McGuirlCounsel for the Federal\nCrownA.\nSchultz, Esq.Counsel for the AccusedTuesday,\nMay 1st, 2007.SPIES\nJ:(Orally)On\nApril 12, 2007, following dismissal of a s.11 (b) application and then a plea\nof guilty, I convicted Elson Richards of three counts of trafficking in a\ncontrolled substance, namely cocaine, contrary to s.5 (2) of the Controlled\nDrugs and Substances Act.The Crown advised that once sentencing was complete,\nthe other charges against Mr. Richards would be withdrawn.The\nfacts in support of the conviction went in as agreed facts.In addition,\nduring the course of submissions, both counsel consented to my reviewing the\npreliminary hearing transcript if I wished to review it. The only additional\ninformation that I obtained from the transcript is the fact that the police had\nreceived information that a couple of people at 45 Elizabeth Street, Apartment\nNumber 8 were selling crack cocaine and that Mr. Richards went by the street\nname of Shadow.This is why the police were able to go to a particular\napartment in order to conduct repeated drug-opportunity buys.As\na result, on January 8, 2004, two undercover officers attended at the apartment\nat 45 Elizabeth Street and met Mr. Richards and a former co-accused, Sherry\nBrown.The officers gave $70 in police buy money to Mr. Richards. He left the\napartment and went to his drug supplier and when he returned he gave the\nofficers .47 grams of crack cocaine.He also gave them his phone number, which\nI presume was so that they could contact him for a similar purpose in the\nfuture.On\nJanuary 20, 2004, two undercover officers went to the same apartment. Again,\nboth Mr. Richards and Ms. Brown were present. Mr. Richards told the officers to\ntake him by car to another location on Lakeshore Boulevard.When they arrived\nat that location, the officers gave Mr. Richards $220 in police buy money.Mr.\nRichards went into the premises and returned with 2.95 grams of crack cocaine.On\nFebruary 10, 2004, two undercover officers attended at the apartment. Mr.\nRichards was not home and Ms. Brown directed them to his place of work.When\nthey arrived, Mr. Richards left work with the officers who drove him to the\nsame location on Lakeshore Boulevard.Once there, the officers gave Mr.\nRichards $220 in police buy money.Mr. Richards went into the premises and\nreturned with 1.72 grams of crack cocaine.It appears that Mr. Richards or his\nsupplier significantly shorted the officers on this occasion.Although\nnot one of the charges pleaded to, I was also told that on February 12, 2004,\ntwo undercover officers approached Mr. Richards at his place of employment\nlooking to buy cocaine.After making a call, Mr. Richards told the officers to\nfollow him by car to the Rockwood Plaza in Mississauga and there they gave him\n$60 in police buy money.Mr. Richards made another call and eventually his\nco-accused, Alan Ainsworth drove up.Mr. Richards got into Mr. Ainsworth’s car\nand he removed the buy money from his pocket.At that point, he and Mr.\nAinsworth were arrested.Mr. Richards had the $60 of police buy money in his\npossession.Mr. Ainsworth attempted to toss cocaine from the car.The cocaine\nwas seized. The cocaine found in Mr. Ainsworth’s possession weighed 6.37\ngrams.Mr. Ainsworth was searched and $145 was seized from him.His car was\nsearched incident to arrest and a further $5,000 was found in the car along\nwith marijuana.The\nCrown submits that I should impose an 18-month custodial sentence and an order\nforfeiting the proceeds.The defence asks that a conditional sentence of\nimprisonment be imposed.The Crown submits this is not an appropriate case for\na conditional sentence.Mr.\nRichards was convicted in 1987 for possession of property obtained by crime\nunder$1,000 and taking an automobile without the consent of the owner.He\nwas sentenced to 30 days on each charge consecutively.In 1992, Mr. Richards\nwas again convicted of taking an automobile in addition to failing or refusing\nto provide a breath sample.He was sentenced to 30 days intermittent on each\ncharge concurrently in addition to probation.In 1995, Mr. Richards was\nconvicted of a drug offence, namely trafficking in a narcotic and sentenced to\n18 months.Mr. Schultz, counsel for Mr. Richards submitted that Mr. Richards\ncould have been pardoned of these offences.They certainly are dated.Mr.\nRichards is 55 years old. He came to Canada from Trinidad in 1976 when he was\n23.Mr. Richards has Grade 11 or 12 education and works in auto repairs. He\nobtained landed immigrant status in 1978.Mr.\nSchultz advised me that the conviction in 1995 for trafficking in narcotics\ntook place as a result of Mr. Richards becoming involved in crack cocaine and\nalcohol when his common-law wife was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and then\ndied in 1995.The\nletters filed in support of Mr. Richards provided the following information.Mr. Richards has been employed with J.B. Auto Sales for two years.He works\nthere on a regular basis whenever there is work.The owner of the business\ndescribes Mr. Richards in glowing terms and states that he has always displayed\na high degree of integrity and responsibility.According to an affidavit sworn\nby Mr. Richards on the s.11 (b) application, prior to his current job he worked\nat another auto repair shop for approximately three years.Mr. Schultz advised\nthat Mr. Richards had been laid off in December 2003, which is shortly before\nthe time these offences were committed.Since\nMr. Richards’ release on February 24, 2004, the Toronto Bail Program has\nsupervised him.In a letter dated February 2, 2006, Mr. Richards’ bail\nsupervisor, Mr. Wali, states that Mr. Richards had been reporting to the office\nonce per week, that he had done so 98 times and had only missed once.As of\nthat date he had complied with all of his bail requirements.Mr. Wali also\nstates that during the supervision period, in addition to maintaining gainful\nemployment, Mr. Richards had completed an intensive treatment program and as of\nthat date continued to attend after-care programming for which he had provided\nverification.The\ntreatment program Mr. Richards undertook was a short-term residential program\nwith Renascent House from May 27, 2005 to June 25, 2005 for alcoholism and drug\naddiction.A letter from a counselor with Renascent House dated June 21, 2005\nopines that Mr. Richards will continue to remain clean and sober as long as he\nwillingly practices the principles of the program.Although the letter states\nthat Mr. Richards was transferred to follow-up, it is not stated what sort of\nfollow-up that was and how long it was to continue.I presume, however, that\nthis is what Mr. Wali was referring to.A\nletter from the secretary of the Trial and Error Group of Alcoholics Anonymous\ndated January 25, 2006 states that Mr. Richards had been attending group\nmeetings twice per week and that he had a sponsor who helped him follow the\n12-step program.This letter was updated by one dated April 11, 2007 that\nconfirms that Mr. Richards now continues to attend these meetings once per\nweek.In\naddition, a letter from Mr. Moursalien from the Toronto Bail Program dated\nApril 20, 2007, who has been supervising Mr. Richards for the last six months,\nwas filed.In fact, Mr. Moursalien was also in court and at my request gave\nevidence in order to answer some of my questions about the treatment program\nMr. Richards has participated in.Mr. Moursalien’s letter states that Mr.\nRichards has had almost a perfect report record for a period of over three\nyears, and that Mr. Richards has demonstrated the ability to follow through\nwith court orders and instructions.Mr. Moursalien also states in his letter\nthat Mr. Richards has reintegrated himself back into the community by\nmaintaining a steady job in an auto repair shop and as well becoming an active\nmember of a church volunteer group and choir. In his letter, Mr. Moursalien\nalso referred to the Renascent program and stated that Mr. Richards has\nattended many Trial and Error Group sessions with Alcoholics Anonymous.As\nhe was present in court, I asked for counsel’s consent that he give evidence,\nas I was not clear as to what, if anything, Mr. Richards is doing for any\nongoing issues with drug addiction.Mr. Moursalien stated that the Trial and\nError Group was for alcohol and narcotics and that Mr. Richards has been in\nNarcotics Anonymous.However, he did not have any information that Mr.\nRichards had participated in Narcotics Anonymous in the last six months.Mr.\nRichards has clearly made a positive impression on his bail supervisors.Mr.\nWali states in his letter that Mr. Richards’ commitment to self-improvement has\nbeen very inspiring to see and that he believes this is only a sign of things\nto come.Mr. Moursalien described Mr. Richards in his evidence as an\nexceptional client who had turned his life around.Although, as Mr. Moursalien\nadmitted to Ms. McGuirl, his comparator group is other persons charged with\noffences who are in the bail program, clearly Mr. Richards has done well in the\nprogram and impressed his bail supervisors.An\nadditional letter from Reverend Sultana was filed, the pastor of Mr. Richards’\nchurch.This letter is dated February 4, 2004, which is shortly before Mr.\nRichards was arrested and so I presume the date is in error.There is also a\nletter from the Choir Director, which is current.Although these letters speak\npositively about Mr. Richards as a 10-year member of the church, who also\nvolunteers his time at the church and sings in the choir, presumably Reverend\nSultana and the Choir Director were unaware of the fact that in early 2004, Mr.\nRichards was also trafficking in crack cocaine.Finally,\nI was provided with two other character references.First of all, in a letter\ndated April 20, 2007, from Mr. Richards’ sponsor in the A.A. program, his\nsponsor states he has known Mr. Richards for 15 years and is aware of his\nstruggles with alcohol and drugs.He believes that incarceration would be\ndetrimental to Mr. Richards’ recovery.I\nwas also given a letter from Ms. Janet Peterson-Bryan dated April 13, 2007. It\nwas not signed but that seems to be an oversight as the letter is on her\npersonal letterhead.She states that she met Mr. Richards in her capacity as a\nlecturer in Political Science at York University and that she has known him for\n12 years.She is aware of what she describes as his background of substance\nabuse.Her letter is a character reference and refers to other volunteer work\nthat Mr. Richards has undertaken beyond his church.With respect to the\ntreatment program at Renascent House, Ms. Peterson-Bryan writes that the\nprogram gave Mr. Richards the impetus to work towards management of his illness\non an ongoing basis, including discontinuing past associations and patterns and\nthat he maintains this to the present.Counsel\ntook opposing views on whether or not the sentence I should impose on Mr.\nRichards should be more or less severe than the sentence I imposed on his\nco-accused, Alan Ainsworth.Mr. Ainsworth pleaded guilty to one count of\npossession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking with respect to the facts\nalready stated for the events of February 12, 2004.I sentenced him to an\n18-month conditional sentence and probation of one year.He also consented to\nforfeiture of the $5,145 found in his possession at the time of his arrest.It\nis difficult to compare the culpability of these two accused.From the Crown’s\nperspective, Mr. Richards committed the more serious offences given that he has\npleaded guilty to trafficking on three occasions.Ms. McGuirl submits that Mr.\nRichards is a sophisticated drug trafficker who was the directing mind of the\noperation.She had suggested a 12 month custodial sentence with respect to Mr.\nAinsworth, as compared to the sentence of 18 months requested for Mr. Richards.Mr.\nSchultz, however, argues that Mr. Ainsworth was a drug supplier, the back end,\nand was found in possession of a large quantity of crack cocaine, 6.37 grams,\nwhich is in total more than the amount involved with Mr. Richards’ offences.He argues that Mr. Richards was only an addict trying to supply his habit.It\nis also fair to say that Mr. Ainsworth has a more substantial criminal record\nalthough his was also quite dated.Having\nconsidered these submissions, I find that, first of all, trafficking in cocaine\nis a more serious offence than possession for the purpose of cocaine, and that\ntaking into account the fact that I’m sentencing Mr. Richards for three counts\nof trafficking, his sentence should be more severe than Mr. Ainsworth.He was\nclearly regularly trafficking in crack cocaine in this timeframe.Another\nfactual issue I must resolve in considering sentence is whether or not Mr.\nRichards was addicted to cocaine.Some cases have considered the fact that\nsomeone who traffics to support his addiction may be treated differently than\nsomeone trafficking for profit as the efficacy of specific deterrence is not\nobvious for someone who is addicted.This may result in treating addiction as\na mitigating factor.Mr.\nSchultz submitted that Mr. Richards was a drug addict and was simply taking the\nofficers to his suppliers; he was not a drug dealer.The position of Ms.\nMcGuirl is that the defence has not provided any independent evidence\nconfirming an addiction problem and that Mr. Richards’ ability to report regularly\nto his bail supervisors is inconsistent with a drug addiction and that these\noffences were committed for profit.There\nis no dispute that Mr. Richards did voluntarily go to Renascent House, but the\nletter from them confirms it was a residential program for rehabilitation from\nthe “disease of alcoholism and/or drug addiction” a few months after his\narrest.That would certainly suggest a problem, although whether it was drugs\nor alcohol or both is unclear.Mr. Richards’ character references from his A.A.\nsponsor and Ms. Peterson-Bryan do refer to problems with drugs and alcohol, but\nI do not have any evidence to suggest that these offences were committed as a\nresult of any drug addiction.The\nofficers were shorted on one occasion, but whether or not that was by Mr.\nRichards or his supplier is not clear.Furthermore, the timing of the offences\ncould be related to Mr. Richards being laid off a couple of months earlier.Certainly at the time, Mr. Richards had become known to the police as a drug\ndealer. He did not have drugs in his possession, which is not unusual for a\ndealer and each time had to obtain drugs from a supplier.I\nhave not been persuaded on a balance of probabilities that I should consider\nany addiction as a mitigating factor, although it may be still relevant to the\nsentence I impose.I turn then to a consideration of what sentence is\nappropriate in this case.The\nfundamental purpose of sentencing, as set out in s.718 of the Criminal Code,\nis to ensure respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and\nsafe society.The imposition of just sanctions requires me to consider the\nsentencing objectives referred to in that section, which the sentence I impose\nshould attempt to achieve.These are denunciation, deterrence; both specific\nand general, separation of offenders from society when necessary,\nrehabilitation, reparation for harm done and the promotion of a sense of\nresponsibility in offenders and acknowledgement of the harm which criminal\nactivity brings to our community.In addition, in imposing sentence I must\ntake into account the principles of proportionality and the applicable\naggravating and mitigating circumstances relating to the offences as set out in\ns.718.2In\nconsidering the submissions of Mr. Schultz and in determining whether or not to\nimpose a conditional sentence, I am guided by the decision of the Supreme Court\nof Canada in R v. Proulx 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000], 1 S.C.R. 61.In that case the Court\nconfirmed that conditional sentences were introduced by Parliament to reduce\nreliance on incarceration and to increase the use of restorative justice\nprinciples in sentencing.The\ncriteria for imposing a conditional sentence in this case, given that there is\nno minimum sentence, are that a penitentiary term and probationary measures are\ninappropriate and that a term of imprisonment of less than two years be\nappropriate; that permitting Mr. Richards to serve his sentence in the\ncommunity must not endanger the safety of the community and that a conditional\nsentence be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of\nsentencing set out in s.718 to s.718.2 of the Criminal Code, and for\nthat I rely on Proulx.I\nhave reviewed the cases relied upon by Ms. McGuirl in support of her position\nthat a conditional sentence is not appropriate in this case.She concedes that\nit is difficult to find cases similar to the facts in this case.As the cases\ngenerally turn on their facts, her cases were of limited assistance.Only a\ncouple of the cases Ms. McGuirl relies upon considered the possibility of a\nconditional sentence and, in fact, several were decided before Proulx.The balance confirm that the penalty proposed by the Crown is within the range\nof appropriate sentences for a case like this.In\nthe case of R v. J.C., [2000] O.J. No. 5995, Bellamy J. found that as\nJ.C. was not a first-time offender and had been convicted of a drug offences\nincluding trafficking with an overall amount involved of 4.2 grams, that\nincarceration was the only way to send a sufficiently strong message to\npotential offenders and to denounce this conduct.However, in that case J.C.\nalso continued to assert his innocence notwithstanding a jury verdict.Furthermore, this decision was released before Proulx.In\nR v. Pinnock, [1998] O.J. No. 5574, Reilly J. also rejected a proposed\nconditional sentence.He certainly appears to have been strongly of the view\nthat because of the need for general and specific deterrence, a conditional\nsentence will rarely be appropriate in such case, but this case was also\ndecided prior to Proulx.In\nR v. Thompson, [2000] O.J. No. 810, McGowan J. of the Ontario Court of\nJustice considered Proulx, but found that the accused would be a danger\nto the community and for that and other reasons, including particularly the\nneed for specific deterrence given the lack of remorse, declined to impose a\nconditional sentence.Finally,\nwith respect to the Court of Appeal decision of R v. Woghiren,\n[2004] O.J. No. 5030, relied upon by the Crown, the Court refused to interfere\nwith a sentence of two years less a day.Without the trial judgment, all of\nthe facts are not known save that the conviction was related to crack cocaine.The Court acknowledged that the sentence was at the high end of the range.Mr.\nSchultz provided his own brief of cases in support of his position that a\nconditional sentence is appropriate.I have also reviewed his cases.Several\nreflect the court’s acceptance of a joint submission and I agree with Ms.\nMcGuirl that as a result they are of less assistance.Furthermore, like those\nof the Crown, they illustrate the fact that sentencing is very sensitive to the\nfacts of the particular case.The\ncase I found of most assistance is the decision of Belleghem J. who considered\nthe dilemma that I face, in R v. Mundle, [2003] O.J. No. 4392.He\nreviewed the decision of the Court of Appeal in Woolcock, where the\nCourt of Appeal agreed with the conclusions of the trial judge that a\nconditional sentence was unsuitable, and on the other hand the decision of the\nCourt of Appeal in R v. Kerr,2001 CanLII 21142 (ON CA), [2001] O.J. No. 5085, that there is no\npresumption against conditional sentences for trafficking offences and that the\ncircumstances of the offence and the offender should govern.In\nKerr, the Court stated that I must not begin my deliberations with a\nrule that the circumstances of the case itself must be rare or unusual before\nimposing a conditional sentence.In Kerr, the Court found that the\nultimate interests of both the community and the appellant were best served by\na sentence most conducive to eliminating the risk of re-offending and that\nthat, in turn, argued for a sentence that both acknowledged and facilitated the\nongoing rehabilitation of the appellant.Justice\nBelleghem found the case before him to be a close case and that the position of\nboth the Crown and the defence were perfectly reasonable.In the end he found\nthat on balance the principles of restorative justice should prevail and\nimposed a conditional sentence.I\nturn then to a consideration of the prerequisites for imposing a conditional\nsentence.The sentence proposed by the Crown in this case is not a\npenitentiary sentence.Although the appropriate sentence in this case for each\noffence would be at the upper end of the range for a reformatory sentence, I am\nsatisfied that a penitentiary term is not appropriate in this case and\ncertainly probationary measures would not be.However, I accept the submission\nof Ms. McGuirl that were it not for the fact that Mr. Richads’ criminal record\nis dated, a penitentiary term would have been warranted.With\nrespect to determining whether permitting Mr. Richards to serve his sentence in\nthe community would endanger the safety of the community, the Court in Proulx\nnoted:“…two factors should be taken into\naccount; the risk of the offender re-offending and the gravity of the damage\nthat could ensue in the event of re-offence.If the judge finds that there is\na real risk of re-offence, incarceration should be imposed.Of course, there\nis always some risk that an offender may be re-offend.If the judge thinks\nthis is minimal, the gravity of the damage that could follow were the offender\nto re-offend should also be taken into consideration. In certain cases, the\nminimal risk of re-offending will be offset by the possibility of a great\nprejudice, thereby precluding a conditional sentence.”In terms of the risk of re-offending,\nit is significant that apartfrom\nthese convictions, Mr. Richards has not been convicted of any criminal offence\nsince October 1995.He has been on judicial interim release awaiting trial for\nover three years and has abided by strict terms of bail of weekly reporting.Furthermore, Mr. Richards’ criminal record does not include any offences of\nviolence, although there are two old convictions for property offences.Mr.\nRichards has demonstrated an ability to comply with court orders. I am,\ntherefore, satisfied that it is likely that he would comply with the terms of a\nconditional sentence.In\nthis regard, I have also considered Mr. Richards’ past and current efforts to\ndeal with his problem with alcohol and drug addiction. He has completed a\nshort-term residential program and regularly attends Trial and Error Group\nmeetings for ongoing support.In addition, he has the support of his A.A.\nsponsor, church and friends.Considering Mr. Richards’ dated record for the\nperiod of time that has passed since these offences, his character references\nand his rehabilitation efforts, I find that the risk that Mr. Richards will\nre-offend is minimal.I\nrecognize, of course, that cocaine is an extremely dangerous and insidious drug\nwith potential to cause a great deal of harm to individuals and to society.It\nis highly addictive, easily obtained and reasonably cheap.Trafficking in\ncocaine is a serious offence and ignoring his conviction over 10 years ago, Mr.\nRichards has repeated that offence three times and attempted to complete a\nfourth transaction before being arrested.There is no doubt that if he were to\nre-offend that there would be serious harm to the community.Although\none can never rule out the possibility of re-offending, in all of the\ncircumstances, I am satisfied that Mr. Richards does not pose any danger to the\nsafety of the community that would preclude him from being a candidate to serve\nhis sentence in the community.I\nturn then to a consideration of whether a conditional sentence would achieve\nthe goals of sentencing.These offences warrant an emphasis on the principles\nof denunciation and deterrence, both general and specific.Not only is trafficking\nin cocaine a very serious offence, Mr. Richards has been convicted of this\nbefore, albeit over 10 years ago.He received an 18-month sentence then, which\nin the long term, did not deter him from re-offending.However,\nas Chief Justice Lamer in Proulx stated:“The stigma of a conditional sentence\nwith house arrest should not be underestimated.Living in the community under\nstrict conditions where fellow residents are well aware of the offender’s\ncriminal misconduct can provide ample denunciation in many cases.In certain\ncircumstances, the shame of encountering members of the community may make it\neven more difficult for the offender to serve his or her sentence in the\ncommunity than in prison.Incarceration, which is ordinarily a\nharsher sanction, may provide more deterrence than a conditional sentence.Judges should be wary, however, of placing too much weight on deterrence when\nchoosing between a conditional sentence and incarceration.The empirical evidence suggests that\nthe deterrent effect of incarceration is uncertain.Moreover, a conditional\nsentence can provide significant deterrence if sufficiently punitive.”The\nCourt of Appeal has affirmed the principle that there is no presumption against\nconditional sentences for trafficking offences. (See R v. Kerr, 2001 CanLII 21142 (ON CA), [2001]\nO.J. No. 5085). It is clear that I must consider all of the sentencing\nobjectives before imposing sentence. (See R v. Woolcock, [2002] O.J. No.\n4927) (Ont.C.A.)The\nquestion then is whether a conditional sentence would be consistent with the\nfundamental purpose and principles of sentencing.As Ms. McGuirl stated in her\nsubmissions, Mr. Richards has been convicted of trafficking before.The amount\nof cocaine that he trafficked on the offences before me was beyond street level\ndealing.On\nthe other hand, Mr. Richards has admitted his misconduct by pleading guilty to\nthese offences. He has also agreed to forfeit the $520 that was found in his\npossession when he was arrested.In addition, he was held in custody for 11\ndays pending his release which would result in a credit of three weeks.I have\nno information about Mr. Richards’ bail conditions such as whether or not he\nwas subject to a curfew, but he was required to report weekly for a period of\njust over three years, which I should take into account as a mitigating factor.\n(See R v. Downes, (2006) 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA), 79 O.R. (3d) 321The\nmost compelling factor in favour of a conditional sentence and in mitigation\ngenerally of the sentence I might otherwise impose in this case is the fact that\napart from this offence, Mr. Richards has demonstrated an ability to be a\nproductive and law-abiding citizen for the last 12 years.In addition, he has\nthe support of many friends who are prepared to vouch for him and he has been\ngainfully employed for the last few years.A jail term would no doubt result\nin the loss of his employment.I\nfind myself in a situation similar to that of Justice Belleghem in the Mundle\ncase in which he found it to be a close case.I am mindful of the\nseriousness of these offences; however, I believe that I can craft terms for a\nconditional sentence that will send a message to both Mr. Richards and the\ncommunity that these offences will be treated strictly.I can also impose\nterms that will minimize the risk of his re-offending.In\nany event, I agree with the views of Justice Belleghem that in a close case\nlike this, the principles of “restorative justice” should prevail.Mr.\nRichards has demonstrated a real desire to get his life back together and to\ndeal with his alcohol and drug problem, not only by the Renascent program, but\nalso with full participation in Alcoholics Anonymous.He has a sponsor who has\nknown him for the last 15 years and the support of his church and others.I\nam satisfied that incarceration could have a negative impact on Mr. Richards’\nrehabilitation and his eventual return to the community. I have concerns that\nhe could not regain employment and certainly he would be removed from his\ncurrent support group. On the other hand, a conditional sentence can help\nimprove his chances of success.For\nthose reasons, I have concluded that a conditional sentence is consistent with\nthe fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing, and more appropriately\nachieves the objective of assisting in the rehabilitation of Mr. Richards and\nre-integrating him as a responsible member of this community.The conditions\nthat I have imposed will reduce any risk to the community of Mr. Richards\nre-offending and ensure that he continues with his rehabilitation.I\nsincerely hope that this conditional sentence will help ensure that Mr.\nRichards will continue to be a productive and law-abiding member of his\ncommunity and live a crime-free life. By imposing a conditional sentence, I, in\nno way intend to minimize the seriousness of these offences and am confident\nthat the stringent conditions I have decided to impose will deter not only Mr.\nRichards but also others from committing these types of offences.Although a\nconditional sentence can be considered a more lenient sentence than an\nequivalent jail term, Mr. Richards must appreciate that incarceration will\nlikely result if any of the conditions are breached.Mr.\nRichards, would you please stand?You\nhave been convicted of very serious offences; three counts of trafficking in\ncocaine from incidents that arose over three years ago. On these three\nconvictions, I impose a conditional sentence of two years less a day on each,\nto be served concurrently, and in the community on the following conditions:1.Keep the peace and\nbe of good behaviour;2.Appear before the\ncourt as and when required;3.Report to a\nsupervisor within two working days of today andthereafter when required by the\nsupervisor and in the manner directed by the supervisor;4.Remain within the\nProvince of Ontario unless writtenpermission to leave the province is\nobtained from your supervisor or approval is given by the court;5.Notify your\nsupervisor or the court in advance of any changeof name or address and promptly notify\nyour supervisor or the court of any change of employment or occupation;6.Maintain your\nemployment or actively seek employment;7.Abstain absolutely\nfrom the consumption or possession ofany alcohol;8.Abstain absolutely\nfrom the consumption of possession ofany drugs or any substances prohibited\nby law except in accordance with a medical prescription;9.Continue to attend\nweekly meetings of the Trial and ErrorGroup of Alcoholics Anonymous and fully\nparticipate in their programs;10.Fully comply with\nand complete any alcohol or drugtreatment program that your\nsupervisor recommends;11.Perform 250 hours\nof community service work. The work isto commence within 60 days of the date\nof the commencement of this order and shall be completed at a rate of not less\nthan 15 hours per month in consecutive months and provide your supervisor with\nproof of attendance and completion of your community service assignments;12.For the first 12\nmonths of this order you shall be confined toyour residence under house arrest 24\nhours per day, 7 days per week except for the following:-being at work,-being at church,-attendance for the purpose\nof providing community service,-attending medical\nappointments or dealing with a medical emergency,-court attendances and\nreporting to your supervisor,-attending meetings of the\nTrial and Error Group of Alcoholics Anonymous,-travel directly to or from\nany of these activities and at any other time with prior written permission of\nyour supervisor,13.Allow law\nenforcement officials, including the supervisor orany one he or she assigns to knock at\nthe door of your residence at any time to monitor your compliance with the\nhouse arrest provision of this order;14.For the remainder\nof your sentence, not to be away fromyour place of residence each and every\nnight between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., subject to any special\nvariation granted by the supervisor;15.Abstain from\nowning, possessing or carrying any weapons asdefined in the Criminal\nCode;16.Abstain from\napplying for a firearms acquisition certificate orany other form of gun\nlicence;17.Abstain from being\nin the company of or associate with anyone known to have a criminal record or\nwho is the subject of criminal charges except for members of your family or\nfellow employees.After\nyour conditional sentence of two years less a day, there will be a term of\nprobation of two years on the same terms save that Clause 11 (dealing with\ncommunity service), Clauses 12 and 13 (dealing with house arrest) and Clause 14\n(dealing with curfew) will be deleted.There\nwill be an order pursuant to s.462.37 of the Criminal Code forfeiting the sum\nof $510 that was seized at the time of your arrest.Finally, there will be a\nmandatory order under s.109 (1) of the Criminal Code for a period of 10\nyears.A\ncopy of this order will be given to you by the court officials, who will ensure\nthat the substance of s.742.2 and s.742.6 of the Criminal Code are explained to\nyou regarding the conditional sentence, and that substance of s.732.2 (3),\ns.732.2 (5) and s.733.1 are explained to you regarding the probation order. That\nis to say, Mr. Richards, you will get a copy of all of this and people will\nmake sure you understand including, of course, Mr. Schultz.Mr.\nRichards, I do not understand why you resorted to trafficking in cocaine in\n2003 when you had a strong network of support around you including you’re A.A.\nsponsor and your church. I am prepared to assume that this was a lapse that\nwill not occur again and have decided to impose this order rather than send you\nto jail.I have imposed strict conditions that you must comply with, but I\nhave included terms that will permit you to continue your employment and your\nparticipation in the Trial and Error support group that has assisted you so\nthat you continue in your efforts to be a law-abiding member of this community.Judging\nfrom the letters filed in your support, I know that you can do this if you\ncontinue to accept support from those around you, including your friends at\nchurch and elsewhere and that you continue to recognize your weakness for\nalcohol and drugs and remain faithful to the Alcoholics Anonymous program or\nfor that matter any other program that your supervisor recommends.I\nhope that you will succeed and comply with the terms of my order.I must warn\nyou, however, that if you do not comply with all of the conditions that I have\nimposed, you will be brought back before this court and if you appear before\nme, I can assure you that I will be very disappointed and you will likely serve\nthe balance of your sentence in jail.I should also tell you with some confidence\nthat if you re-offend, it is very likely that you will go to the penitentiary.I trust that that is not going to happen. I hope that you will be able to put\nall of this behind you and get on with your life and I wish you well.THE\nACCUSED:I will take it. Thanks very much.MR.\nSCHULTZ:Your Honour, if I may, condition number 12? I tried to\nlist all of the exceptions. On conditional sentences that I have looked at in\nthe past…THE\nCOURT:Yes.MR.\nSCHULTZ:…they have included a brief two to three hour period\nonce a week to purchase groceries and personal sundries and things like that\nbecause if he were to do that on the way home from work, he could technically\nbe breached.THE\nCOURT:That’s a good point. Do you have any issue with that?MS.\nMCGUIRL:I don’t have any issue with that, but I do have a\nfollow-up and also with respect to conditions that have been imposed. Your\nHonour had indicated that he was not to be in contact with any one known to\nhave a criminal record and I think the only exception that perhaps should be\nincluded is with the exception of those in the Trial and Error Group or A.A.\ngroups or specific recovery groups because there is a high probability, I think\nthat should propose a conflict in terms of him fulfilling the condition.THE\nCOURT:I thank you for pointing that out. I hadn’t thought of\nthat. So there will be two amendments. First of all, to condition number 12\nthat Mr. Richards be permitted to spend three hours a week.MR.\nSCHULTZ:I think that would be fine. In my limited experience,\nYour Honour, there is usually a day chosen and then on that day he has a\ncertain window of opportunity. Is there a day that you would like to shop? It\ncan be any day of the week, probably not a Sunday; on a Saturday.THE\nACCUSED:My concern is, are you talking about shopping?MR.\nSCHULTZ:Yes, once a week.THE\nACCUSED:My concern right is to pick a day. Any day.THE\nCOURT:What day do you normally do your shopping?THE\nACCUSED:Maybe it’s far better on a Friday.MR.\nSCHULTZ:Friday, okay.MS.\nMCGUIRL:It’s also usually morning or afternoon as opposed to\nevening and it would be usually drafted as Friday, 12 to 3, for example.THE\nCOURT:Yes. You’re not working normally on a Friday.THE\nACCUSED:Yeah. Normally I work until six o’clock, mainly until six,\nso it could be just after I finish work.THE\nCOURT:All right, from six to nine o’clock on a Friday night.\nWhat do you think of that?MS.\nMCGUIRL:May I suggest perhaps a morning or afternoon given the\nnature of the offences and the fact that the trafficking usually occurs in the\nevening hours.THE\nACCUSED:Okay, yeah, that’s probably better on a Saturday.THE\nCOURT:Just a moment. Just one at a time, please, Mr.\nRichards.MS.\nMCGUIRL:I would suggest for your consideration Saturday from 12\nto 3.THE\nCOURT:All right.MR.\nSCHULTZ:That’s what we are going to suggest as well, 12 to 3 on\nSaturday.THE\nCOURT:All right, because I was just going to say that\nSaturday is more likely. So Saturday from 12 till 3 p.m., be able to attend for,\nI guess, shopping for personal effects and groceries.MS.\nMCGUIRL:Or necessities. I think necessities of life is usually\nwhat it is.THE\nCOURT:So Saturdays from 12 to 3, he’s permitted to go\nshopping for the necessities of life. That’s a fair description, and I have\nadded to condition 17, except for members of your family or fellow employees or\nmembers of the Trial and Error Group or any other counselling groups as\ndirected by your supervisor, I guess.MS.\nMCGUIRL:And one more clause with respect to the shopping, it’s\nalso in my experience drafted often directly to or from wherever he’s shopping;\nfor example, if he’s driving around in the car and found to be parked some\nplace, there has to be some way that if he’s breached, at least, there’s an understanding\nthat he was heading directly to or from a grocery store and he should be able\nto, in very short order, explain to whoever he is pulled over by, should that\nhappen, exactly where he was going and that way that expectation will always be\nthere.THE\nCOURT:Right. So have you got some specific wording that you\nhave in mind?MS.\nMCGUIRL:Directly to or from the establishment to obtain the\nnecessities of life, shopping establishment or.THE\nCOURT:All right. I can work out some language with the Registrar\nto put that in. The attendance at business establishments for the purpose of\npurchasing the necessities of life including travel to and from those\nestablishments.MS.\nMCGUIRL:Yes, directly to and from.THE\nCOURT:All right. Now the exception to the Trial and Error\nGroup, and I guess any other counselling groups directed in paragraph 10.MR.\nSCHULTZ:Just if I can get some clarification, Your Honour, would\nthat include his sponsor because I do know his sponsor has a criminal record.\nIf we could just include him?THE\nCOURT:Okay, so your fellow employees. So it would be an A.A.\nsponsor, his Trial and Error Group, any other counselling groups in paragraph\n10. Any other issues? All right, the specific counts that are being withdrawn?MS.\nMCGUIRL:Yes. Did Your Honour order a s.109 order for 10 years as\nmandatory?THE\nCOURT:Yes.MS.\nMCGUIRL:Okay. I must have missed that. Yes, I would then request\nthat all the remaining charges in relation to Mr. Richards be withdrawn.THE\nCOURT:All right. So we will just leave it that so we don’t\nget the wrong number. All right.MS.\nMCGUIRL:Yes.MR.\nSCHULTZ:Thank you very much, Your Honour, for your\nconsideration. I thank my friend.MS.\nMCGUIRL:Thank you very much, Your Honour. Those are all the\nmatters I have before you today, Your Honour. If I may be excused?THE\nCOURT:Yes, you may, thank you. Thank you very much, counsel.\nMr. Richards.MR.\nSCHULTZ:Thank you very much, Your Honour.THE\nACCUSED:Thank you, Your Honour.…COURT\nADJOURNED AT 10:45 a.m.******THIS\nIS TO CERTIFY THAT THE foregoingis\na true and accurate transcript of mystenomask\nrecordings herein stated to thebest\nof my skill and ability.__________________________________________Annette\nCartoCertified\nCourt ReporterTranscript\nordered:June 13, 2007Transcript\ncompleted:June 15, 2007Ordering\nparty notified: June 29, 2007"}

BourgeoisAppealHeard:September 22, 2016, in Halifax,Nova ScotiaSubject:Sentencing; conspiracy tocommit the indictable offence of sexual assault on a child.Summary:On October 27, 2014, theappellant pled guilty to a number of charges:one charge of possessing childpornography; one charge of accessing child pornography; one charge of makingchild pornography; and eight charges of conspiring to commit the indictableoffence of sexual assault on a child.He received a global sentence of sevenyears; the conspiracy charges netting five years concurrent.On appeal, itis only the disposition rendered in relation to the eight conspiracy chargeswhich the appellant challenges.There was no factual disputeas to the appellant’s conduct.He participated via the web in a number of“live shows” where he directed adults, located in the Philippines, as to howpre-pubescent children should be engaged in a variety of sexual acts.Theappellant directed the nature of the abuse inflicted upon the children, forhis own sexual gratification.At the sentencing hearing,the judge noted the appellant’s involvement was at the “highest end of thescale” in terms of gravity, and his conduct was “horrendous in its impact”.The appellant had been assessed as being a high risk to re-offend against children.The appellant argued the fiveyear sentence was harsh and excessive.He argued that the Crown andsentencing judge could not locate any case authorities in which a conspiracyto commit sexual assault arose in factually similar circumstances, and assuch, his sentence was not supportable.Issue:Did the sentencing judge err in theimposition of a five year sentence for the conspiracy offences?Result:Appeal dismissed.The lack ofa reported case involving a similar offender committing a factually similaroffence does not serve to render a sentence harsh or excessive.With orwithout precedential assistance, a sentencing judge must apply the principlesof sentencing to the nature of the offender and offence before him or her tocraft an appropriate disposition.Here, the sentencing judgeconsidered the appropriate principles of sentencing.The five year sentencewas not harsh or excessive in the circumstances of this offender and hisconduct.This information sheet does not form part\nof the court’s judgment.

But Mr. Pitts viewed her\nin that regard, although I think he acknowledged to the police and to Dr.\nConnors, at least, that he may have been being duped in that regard.But be\nthat as it may, he spoke to this young girl, through the internet, on that\nbasis.[12]He opined about bringing\nJS and the young girl back to Canada.He referred to himself as “Daddy” at\nsome times.He spoke to JS and to the child about sleeping with this girl and\nperforming sexual acts short of sexual intercourse.He, in fact, paid JS to\nhave her perform certain sexual acts with this girl, including variations of\noral sex and exposure of her genitalia to Mr. Pitts, who, obviously, was\nviewing this for his own sexual gratification.[13]There were a number of\nthese “live shows,” if I can use that expression.The Crown indicated five or\nsix, and in two of these incidents, Mr. Pitts recorded these somehow on his\ncomputer and had them available for further viewing.That, of course, is the\nbasis of the making of the child pornography charge which he has pled guilty\nto.[14]The conversations in\nwhich Mr. Pitts was discussing various sexual performances are the subject of\nthe conspiracy charges, wherein Mr. Pitts was agreeing with the adult females\non the other end of the line to have these children available to perform\nvarious sexual acts wherein these children were abused sexually. These are the\nconspiracy charges which Mr. Pitts has pled guilty to.[15]Mr. Pitts had a\ncollection of child pornography separate and apart fromthese live shows – a\ncouple of hundred of those, and there were a number of videos, as well.He was\naccessing the internet for those and he was possessing those, and that is the\nbasis of the charge of possession of child pornography and of accessing child\npornography.[16]In terms of the gravity\nof the offence, which is one of the important aspects of this process which I\nam required to consider, I can only describe this as being horrendous in its\nimpact.There is really no limit to the negative superlatives that can be used\nto describe what one can only conclude is depravity.And I am very aware of\nthe risk of attaching too many sensational words to this, for the reasons that\nMr. Singleton had correctly pointed out.One cannot be over-sensational in\ndescribing how horrendous and negative these images are. Quite frankly, the\nlive shows that Mr. Pitts was participating in, and directing, are, quite\nfrankly, at the high end of the scale of child pornography.He is not viewing\nimages that were created by somebody else; he is directly responsible for the\nabuse of these children, because he was conspiring and agreeing to have these\nchildren abused.[5]Mr. Pitts has not taken issue with the above\ndescription.Issues[6]In his Amended Notice of Appeal, Mr. Pitts sets\nout the following grounds:1.Sentence based on Safer Community Act (sic; Safe\nStreets and Communities Act, S.C. 2012, c. 1) which came into law after the\noffender was charged.2.Hard and Excessive.3.Outside the range of sentence for similar offenders in\nsimilar circumstances.4.Crown did not provide any case law for the conspiracy to\ncommit an indictable offence (sexual assault) in relation to the 5 years that\nthe crown was asking for.5.Cases that the crown provided to the trial judge show\nthat the offender had direct power and control over the victim(s) as well as\nphysical contact.In my case there was a third party who had direct power and\ncontrol over the victim(s).My case also shows that I have no physical contact\nwith the victim(s).[7]In his written submissions, Mr. Pitts raised an\nadditional allegation of error.He submits that he could not have been\nconvicted of conspiracy because all of the children involved in the “live shows”\nwere under the age of 12, and as such, could not be criminally responsible\nunder the Criminal Code.Flowing from this, he argues there\ncannot be a conspiracy if the co-conspirator, a child under 12, is immune from\ncriminal responsibility.[8]This argument can be dealt with summarily.Firstly, Mr. Pitts has not appealed his conviction, which was notably entered\nby virtue of a guilty plea given with the benefit of counsel.A challenge to\nhis conviction is not, in my view, properly before this Court.Further, even\nif this Court were inclined to consider a late in the day challenge to conviction,\nthere is no merit to the position advanced by Mr. Pitts.On the face of the\nundisputed factual record, it was the adults on the other end of the video link\nwith whom Mr. Pitts conspired.The children were clearly the victims of the\nconspiracy, not participants in it.[9]Before this Court, Mr. Pitts conceded that the Safe\nStreets and Communities Act had no relevance to the issues on appeal, and\nthat the sentencing judge did not incorrectly apply that legislation.His\nremaining arguments relate to the alleged harshness of the five year sentence.In my view, the sole issue on this appeal is whether the sentencing judge erred\nin the imposition of that sentence.Standard\nof Review[10]The standard of review in relation to sentencing\ndecisions is well-established and was recently described by this Court in R.\nv. Landry, 2016 NSCA 53 (CanLII).Justice Beveridge explained:[35]Before turning to the appellant’s complaints of error, it is\nappropriate to recognize that an appellate court is not at liberty to reassess\nthe issues that faced a trial judge and substitute its own view as to the\nappropriate outcome.Sometimes an appellate court may well conclude that\nit would not have arrived at a particular result, but must defer to the trial\ncourt.The level of deference is conveniently referred to as the standard\nof review.[36]The standard of review is different for the two putative errors\nadvanced by the appellant.A judge must correctly identify and apply the\nrelevant legal principles in arriving at sentence.An appellate court is\nfree to substitute its view of the correct legal principles.Furthermore,\nif a trial judge errs in law or principle, deference dissipates in relation to\nthe discretionary decision as to sentence.The appellate court is free to\narrive at the appropriate sentence (see R. v. Hawkins, 2011 NSCA 7 (CanLII) at\npara. 43; R. v. Bernard, 2011 NSCA 53 (CanLII); R. v. Brunet, 2010 ONCA\n781 (CanLII); R. v. MacDonald, 2009 MBCA 36 (CanLII); R. v. Provost, 2006 NLCA 30 (CanLII); R.\nv. Rezaie (1996), 1996 CanLII 1241 (ON CA), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.); and R. v. Willis,\n2013 NSCA 78 (CanLII)).[37]But, as the Supreme Court of Canada recently emphasized in R. v.\nLacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII), the legal error must have been one that impacted\nsentence.[38]Absent legal error that had an impact on the quantum or type of\nsentence imposed, an appellate court must defer to the sentence imposed at\ntrial.It can only intervene if it concludes that the sentence is unfit\nas being manifestly excessive or inadequate (see R. v. Eisan, 2015 NSCA\n65 (CanLII) at paras. 25-26).[11]To successfully challenge the sentence imposed,\nit must be shown that the sentencing judge made a legal error which impacted on\nthe sentence; or that the term is manifestly excessive.Analysis[12]Principles of sentencing are set out in the Criminal\nCode, most notably s. 718, which are intended to guide courts in the\nframing of appropriate dispositions.This section, and the principles set out\ntherein, were noted by the sentencing judge:[3]Any sentencing, of\ncourse, begins with a consideration of the purpose and principles of sentencing\nas set out in s. 718 and the related sections of the Criminal Code. The\npurpose of sentencing is the protection of the public, in this case, protection\nof children, which I will speak about more in a minute, and, of course,\nupholding the integrity of the law.And that is done through the imposition of\nwhat are called “just” sanctions – “just” meaning that there is a measure of\nproportionality and restraint to achieve certain objectives. Those objectives\nare set out in s.718 of the Criminal Code.In my opinion, the\nobjectives that need to be emphasized here, and I think the case law supports\nthis, is, first of all, denunciation; secondly, deterrence, and then\nseparation, and rehabilitation. But, clearly, denunciation is the primary\nobjective.Deterrence and separation and rehabilitation are also important, as\nwell.[4]Those sanctions are\nimposed using certain principles, which, again, are set out in the subsections\nof those sections that I referred to. It is the principle of proportionality,\nwhich is the fundamental principle of sentencing. The principles of parity and\nrestraint apply as well.[5]The principle of\nproportionality is measured by looking at the gravity of the offence and the\nmoral culpability of the offender or the moral blameworthiness, which Mr.\nSingleton referred to earlier in his submissions, which I will come back to.[6]I would also say that\nthe Supreme Court of Canada has indicated that sentencing is a vehicle through\nwhich we, as a society, make a statement on the values that are important and\nshould be promoted in our Canadian society.And of course, that is important\nhere because the value that needs to be emphasized and promoted, and the\nmessage sent to our community and society, generally, is that our children are\nvaluable assets and they need to be protected, whether those children are in\nCanada or across the world. The victims in this offence, of course, are in\nanother country.But that does not diminish the values that we should be\nupholding.I might also say that diminishing the respect and dignity of\nchildren abroad, of course, diminishes the dignity and respect of all children,\nin my opinion.[13]In my view, there is no question the sentencing\njudge identified the appropriate sentencing principles.Mr. Pitts has not\nsuggested otherwise.It is equally clear that denunciation was the factor most\nheavily weighed by the court.Given the ages of the victims, s. 718.01 was\nrelevant.It provides:718.01When a court imposes a\nsentence for an offence that involved the abuse of a person under the age of\neighteen years, it shall give primary consideration to the objectives of\ndenunciation and deterrence of such conduct.[14]The crux of Mr. Pitts’ challenge to the sentence\nrelates not to the principles applied by the sentencing judge, but rather, the\nlack of precedent in the case authorities.It was acknowledged by the court\nand counsel at the sentencing hearing that the application of a conspiracy\ncharge to the factual circumstances in the present case appeared to be unique,\nat least in reported authorities.[15]Before this Court, Mr. Pitts reviewed the case\nauthorities relied upon by the Crown at the sentencing hearing and attempted to\ndemonstrate how they were factually distinct from his circumstances.He\nsubmits that none of those authorities support a sentence of five years.He\nargues that the lack of a similar sentence for a similar offence makes the term\nof five years harsh and excessive.I disagree.[16]Undoubtedly, case authorities are an important\ntool which assist a sentencing judge in the crafting of an appropriate\ndisposition.Consideration of past dispositions help insure that a sentence is\n“similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences\ncommitted in similar circumstances” (see s. 718.2(b)).However, the lack of a\nreported case involving a similar offender committing a factually similar\noffence does not serve to render a sentence harsh or excessive.With or\nwithout precedential assistance, a sentencing judge must apply the principles\nof sentencing to the nature of the offender and offence before him or her to\ncraft an appropriate disposition.[17]The sentencing judge noted that Mr. Pitts’\ninvolvement in the live shows was at the “high end of the scale” in terms of\ngravity, and that the conduct was “horrendous in its impact”.It was further\nnoted that Mr. Pitts had a previous criminal conviction for sexual interference\nagainst a child.He had recently undergone a sexual offender assessment, which\nopined he was a “high risk to re-offend” against children.[18]The conspiracy charges and the penalty in\nrelation thereto are grounded in ss. 465(1)(c) and 271(a) of the Code\nrespectively.The offences attract a maximum sentence of 10 years.In light\nof the considerations noted above, and the deference afforded to the sentencing\njudge, it is difficult to see how a sentence of five years in these\ncircumstances is harsh or excessive.Disposition[19]I am not satisfied that in formulating the\nsentence under appeal, the sentencing judge committed legal error.Nor am I\nsatisfied that the sentence imposed was harsh or excessive.As such, I would\ndismiss the appeal.Bourgeois, J.A.Concurred in:Bryson, J.A.Oland, J.A."}

[orally]: The respondent was convicted by Trahey,\nP.C.J., on a plea of guilty, of the charge of unlawfully defrauding the Bank of\nNova Scotia of monies in excess of $200.00 contrary to s. 338(1)(a) of the Criminal\nCode of Canada. Sentence was suspended and the respondent was placed on\nprobation for two years. It was a term of her probation order that she make\nrestitution to the bank in the amount of $4,047.11 by paying $1,047.11 on or\nbefore March 31, 1986, and the balance by equal monthly installments of\n$200.00.[2]The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed and, if\nleave is granted, appeals on the ground that it is inordinately low having\nregard to the position of trust occupied by the respondent when she committed\nthe offence.[3]The respondent, aged 43, is a married woman with four teenage\nchildren. She had worked with the Bank of Nova Scotia for some 12 years and, at\nthe time of the offence, was Assistant Operations Officer. During the period\nfrom February 1985 to September 1985, she defrauded the bank of certain monies\ntotalling $4,047.11 by deducting amounts from deposits made, from time to time,\nby one of the bank's customers .[4]This court has stated on a number of occasions that theft\ninvolving a breach of trust ordinarily warrants a custodial sentence. The\ncircumstances of this case, however, justify a departure from the ordinary\nrule. The pre-sentence report is most favourable to the respondent. She is\nrepentant of her actions and has complied with the order for restitution. She\nhas the support of her husband and family and there is every reason to believe\nthat she will not in future violate any trust obligation. A custodial sentence\nwould work an undue hardship on her young children and would not, in our view, be\nin the best interests of society.[5]For these reasons, we are of the view that the sentence imposed\nin this case was an appropriate one.[6]Leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is dismissed.

BryantCOUNSEL:Steven Guiler, Assistant Crown Attorney, for Her\nMajesty the QueenDonald H. Crawford,\nQ.C. for Mr. L.T.HEARD:July 26,\n2010ENDORSEMENT FOR SENTENCE[1]L.T. was charged in a two count\nindictment alleging that he committed indecent assaults on two young females.[2]Count 1 alleged that L.T.\nindecently assaulted T.M., a female person, between January 1, 1972 and\nDecember 31, 1974 contrary to s. 149 of the Criminal Code.L.T. and his\nwife were friends of T.M.’s parents and the two families often socialized\ntogether.One evening in the spring of 1972, the two families went smelt\nfishing.The families decided to return to L.T.’s residence after smelt\nfishing.L.T. drove his wife, T.M., his daughter K.T. and his son R.T. in his\nvehicle.T.M.’s parents and her sister drove in her father’s vehicle.[3]T.M. testified that while she was\nseated in the back seat of L.T.’s car on route to L.T.’s residence, L.T. reached\nback and unzipped her pants and inserted his finger into her vagina.T.M. said\nthat she did not understand how L.T. was able to drive and digitally assault\nher.[4]The parents continued to socialize\nafter they returned to L.T.’s family home. T.M.’s father was ill and he walked\nhome but her mother stayed at L.T.’s residence. The children went to bed. T.M.\nstayed overnight at L.T.’s house.She slept in her friend K.T.’s bedroom with K.T.\nand her younger sister.During the night, T.M. testified that she woke up and\nthat her underwear had been removed, her nightgown was pushed up and her legs\nwere spread apart.She said that L.T. was performing cunnilingus.He returned\nto the bedroom on seven or eight occasions to perform cunnilingus. T.M. said that\nL.T. digitally penetrated her vagina and on one occasion she felt a soft object\npenetrate her vagina.[5]The next morning T.M. observed a\ndark spot in her underwear and she believed she soiled herself.Later, she observed\na discharge of white “stuff”.She hid her underwear in the waste basket.[6]On the night when these incidents\noccurred, T.M. was eight years old and about to turn nine. The Criminal Code\nprovides that a child of eight could not consent to sexual activity.[7]The jury found L.T. guilty of indecently\nassaulting T.M., a female person, at Tillsonburg within the time period set out\nin the indictment.[8]Count 2 alleged that L.T.\nindecently assaulted C.A., a female person, between December 1, 1972 and\nDecember 31, 1972. C.A. was a babysitter employed by L.T. to babysit his\nchildren, K.T. and R.T., while both parents worked. One evening in December 1972,\nC.A. was babysitting K.T. and R.T. because L.T. and his spouse were\nsocializing.[9]L.T. and his spouse returned home early\nthe next morning.L.T. offered to drive C.A. home.L.T. was driving and C.A.\nwas seated on the front bench seat.L.T. pulled his car to the shoulder of the\nroad. C.A. was wearing clothing and L.T. grabbed her through her clothing. L.T.\ngrabbed C.A.’s breast with his right hand and then proceeded to grab her in the\narea of her vagina.[10]C.A.\nstruck L.T. with her fist. L.T. called her a bitch for striking him. She got\nout of the car and L.T. drove away.C.A. was walking home during a snow storm\nwhen a police officer drove by and stopped.The officer gave C.A. a ride home.C.A. did not tell the police officer that she had been assaulted by L.T.[11]C.A. was\n16 years old in December 1972.The jury found L.T. guilty of indecently\nassaulting C.A., a female person, at Tillsonburg within the time period\nspecified in the indictment.[12]I accept\nas proven the above facts pursuant to s. 724(2) of the Criminal Code which\nwere essential to the jury’s verdict of guilty of indecent assault of T.M.,\nnamely the acts of cunnilingus and digital penetration and the insertion of his\npenis into T.M.’s vagina.I also accept as proven all facts that were\nessential to the jury’s verdict of guilty of indecent assault of C.A., namely\ngrabbing C.A.’s breast and vagina through her clothing.[13]L.T.\nwas born on January 20, 1942.L.T. married K.T. in 1963.There are two adult\nchildren of the marriage.L.T. left high school after grade 10.He worked for\n40 years as a forklift driver and a receiver at a manufacturing facility in\nTillsonburg until his retirement three years ago. L.T. has no previous criminal\nrecord.[14]L.T. and his wife K.T. were close\nfriends with T.M.’s parents. The two families socialized at each other’s houses\nplaying cards, chess, singing songs and drinking.The children of both\nfamilies were friends and the children often slept at each other’s homes while\ntheir parents were socializing.[15]T.M. slept\nat L.T.’s home with T.M.’s parents’ permission because her parents had a close\npersonal relationship with L.T. and his spouse. C.A. was a 16 year old\nbabysitter whom L.T. was driving home early in the morning after L.T. and his spouse\nreturned home.Both T.M. and C.A. were vulnerable young persons. L.T. was in a\nposition of trust with respect to T.M. and C.A.[16]Parliament\nhas codified the purpose of sentencing in s. 718 of the Criminal Code which\nstates in part as follows:The fundamental\npurpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention\ninitiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just and peaceful\nsociety by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following\nobjectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from\ncommitting offences;…(d)to assist in\nrehabilitating offenders;(e)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and\nacknowledgement of the harm done to the victim and the community.[17]There is\nno evidence that the offender has engaged in any criminal activity since the\nindecent assaults occurred. Accordingly, there is no apparent need to separate\nthis offender from society after the passage of 38 years.[18]Section\n718.01 of the Criminal Code provides:When a court imposes\na sentence for an offence that involved the abuse of a person under the age of\neighteen years, it shall give primary consideration to the objectives of\ndenunciation and deterrence of such conduct.[19]Section\n718.2 further provides that when an offender abuses a person under the age of\neighteen years or abuses a position of trust or authority in relation to the\nvictim while committing an offence, this is an aggravating factor. Both victims\nwere under eighteen years old and L.T. was in a position of authority and trust\nwith respect to them.[20]L.T.\nindecently assaulted T.M. and C.A.Although both assaults were serious crimes,\nthe assault of T.M. was significantly more physically intrusive than the\nassault of C.A.The assaults have adversely affected and continue to have an\nimpact on each of the victims as evidenced by their victim impact statements.\nCourts have imposed significant penal sanctions in cases involving young children\nand adolescents, especially if the offender is in a position of authority or commits\na breach of trust.[21]In R.\nv. P.(M.) (1992), 1992 CanLII 2761 (AB CA), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 530 at 535[1],\nthe Alberta Court of Appealmade the following observations:When the victim of a major sexual assault\nis a child, it is also no doubt true that such an assault frequently results in\nserious psychological harm to the victim.When a man has assaulted a child for his\nsexual gratification, then, even if no long-lasting physical trauma is suffered\nby the child, it is reasonable to assume that the child may have suffered\nemotional trauma, the effects of which may survive longer than bruises or\nbroken bones, and may even be permanent.One consequence of being abused sexually\nmay be that the child will never be able, as an adult, to form a loving, caring\nrelationship with another adult of the opposite sex, being always fearful, even\nunconsciously, that such a partner will use sexual acts to hurt him or her\nrather than as an intimate expression of caring and affection. There is no\nempirical way of proving that a particular child victim's emotional trauma will\nor will not make it more difficult or impossible for him or her to love\nanother, without fear of abuse. We have only the recorded experiences of men\nand women who attribute their difficulties as adults in forming mature and\nfulfilling relationships to their having been abused sexually when they were\nchildren.[22]The\nconsequences of the sexual abuse suffered by T.M. and C.A. are described in their\nvictim impact statements.T.M. stated that she believes the emotional impact\nof the assault by L.T. led her to remain in an abusive marriage for 15 years.In addition, she suffers from nightmares and anxiety which she attributes to Post\nTraumatic Stress Disorder for which she receives intensive therapy.[23]C.A.\nfiled her Victim Impact Statement. She stated that she has lived in fear, has\nproblems trusting males and has difficulties in her marriage due to the assault\nupon her in December 1972. She said the scare will always be with her but hopes\nthat maybe her fears will fade a bit as she wants to be able to be present in\npublic places without these concerns. In their Victim Impact statements, T.M.\nand C.A. said they have suffered lasting emotional trauma as a result of L.T.’s\nconduct.[24]Impact statements should describe\n\"the harm done to, or loss suffered by, the victim arising from the\ncommission of the offence\". Accordingly, I have not considered the comments made by T.M. with respect to the mortgage\ntransaction between L.T. and her uncle or the favourable comments of the police\nofficers made by C.A.[25]Crown\ncounsel’s position is that the Court should impose a penitentiary term of three\nyears for the indecent assault of T.M. and two years consecutive for the\nindecent assault of C.A. for a total custodial sentence of five years.Crown\ncounsel relied uponR. v. D.D. 2002 CanLII 44915 (ON CA), [2002] O.J. No. 1061(C.A.) and R. v.\nD.R., 2003 CanLII 9127 (ON CA), [2003] O.J. No. 561 (C.A.) for the proposition that a conditional\nsentence was not available forsexual touching of children. The issues before\nthe Court of Appeal in R. v. D.D., supra, did not deal with the\nissue whether or not a conditional sentence could be imposed for a sexual\nassault. In R. v. D.R., supra, the Court of Appeal did not\nprohibit a trial judge from imposing a conditional sentence for a sexual\noffence against children.Rather, the Court stated at paragraph 8 that\nconditional sentences should “rarely be imposed.”Moreover, the Ontario Court\nof Appeal accepted conditional sentences for indecent assaults in R. v.\nA.G.W., 2000 CanLII 5641 (ON CA), [2000] O.J. No. 398 (C.A.) and R. v. S.W., [1998] O.J. No.\n2867 (C.A.).[26]A\nmajority of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. L.F.W.2000 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R.\n132, upheld a conditional sentence for historical indecent assault and gross\nindecency offences.[27]The\nCrown further submitted that s. 752 of the Criminal Code prevents\nconditional sentences being imposed because L.T. was convicted of two “serious\npersonal injury offences” as that term is defined in s. 752 of the Code.Section 752 of the Criminal Code is found in Part XXIV of the Code\nwhich deals with “Dangerous Offenders and Long Term Offenders”, a matter which\nis not before the Court. Further, Parliament expressly limited personal injury\noffences to crimes “for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for\nten years or more”.The maximum term of imprisonment for the offence of\nindecent assault is five years.The Crown’s interpretation of s. 752 is patently\nincorrect.[28]Accordingly,\nI reject the Crown’s submission that a conditional sentence cannot be imposed\nfor an indecent assault of a child.[29]Defence\ncounsel’s position is that a suspended sentence and a period of probation would\nbe an appropriate sentence or in the alternative a conditional sentence to be\nserved in the community.Defence counsel did not file any case law in support of\nhis position. As mentioned, conditional sentences are rarely imposed in cases\nof historical indecent assaults on children.In R. v. A.G.W., supra,\nthe accused was in extremely poor health, and was not expected to survive a\ncustodial sentence.In R. v. S.W., supra, the accused and his\nwife suffered from serious medical issues, and his wife was extremely dependent\non him for her daily needs.L.T. is not in a similar situation.[30]Although\na conditional sentence is an available option, it is my view that a conditional\nsentence is not available for the more intrusive assault of T.M.[31]Parliament\nprovided that the maximum penalty for indecent assault of a female was five\nyears. L.T. sexually abused a young child and a teenager while he was an adult and\nwas in a position of authority and trust. These isolated incidents of assault\nmust be distinguished from those cases where the sexual abuse occurred on a\nregular and persistent basis over a substantial period of time. Although L.T.\nperformed cunnilingus, digital penetration and sexual intercourse on T.M.,\nthese acts were not accompanied by additional acts of physical violence,\nthreats of future physical violence, or other forms of extortion or\nbrutalization.[2]\nI am also mindful that these offences occurred many years ago.[32]L.T.\nmaintains his innocence notwithstanding a verdict of his peers found him guilty\nof both offences. Although the PSR report indicates there is a lack of remorse,\nthe lack of remorse is not an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes.[33]Taking\nthese factors, and the fact that L.T. has no previous criminal record, into\naccount, I am satisfied that an appropriate and fit sentence is one that blends\na custodial sentence with a conditional sentence as approved by the Ontario\nCourt of Appeal in R. v. Ploumis (2000), 2000 CanLII 17033 (ON CA), 150 C.C.C. (3d) 424. Thus, L.T.\nshall serve a period of incarceration in an institution as well as in the\ncommunity to be followed by a period of probation.[34]I\nsentence L.T. to a custodial sentence of one year for count one and a conditional\nsentence of one year less one day for count two consecutive to the sentence in\ncount one, plus 2 years probation. Thus, the total global sentence is two years\nless one day plus two years probation. I am satisfied that serving part of his\nsentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and\nwould be consistent with the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing\nset out in sections 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code. The\nconsiderations of denunciation and general deterrence are adequately served by\nthe blended sentence together with punitive and restrictive conditions of the\nconditional sentence.[35]The\nconditional sentence is to be served in the community upon mandatory conditions\nthat apply to all conditional sentences: (1) keep the peace and be of good\nbehaviour; (2) appear before the Court when required to do so; (3) report to a\nsupervisor within two working days and thereafter as required by him or her, in\nthe manner as directed by the supervisor; (4) remain within the jurisdiction of\nthe court, that is to say, the province of Ontario, unless written permission\nis otherwise obtained from the Court or from your supervisor; and (5) notify\nthe Court or your supervisor of any change of address, change of employment or\nof occupation.[36]I\nimpose the following additional conditions: (1) follow any counseling or\ntreatment program to address offence-specific and addiction as directed by your\nsupervisor; (2) provide to your supervisor any form of release requested so as\nto allow him or her to monitor your treatment and counseling program; (3) you\nare to be subject to house arrest for the duration of your conditional\nsentence, save and except for you to attend medical appointments, counseling,\ntreatment programs, your counsel's office and, as well, save and except for\nmedical emergencies and as may be exempted by your supervisor; (4) you are not\nto communicate, either directly or indirectly, with T.M. or C.A. unless such\ncommunication is authorized in advance in writing by any of them; (5) you are\nnot to attend within 500 metres of the residences of T.M. or C.A., their place\nof employment, or school; and, (6) you are not to be alone with a child under\nthe age of 18 unless accompanied by another mature adult.Those are the\noptional conditions that I have imposed.[37]If you\nthink that any of the optional conditions that I have imposed should be varied\nor changed for any reason, there is a procedure available whereby you, the\nsupervisor or the prosecutor may apply to the Court to vary the optional conditions.[38]I\ninform you that if you are in breach of any of the mandatory or optional\nconditions I have imposed, you could be arrested and you could be subjected to\na bail hearing, as would any other person arrested for a criminal offence.If\nyou are found guilty of having breached any of the conditions imposed, then, in\nthose circumstances, you may be called upon to serve a portion or the balance\nof your then remaining sentence in an institution rather than in the community.[39]The blended\ncustodial and conditional sentences are to be followed by a period of two years\nprobation.Other than the statutory condition that you keep the peace and be\nof good behaviour, you are to report to a probation officer as required by him\nor her. As well, you are to continue or participate and complete counseling or\ntreatment program to address offence-specific and addiction as directed by your\nprobation officer. You are not to communicate, either directly or indirectly,\nwith T.M., or her children T.M., D.M., S.M.or C.A. unless such communication\nis authorized the written revocable permission of your probation officer.As\nwell, you are not to be alone with a child under the age of 16 unless accompanied\nby another mature adult during the probationary period.[40]In\naddition I make the following orders: (1) you are prohibited from possessing\nany weapons for 10 years pursuant to s. 109 of the Criminal Code; (2) you must\nprovide a sample of a bodily substance for the purpose of D.N.A. testing pursuant\nto s. 487.051; (3) you must register and comply with the Sex Offender\nInformation Act for 10 years pursuant to s. 490.012; and (4) you are prohibited\nfrom communicating directly or indirectly with C.C. or T.M. during the\ncustodial period of your sentence pursuant to s. 743.21(1).­­­­­­­________________Justice A.

The failure to interview the nurse and to cross-examine\nthe complainant on the statement cannot, in our view, be attributed to\nreasonable professional judgment. The trial counsel’s explanations for these\ndecisions do not bear up under scrutiny and are inconsistent with counsel’s\nlater futile attempt to lead hearsay evidence of the nurse’s statement.[2]We are also satisfied that the appellant has\nshown that the reliability of the trial’s results may have been compromised.P.C. Roger’s attempt to explain away the express words of her note of the nurse’s\nstatement is not reasonable. Had the complainant been confronted with this\nstatement, the result of the case may have been different. That statement to\nthe nurse supported the defence position that the complainant had reinterpreted\nthe events surrounding the sexual act in light of the quite brutal and\nunprovoked assault that followed.[3]Accordingly we would allow the appeal from\nconviction for sexual assault and order a new trial.[4]The trial judge imposed five years imprisonment\nconcurrent for the aggravated assault and the sexual assault. In view of our\nconclusion on the sexual assault, it is necessary to review the five-year\nsentence imposed for the aggravated assault. For that purpose the fresh\nevidence is helpful. That evidence shows that the appellant is confronting his\nalcohol problem and making excellent progress with his rehabilitation. That\nsaid, the aggravated assault was an extremely serious one, committed within a\ndomestic context and committed only a very short time after he was released, having\nassaulted this very same complainant.[5]Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence for\naggravated assault is granted, the appeal is allowed and the sentence is\nreduced to four years imprisonment.Signed:“M.\nRosenberg J.A.”“E.E.

Ansari, 2015 ONCA 891DATE: 20151215DOCKET: M45729 (C52883)Strathy C.J.O., Watt and Epstein\nJJ.A.BETWEENHer Majesty the QueenRespondentandAsad AnsariApplicantJohn Norris and Breese Davies, for the\napplicantCroft Michaelson, Q.C., for the\nrespondentHeard: December 4, 2015An application for an extension of time\nto file a notice of application for leave to appeal the sentence imposed on\nOctober 4, 2010 by Justice Fletcher Dawson of the Superior Court of Justice,\nsitting with a jury, and an application for an order under s. 684 of the Criminal\nCode.By the Court:[1]Asad Ansari is a Canadian citizen. On June 23,\n2010 a jury found him guilty of participating in the activities of a terrorist\ngroup. On October 4, 2010 the trial judge sentenced him to one day in jail to\nbe followed by three years’ probation. In light of the time he had already\nspent in pre-sentence custody and the then prevailing rule of thumb about\ncredit for it, the trial judge considered the sentence imposed to be the\nfunctional equivalent of a sentence of six years and five months. At trial,\nCrown counsel did not seek any additional term of imprisonment beyond the\nperiod reflected in the pre-trial custody credit.[2]Asad Ansari appealed his conviction. He did not\nseek leave to appeal his sentence, the carceral component of which he had\nserved on the day the trial judge imposed the sentence.[3]On August 19, 2015 this court dismissed Asad\nAnsari’s appeal from conviction.THE APPLICATION[4]Asad Ansari (“the applicant”) now applies for an\norder extending the time within which he can serve and file a notice of\napplication for leave to appeal the sentence imposed at trial. He also seeks an\norder under s. 684 of the Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C., 1985, c.\nC-46, appointing counsel to act on his behalf on this application, and on the\nappeal from sentence if the extension of time he requests is granted.[5]At the outset of the hearing in this court, the\napplicant modified the relief sought on the application. He pursued his\napplication to extend the time within which to serve and file a notice of\napplication for leave to appeal sentence, but asked that the application for an\norder under s. 684 of the Criminal Code be adjourned sine die\nfor hearing before a single judge if required.[6]At the conclusion of oral argument, the Chief\nJustice delivered brief reasons extending for ten days the time within which\nMr. Ansari could serve and file his notice of application for leave to appeal\nsentence. The Chief Justice adjourned the s. 684 application sine die\nto be heard by a single judge of this court, if required. What follows are the\nreasons the Chief Justice said would be provided to explain the orders made.THE APPLICATION FOR AN EXTENSION OF TIME[7]It is common ground that Asad Ansari did not\nform the intention to appeal the sentence imposed upon him within 30 days of\nits pronouncement.The Essential\nBackground[8]On June 19, 2014, nearly four years after the\napplicant was sentenced, the Strengthening Canadian Citizenship Act,\nS.C. 2014, c. 22 received royal assent. Among other things, the Act amended s.\n10 of the Citizenship Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-29, to permit the\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration to revoke the citizenship of any\nCanadian citizen convicted of a terrorism offence and sentenced to a term of\nimprisonment of at least five years. The legislation came into force on May 28,\n2015 and applied to convictions entered and sentences imposed both before and\nafter that date.[9]In early July, 2015 the applicant received\nnotice under the Citizenship Act that the Minister may revoke his\ncitizenship as a result of his conviction and sentence. The applicant was\nafforded an opportunity to make written submissions to the Minister.[10]On receipt of the notice, the applicant sought\nlegal advice. He joined a constitutional challenge in the Federal Court\nclaiming that parts of the Citizenship Act, including the Minister’s\nauthority to revoke citizenship on the basis of a conviction of a terrorism\noffence, are unconstitutional.[11]The applicant also instructed counsel to seek\nan order extending the time within which to serve and file a notice of\napplication for leave to appeal the sentence imposed upon him.The Arguments on the\nApplication[12]The applicant emphasizes the discretionary\nnature of the decision to grant an extension of time. The overarching\nconsideration is whether the interests of justice warrant the extension.[13]The applicant readily acknowledges that he did\nnot form the intention to appeal sentence within 30 days of its imposition. The\ncarceral component of the sentence ended the day it was imposed. But he took\nimmediate steps to do so once notified of the Minister’s intention. His\nresponse included not only an attack on the sentence imposed, but also a\nchallenge to the constitutionality of the legislation invoked by the Minister.[14]The applicant says that the proposed appeal has\nmerit. The collateral consequences of a sentence require consideration in imposing\na fit sentence, as well as on appellate review of the fitness of a sentence\nimposed at trial. Appellate courts have authority to intervene to adjust the\nsentence, even after its completion, if the sentencing judge has failed to\nconsider its collateral consequences. It is all the more so when those\nconsequences arise because of a statutory amendment that has retrospective\neffect.[15]The respondent opposes the extension of time the\napplicant seeks.[16]The respondent emphasizes the need for finality\nin criminal proceedings. Extensions of time are exceptional. They require\nextraordinary circumstances that reveal a real concern that an injustice may\noccur or be perpetuated in the absence of an extension.[17]A consideration and balancing of the relevant\nfactors belies any claim that the justice of the case warrants the extension\nsought. Nothing was overlooked when the sentence was imposed that gives any\nreason to doubt the fitness of that sentence. The applicant’s real complaint is\nwith the retrospective effect of the amendment. But that issue will occupy\nanother court at another time, not a court asked to review the fitness of\nsentence.[18]In addition, the respondent continues, the\napplicant has failed to demonstrate any merit in the proposed appeal. The\nreduction sought here – to a sentence under five years – would distort the\nsentencing process and result in the imposition of an artificial and\ninappropriate sentence.The Governing\nPrinciples[19]Section 678(2) of the Criminal Code\nauthorizes a panel or judge of a court of appeal to extend the time within\nwhich notice of an application for leave to appeal may be given. Rule 7 of the Criminal\nAppeal Rules, SI/93-169, permits an extension to be granted before or\nafter the expiration of the 30-day period prescribed by r. 4(2). Neither\nthe Criminal Code nor the Criminal Appeal Rules frames a test\nto be applied or describes any factors to be considered in deciding whether the\nextension should be granted.[20]A few brief points emerge from the authorities.[21]First, the authority to grant or refuse an\nextension of time is discretionary. No party is entitled to an extension of\ntime as of right: R. v. Roberge, 2005 SCC 48 (CanLII), [2005] 2 S.C.R. 469, at\npara. 6; R. v. Menear (2002), 2002 CanLII 7570 (ON CA), 162 C.C.C. (3d)\n233 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 20.[22]Second, relevant factors that may be considered\nwhen an extension of time is sought include, but are not limited to:i.whether the applicant formed a bona fide\nintention to seek leave to appeal and communicated that intention to the\nopposite party within the time prescribed for filing the applicable notice;ii.whether the applicant has accounted for or\nexplained the delay in filing the notice; andiii.whether the proposed appeal has merit: Menear,\nat para. 20.[23]Depending on the circumstances of the\napplication, other factors may also influence the decision. The length of the\ndelay. Prejudice to the respondent. The diligence or inattentiveness of\ncounsel. Whether the applicant has taken the benefit of the judgment: Menear,\nat para. 21; Roberge, at para. 6. In the final analysis, the\noverarching consideration is whether the applicant has demonstrated that the\njustice of the case requires that the extension of time be granted: Menear,\nat para. 21.[24]Third, the collateral consequences of a sentence\nare a relevant factor for a sentencing court to consider in determining a fit\nsentence, one that gives effect to the fundamental principle of sentencing –\nthat the sentence be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree\nof responsibility of the offender: R. v. Pham, 2013 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2013] 1\nS.C.R. 739, at para. 11. The relevance of collateral consequences may also flow\nfrom the sentencing objective of assisting in the rehabilitation of the\noffender: Pham, at para. 11.[25]Collateral consequences of a sentence are any\nconsequences of the impact of the sentence on the particular offender. Such\nconsequences may include those associated with deportation and immigration\nstatus. Variation of a sentence to avoid collateral consequences must not be so\ngreat, however, that the sentence offends the fundamental principle of\nproportionality: Pham, at paras. 11, 18.[26]Fourth, extensions of time to appeal sentence\nhave been granted where the trial judge was unaware of the collateral\nconsequences of the sentence she or he imposed, as well as in instances in\nwhich the law changed after sentence to include or increase collateral\nconsequences: R. v. Leung, 2004 ABCA 55 (CanLII), 354 A.R. 2, at para. 3; R.\nv. Bahadur, 2010 SKCA 103 (CanLII), 359 Sask. R. 260, at para. 13; R. v. Truong,\n2007 ABCA 127 (CanLII), 404 A.R. 277, at para. 13.[27]Finally, extensions of time have been granted on\nthe basis of disproportionate collateral consequences after the sentence had\nbeen served or where the carceral portion of it was about to expire: Leung,\nat para. 6; R. v. Kanthasamy, 2005 BCCA 135 (CanLII), 195 C.C.C. (3d) 182, at\npara. 10.The Principles Applied[28]Several factors persuade us that we should\nextend the time within which the applicant can serve and file a notice of\napplication for leave to appeal sentence.[29]First, the interests of justice favour the\nextension. To refuse the order, a substantial injustice may occur, wrought by\nlegislation not in force or within the reasonable contemplation of any of the\nparticipants in the trial process, but made retrospective by an enactment\npassed years later.[30]Second, the failure of the applicant to seek\nleave to appeal sentence within 30 days of its imposition is easily explained.\nThe carceral portion of his sentence expired the day sentence was imposed. And\nan appeal of the length or discretionary terms of the probation order would\nrisk dismissal for failure to invoke s. 732.2(3) of the Criminal Code.[31]Third, the collateral consequences – loss of\nCanadian citizenship – are of such magnitude as to render it unjust to deprive\nthe applicant of the opportunity to seek a variation of the sentence to remove\nhimself from the reach of the amendment.[32]Fourth, when notified by the Minister, the\napplicant and his counsel acted diligently to pursue two avenues to achieve a\nresult that would remove the applicant from the class of persons subject to the\nauthority of the Minister to strip a citizen of Canadian citizenship. The\napplicant sought this extension of time in order to ask the court to reduce the\nimputed sentence to less than five years. And he challenged the\nconstitutionality of the legislation that provided the Minister with the\nauthority to strip Canadians of their citizenship.[33]Fifth, it cannot be said that the appeal is\ndevoid of merit. The collateral consequences of a sentence are a relevant\nfactor for both trial and appellate courts to consider in imposing or reviewing\nthe imposition of a sentence to ensure its conformity with the principle of\nproportionality. The variation sought is not on its face so far removed from\nthe sentence imposed to be outside the range of variation permissible under Pham.[34]It is for these reasons that we granted the\napplicant an extension of time within which to serve and file his notice of\napplication for leave to appeal sentence.THE s. 684 APPLICATION[35]In accordance with submissions of counsel, the\napplication under s. 684 of the Criminal Code is adjourned sine\ndie to be reinvigorated if required and scheduled for hearing before a\nsingle judge in chambers.CONCLUSION[36]For these reasons, we granted the application\nfor an extension of time to file a notice of application for leave to appeal\nsentence. The s. 684 application is adjourned sine die for hearing before\na single judge if required.Released: December 15, 2015 (GS)“G.R.\nStrathy C.J.O.”“David\nWatt J.A.”“Gloria\nEpstein J.A.”"}

prohibited under s. 86(1)(a)(ii) of the B.C.\nMotor Vehicle Act, contrary to s. 88(1)(a).Section 88(1)(c)\nprescribes a minimum penalty of seven days' imprisonment and a $300 fine for a\nfirst conviction of driving while prohibited under s. 84, 85, 86 or 214.The provincial court found that the provision did not infringe the guarantee\nagainst cruel and unusual punishment in s. 12 of the Canadian Charter\nof Rights and Freedoms and imposed the minimum sentence.On appeal, the\ncounty court found that the sentencing provision violated s. 12 of the Charter\nand could not be justified under s. 1.That determination was upheld by the\nCourt of Appeal.The constitutional questions before this Court queried\nwhether s. 88(1)(c) of the Motor Vehicle Act infringes s. 12\nof the Charter and, if so, whether the infringement is justified under\ns. 1.Held (Lamer C.J. and McLachlin and\nStevenson JJ. dissenting):The appeal should be allowed.The mandatory\nminimum sentence imposed pursuant to s. 88(1)(c) of the Motor Vehicle\nAct for a first conviction of driving while prohibited does not infringe\ns. 12 of the Charter when the prohibition from driving is made\npursuant to s. 86(1)(a)(ii) of the Act.Other prohibitions from driving,\nviolation of which also triggers the mandatory minimum sentence in s. 88(1)(c),\nare not at issue in this appeal.Per La Forest, L'Heureux‑Dubé,\nSopinka, Gonthier, Cory and Iacobucci JJ.:The general test for\ndetermining whether a punishment is cruel and unusual within the meaning of\ns. 12 is one of gross disproportionality, which must consider the gravity\nof the offence, the personal characteristics of the offender and the particular\ncircumstances of the case.Other factors which may legitimately inform an\nassessment are whether the punishment is necessary to achieve a valid penal\npurpose, whether it is founded on recognized sentencing principles, whether\nthere exist valid alternatives to the punishment imposed, and to some extent\nwhether a comparison with punishments imposed for other crimes in the same\njurisdiction reveals great disproportion.The test is not one which is\nquick to invalidate sentences crafted by legislators.It will only be on rare\noccasions that a court will find a sentence so grossly disproportionate that it\nviolates s. 12 of the Charter.There are two\naspects to the analysis of invalidity under s. 12.One aspect involves the\nassessment of the challenged penalty or sanction from the perspective of the\nperson actually subjected to it, balancing the gravity of the offence in itself\nwith the particular circumstances of the offence and the personal\ncharacteristics of the offender.If it is concluded that the challenged\nprovision provides for and would actually impose on the offender a sanction so\nexcessive or grossly disproportionate as to outrage decency in those real and\nparticular circumstances, then it will amount to a prima facie violation\nof s. 12 and will be examined for justifiability under s. 1 of the Charter.If the particular facts of the case do not warrant a finding of gross\ndisproportionality, there may remain another aspect to be examined, namely a Charter\nchallenge or constitutional question as to the validity of a statutory\nprovision on grounds of gross disproportionality as evidenced in reasonable\nhypothetical circumstances.The constitutional\nquestions in this case are restricted in focus to the particular form of\nprohibition to which respondent was subjected under s. 86(1)(a)(ii) of the\nAct.In relation to the particular offence and respondent's personal\nsituation, s. 88(1)(c), applied in a severed fashion in respect of\ns. 88(1)(a) and s. 86(1)(a)(ii), does not infringe s. 12 of the Charter.Commission of the offence specified by ss. 86(1)(a)(ii) and 88(1) is\ngrave.The gravity of the offence must be assessed in light of the legislative\npurpose and the underlying driving offences giving rise to the prohibition.An\norder of prohibition made under s. 86(1)(a)(ii) is aimed in large measure at\nsafeguarding the health and lives of citizens using the highways of a province,\nas reflected in the requirements that the prohibited individual must have built\nup an \"unsatisfactory driving record\" and that the prohibition be\n\"in the public interest\".Only bad drivers with an unsatisfactory\ndriving record are prohibited under s. 86(1)(a)(ii) because it is\nespecially those drivers who are dangerous to innocent citizens using the roads\nin a responsible manner.The Act's emphasis on the promotion of responsible\ndriving and penalizing of irresponsible driving is further reflected in the\nrequirement in the offence that a person knowingly drive while prohibited.As\nwell, because the offence is difficult to detect, there is a great temptation\non the part of many prohibited drivers to commit it, and a legislature may\ntherefore rationally conclude that for the purpose of deterrence a serious\npenalty must attach to it.The gravity of the offence of driving while\nprohibited is made more obvious upon review of the Act's procedural safeguards,\nwhich ensure that only bad drivers will be prohibited from driving under\ns. 88(1)(a) in application to s. 86(1)(a)(ii).Having been\nprohibited from driving, respondent knowingly and contemptuously violated the\nprohibition.There was no indication that he was urgently required to drive\nhis car on the day in question, nor was there any submission as to a relevant\npersonal characteristic of his that would justify a mitigated or lesser\nsentence than the mandatory minimum.The effects of the sentence cannot\nreasonably be said to outrage standards of decency or be seen as grossly\ndisproportionate to the wrongdoing.The effect of the seven‑day sentence\nis lighter than might first appear, since the sentence can be fashioned to be\nfully served on a few weekends, as in this case.It is unlikely that\nthe general application of the offence would result in the imposition of a\ngrossly disproportionate sentence amounting to cruel and unusual punishment.Respondent has not discharged the onus of demonstrating a reasonable hypothetical\ncircumstance in which enforcement of the statute would violate s. 12.The\nregulatory system of penalty points and internal reviews guarantees that it\nwill be exceptionally rare that a so‑called \"small offender\"\nwill ever be subjected to the minimum penalty in s. 88(1)(c).By\ndivorcing the offence of driving while prohibited from the various infractions\nwhich led up to the prohibition, the Court of Appeal accorded insufficient\nweight to the gravity of the offence and to the relatively high threshold for\nits commission.Per Lamer C.J. and McLachlin and\nStevenson JJ. (dissenting):The mandatory minimum sentence of seven days'\nimprisonment plus a fine would in some cases be clearly disproportionate and\nshocking to the Canadian conscience, and hence violate the guarantee against\ncruel and unusual punishment in s. 12 of the Charter.The\nprovision cannot be saved under s. 1 of the Charter because it is\noverbroad:no obvious or probable need for a deterrent which has such an\nindiscriminate reach has been demonstrated.Rather than\nalleviating the particular offences from the purview of s. 88(1)(c) on a\ncase‑by‑case basis, the Court should strike out the mandatory\nminimum sentence.An analysis which proceeds by severing potentially offending\nparts of s. 88 fails to answer the question posed on this appeal.Furthermore,\nsevering the reference in s. 88 to prohibitions other than selected cases\nunder s. 86 of the Act has an effect analogous to reading down the\nstatute, or applying the doctrine of constitutional exemption.To address\ns. 88 as though it referred only to prohibitions under s. 86 is to\naddress a different scheme than that enacted by the legislature and leaves the\nconstitutional status of the scheme uncertain, which runs counter to the\nfundamental principle that laws whose violation can result in imprisonment\nshould be clear, certain and ascertainable.Cases CitedBy Gonthier J.Considered:R. v.

SUPERINTENDENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES, hereby give you notice that I consider it\nto be in the public interest to prohibit you from driving a motor vehicle under\nsection 86(1)(a)(ii) of the Motor Vehicle Act, and you are hereby prohibited.This\nprohibition from driving commences on the date you receive this notice and\ncontinues for a term of 3 months....I\nwill consider any submissions in writing that you may wish to make as to why\nthis prohibition order should be cancelled or should have a shorter term than\nset out above.Your\nfive year driving record is attached.The specific nature of the\nrespondent's infractions and the total of his accumulated points were not\npleaded at trial, nor in the Court of Appeal.On June 13, 1987,\nthe respondent was stopped by an R.C.M.P. officer while driving a motor vehicle\nwhich the officer alleged was speeding.The respondent received a ticket for\nthe alleged infraction, and upon discovery that he had been prohibited from\ndriving, was given a \"notice to appear\", to answer a charge under\ns. 88(1) of the Act.At trial in\nProvincial Court, the respondent was found guilty of the offence of driving\nwhile prohibited and was sentenced to the minimum penalty of seven days'\nimprisonment, to be served intermittently on consecutive three-day weekends,\nand a $300 fine, to be paid within three months of the date of judgment.The\nconstitutional validity of the minimum sentence was argued before the\nProvincial Court, which concluded that s. 12 of the Charter was not\nviolated by s. 88(1) of the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act.The respondent\nappealed the Provincial Court decision to the County Court of British Columbia\nwhere Hogarth Co. Ct. J. held that the sentencing provision in s. 88(1)(c)\nviolated s. 12 of the Charter and could not be justified under s. 1.That determination was later upheld by the decision of the British Columbia\nCourt of Appeal, which determination forms the subject matter of this appeal.II -- Relevant LegislationMotor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 28886.

Provincial Court, Surrey, B.C.The Trial Court\ndecided it was bound by the decisions of the Vancouver County Court in R. v.\nWilliams (1988), 26 B.C.L.R. (2d) 67, and the B.C. Court of Appeal in R.\nv. Konechny (1983), 1983 CanLII 282 (BC CA), 10 C.C.C. (3d) 233, to hold that s. 88(1) of the\nAct was valid and did not amount to the imposition of cruel and unusual\npunishment in terms of s. 12 of the Charter.It sentenced the\nrespondent to seven days' imprisonment, to be served intermittently, over the\ncourse of consecutive three-day weekends.Westminster County Court ((1988), 44 C.C.C. (3d) 166)Judge Hogarth in\nthe County Court of Westminster reviewed the relevant jurisprudence, including\nthe decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Smith, 1987 CanLII 64 (SCC), [1987]\n1 S.C.R. 1045, before deciding that it was a certainty that sooner or later the\nprescribed penalty in a given case would be outrageous.Applying the test of\ngross disproportionality established by the majority in Smith, he\ndetermined that, in combination, ss. 88(1)(a) and (c) violate s. 12 of the\nCharter.He further held that the violation could not be justified\nunder s. 1 of the Charter.British Columbia Court of Appeal ((1990), 1990 CanLII 833 (BC CA), 43 B.C.L.R. (2d) 161)The Court of\nAppeal, speaking unanimously through Wood J.A., upheld the decision of Hogarth\nCo. Ct. J.In its reasons for judgment, the Court noted that the test of cruel\nand unusual punishment employed by the majority in Smith was\nsignificantly different from that used in Konechny, supra, and that\nthe emphasis in Smith on the personal characteristics of the offender\nand the particular circumstances of the offence was to be accorded great\nweight.Despite the Court\nof Appeal's focus on the particular circumstances of a case, it compared the\nenforcement and sentencing provisions in s. 88 with those of other\noffences.It found that there was \"little in the way of intrinsic danger\nto the community at large\" by a commission of the offence of driving while\nprohibited and that, as a consequence, there was little justification for a\nminimum sentence of seven days' imprisonment.As Wood J.A. expressed this\nidea, at p. 170:It\nis, after all, the nature of the driving, and not the fact that such driving is\nprohibited, which represents a danger to society.And yet, significantly, for\nmany types of driving which the statute clearly identifies as dangerous, such\nas speeding, disobeying traffic control devices and driving without due care\nand attention, not only is there no required minimum term of imprisonment upon\nconviction, but the maximum punishment prescribed in each case is a number of\npenalty points, which are noted on the offender's driving record....When\none looks to the criminal law, it is evident that there are many serious crimes\nthe commission of which presents a real danger to society for which no\nmandatory minimum sentence is prescribed by the Criminal Code..\n. .A\ncomparison of the relative severity of those many offences at law which do not\ncarry a mandatory jail term as punishment for a first conviction with that of\nthe offence here under consideration leads me to the conclusion that there is\nno reason, in principle, why the latter must carry a mandatory minimum\npunishment of seven days' imprisonment.The court stressed\nthat the offence of driving while prohibited must be assessed on its own,\nwithout considering the offences and infractions which led up to the prohibition,\nat p. 173:The\ncircumstances of the offence which are relevant to the tests under\nconsideration are those related to the driving which is prohibited, and not\nthose which led to the prohibition.If a sentence of seven days is wholly\ndisproportionate in any given case ... its constitutionality cannot be salvaged\non the grounds that it is in some way justified as a form of supplementary\npunishment for offences of which the offender has already been convicted and\nfor which he has already been punished.In reflecting on\nhypothetical circumstances which might infringe s. 12, and emphasizing\nthat there are an unlimited number of different circumstances under which the\noffence could be committed, the court proceeded to find a violation of\ns. 12 based on its view that \"inevitably there will be cases where a\nmandatory minimum sentence of seven days' imprisonment, plus a fine of $300,\nwill be so grossly disproportionate to what would otherwise have been\nappropriate that to impose such a sentence will clearly offend against\ns. 12 of the Charter\" (p. 172).The court also noted that while a\ndefence of necessity might in rare cases save an exceptional offender from the\npunishment prescribed by s. 88(1)(a), that defence would not eliminate the\ncertainty that sooner or later a case of gross disproportionality would arise.Finally, the court\nheld that while the objective of protecting the public from bad drivers was\nimportant, and was rationally connected to the legislative purpose underlying\nthe minimum sentence, namely to deter prohibited drivers from violating that\nprohibition, nevertheless the seven-day minimum did not impair the s. 12\nright as little as possible, so it was not justifiable under s. 1 of the Charter.In its opinion, this conclusion was reinforced by the fact that no other\nprovince in Canada had thought it necessary to impose a mandatory minimum\nprison sentence on drivers found violating an official prohibition.The B.C.\nCourt of Appeal therefore struck down the minimum punishment provided by\ns. 88(1)(c), and directed that the matter of the appropriate sentence be\nremitted to the Trial Court.IV -- IssuesThe issues raised\nin this appeal are the following constitutional questions stated by Lamer C.J.\non September 11, 1990:1.Does\nthe mandatory minimum sentence of seven days' imprisonment, together with a\nfine of $300, imposed pursuant to s. 88(1)(c) of the Motor Vehicle Act,\nR.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, for a first conviction of driving while prohibited\ninfringe or deny rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 12 of the Canadian\nCharter of Rights and Freedoms?2.If\nthe mandatory minimum sentence imposed pursuant to s. 88(1)(c) of the Motor\nVehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, for a first conviction of driving while\nprohibited infringes or denies rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 12 of\nthe Charter, is that sentence justified by s. 1 of the Charter\nand therefore not inconsistent with the Constitution Act, 1982?Counsel for the\nAttorney General of British Columbia, in his oral submissions, limited his\ndefence of s. 88(1)(c) of the Motor Vehicle Act, to prohibition\norders imposed via s. 86(1)(a)(ii).I see no reason why the Attorney\nGeneral of British Columbia could not so limit his case.The constitutional\nquestions are restricted in focus to the particular form of prohibition to\nwhich the respondent was subjected under s. 86(1)(a)(ii) of the Act.Other forms of prohibition, violation of which also trigger the mandatory\nminimum sentence in s. 88(1)(c), are not at issue in this appeal.V -- Analysis1.Does\nthe mandatory minimum sentence of seven days' imprisonment, together with a\nfine of $300, imposed pursuant to s. 88(1)(c) of the Motor Vehicle Act,\nR.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, for a first conviction of driving while prohibited\ninfringe or deny rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 12 of the Canadian\nCharter of Rights and Freedoms?Background to the Challenged ProvisionThe Government of\nBritish Columbia established a Motor Vehicle Task Force in 1978.Its mandate\nwas to examine the laws and procedures governing highway users in British\nColumbia and to recommend changes to promote safe driving habits, in order to\nreduce a growing number of accidents and bodily injury claims.After the Task\nForce issued its Report in 1980, the Legislative Assembly enacted a mandatory\npenalty for driving while a person's licence was suspended.It provided for a\nfine of not less than $300 and for imprisonment of not less than seven days (Miscellaneous\nStatutes Amendment Act (No. 2), 1981, S.B.C. 1981, c. 21, s. 55).In 1982,\nthe Assembly amended the Motor Vehicle Act to apply the mandatory\npenalty in s. 88 of the Motor Vehicle Act to prohibitions as well\nas to suspensions (Motor Vehicle Amendment Act, 1982, S.B.C. 1982, c.\n36, s. 19).That enactment was to give effect to one of the many\nrecommendations of the Task Force.It is that amended provision which is\nchallenged in this appeal.Shortly after the\nmandatory sentencing provision came into effect, on August 15, 1981,\nthe mandatory minimum sentence of seven days' imprisonment was challenged in R.\nv. Konechny, supra, on the grounds that it violated s. 9 and\ns. 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.A majority\nof the British Columbia Court of Appeal held that the sentencing provision did\nnot violate the Charter because the sentence was not grossly\ndisproportionate to the wrongdoing.Macdonald J.A. indicated, at p. 248, that\nthe concept of cruel and unusual punishment \"is restricted to punishment\nat a high level of severity\" and agreed with McFarlane J.A. that seven\ndays' imprisonment for driving when knowingly prohibited was not excessive.The mandatory\nminimum in s. 88 of the Act was again challenged subsequent to this\nCourt's determination in R. v. Smith, supra, with conflicting\nresults in the County Court -- in R. v. Williams, supra, and in\nthe case on appeal.In the case on appeal, Wood J.A. in the court below\nindicated at p. 168 that in his view:...\nthe decision of the majority in the Smith case must, in that sense, be\ntaken to have reopened the issue which had apparently been decided in Konechny.It is Smith\nwhich must therefore be closely examined.For it is the test set out there\nwhich led the Court of Appeal in this case to a different result than that\nreached in its initial review of s. 88(1)(c) in Konechny, supra.The General Test for Determining Violations\nof s. 12 of the CharterThe current test\nfor determining whether a law prescribes a cruel and unusual punishment was\nestablished in R. v. Smith, supra, per Lamer J., as\nhe then was.The test was born of an extensive review of the history and meaning\nof the principle against cruel and unusual punishment, which background need\nnot be repeated here.That test has been subsequently reaffirmed in the cases\nof R. v. Lyons, 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, and R. v. Luxton, 1990 CanLII 83 (SCC), [1990] 2\nS.C.R. 711.In Smith,\nthe Court struck down a seven-year minimum sentencing provision which applied\nto the offence of importing narcotics under s. 5(1) of the Narcotic Control\nAct.In its view, that mandatory sentence amounted to cruel and unusual\npunishment under s. 12 of the Charter.Each member of the Court in\nSmith accepted the general principle that a sentence which is grossly or\nexcessively disproportionate to the wrongdoing would infringe s. 12.The Smith\ntest accords much weight to the particular circumstances of the offender and to\nthe specific factual circumstances under which the offence was committed.The\nCourt decided that the effects of the punishment on a particular individual are\nto be closely considered in assessing the constitutional validity of a\nprescribed sentence.The general\nstandard for determining s. 12 infringements is contained in the following\npassage from the judgment in Smith, at p. 1072:...\nthe protection afforded by s. 12 governs the quality of the punishment and\nis concerned with the effect that the punishment may have on the person on whom\nit is imposed....The criterion which must be applied in order to determine\nwhether a punishment is cruel and unusual within the meaning of s. 12 of\nthe Charter is, to use the words of Laskin C.J. in Miller and Cockriell,\nsupra, at p. 688, \"whether the punishment prescribed is so\nexcessive as to outrage standards of decency\".In other words, though\nthe state may impose punishment, the effect of that punishment must not be\ngrossly disproportionate to what would have been appropriate....\nThe test for review under s. 12 of the Charter is one of gross\ndisproportionality, because it is aimed at punishments that are more than\nmerely excessive.[Emphasis added.]Constitutive Elements of the General\nTest of Gross DisproportionalitySmith states that a determination of gross\ndisproportionality must consider the following essential elements as stated by\nLamer J., at p. 1073:...\nthe gravity of the offence, the personal characteristics of the offender and\nthe particular circumstances of the case in order to determine what range of\nsentences would have been appropriate to punish, rehabilitate or deter this\nparticular offender or to protect the public from this particular offender....One\nmust also measure the effect of the sentence actually imposed.The assessment must\nnot examine a wider set of concerns at this point.Lamer J. indicated, at\np. 1073:The\nother purposes which may be pursued by the imposition of punishment, in particular\nthe deterrence of other potential offenders, are thus not relevant at this\nstage of the inquiry.This does not mean that the judge or the legislator can\nno longer consider general deterrence or other penological purposes that go\nbeyond the particular offender in determining a sentence, but only that the\nresulting sentence must not be grossly disproportionate to what the offender\ndeserves.If a grossly disproportionate sentence is \"prescribed by\nlaw\", then the purpose which it seeks to attain will fall to be assessed\nunder s. 1.Section 12 ensures that individual offenders receive\npunishments that are appropriate, or at least not grossly disproportionate, to\ntheir particular circumstances, while s. 1 permits this right to be\noverridden to achieve some important societal objective.Although not in\nthemselves decisive to a determination of gross disproportionality, other\nfactors which may legitimately inform an assessment are whether the punishment\nis necessary to achieve a valid penal purpose, whether it is founded on\nrecognized sentencing principles, whether there exist valid alternatives to the\npunishment imposed, and to some extent whether a comparison with punishments\nimposed for other crimes in the same jurisdiction reveals great disproportion.An arbitrarily imposed sentence does not necessarily result in gross\ndisproportionality and does not necessarily violate s. 12.Lamer J. held\nthat arbitrariness is \"a minimal factor in the determination of whether a\npunishment or treatment is cruel and unusual\" (at p. 1076), because\ns. 9 and s. 15 of the Charter are the provisions most suitably\ntailored to protect against it, and because s. 12 is concerned primarily\nwith the effect of a punishment (at p. 1075).The challenged\nprovision of the Narcotic Control Act was held to infringe s. 12\nbecause it was, at p. 1078:...\ninevitable that, in some cases, a verdict of guilt will lead to the imposition\nof a term of imprisonment which will be grossly disproportionate.This\nis what offends s. 12, the certainty, not just the potential.As will be seen below, this\nformulation does not envision that any or all imaginable commissions of the\noffence in which the punishment would be grossly disproportionate to the\nwrongdoing warrant a finding of infringement of s. 12.The foregoing\nelements govern application of the test of gross disproportionality under\ns. 12 of the Charter.It is not a simple test.It requires that\nmultiple factors be carefully examined and weighed against each other, although\neach of the subordinate factors listed by Lamer J. in Smith need not be\nconsidered in every case.They are guidelines which, although not\ndeterminative in themselves, help to assess whether the punishment is grossly\ndisproportionate (Smith, at p. 1074).Moreover, it is\nclear from both Smith and Lyons, supra, that the test is\nnot one which is quick to invalidate sentences crafted by legislators.The\nmeans and purposes of legislative bodies are not to be easily upset in a\nchallenge under s. 12.In Smith, the Court explained, per\nLamer J., at pp. 1077 and 1072:A\nminimum mandatory term of imprisonment is obviously not in and of itself cruel\nand unusual.The legislature may, in my view, provide for a compulsory term of\nimprisonment upon conviction for certain offences without infringing rights\nprotected by s. 12 of the Charter..\n. .We\nshould be careful not to stigmatize every disproportionate or excessive\nsentence as being a constitutional violation, and should leave to the usual\nsentencing appeal process the task of reviewing the fitness of a sentence.Section 12\nwill only be infringed where the sentence is so unfit having regard to the\noffence and the offender as to be grossly disproportionate.This principle was\nconfirmed by La Forest J., on behalf of the unanimous Court in Lyons, supra,\nat pp. 344-45:The\nword \"grossly\", it seems to me, reflects this Court's concern not to\nhold Parliament to a standard so exacting, at least in the context of\ns. 12, as to require punishments to be perfectly suited to accommodate the\nmoral nuances of every crime and every offender.On behalf of this\nCourt, Lamer C.J. again affirmed this approach in Luxton, supra,\ninvolving a s. 12 challenge to a section of the Criminal Code\ncreating a 15-year increase in minimum parole eligibility for those convicted\nof murder during unlawful confinement.In rejecting the challenge, Lamer C.J.\ncited a passage from R. v. Guiller (1986), 48 C.R. (3d) 226 (Ont.\nDist. Ct.), which he had previously quoted in Smith, and which reads, at\np. 725:It\nis not for the court to pass on the wisdom of Parliament with respect to the\ngravity of various offences and the range of penalties which may be imposed\nupon those found guilty of committing the offences.Parliament has broad\ndiscretion in proscribing conduct as criminal and in determining proper punishment.While the final judgment as to whether a punishment exceeds constitutional\nlimits set by the Charter is properly a judicial function, the court\nshould be reluctant to interfere with the considered views of Parliament and\nthen only in the clearest cases....This message\napplies equally to the considered views of a provincial legislature for there\nis no material difference, from the perspective of Charter scrutiny\nunder s. 12, between the acts of Parliament and the acts of a provincial\nlegislative assembly.As well, since the minimum sentence prescribed by\ns. 88(1)(c) is the serious sanction of imprisonment, it is not significant\nthat s. 88 creates an offence in a provincial statute and not an offence\nin the Criminal Code.Further support for\nthe principle that s. 12 will not easily be infringed is contained in the\nrecent decision of this Court in Steele v. Mountain Institution, 1990 CanLII 50 (SCC), [1990]\n2 S.C.R. 1385, per Cory J.The Court stated, at p. 1417:It\nwill only be on rare and unique occasions that a court will find a sentence so\ngrossly disproportionate that it violates the provisions of s. 12 of the Charter.The test for determining whether a sentence is disproportionately long is very\nproperly stringent and demanding.A lesser test would tend to trivialize the Charter.The deference to\nlegislated sentences signalled by these passages is especially comprehensible\nwhen one considers the broad and varied purposes of penal sanctions.In Lyons,\nsupra, La Forest J. articulated the common view that while sentences are\npartly punitive in nature, they are mainly imposed for the protection of the\npublic.This view accords with the purpose of the criminal law in general and\nof sentencing in particular.He stated, at p. 329:In a\nrational system of sentencing, the respective importance of prevention,\ndeterrence, retribution and rehabilitation will vary according to the nature of\nthe crime and the circumstances of the offender.This\nacknowledgement that sanctions serve numerous purposes underscores the\nlegitimacy of a legislative concern that sentences be geared in significant\npart to the continued welfare of the public through deterrent and protective\naspects of a punishment.This perspective is explicitly affirmed in R. v.\nLuxton, supra, per Lamer C.J., at p. 721.Thus, while\nthe multiple factors which constitute the Smith test are aimed primarily\nat ensuring that individuals not be subjected to grossly disproportionate\npunishment, it is also supported by a concern to uphold other legitimate values\nwhich justify penal sanctions.These values unavoidably play a role in the\nbalancing of elements in a s. 12 analysis.Applying These Elements of the Smith\nTest to the Facts on AppealReconciling \"Particular\nCircumstances and Personal Characteristics\" with the Need for General\nAssessment of the Validity of Challenged LegislationSmith makes it plain that gross\ndisproportionality must be determined by paying close attention both to the\nparticular situation in which the offence occurred and to the personal traits\nof the offender, though it clearly does not go as far as a complete\nindividualization of sentencing, which might put into question the\nconstitutional validity of mandatory minimum sentences generally.Moreover,\nwhere the constitutional validity of a statutory provision is at stake, and not\nmerely the justice of a particular sentence imposed by a judge at trial, it\nwill often be necessary to go beyond the specific facts of the appeal, to\nassess the proportionality of the sentence prescribed by statute.Thus if it\nwere determined that the minimum sentence as applied to Willy Goltz in the case\non appeal was not grossly disproportionate to the wrongdoing in the unique\ncircumstances of the case, it would not follow that s. 88(1)(c) of the Motor\nVehicle Act, as a piece of general legislation applicable to all motorists\nin British Columbia, complies with the strictures of s. 12 of the Charter.But this raises a question:how does the test in Smith reconcile a\nconcern for the particular circumstances of the offence with a necessarily more\ngeneral assessment of the challenged sentencing provision as a whole?The question is not\ngreeted by an immediate or obvious answer.The jurisprudence to date exhibits significant\nconfusion about the use of hypothetical examples which may readily demonstrate\nthat in some imaginable circumstances a minimum penalty might result in a\npunishment whose effects are grossly or excessively disproportionate to the\nparticular wrongdoing in a given case.The Two Aspects of an Analysis of the\nApplication of s. 12The Court in Smith\nemployed a hypothetical example which illustrated the potential unfairness of\nthe minimum penalty of seven years' imprisonment for importing narcotics under\ns. 5(1) of the Narcotic Control Act.It painted a picture of a\ntourist returning to Canada from another country with one marijuana cigarette,\nand contrasted this \"small offender\" with a serious hard drug dealer\nconvicted of importing a large quantity of heroin (at pp. 1056 and 1078).It held that the challenged sentence would be grossly disproportionate to the\nappropriate sentence in the case of that imaginary small offender.Thus,\nirrespective of the possible appropriateness of a seven-year prison term for\nthe actual offender in Smith -- a 27-year-old with two previous\nconvictions, caught returning from Bolivia in possession of cocaine worth more\nthan $100,000 on the street, and who had pleaded guilty to the charge -- the\nprovision cast too wide a net.It was invalid because its potential effects\nwere so excessive as to outrage decency.In this appeal\nalso, the British Columbia Court of Appeal turned its mind, in an abstract\nfashion, to hypothetical circumstances before deciding that s. 88(1)(c) of\nthe Act is invalid under s. 12.Although I am of the view that the\napproach of the Court of Appeal was in some respects mistaken, nonetheless it\nwas appropriate for the Court of Appeal to contemplate hypothetical\ncircumstances.There are two\naspects to the analysis of invalidity under s. 12.One aspect involves\nthe assessment of the challenged penalty or sanction from the perspective of\nthe person actually subjected to it, balancing the gravity of the offence in\nitself with the particular circumstances of the offence and the personal\ncharacteristics of the offender.If it is concluded that the challenged\nprovision provides for and would actually impose on the offender a sanction so\nexcessive or grossly disproportionate as to outrage decency in those real and\nparticular circumstances, then it will amount to a prima facie violation\nof s. 12 and will be examined for justifiability under s. 1 of the Charter.There may be no need to examine hypothetical situations or imaginary\noffenders.This was not the case in Smith, and for that reason the\nCourt was obliged to examine other reasonably imaginable circumstances in which\nthe challenged law might violate s. 12.If the particular\nfacts of the case do not warrant a finding of gross disproportionality, there\nmay remain another aspect to be examined, namely a Charter challenge or\nconstitutional question as to the validity of a statutory provision on grounds\nof gross disproportionality as evidenced in reasonable hypothetical\ncircumstances, as opposed to far-fetched or marginally imaginable cases.(See generally C. Robertson, \"The Judicial Search for Appropriate\nRemedies Under the Charter: The Examples of Overbreadth and Vagueness\" in\nR. Sharpe, Charter Litigation (1987).)The section 12\nanalysis must now be undertaken as to both aspects.In the\n\"particularized\" section of analysis, the considerations of gravity\nof the offence, the particular circumstances of the case, the personal\ncharacteristics of the offender, and the effects of the sentence must be\nexamined in light of the facts of the instant appeal.First Aspect:Applying the Smith Test\nto the Actual Offender(i)Gravity of\nthe OffenceAn order of\nprohibition made under s. 86(1)(a)(ii) of the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act is\naimed in large measure at safeguarding the health and lives of citizens using\nthe highways of a province.This aim is directly reflected in\ns. 86(1)(a)(ii) of the Act which specifies two principal conditions which\nmust be satisfied before the Superintendent may use his authority to prohibit a\nperson from driving.The first is that the prohibited individual must have\nbuilt up an \"unsatisfactory driving record\".The second is that the\nprohibition be \"in the public interest\".Only bad drivers\nwith an unsatisfactory driving record are prohibited under s. 86(1)(a)(ii)\nof the Act because it is especially those drivers who are dangerous to innocent\ncitizens using the roads in a responsible manner.As the Crown argued, the\npurpose of s. 88(1)(c) is straightforward.It is:\"to keep proven\nbad drivers off the road.By general and specific deterrence, it discourages a\nperson from driving while prohibited and thus promotes safety generally on the\nhighways.\"The administrative\nscheme for the prohibition of bad drivers and imposition of mandatory minimum\nsentences was enacted as a consequence of the extensive study by the Motor\nVehicle Task Force.It had found that the more penalty points a driver had as\na result of driving infractions, the more likely it was that the individual would\nnot be a responsible, safe driver.The Act's emphasis\non the promotion of responsible driving and penalizing of irresponsible driving\nis further reflected in the requirement in the offence that a person knowingly\ndrive while prohibited.This is expressly provided by s. 88(1) which\nreads:\"A person who drives a motor vehicle on a highway or industrial\nroad knowing that (a) he is prohibited from driving a motor\nvehicle ... commits an offence\" (emphasis added).The section has been\ninterpreted accordingly (R. v. Alston (1985), 36 M.V.R. 67 (B.C.C.A.)).A driver who drove while prohibited from driving, yet who was unaware of the\nprohibition, is not as irresponsible as the person who contemptuously drives\nwhile knowing that he is prohibited from doing so.In that respect, it is a\ngraver offence knowingly to drive while prohibited than would be an offence of\ndriving while unaware of a prohibition.Additionally,\nbecause the offence is difficult to detect -- since a police officer will not\nknow a driver has been prohibited until that driver is stopped and questioned\n-- there is a great temptation on the part of many prohibited drivers to commit\nthe offence.Consequently a legislature may rationally conclude that for the\npurpose of deterrence a serious penalty must attach to it.In step with the\nCourt of Appeal, the respondent argued that a distinction must be made between\nthe offence of driving while prohibited and the infractions giving rise to it.He asserts that the gravity of the infractions cannot contribute to the gravity\nof the s. 88(1) offence since they are separate offences with separate\nsentences.The respondent argued further that the purpose of s. 88(1)(c)\nis not to keep bad drivers off the road but to punish those individuals who,\nhaving lost their driving privileges, simply decide to drive.With respect, I\nmust disagree with such reasoning.The purpose and\neffect of the seven-day minimum sentence cannot reasonably be understood\nwithout reference to the underlying traffic rule infractions or Criminal\nCode offences which will have been committed by a person convicted under\ns. 86(1)(a)(ii).The record of those infractions is the principal\njustification for punishment and proof of the threat to public safety by the\ncontinued driving of the prohibited driver.While it is possible in logic to\ndraw a line between the offence of knowingly driving while prohibited simpliciter\nand the driving offences upon which that offence is grounded, common sense and\nthe purposes of the legislative scheme do not permit the distinction.Assessing the gravity of the offence of knowingly driving while prohibited,\nwithout considering the reasons for the prohibition, would be mere abstraction;\nan assessment in a vacuum.To analyze s. 88(1)(c) without considering the\nconduct it is dependent on for its justification would be like attempting to\nunderstand a provision stating \"X is subject to the foregoing definition\nin subsection (1)\" without first examining subsection (1).The\nmeaning of \"X\" can only be gathered when one knows what precedes it.Evidence was\nintroduced at trial which showed that a small number of bad drivers are\ninvolved with a disproportionate number of traffic‑related accidents\noverall.One estimate adduced by counsel for the Crown claimed that\nfive percent of the drivers in British Columbia are involved in 44 percent\nof the reported accidents.As the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles noted in\nhis 1987 Report:In\nBritish Columbia, traffic accidents and traffic law violations represent the\nsingle largest financial burden on the citizens and government of this\nProvince....The cost in human terms cannot be measured.Motor\nvehicle accidents have been increasing steadily since 1984, with 1987 figures\nthe highest recorded since 1981.Last year in British Columbia a total of 622\npersons were killed in motor vehicle accidents and 41,291 people were injured.This translates to an average of 113 persons injured each day, and one person\nkilled every 14 hours.The importance of\nseriously punishing bad drivers who, in open contempt of the law and in\ncontravention of a direct order by the Government, choose to drive while\nprohibited has already been noted in a decision of this Court.In Re B.C.\nMotor Vehicle Act, 1985 CanLII 81 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, Lamer J. (as he then was) on behalf\nof the majority wrote, at p. 521:I\ndo not take issue with the fact that it is highly desirable that \"bad\ndrivers\" be kept off the road.I do not take issue either with the\ndesirability of punishing severely bad drivers who are in contempt of\nprohibitions against driving.Although these\ncomments were made in the course of a s. 1 analysis, in a challenge to an\nabsolute liability offence attracting a mandatory minimum sentence, and are\ntherefore not directly pertinent when considering the gravity of the offence\nunder s. 12, nevertheless the statement is an acknowledgement that the\noffence of driving while prohibited for having a record of bad driving is very\nserious and one which may warrant severe punishment.To that extent, it\nsupports the case for the Crown.The gravity of the\noffence of driving while prohibited is made more obvious upon review of the\nAct's procedural safeguards.One's understanding of the seriousness of the\noffence is advanced by examining the Superintendent's sound administrative\nsystem which identifies bad drivers, for its regulatory safeguards ensure that\nonly bad drivers will be prohibited from driving under s. 88(1)(a) in application\nto s. 86(1)(a)(ii) of the Act.In the first place,\nthe Motor Vehicle Act provides for a penalty point system which\ncalculates accumulating demerits, ranging from two to ten points depending on\nthe severity of the offence.At various levels of accumulated points, the\nSuperintendent is notified.The Superintendent then takes measures to issue a\nletter of warning to a driver, indicating that if he or she continues to\naccumulate penalty points the Superintendent may take remedial steps.Once a driver\naccumulates 15 penalty points, the Superintendent is again alerted and he\nwill then decide to either place the driver on probation, send a notice of\nintent to prohibit which gives the driver 21 days to show why his or her\nlicence should not be suspended, or actually issue a notice of prohibition.If the\nSuperintendent ultimately sends a notice of prohibition, it is his practice to\ninvite the person to make submissions in writing as to why the prohibition\norder should be cancelled or shortened in duration and to indicate that the\nSuperintendent will review the person's case if such submissions are received.In the instant appeal, the respondent was sent such a letter.The letter also\nadvises the driver of his or her right to appeal the Superintendent's final\ndecision to a judge of the County Court, under s. 87 of the Act, and\nfurther notifies the driver of the minimum penalty imposed upon a conviction of\ndriving while prohibited.If a driver disputes the accuracy of the driving\nrecord, the Superintendent's practice is to hold the prohibition in abeyance\nwhile determining whether an error was made in the calculation of points.Of\ncourse, it is also open to the driver to dispute the merits of a traffic rule\ninfraction at the time of the alleged infraction.Finally, in exercising his\nauthority to prohibit a person from driving in the public interest, he must at\nall times exercise it in accordance with the principles of natural justice (Hundal\nv. Superintendent of Motor Vehicles (1985), 1985 CanLII 772 (BC CA), 64 B.C.L.R. 273 (C.A.), per\nNemetz, C.J.B.C., at pp. 275-76, Motor Vehicle Act Regulations,\nDivision 28).While, as Smith\nindicates, the test of gross disproportionality is not dependent on procedural\nsafeguards built into an offence, nonetheless a review of these procedures in\nthe instant appeal markedly reveals that the offence is not trivial or\narbitrary.On the contrary, the mandatory minimum sentence contained in\ns. 88(1)(c) and applicable to s. 86(1)(a)(ii) is based squarely on a\nlegislative concern to isolate bad drivers for the better protection of the\npublic.Most importantly, it demonstrates that a person who has been given\nthis panoply of safeguards against wrongful or inappropriate prohibition, yet\nknowingly violates the notice in contempt of the public interest and the\nsanction which seeks to protect it, commits a graver offence than a person who\nviolated the prohibition unwittingly and who had not been given this range of\nintermediate opportunities to mend his ways, to inquire into the reasons for\nthe prohibition, and to appeal the Superintendent's decision.The consequences of\na prohibition will, of course, be known to both the superintendent and the judge\non the appeal.This provides a reasonable assurance that the prohibition will\nnot be imposed for a trivial infraction.To posit that a prohibition can occur\nfor a trifling reason is to assume failure of the system.There is no evidence\nof this having occurred and it is not suggested that it occurred in this case.In partial summary,\nit must be said that commission of the offence specified by\ns. 86(1)(a)(ii) and s. 88(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act is\ngrave.It may involve a risk to the lives and limbs of innocent users of the\nprovince's roads, by persons designated bad drivers by a fair and cautious\nidentification system, who knowingly step outside the law.(ii)The\nParticular Circumstances of the Case, and(iii) The\nPersonal Characteristics of the OffenderHere the particular\ncircumstances of the offence are straightforward.Although the number of\npenalty points which the respondent had accumulated prior to his prohibition\nwas not submitted to the Court, we have seen that the administrative practice\nof the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles in British Columbia is to wait until\nnumerous points have accumulated before ultimately deciding whether, in the\npublic interest, a prohibition is necessary.Counsel for the Crown indicated\nthat there will have been a number of traffic rule violations or several Criminal\nCode convictions demonstrating unsafe driving habits before a notice of\nprohibition is issued.A decision to prohibit will typically be made if a\ndriver has amassed 15 points in a two-year period.That the respondent\nhad demonstrated himself to be an irresponsible or bad driver is not at issue.It appears from the record that he did not take the opportunity to dispute the\naccuracy of the record of penalty points on which his unsatisfactory driving\nwas based.At no point in argument did the respondent take exception to this\nbasic premise.From a strict rule\nof law perspective, it might be preferable that the regulations under the Motor\nVehicle Act were specified in a type of hierarchical code in which the\nexact total of penalty points derived from various combinations of traffic or\ndriving offences would trigger prohibition.Such a code would remove\ndiscretion from the decision.Yet that would lose the advantages of\nflexibility and would result in an unworkable system.In effect, it would\nprevent the Motor Vehicle Branch from considering the unique mix of bad driving\nelements in a person's particular driving record.The regulations\nunder the Act list 148 different forms of traffic law breaches and Criminal\nCode offences to which various penalty points attach.They range from\n\"driving over newly painted lines\" (two penalty points) to\n\"causing death by criminal negligence\" (10 penalty points).The\nrange of offences between these examples is overwhelming.It would be\nirrational and practically impossible to attempt to establish mandatory\nthresholds for each of the astronomical number of combinations of offences\nwhich might trigger prohibition.We have seen that in forming an opinion about\nwhether prohibition would be in the public interest, the practice of the\nSuperintendent and the Motor Vehicle Branch is to permit a number of traffic\nrule violations and Criminal Code offences to accumulate before that\ndecision is made and a prohibition notice issued.That administrative\npractice, performed in accordance with the principles of natural justice, is\nboth desirable and reasonable.In any event,\nhaving been prohibited from driving, the respondent knowingly and\ncontemptuously violated the prohibition.Indeed, it was alleged by the\napprehending R.C.M.P. officer that the respondent was speeding.That belief\ncaused the respondent to be pulled over on the highway.The court was given no\nreason to believe that the respondent was responding to an emergency or was in\nany way urgently required to drive his car on the day in question.Nor was\nthere any submission to the court as to any relevant personal characteristic of\nthe respondent that would justify a mitigated or lesser sentence than the mandatory\nminimum.It is clear that these factors provide no counterweight to offset the\ngravity of the offence which the respondent committed.The respondent is also\nunable to use the \"effects of the sentence\" in aid of his position.(iv)Effect of\nthe SentenceSmith states that the effect of the\nsentence must also be measured for gross disproportionality.The effect of the\nsentence is \"often a composite of many factors and is not limited to the\nquantum or duration of the sentence but includes its nature and the conditions\nunder which it is applied\" (p. 1073).Smith indicated, by way\nof illustration, that 20 years for a first offence against property would be\ngrossly disproportionate and would infringe s. 12.Here the effect of\nthe sentence is different in kind from both the preceding example and from the\nseven‑year sentence challenged in Smith.Seven days in prison for\nknowingly driving while prohibited, due to bad driving, is a far cry from seven\nyears in prison for importing one marijuana cigarette or 20 years for\ncommitting a property-related offence.This difference is made still clearer\nwhen the seven‑day sentence is examined in full context.As the intervener\nthe Attorney General for Ontario submitted in written argument, the effect of\nthe seven‑day sentence is lighter than might first appear, since a court\ncould fashion a sentence under s. 88(1)(c) whereby it would be fully served in\njust a few weekends.Indeed in this case the sentence was to be served\nintermittently on consecutive three‑day weekends, in order that the\nrespondent could continue to work without disruption.In British Columbia,\nsentences of imprisonment may be limited by earned remission (Correction Act,\nR.S.B.C. 1979, c. 70, s. 18).The law would permit a seven‑day sentence\nto be served in as little as five days.If the sentence poses a true hardship,\nan imprisoned offender may under certain conditions be temporarily released for\nhumanitarian, medical, or educational reasons (Offence Act, R.S.B.C.\n1979, c. 305, ss. 77, 122; Correction Act, ss. 1, 15, 16, 18, 19 and\n47).I think it is plain\nthat the effects of the sentence cannot reasonably be said to outrage\nstandards of decency or be seen as grossly disproportionate to the wrongdoing.They do not amount to cruel or unusual treatment under s. 12 in the\npresent case.Summary on First\nAspectIn light of the\nforegoing considerations, I conclude that in relation to the particular offence\nand the personal situation of the respondent, the challenged provision of the Motor\nVehicle Act does not infringe s. 12 of the Charter.It is therefore\nunnecessary at this point to examine any other factors listed by Lamer J.\nin Smith.However, whether s. 88(1)(c) would violate s. 12 in\nother circumstances which merit the concern of this Court must also be\nconsidered.A constitutional question remains to be answered.Thus, a brief\nreview of the challenged sentencing provision, based on reasonable hypothetical\ncircumstances, must be performed, to determine if it is likely that the general\napplication of the offence would result in the imposition of a grossly\ndisproportionate sentence amounting to cruel and unusual punishment.Second Aspect:Assessing\ns. 88(1)(c) Generally, Under Reasonable Hypothetical CircumstancesA reasonable\nhypothetical example is one which is not far-fetched or only marginally\nimaginable as a live possibility.While the Court is unavoidably required to\nconsider factual patterns other than that presented by the respondent's case,\nthis is not a licence to invalidate statutes on the basis of remote or extreme\nexamples.Laws typically aim to govern a particular field generally, so that\nthey apply to a range of persons and circumstances.It is true that this Court\nhas been vigilant, wherever possible, to ensure that a proper factual\nfoundation exists before measuring legislation against the Charter (Danson\nv. Ontario (Attorney General), 1990 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1086, at p. 1099, and MacKay\nv. Manitoba, 1989 CanLII 26 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357, at pp. 361-62).Yet it has been noted\nabove that s. 12 jurisprudence does not contemplate a standard of review\nin which that kind of factual foundation is available in every instance.The\napplicable standard must focus on imaginable circumstances which could commonly\narise in day-to-day life.The particular\nfacts of the instant appeal provide an important benchmark for what is a\nreasonable example in the context of s. 86(1)(a)(ii) of the Act.This is\nbecause they represent one real application of the challenged statutory\nprovision.A finding of absence of Charter infringement on the sole\nbasis of these particular facts therefore lends support to a conclusion that\nthe challenged legislation is valid under s. 12.In this appeal, this\nindication is particularly significant because the administrative guidelines\nand internal review system which screen out genuinely bad drivers ensure that\nresponsible drivers will not be prohibited, and because the facts of this\nappeal are highly representative of commonly imaginable instances of the\noffence.The regulatory\nsystem of penalty points and internal reviews guarantees that it will be\nexceptionally rare that a so‑called \"small offender\" of the\nkind hypothesized in Smith will ever be subjected to the minimum penalty\nin s. 88(1)(c).This feature of the Motor Vehicle Act and its\nRegulations distinguishes the challenged legislation from that in Smith\nwhere a truly wide net was cast because of the multiple ways in which the\noffence of importing narcotics could be committed.In Smith, one could\nforesee truly \"small offenders\" being subjected to the harsh minimum\npenalty.Here that is not so.If the other\noffences giving rise to prohibitions under s. 88(1)(a) had not been\nseverable, s. 88(1) would admittedly cast a wider and potentially more\nsuspect net, with a greater chance that a reasonably imaginable situation could\narise in which punishment of seven days' imprisonment would be unduly excessive\ngiven the gravity of the offence.Yet in this appeal the only aspect of\ns. 88(1)(c) being reviewed is that which relates to bad drivers covered by\ns. 86(1)(a)(ii) and s. 88(1)(a) of the Act.The threshold for\ncommission of the offence is high.One must build up an unsatisfactory driving\nrecord.The Superintendent must conclude that further driving is against the\npublic interest.One's avenues of internal review and appeal must have been\nexhausted.And one must know that one has been prohibited from driving,\nyet drive anyway, in defiance of that prohibition.Even at that, the sentence\nis only seven days, a punishment with very different dimensions than the\nsentence of seven years witnessed in the Smith case.Finally, even if\nthe careful internal review process at the Motor Vehicle Branch were to go\nawry, the County Court on an appeal under s. 87 could set the prohibition\naside if an error in the calculation of points had been made, or if the court\nthought the person's driving record was satisfactory or that the public interest\ndid not call for a prohibition.As to the\nrepresentative nature of the particular facts of the case on appeal, we are\npresented with an adult driver who had accumulated numerous penalty points, was\nprohibited from driving, knowingly disobeyed the prohibition seemingly for no\nreason other than convenience, and was caught on the highway when he appeared\nto a police officer to be speeding.There are no unusual circumstances to\nmuddy the waters.It is a typical situation for this offence.To that extent,\nthe case is a useful indicator that, in reasonably imaginable circumstances,\nthe minimum sentence will not be grossly disproportionate to the wrongdoing.There remains to be\nexamined whether there are reasonable hypothetical circumstances where the minimum\nsentence would be grossly disproportionate.The Court of Appeal dealt with the\nissue as follows (at p. 172):The\nfact is that there are an unlimited number of different circumstances under\nwhich the offence of driving while prohibited can be committed.It is also\napparent that the different circumstances personal to the offender will be as\nnumerous and as varied as the number of offenders themselves.Those facts,\ntogether with a modest amount of human experience, lead to the conclusion that\ninevitably there will be cases where a mandatory minimum sentence of seven\ndays' imprisonment, plus a fine of $300, will be so grossly disproportionate to\nwhat would otherwise have been appropriate that to impose such a sentence will\nclearly offend against s. 12 of the Charter.It would appear\nthat the Court of Appeal was able to draw this conclusion by divorcing the\noffence of driving while prohibited from the various infractions which led up\nto the prohibition.It is that which resulted in its accordinginsufficient\nweight to the gravity of the offence and to the relatively high threshold for\ncommission of the offence.Consequently, it could assume without more that a\n\"small\" or \"best offender\" could be conjured up to support\na finding of gross disproportionality.In my view, this distinction does not\nreflect reality and should not be made.Furthermore, having\nlittle in the judgment of the Court of Appeal to rely upon,the respondent\nalso failed to discharge on his own the burden of showing gross\ndisproportionality.He argued that from among ss. 25, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 94\nand 214 of the Act, certain provisions contemplate suspensions or prohibitions\nfor relatively minor offences, such as failure to pay for a licensing\nexamination (s. 85), or failure to reimburse the Insurance Corporation of\nBritish Columbia (I.C.B.C.) for money paid on a claim (s. 83(3)), which\noffences are not sufficiently grave to justify a minimum sentence of seven days'\nimprisonment.The respondent hypothesized that a single parent, suspended for\nfailure to repay the I.C.B.C., who was required to drive a seriously ill child\nto the hospital, would receive a grossly disproportionate punishment at the\nhands of s. 88(1)(c) if convicted of driving while suspended and sentenced\nto seven days in prison.But whether or not\nthat particular example demonstrates gross disproportionality is not relevant\nto this appeal.It does not pertain to prohibitions under\ns. 86(1)(a)(ii) in tandem with s. 88(1)(a) of the Act.The\nrespondent's responsibility was to marshal a reasonable example pertaining to\nthe precise provision being challenged.That he did not do.Even if the\nrespondent had submitted a relevant example, it is doubtful that it would have\novercome the strong indication of validity arising from the first,\nparticularized step of s. 12 analysis.Moreover, even if a \"best\noffender\" type of example were submitted and -- against probability -- it\nwere accepted as being a reasonable hypothetical case, it is not clear that the\nrespondent could make a successful claim of gross disproportion.For instance, one\ncan imagine an elderly person, perhaps a grandfather, prohibited from driving\nfor a sizeable accumulation of penalty points related to the infraction of\n\"slow driving\", contrary to s. 150(1) of the Act.If that\nperson was required by medical emergency, no other means of transportation\nbeing available, to drive his grandson from a remote fishing hut beside a lake\nto a hospital in a nearby town, yet did so knowing he was prohibited from\ndriving, he could be charged with violating s. 88 and would be subject to\nthe minimum sentence of seven days in prison, even if it was his first\nconviction for such an offence.Most reasonable persons would likely conceive\nthat punishment as grossly disproportionate to the wrongdoing.But this surely\ndoes not mean s. 88 is constitutionally invalid in terms of s. 12.As\nsuggested by La Forest J. in Lyons, supra, it simply is\nnot necessary that legislated punishments be \"perfectly suited to\naccommodate the moral nuances of every crime and every offender\"\n(p. 345).Such a case would\ngive rise to the common law defence of necessity recognized by this Court in Perka\nv. The Queen, 1984 CanLII 23 (SCC), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232.The doctrine exists as an excusing\ndefence, operating in very limited circumstances, when conduct that would\notherwise be illegal and sanctionable is excused and made unsanctionable\nbecause it is properly seen as the result of a \"morally involuntary\" decision,\nto do an act which in the eyes of society is thought to have positive social\nvalue outweighing the detrimental effect of the contravention.It only applies\nin circumstances of imminent risk where the action was taken to avoid a direct\nand immediate peril, and where there are no reasonable legal alternatives to\nthe conduct pursued (Perka, supra, at p. 259).It seems\nvirtually certain that a jury of peers would judge the actions of the\nprohibited driver in the foregoing example as meeting the requirements of this\ndefence.In that case, the punishment meted out by s. 88(1)(c) would not\nbe imposed.Therefore a grossly disproportionate sentence would not arise.On the second\naspect of the s. 12 analysis, the onus to demonstrate a reasonable\nhypothetical circumstance in which enforcement of the statute would violate\ns. 12 for imposing excessive or grossly disproportionate punishment\nremains with the party challenging the provision's validity.In the instant\nappeal, that onus was not discharged.Consequently, the challenge based on the\nsecond and hypothetical limb of the s. 12 inquiry must also fail.SummaryThere is no basis\nfor the conclusion that s. 88(1)(c), applied in a severed fashion in\nrespect of s. 88(1)(a) and s. 86(1)(a)(ii) of the Act, infringes\ns. 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.The\nparticular factual circumstances of the instant appeal do not warrant such a\ndetermination, nor do reasonable hypothetical circumstances.The high\nthreshold of gross disproportionality established in Smith and affirmed\nin Lyons, Luxton and Mountain Institution has not been\ncrossed.The pertinent provisions of the provincial law do not outrage\nstandards of decency.On the contrary, they promote valid and important social\nobjectives through conventional forms of penal sanctions.Accordingly, there is\nno reason to proceed to the second constitutional question dealing with\ns. 1 of the Charter.Given the\nrelatively minor nature of some of the other infractions listed in\ns. 88(1)(a) and which may result in prohibition triggering the minimum\nsentence in s. 88(1)(c), it may be that this conclusion would not apply to\nthem.Those infractions which are purely administrative in nature, and are not\ndirectly linked to bad driving appear particularly suspect.Yet, their\nconstitutionality is not at stake in this appeal and I will refrain from\ncommenting further.VI -- DispositionThe constitutional\nquestions are therefore answered as follows:1.Does\nthe mandatory minimum sentence of seven days' imprisonment, together with a\nfine of $300, imposed pursuant to s. 88(1)(c) of the Motor Vehicle Act,\nR.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, for a first conviction of driving while prohibited\ninfringe or deny rights and freedoms guaranteed by s. 12 of the Canadian\nCharter of Rights and Freedoms?A.No,\nwhen the prohibition from driving is made pursuant to s. 86(1)(a)(ii) of\nthe Motor Vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288.Other prohibitions from\ndriving, violation of which also triggers the mandatory minimum sentence in\ns. 88(1)(c), are not at issue in this appeal and no answer is required or\ngiven.The second\nconstitutional question does not arise.I would allow the appeal.The\nrespondent's sentence of seven days' imprisonment to be served intermittently\non consecutive three-day weekends must stand.//McLachlin J.//The reasons of\nLamer C.J. and McLachlin and Stevenson JJ. were delivered byMcLachlin\nJ. (dissenting) -- I have\nread the reasons of Justice Gonthier; I respectfully differ from him in his\ncharacterization of the issue on this appeal and the basis of the decision of\nthe Court of Appeal below. I would dismiss the appeal for the basic reasons\nenunciated by Wood J.A. of the British Columbia Court of Appeal.The Reasons of the Court BelowThe decision of the\nCourt below (1990), 1990 CanLII 833 (BC CA), 43 B.C.L.R. (2d) 161, per Wood J.A., may be\nsummarized as follows:1.The\nissue is whether the mandatory minimum sentence required by s. 88(1)(c) of the Motor\nVehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1979, c. 288, violated the guarantee against cruel\nand unusual punishment, in s. 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and\nFreedoms.2.The\ntest for whether a sentencing provision violates s. 12 of the Charter is\nwhether it is grossly disproportionate having regard to the gravity of the\noffence, the personal characteristics of the offender, and the particular\ncircumstances of the case, per this Court's judgment in R. v. Smith,\n1987 CanLII 64 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045.3.Without\ngoing into examples of hypothetical cases, the Court found a certainty that s.\n88(1)(c) would, in some cases, lead to punishment which would be grossly\ndisproportionate, violating s. 12.4.The\nviolations could not be said to infringe the rights protected by s. 12\"as little as possible\" nor would the effects in all circumstances be\nproportional to the objectives to be served; hence, s. 88(1)(c) could not be\nsaved under s. 1.5.Rather\nthan relieving particular respondents from the cruel and unusual aspects of a\nseven-day sentence, retaining s. 88 as is, the better course was to strike down\nthe mandatory minimum punishment, leaving in place a full range of sentences to\nbe employed as needed and as deemed appropriate by the trial judge.Gonthier J., as I\nunderstand his reasons, parts company with the Court of Appeal on propositions\n1 and 3.His conclusions make it unnecessary to consider propositions 2, 4 and\n5.The Issue on the AppealSection 88(1)(c) of\nthe Motor Vehicle Act imposes the mandatory minimum sentence where a\nperson drives knowing that he or she is prohibited from driving a motor vehicle\nunder any one of four sections of the Act -- ss. 84, 85, 86, and 214.The\nCourt of Appeal treated the issue on appeal as the constitutionality of s. 88(1)(c)\nof the Act in all its applications.The question was whether the mandatory\nminimum sentence imposed by this provision for a first conviction of driving\nwhile prohibited for any of the specified reasons infringes the Charter.Gonthier J.'s\nanalysis, by contrast, is restricted to certain prohibitions under s. 86, and\nproceeds as though other prohibitions under s. 86 and ss. 84, 85 and 214 were\nnot referred to in s. 88(1)(a) nor subject to the mandatory sentence provided\nin s. 88(1)(c) of the Act.Gonthier J. concludes that the mandatory minimum\nsentence in relation to selected prohibitions under s. 86 would not infringe\nthe Charter.He goes on to suggest that if other prohibitions referred\nto in s. 88 were considered, the result might well be that the mandatory\nminimum sentence imposed by s. 88(1)(c) would be unconstitutional.In effect,\nGonthier J. holds that one particular application of s. 88(1)(c) does not\nviolate the Charter, while admitting that other applications of the\nsection might infringe the Charter.This difference in\nfocus, as I perceive it, constitutes the fundamental distinction between the\nreasons of Gonthier J. and those of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia.The Court of Appeal looked at s. 88(1)(c) in all its potential applications\nand concluded that some of them would inevitably violate the Charter\nprohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.It therefore ruled s. 88(1)(c)\nunconstitutional.Gonthier J., at p. 000, by contrast, considers s. 88 only in\nrelation \"to the particular form of prohibition to which the respondent\nwas subjected under s. 86(l)(a)(ii)\" -- as he puts it, he confines his\nanalysis to the reference in s. 88(1)(c) to s. 86 and \"severs\" the\nreferences to other types of prohibitions.Having excluded a priori\npotentially offending applications, he finds s. 88(1)(c) constitutional.Attractive as the\nresult may be, I have concluded that an analysis which proceeds by severing out\nfrom the impugned provision applications which might render it unconstitutional\ncannot be sustained.Such an analysis does not, as I see it, address the issue\nposed by the constitutional question before us -- whether s. 88(l)(c), as\nenacted by the legislature in its entirety, is constitutional.It also, as I\nwill argue below, constitutes an abrupt departure from the approach this Court\nhas hitherto taken to assessing legislation under the Charter in general\nand to the guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment in particular.First, an analysis\nwhich proceeds by severing potentially offending parts of s. 88 fails to answer\nthe question posed on this appeal. The first constitutional question asks this\nCourt: \"Does the mandatory minimum sentence of seven days' imprisonment,\ntogether with a fine of $300, imposed pursuant to s. 88(1)(c) of the [Act]...,\nfor a first conviction of driving while prohibited infringe or deny rights and\nfreedoms guaranteed by s. 12...?\"The words \"while prohibited\"\ndo not limit the question to a particular type of prohibition.While this\nCourt is not obliged to answer constitutional questions as stated, the Court\nmust bear in mind that such questions constitute a precise formulation of the\nassistance requested and have usually served as the focus of the analysis and\nargument before the Court.Before the Court, the Attorney General of British\nColumbia sought to limit the Court's review of s. 88(1)(c) to the prohibition\nof the respondent Goltz's driver's licence under s. 86(1)(a)(ii).The\nrespondent, however, insisted that the Court undertake a review of s. 88(1)(c)\nin its entirety, in accordance with the constitutional question before the\nCourt. In argument, respondent's counsel addressed the constitutionality of s.\n88(1)(c)'smandatory minimum sentence as applied to persons prohibited from\ndriving under ss. 84, 85 and 214 of the Motor Vehicle Act, in addition\nto those persons prohibited under s. 86(1)(a)(ii).Seen in this light, the\nbetter course would seem to me to be to answer the constitutional question as\nposed.But even if this\nCourt were willing to address the question in terms narrower than those posed,\nargued and treated by the court below, it could not, in my view, do so without\ndeparting from its own established jurisprudence.Severing the reference in s.\n88 to prohibitions other than selected cases under s. 86 of the Act has an\neffect analogous to reading down the statute, or to use another current term,\napplying the doctrine of constitutional exemption.Section 88, for the\npurposes of this appeal, is read as though it did not contain provisions which\nmay prove unconstitutional. To put it another way, the mandatory sentence\nsection is allowed to stand, but judges are directed that when in the future\nunconstitutional applications of the section arise, the section should be\ndeclared unconstitutional with respect to those applications and not applied.This Court was\ninvited to apply a similar approach in R. v. Seaboyer, 1991 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R.\n577.There the majority of the Court of Appeal, having concluded that s. 276\nof the Criminal Code in some of its applications violated the Charter,\ndeclined to strike the section down on the ground that the appropriate remedy\nwas for the trial judge to decline to apply the section in cases where a\nconstitutional violation would occur.Without deciding that techniques of\nreading down or constitutional exemption may never apply to save legislation,\nthe majority of this Court concluded that those doctrines could not be\nappropriately applied in that case, because, inter alia, the effect\nwould have been tochange the law under consideration significantly and\nsubstantially and would have amounted to delegating to future trial judges the\ntask of determining when the legislation should not be applied.On this\nreasoning, it was observed, no law need be found to offend the Charter.The law is declared valid; it is only some of its applications which are\ninvalid.The same\nconsiderations apply here.To address s. 88 as though it referred only to\nprohibitions under s. 86 is to address a different scheme than that enacted by\nthe legislature.Moreover, while s. 88(1)(c) would be declared\n\"valid\", its constitutional status would remain uncertain, to be\ndetermined according to whether trial judges in future cases saw its application\nas violating the Charter.This runs counter to the fundamental\nprinciple that the law -- particularly laws whose violation can result in\nimprisonment -- should be clear, certain and ascertainable. This Court has\nconsistently advocated a strict and rigorous Charter analysis of\nprovisions which have as their sanction the withdrawal of a person's liberty.To leave determination of criminal and quasi-criminal offences to case-by-case\nadjudication by judges would be to deprive people of knowing in advance what\nthe law is. Only after they are tried will such persons be told whether or not\nthey have broken a valid law. In my view, such an approach should not be\nadopted to offences which may result in imprisonment. The preferable approach\nis to confront squarely the question of the extent to which a law is\ninconsistent with the Charter and hence invalid under s. 52 of the Constitution\nAct, 1982, when it is raised on an appeal such as this.In the case at bar,\nGonthier J.'s restrictive analysis of the provision in issue means that judges,\nwhen confronted with cases arising under portions of s. 88(1)(a) not addressed\nhere, will have to determine on a case-by-case basis whether those applications\nof s. 88(1)(c) infringe the Charter.Ultimately, we will be left with\nan untidy and uncertain combination of judge-made and legislated law.A\nmotorist seeking to know the risks of driving while prohibited will not be able\nto determine his or her position simply by consulting the statute.Upon\nconsulting the statute, the motorist would reasonably conclude that s. 88 is\nvalid, particularly if a judgment exists answering the constitutional question\nhere posed in the negative.But the motorist would be wrong.As Gonthier J.\nnotes, imprisonment for breach of some prohibitions might well offend the Charter,\nrendering the law to that extent invalid.If the motorist concludes that\nmandatory imprisonment for breach of the prohibition in his case offends the Charter\nand decides to drive, the motorist may subsequently be told by a judge that\nthis view of the law was wrong and find himself or herself behind bars.The constitutional\nquestion in this case for sound reasons asks this Court to rule generally on\nthe constitutionality of the punitive regime set up by s. 88 for parties who\nbreach a prohibition from driving, not to defer to future decisions the\ndetermination of the extent to which it is invalid.In my view, that is a wise\nand fair course, given the interest of the public in knowing with some\ncertainty the state of the law on matters which may result in imprisonment.In the past, this\nCourt when asked to determine whether legislation is invalid has analyzed the\nquestion on the basis of all the potential applications of the provision\nin question, and has not \"saved\" the legislation by considering only\nthe particular application on the facts before the Court.Indeed, Gonthier\nJ.'s \"dual aspect analysis\", which requires consideration both of the\nsituation of the particular accused as well as other hypothetical applications,\nimplicitly acknowledges this.Consider the approach adopted by Lamer J. (as he\nthen was) in Smith, at p. 1078:...the\nlaw is such that it is inevitable that, in some cases, a verdict of\nguilt will lead to the imposition of a term of imprisonment which will be\ngrossly disproportionate.[Emphasis added.]Lamer J. did not suggest in Smith\nthat every minimum seven-year sentence handed out for trafficking would offend\nthe Charter.Rather, because some of the sentences rendered\nunder that provision would have been cruel and unusual, the entire section was\nheld to be invalid.The same approach\nshould be adopted with respect to s. 88(1)(c) of the Motor Vehicle Act.\nMany of the mandatory sentences imposed under s. 88 may not be cruel and\nunusual. But if, to borrow the language of Lamer J. in Smith, it is\n\"inevitable that, in some cases, a verdict of guilty will lead to the\nimposition of a term which will be grossly disproportionate\" (p. 1078),\nthe entire subsection must be struck down.In some cases a\nlegislative provision can be saved by reading out an offending condition, for\nexample, the words \"he [the accused] establishes that\"imposing a\nreverse onus: R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc., 1991 CanLII 39 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 154.Removal of the words in such a case does not violate the main thrust of the\nlegislative provision, and it does not have the result of declaring a law\nvalid, even though aspects of it may in fact be invalid, thereby leaving the\nconstitutionality of the law to future case-by-case determination.In conclusion, I\ntake the view that the issue before the Court is whether the mandatory minimum\nsentence under s. 88(1)(c) will \"in some cases\", to borrow the\nlanguage of Smith, be grossly disproportionate and hence violate s. 12\nof the Charter.The section cannot be declared valid on a\n\"severed\" basis, subject to the proviso that some of its severed\napplications may in future cases be revealed as invalid. It follows that the Court\nmust examine not only selected prohibitions and applicable procedures under s.\n86(1)(a) but must consider the entire range of prohibitions encompassed by s.\n86, as well as s. 84 (e.g. permitting prohibition from driving for failure to\npay for a licensing examination); s. 85 (e.g. permitting prohibition from\ndriving for failure to satisfy a final judgment in excess of $400 related to a\nmotor vehicle accident); and s. 214.Violation of the CharterThe Court of Appeal\nconcluded that the minimum sentence of mandatory imprisonment plus a fine of\n$300 violated the s. 12 guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment because\nsome sentences imposed under it would be grossly disproportionate.The question\nis whether the Court was correct in so concluding.Gonthier J. concludes the\nCourt of Appeal erred.Gonthier J. is able\nto come to this conclusion by restricting his analysis to the application of s.\n88(1)(c) to the specific prohibition on the facts and by not considering the\nentire range of prohibitions for which the mandatory minimum sentence of\nimprisonment must be imposed.Sharing, as I do, the Court of Appeal's view\nthat the entire range of prohibitions covered by s. 88(1)(c) must be\nconsidered, I must determine whether the Court was right in concluding that\nsome applications of s. 88(1)(c) would inevitably lead to disproportionate\nsentences which violate s. 12.In the first step\nof the analysis, the Court of Appeal considered the gravity of the offence in\nrelation to the sentences requiring imprisonment and concluded (at p. 170):A\ncomparison of the relative severity of those many offences at law which do not\ncarry a mandatory jail term as punishment for a first conviction with that of\nthe offence here under consideration leads me to the conclusion that there is\nno reason, in principle, why the latter must carry a mandatory minimum\npunishment of seven days' imprisonment.The Court of Appeal\nthen turned to the circumstances of the offence and the personal circumstances\nof the offender.Wood J.A. began by noting that the Court of Appeal was not\nasked to consider \"whether the sentence imposed upon the respondent is\nappropriate in relation to the circumstances of his case\"; the Court was\n\"only to decide whether the statutory requirement that no less a sentence\nbe imposed in all cases is one which violates the constitutional\nguarantee invoked\" (p. 164).On this premise, Wood J.A. addressed these\nissues globally, as relating to the particular circumstances of potential\noffenders affected by the provision.He declined to enter into speculation as\nto a particular hypothetical, relying on Lamer J.'s comment in Smith (at\np. 172):...it\nis not the certainty of a particular case that Lamer J. was concerned with in Smith,\nit was the certainty that, given the multiplicity of situations that might\noccur, a grossly disproportionate sentence was in one or more of them a\ncertainty.He went on to conclude (at p. 172):The\nfact is that there are an unlimited number of different circumstances under\nwhich the offence of driving while prohibited can be committed.It is also\napparent that the different circumstances personal to the offender will be as\nnumerous and as varied as the number of offenders themselves.Those facts,\ntogether with a modest amount of human experience, lead to the conclusion that\ninevitably there will be cases where a mandatory minimum sentence of seven\ndays' imprisonment, plus a fine of $300, will be so grossly disproportionate to\nwhat would otherwise have been appropriate that to impose such a sentence will\nclearly offend against s. 12 of the Charter.I do not share\nGonthier J.'s opinion that Wood J.A.'s analysis is abstract, supported by\nfacile assumptions based on \"small\" or \"best offender\"\nscenarios, and is thus, insufficient to uphold a finding that s. 88(1)(c)\ninfringes s. 12 of the Charter.Should Gonthier J. require further\nhypothetical instances which \"reflect reality\", they can easily be\nsupplied.Consider the example provided by Hogarth Co. Ct. J. at trial (and\ncited by Wood J.A.) of the situation of an \"accused, prohibited from\ndriving, [who] had moved a motor vehicle with a disabled driver a few feet at\nan accident scene on a freeway, to permit other cars backed up for miles to get\nby\" ((1988), 44 C.C.C. (3d) 166, at p. 172).I agree with Hogarth Co. Ct.\nJ. in conclusion that \"a seven-day jail sentence and a $300 fine which\nmight mean loss of employment of long standing and other amenities would be\nridiculous\".Consider also the\ncase of persons driving while prohibited who plead extenuating circumstances\nwhich, while not providing a defence at law (i.e. the common law defence of\nnecessity), should properly be considered in sentencing because they tend to\nreduce the accused's blameworthiness.(In this respect, I note the limited\navailability of the defence of necessity on the test set out by this Court in Perka\nv. The Queen, 1984 CanLII 23 (SCC), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232.)To return to the\ncentral issue, however, I understand the Court of Appeal as simply saying that\nwhen the gravity of the offence is considered together with the potential range\nof situations in which offenders may find themselves, a mandatory minimum\nsentence may prevent the court charged with sentencing from reaching a fair\nresult, and indeed require the judge in some cases to impose a sentence which\nis grossly disproportionate.To put it another way, the mandatory minimum\nsentence required by s. 88(1)(c) deprives the judge of the range of discretion\nwhich is appropriate having regard to the gravity of the offence and the\ncircumstances in which it arises.In short, mandatory minimum sentences must\nbe appropriate having regard to the gravity of the offence and the potential\ncircumstances which may arise.I see no error in that conclusion.Nor do I\nsee any error in referring to \"a modest amount of human experience\".\nThe experience of a judge who has had occasion to pass sentences for different\noffences leaves him with great respect for the infinite variety of circumstances\nwhich may mandate a sentence short of imprisonment for all offences save those\nof the greatest gravity.Gonthier J.\nsuggests that the Court of Appeal was able to reach these conclusions only by\n\"divorcing the offence of driving while prohibited from the various\ninfractions which led up to the prohibition\" (p. 000).With respect, I\nthink this may misconstrue Wood J.A.'s reasoning.Wood J.A. referred to the\nneed to consider the circumstances \"related to the driving which is\nprohibited\" rather than the circumstances leading to the prohibition, only\nafter having stated his primary conclusion, and for the sole purpose of\nrebutting the argument that sentences imposed under s. 88(1)(c) could not be\nfound disproportionate because those convicted of driving while prohibited\nwould not be \"small\" offenders.He concluded (at p. 173):If a\nsentence of seven days is wholly disproportionate in any given case, based on\nthe circumstances of the offence and the personal circumstances of the\noffender, its constitutionality cannot be salvaged on the grounds that it is in\nsome way justified as a form of supplementary punishment for offences of which\nthe offender has already been convicted, and for which he has already been\npunished.Wood J.A.'s point, as I understand it,\nwas simply that it is the offence of driving while prohibited, together with all\ncircumstances relevant to that offence, which must be considered.Therefore the mere fact that the accused has committed previous driving\ninfractions does not save the mandatory sentence imposed by s. 88(1)(c).I conclude that the\nCourt of Appeal properly applied the tests laid down by this Court in Smith\nand correctly concluded that s. 88(1)(c) violated s. 12 of the Charter.I share the view of Wood J.A. below that in some of the cases envisaged by the\nscheme established by ss. 88(1)(a) and (1)(c) of the Motor Vehicle Act,\nthe mandatory minimum sentence of seven days' imprisonment plus a fine would be\nclearly disproportionate and shocking to the Canadian conscience, and hence\nviolate the guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment in s. 12 of the Charter.I also agree with the conclusion of Wood J.A. that s. 88(1)(c) cannot be saved\nunder s. 1 of the Charter because it is overbroad.To quote Wood J.A.\n(at p. 176): \"[the] material does not demonstrate any obvious or probable\nneed for a deterrent which has such an indiscriminate reach.\"Finally, I agree\nwith the Court of Appeal that rather than alleviating the particular offences\nfrom the purview of s. 88(1)(c) on a case-by-case basis, as is required for\nconformity with the Charter, the mandatory minimum sentence in s.\n88(1)(c) should be struck out.As suggested earlier, the certainty required\nfor offences which may lead to imprisonment requires no less.DispositionI would dismiss the\nappeal and remit the matter to the trial court.Appeal allowed, Lamer C.J.\nand McLachlin and Stevenson JJ. dissenting.Solicitor for the\nappellant:The Ministry of the Attorney General, Victoria.Solicitor for the\nrespondent:Kathryn Ford, New Westminster.Solicitor for the\nintervener the Attorney General for Ontario:The Ministry of the Attorney\nGeneral, Toronto.Solicitor for the\nintervener the Attorney General of Manitoba:The Department of Justice,\nWinnipeg."}

Further, s. 718.2(e) provides that “all available sanctions other than imprisonment\nthat are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all\noffenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal\noffenders”.[9]The Ontario Court of Appeal set the\nappropriate range of sentencing for street level trafficking in cocaine to be\nsix months to two years less a day.The court held that cases that involve\nlarger quantity narcotics offences committed during probation should attract\nsentences at the higher end of the range: [R. v. Woolcock, [2002] O.J. No.\n4927, at paras. 8 and 15, (Ont. C.A.)].[10]With the elimination of conditional\nsentences for trafficking in controlled substancessome trial judges have\nimposed suspended sentences: [R. v. McGill, 2016 ONCJ 138 (CanLII), [2016] O.J. No.\n1346, at para. 61, (Ont. C.J.); R. v. Caputi, [2013] O.J. No.\n6447, unreported (Ont. C.J.);R. v. Azeez,\n2014 ONCJ 311 (CanLII), 2014 ONCJ 311 (Ont. C.J.); R. v. Moniz, unreported, 2015\n(Ont. C.J.); and R. v. Duncan, [2016] O.J. No. 25\n(Ont. C.J.)].[11]However, generally in sentencing\noffenders convicted of trafficking in controlled substances, especially with\nthe unavailability of conditional sentences, courts have tended to impose a\ncustodial sentence.One court remarked that it is difficult to find a single\nreported case of a court suspending the sentence of an offender who was\nconvicted of trafficking in Schedule I drugs like cocaine or heroin: [R. v.\nMcGill, 2016 ONCJ 138 (CanLII), [2016] O.J. No. 1346, at para. 61,\n(Ont. C.J.)].[12]In the rare case that a non-custodial\nsuspension of sentence is imposed, the court has relied on the doctrine of\n“exceptional circumstances”.[13]Cases that found exceptional\ncircumstances include cases involving the following mitigating circumstances:\nrehabilitation after arrest [ R. v. Duncan, [2016] O. J. 25\n(Ont. C.J.)]; a guilty plea to\ntrafficking in cocaine [R.\nv. McGill, 2016 ONCJ 138 (CanLII), [2016] O. J. 1346\n(Ont. C.J.)]; a guilty plea to trafficking in MDMA [R. v. Caputi,\n[2013]\nO.J. 6447 (Ont. C.J.); small amounts of drugs, post-conviction\nsobriety and no prior convictions for some of the accused [R. v. Voong, [2015] B.C.J. No. 1335\n(B.C.C.A.)]; no related record, rehabilitation, youthful offender [R. v. Dickey,\n[2015] B.B.J. No. 1465 (B.C.S.C.); affirmed [2016] B.C.J. No.\n615 (B.C.C.A.)]; a guilty plea and rehabilitation[R. v. Carillo, [2014] B.C.J. No.\n873 (B.C.C.A.)]; and a guilty plea, no criminal record, good prospects for\nrehabilitation [R. v. Orr, [2015] B.C.J. No.\n1553 (B.C.P.C.)].[14]The defence relies on the cases that have\nimposed non-custodial suspensions of sentence.In a case I decided recently I\ndenied the defence’s request for a suspended sentence.However, in that case I\ndistinguished it from cases that have found exceptional circumstances.In the\ncase before me, the offender did not have a pro-social life; she was not\nseeking rehabilitation for drug addiction; she had a lengthy criminal record.I imposed a 30-day intermittent sentence and two years’ probation: [R. v.\nIrish, 2016 ONSC 4500 (CanLII) (Ont. S.C.J.)].CONCLUSION[15]Mr. Thevarajah impressed me as a person\nwho truly regretted what he had done.It seems he fell prey in a weak moment\nto the lure of making easy money when he was financially strapped.The rest of\nhis life seemed positive.[16]Mr. Thevarajah has lived with his parents\nin a stable family environment.He is pursuing a post-secondary school\neducation and has been consistently employed.He spoke and wrote to the court\nand offered a sincere apology for his criminal activity.He has made pro-social\nsteps in his life towards his own rehabilitation.However, I think because of\nthe seriousness of his decision at a young age to traffic drugs through social\nmedia and sell them to the public that he can\nbenefit from the supervision of his probation officer during a period of\nprobation.[17]I realize this might be a case calling for a restriction on Mr. Thevarajah’s\nuse of computers, iPads and cellphones since it was by using such devices to\naccess Craigslist that led him to crime.However, I recognize that important\nto Mr. Thevarajah’s rehabilitation is continuing his post-secondary education.His program will most certainly require the use of a computer and the\ninternet.In view of Mr. Thevarajah’s sincere presentation on sentencing, I\ntrust he has learned a hard lesson and will not make the mistake of using his\ndevices for any illegal or improper purposes.[18]Mr. Thevarajah’s parents attended the\nsentencing hearing.It was evident from the distressed expressions on their\nfaces that they were fretful about their son’s wellbeing and future.To\nsupport his son’s progress, the father has secured a job for his son in his\ncatering business.[19]I find this is an appropriate case for a\nsuspended sentence with a one-year period of probation.I believe this\nsentence achieves the objectives of denunciation and deterrence, parity with\nsimilar cases and proportionality of the crime to the sentence.The sentence\nis in keeping with the principle enunciated in s. 718.2(e) which provides that “all available sanctions other\nthan imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered\nfor all offenders”.SENTENCE[20]I will now pronounce sentence.Keerthigan Thevarajah, will you please\nstand?[21]You have been convicted for trafficking in MDMA.You stand to be\nsentenced for that offence.[22]I sentence you to a suspended sentence.[23]I also sentence you to a probationary period of one year on the\nfollowing conditions:(a)You will keep the peace and be of good\nbehaviour.(b)You will appear before the court when\nrequired to do so by the court; and(c)You will notify the court or the\nprobation officer in advance of any change ofname or address, and\npromptly notify the court or the probation officer of any change of employment\nor occupation.(d)You will report to a probation officer\n(i) within four working days, or such longer period as the court directs, after\nthe making of the probation order, and (ii) thereafter, when required by the\nprobation officer and in the manner directed by the probation officer.(e)You\nwill attend for and actively participate in, and to the satisfaction of your\nprobation officer, any assessment, treatment or counselling as required by your\nprobation officer and you will sign whatever consents or releases as may be\nrequired by your probation officer in order to monitor and verify compliance\nwith said assessment, treatment or counselling and you will provide written\nproof of completion of said assessment, treatment or counselling to your\nprobation officer.(f)You will not own, possess or carry any\nweapons as defined by the Criminal Code.(g)You will abstain from the consumption\nof drugs except in accordance with a medical prescription.[24]In addition there shall be the following ancillary orders:(a)A Criminal Code section 109 weapons prohibition for\nlife.(b)A forfeiture of the $200 seized from Mr. Thevarajah.B.A. ALLEN J.Released: November 29, 2016CITATION:\nR. v.

Starting in early July 2013, Loor used a\nforged prescription to obtain 45 patches of fentanyl – 15 at a time – from a\npharmacy in Barrie. He was eventually charged and tried in the Ontario Court of\nJustice.[2]The main issue at trial was identity: was Loor\nthe person who obtained the fentanyl? The evidence of identity was\ncircumstantial as neither of the two pharmacists who dispensed the prescription\ncould identify Loor as the person who came to the pharmacy to get the\nprescription filled. Loor did not testify.[3]In lengthy and thorough reasons the trial judge\nfound Loor guilty of three counts of using a forged document (the prescription)\nand three counts of trafficking in fentanyl. She sentenced him to 6 years in\njail less 18 months credit for pre-sentence custody.[4]Loor appeals both his conviction and his\nsentence. On his conviction appeal he submits that the verdict was unreasonable\nfor two related reasons: the evidence was not sufficient to prove identity\nbeyond a reasonable doubt; and the trial judge could reasonably infer from the\nevidence that another person, even another member of the trafficking ring,\ncould have impersonated Loor, using fake identification. On his sentence\nappeal, Loor submits that six years was excessive, disproportionate to his\nlevel in the trafficking ring hierarchy, and inconsistent with the sentences\nimposed on two of the higher-ups.[5]We did not call on the Crown on the conviction\nappeal and it is dismissed. I would also dismiss the sentence appeal.B.The conviction appeal(a) The fentanyl trafficking ring[6]The head of the trafficking ring, the “kingpin”,\nwas a man named Raymond Goudreau. The two other higher-ups were Grenville\nSinclair and his girlfriend at the time, Julie Baks. Baks was employed as a\nmedical secretary to Dr. Alain Sacksen, who ran a medical clinic in Barrie.\nBaks’ employment was key to the operation of the trafficking ring.[7]Their operation, a rather sophisticated scheme,\nworked as follows. Goudreau would give personal information about an individual\nto Sinclair. The personal information would include the name, date of birth,\nhealth card number, telephone number and address of the individual. Sinclair\nwould give the information to Baks. Baks would use the information to create a\nfake patient file and then would produce a forged prescription for fentanyl\npatches for the individual. After she produced the forged prescription she\nwould delete the patient file. Baks would then give the forged prescriptions to\nSinclair, who in turn would give them to Goudreau. He would provide them to the\nfake patients, who would go to the pharmacies and obtain the fentanyl patches\n(in a couple instances, Sinclair gave the forged prescriptions directly to the\nfake patients). The patches were then given to Sinclair, or to Goudreau, who\ntrafficked them in North Bay, where a patch could be sold for between $400 and\n$450.[8]When the police raided Goudreau’s operation,\nBaks had created 19 fake patient files, of which Loor was one, and had produced\nforged prescriptions for 900 fentanyl patches.[9]The next two sections of this narrative set out\nin summary form the circumstantial evidence supporting the trial judge’s\nfinding of guilt.(b) Loor obtains 45 fentanyl patches[10]In July 2013, Baks opened a computer file for a\nfake patient named Yancy Loor. She inputted Loor’s health card number,\nbirthdate, address and telephone number. Baks then created a prescription for\nLoor for 45 transdermal fentanyl patches at the highest available strength, 100\nmicrograms per hour. Baks forged Dr. Sacksen’s signature on the prescription.\nThe prescription contained the same personal information on Loor as in the\npatient file. After creating the forged prescription, Baks deleted the patient\nfile in Loor’s name.[11]Shortly afterwards, Yancy Loor went to the\nExpress Aid IDA Pharmacy in Barrie and tendered the prescription to one of the\npharmacists, Jamil Rashid. Because Loor had never filled a prescription at the\npharmacy before, Rashid did three things. First, he called Dr. Sacksen’s office\nto verify the prescription. Baks told him that the prescription was correct.\nSecond, as required by provincial legislation, Rashid verified Loor’s identity.\nHe did so by comparing the photo on the health card Loor had produced for\nidentification with the person standing in front of him. Rashid was satisfied\nthat the person at the pharmacy was the same person whose photo was on the\nhealth card. Third, as a further check, Rashid handwrote Loor’s health card\nnumber, which was the same as the number in the patient file at Dr. Sacksen’s\noffice and on the forged prescription.[12]Rashid then dispensed 15 patches to Loor, the\nfirst of three installments, at a cost of $228.93. Rashid did not, however,\nmake a copy of Loor’s health card.[13]On August 1, 2013 a different pharmacist\ndispensed the second installment of 15 patches of fentanyl. She had no\nindependent recollection of doing so but was adamant that when dispensing\nnarcotics her practice was to check identification unless she knew the person,\nand she did not know Loor. The pharmacy’s prescription record showed that 15\npatches were dispensed to a man named Yancy Loor with the identical personal information\nand health card number as on the original prescription.[14]On September 3, 2013 Rashid dispensed the last\ninstallment of 15 fentanyl patches to a person with the same personal\ninformation and health card number as Yancy Loor.(c) Loor is located and arrested[15]When the police arrested Goudreau they obtained his\ncellphones, which contained contact lists. One of Goudreau’s contacts was\n“Yanz” with a telephone number the same as the number on Loor’s deleted patient\nfile at Dr. Sacksen’s office and on the prescription records from the pharmacy.[16]A police officer named Justin Ford called the\nnumber and when a male voice answered he asked “Yancy”? The male responded\n“yeah”. Ford then asked “Yancy Loor”? Again, the male responded “yeah”. Ford\nidentified himself as a police officer from the street crime unit. The male\nsaid he would get his lawyer to call him back. Ford gave the male his police-issued\ncellphone number. A lawyer named Craig Bottomley called Ford on behalf of his\nclient Yancy Loor.[17]Loor was arrested at the Central North\nCorrectional Centre, where he was in custody on another matter. On arrest he\nidentified himself as Yancy Loor, and asked to speak to his lawyer, Craig\nBottomley.[18]From among Loor’s property at the jail, Ford\nfound Loor’s health card, which by this time had expired. The card had the same\nnumber and date of birth as in Dr. Sacksen’s patient file and the IDA Pharmacy\nrecords. In Ford’s lay opinion the photo on the heath card was a photo of Loor.(d) Discussion[19]Because Loor was convicted on circumstantial\nevidence of identity, two legal standards come into play on this appeal: the\nstandard to convict where the evidence of identification is solely or primarily\ncircumstantial; and the standard of appellate review of the reasonableness of a\nverdict based on circumstantial evidence.[20]In recent decisions, the Supreme Court of Canada\nhas emphasised that no particular form of words is required to express the\nstandard for a conviction based on circumstantial evidence. Even ordinary proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt language is acceptable. See for example R. v.\nGriffin, 2009 SCC 28 (CanLII),\n[2009] 2 S.C.R. 42, at para. 33; and R. v. Villaroman, 2016 SCC 33 (CanLII), [2016] 1 S.C.R. 1000, at\nparas. 17-22.[21]But in Villaroman, Cromwell J. favoured\nlanguage that focuses on inference drawing because that language alerts the\ntrier of fact to the danger of coming to an unwarranted or speculative\nconclusion. The standard may thus be expressed as follows: in a case where the\nsole or primary evidence of identification is circumstantial, in order to\nconvict, the trier of fact must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the\nguilt of the accused is the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from\nthe evidence.[22]On appeal, where the Crown’s case at trial\ndepended on circumstantial evidence, to uphold the reasonableness of the\nverdict, an appellate court must be satisfied that the trier of fact acting\njudicially could reasonably be satisfied that the accused’s guilt was the only\nreasonable conclusion available on the totality of the evidence: see Villaroman\nat para. 55. But Cromwell J. also added at para. 71: “[T]hat it is\nfundamentally for the trier of fact to draw the line … that separates\nreasonable doubt from speculation.” An appellate court is justified in\ninterfering only if the trial judge’s conclusion that the evidence excluded any\nreasonable alternative to guilt was itself unreasonable.[23]In the present case, the trial judge was well\naware that the evidence against Loor was entirely circumstantial. She\nrecognized that neither pharmacist could identify Loor as the person who came\nto their pharmacy to get the prescription for 45 fentanyl patches filled. The\npharmacy did not have video surveillance available. And Rashid did not make a\ncopy of the health card presented to him to identify the person asking to have\nthe prescription filled.[24]The trial judge also understood the standard for\nconvicting on the basis of circumstantial evidence of identity. After an\nexhaustive review of that evidence, she considered and rejected the possibility\nof any reasonable inference from the evidence other than guilt. She concluded:I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe only rational inference that can be drawn from the circumstantial evidence\nis that the accused is guilty. Based on the evidence I accept, I am convinced\nbeyond a reasonable doubt of Mr. Loor’s guilt. There is nothing in the evidence\nor the lack of evidence that I have heard that causes a reasonable doubt.[25]Nonetheless, Loor submits that the\ncircumstantial evidence of identification was insufficient to prove his guilt\nand that the trial judge failed to consider the possibility that another\nperson, even another person within the trafficking ring, could have\nimpersonated Loor, with false identification, to obtain the fentanyl patches. I\ndo not agree with either branch of Loor’s submission.[26]The trial judge reasonably concluded that no\nreasonable inference other than guilt was available on the evidence. She also properly\nrejected, at least implicitly in the passage from her reasons quoted above, the\nsuggestion that Goudreau or Sinclair or some other person used a fraudulent\nhealth card with Loor’s personal information on it to obtain the fentanyl\npatches. That possibility was nothing more than mere speculation or conjecture.[27]The following pieces of circumstantial evidence\nespecially show that the only reasonable inference from the evidence was that\nYancy Loor went to the IDA Pharmacy on three occasions and, using a forged\nprescription, obtained 45 patches of fentanyl:•Rashid testified that the photo on the health\ncard in Loor’s name tendered for identification was the photo of the person who\nobtained the fentanyl patches. The trial judge was entitled to accept Rashid’s\nevidence;•The health card tendered to Rashid had the same\nnumber as the health card Ford later seized from Loor’s property;•Rashid’s evidence and the practice of the\npharmacists, which the trial judge accepted, show that the same person went to\nthe pharmacy all three times;•Ford gave evidence, which the trial judge\naccepted, that the photo on the health card he seized from Loor’s property was\na photo of Loor; and•The telephone number in Goudreau’s contact list\nfor “Yanz” was the same number on Loor’s patient file and on the prescription.\nAnd when Ford telephoned that number Loor answered the phone. As the trial\njudge reasonably found:I find it beyond the bounds of coincidence\nthat the same named individual and phone number appear in this document and the\nsame named individual and phone number are linked through the officer’s call some\nten months later. I reject any suggestion, either overt or implied, that the\nnumber did not link up with the accused before the court at the time of the\ncommission of the offences and I find that it did so.[28]Appellate intervention is not justified. The\nconviction appeal is dismissed.C.The sentence appeal(a) Overview[29]The trial judge sentenced Loor to 6 years less\n18 months credit for pre-sentence custody. Loor submits that his sentence was\nexcessive, disproportionate to his role in the drug trafficking ring, and\ninconsistent with the sentences imposed on Baks and Sinclair.[30]I disagree. Sentencing judges have wide latitude\nin fashioning a fit sentence, and the sentences they impose attract significant\ndeference from an appellate court. We may interfere only if the sentence is\ndemonstrably unfit or the sentencing judge commits an error of law or principle\nthat has an impact on the sentence: see R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII), [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at\npara. 11.[31]Here, the trial judge committed no error in\nprinciple and the sentence she imposed was fit. She recognized that Loor’s\nsentence must be proportionate to the seriousness of his crimes and his moral blameworthiness,\nand that the principles of specific and general deterrence and denunciation are\nimportant principles in sentencing drug traffickers. She took into account the\naggravating considerations that might tend to increase Loor’s sentence, and the\nmitigating considerations that might tend to reduce it. Finally, she fairly\nreconciled the sentence she imposed on Loor with the sentences for Baks and\nSinclair.[32]In Lacasse at para. 12, Wagner J. for\nthe majority wrote that “proportionality is the cardinal principle that must\nguide appellate courts in considering the fitness of a sentence imposed on an\noffender.” Proportionality means that the sentence imposed depends on the\ngravity of the crime and its consequences and on the offender’s degree of\nresponsibility or moral blameworthiness.(b) Gravity of Loor’s crimes[33]Unless used for therapeutic purposes, under\nproper medical supervision, fentanyl is a highly dangerous drug. Its widespread\nabuse, though recent, has quickly become entrenched in our country. Every day\nin our communities, fentanyl abuse claims the lives of Canadians.[34]At the sentencing hearing, the Crown filed\naffidavit evidence from Dr. Karen Woodall, a toxicologist at the Centre of Forensic\nSciences, as well as the transcript of her evidence from another case. The\npurpose of her evidence was to show the dangers of fentanyl abuse and the serious\nconsequences of fentanyl trafficking. Dr. Woodall has studied the effects of fentanyl\nand has co-authored two articles on fentanyl abuse – one on the oral abuse of fentanyl\npatches and another on fentanyl-related deaths in Ontario. The following is a\nsummary of her evidence.(i)Evidence of Karen Woodall[35]Fentanyl, like heroin, is an opioid. Opioids are\ndrugs that act on the central nervous system to relieve pain. Unlike heroin, which\nis illegal, fentanyl is a prescription drug, which can be obtained legally for\ntherapeutic use.[36]Therapeutically, fentanyl is used for the\nmanagement of moderate to severe chronic pain. Patches are an effective way to\nadminister fentanyl because they are applied to the skin and provide a patient\nwith continuous pain relief for up to three days. But fentanyl is a very\npowerful drug, according to Dr. Woodall, up to 100 times more powerful than\nmorphine and 20 times more powerful than heroin. Because it is so potent, fentanyl\nis only prescribed in a patch under strict medical supervision and to those who\nare “opioid tolerant”, that is to those who have been taking opioids for a long\ntime.[37]Because fentanyl is so potent it becomes a very\ndangerous drug when it is not used for therapeutic reasons under medical\nsupervision. Those who have a prescription for it and yet abuse it, or those\nwithout a prescription who buy a patch on the street or borrow one from a\nfriend are at risk of toxicity and death.[38]The effects of fentanyl are why people abuse it.\nFentanyl gives people a high, a feeling of well-being, of euphoria. Those who\nuse it for a long time may become addicted. But because fentanyl depresses the\ncentral nervous system, it can slow down the way one’s brain functions,\ndecrease one’s heart rate, and slow down one’s breathing. A person who takes\nenough fentanyl may eventually stop breathing and die.[39]When abused, fentanyl patches are especially\ndangerous. People can abuse a fentanyl patch in many different ways. They can\ninject the patch contents intravenously, cut up the contents and chew small\nportions at a time, inhale it, smoke it, and even make tea with it. What makes\nthe patch particularly dangerous is the medication’s location within the patch.\nThe medication is in a matrix, essentially buried inside the patch. To get the\nmedication out of the patch a person has to chop it up or melt it down or heat it\nup. But then the person will not know how much fentanyl has been released. Its\npotency for an individual is thus often unpredictable. And so, Dr. Woodall\nconcludes, a lot of deaths have been associated with the abuse of fentanyl\npatches.(ii)The gravity of Loor’s crimes[40]Loor trafficked in 45 patches of fentanyl, as\nthe trial judge found a “not insignificant amount” of this dangerous drug, worth\nsomewhere between $18,000 and $20,000 on the street in North Bay. In addition,\nby using a forged prescription Loor planned and carried out a fraud on the\npharmacy. His crimes and their consequences were serious.(c) Loor’s degree of responsibility and moral blameworthiness(i)Loor’s role[41]Loor was 39 years old when he committed these\noffences. He must accept a fair measure of responsibility for his role.\nAlthough he was a low-level member of Goudreau’s trafficking ring, his role was\nnecessary to the successful operation of the scheme. He and the others that\nwent to the pharmacies were needed to obtain the fentanyl patches. And in\ncarrying out his role he must accept responsibility for deceiving the IDA Pharmacy\nand two of its pharmacists. He was unable to prove that he was an addict\ntrafficker, which might have served to reduce his moral blameworthiness.(ii)Aggravating and mitigating considerations[42]The trial judge properly took into account and\nweighed the aggravating and mitigating considerations that tended to increase\nand reduce Loor’s sentence.[43]The aggravating considerations included:•Loor had a previous criminal record, including a\nconviction for trafficking;•He trafficked 45 patches of the highest\nstrength, 100 micrograms per hour;•He trafficked a highly dangerous drug; and•He deceived a pharmacy and two of its pharmacists.[44]The mitigating considerations included:•Loor had a gap in his criminal record, and no\nconvictions for nearly five years before these offences;•He did not profit much from his trafficking;•He had strong family support and has young\nchildren;•He had done significant volunteer work at the\nJane/Finch Community and Family Centre; and•He showed good behaviour while in custody.(iii)The sentences for Baks and Sinclair[45]Baks and Sinclair were higher-ups in the\ntrafficking ring. Each played a key role in the scheme. Baks trafficked 900 fentanyl\npatches, 20 times more than did Loor. Sinclair likely trafficked a similar\namount. After pleading guilty Baks was initially sentenced to nine years on a\njoint submission, but on appeal, her sentence was reduced to six years, the\nsame as Loor’s sentence: see R. v. Baks, 2015 ONCA 560 (CanLII). Sinclair, too,\nwas initially sentenced to nine years after pleading guilty, but on appeal his\nsentence was reduced to eight years: see R. v. Sinclair, 2016 ONCA 683 (CanLII).\nYet there is no inconsistency in the sentences imposed by this court on Baks\nand Sinclair and the sentence imposed by the trial judge on Loor. Each of them\nis understandable.[46]This court reduced Baks’ sentence from nine\nyears to six years because of a powerful set of mitigating considerations (in\naddition to her guilty plea):•She was a young person with no previous record,\nand no indication of any previous criminal activity;•She had excellent prospects for rehabilitation;•She acted at the instigation of and under\npressure from Sinclair, with whom she had a romantic relationship; and•Most important, early on she fully cooperated\nwith the police’s investigation and then gave a statement and testified against\nboth Sinclair and Goudreau.[47]This court reduced Sinclair’s sentence from nine\nyears to eight years because two of the mitigating considerations that reduced\nBaks’ sentence also applied to his sentence:•He had excellent prospects for rehabilitation; and•He testified against Goudreau.[48]None of these mitigating considerations that\nreduced the sentences for Baks and Sinclair apply to Loor. A six year sentence\nfor Loor is not demonstrably unfit or out of line with the sentences imposed on\nBaks and Sinclair.(d) Conclusion[49]Loor has failed to demonstrate that his sentence\nwas unfit or reflected any error in principle. The Crown invited us to\nestablish a range for fentanyl trafficking, while acknowledging that sentencing\nis a “highly individualized exercise” and that the relevant considerations\naffecting a sentence will vary from individual to individual: see Lacasse\nat para. 58.[50]Few fentanyl trafficking cases have reached this\ncourt. It is thus perhaps too early in our jurisprudence to establish a range.\nBut I think it fair to say that generally, offenders – even first offenders –\nwho traffic significant amounts of fentanyl should expect to receive\nsignificant penitentiary sentences.[51]Although I would grant leave to appeal sentence,\nI would dismiss Loor’s sentence appeal.Released: “J.L.” September 8, 2017“John Laskin\nJ.A.”“I agree.\nJanet Simmons J.A.”“I agree.

They both wore masks and\ngloves. The accused had a firearm.[7]The accused pushed the victim on the floor and\nhit her face, pointing the gun to her head.[8]The accused tried to undress the victim and\ntouched her vagina. His pants were down when the police arrived. The accomplice\nwas arrested on the premises.[9]The accused escaped by a window that he broke\nand on which he cut himself leaving blood with his DNA. To escape, he broke\ninto another apartment. His DNA was also found on those premises.[10]During the assault the victim repeatedly said no\nto the accused. She told him the police was coming. In fact, the telephone line\nwith 9-1-1 was open during the whole event.[11]The evidence also indicates that the accused had\nduck tape and condoms with him.[12]The weapon used by the accused was found in the\napartment.[13]The accused and his accomplice both knew the\nplaintiff, as a few weeks before the incident they were co-workers.[14]The plaintiff suffered the following minor\nphysical injuries:•Bruises and scratches to the face.•Cut to the lips.•Cut to the hand.•Scratches on her breasts.[15]She still suffers psychologically. To that\neffect, she wrote a letter produced as exhibit S-1.[16]The accused quit his job after the events\nwithout leaving his new address.[17]In September 2008 the police went to meet him at\nthe hospital where he was working. The accused ran away and never came back to\nhis job.[18]He was arrested in November 2008 and released.\nAfterwards, the police realised he was wanted for this affair.[19]Shortly after, the accused came to the police\nand was arrested. The accused was identified by his DNA.[20]The crown presented the audio recording of the\n9-1-1 call in Court. The call’s duration was of 10 minutes and 45 seconds from\nthe moment the call was received by the 9-1-1 operator to the moment the police\narrived at the victim’s residence.[21]On many occasions we can hear the plaintiff\nsaying “no” and trying to convince the aggressor to stop.[22]Defence called on a witness, the sister of the\naccused and produced as exhibit SD-1, eleven statements of friends and relatives.\nShe said that shortly after the events, the accused changed his life in a very\npositive way. He also contacted a lawyer, one year after. During\ncross-examination, she stated the accused told her he didn’t assault the\nvictim. Later on he told her he had a weapon. He stated nothing was planned. He\nput the blame on the accomplice.[23]She states the accused is a good person who made\na big mistake and who deserves a chance. He has changed in a positive way since\nthe events and is a loving and caring father to his son. Exhibit SD-1 (11\nletters) is to the same effect.[24]The accused expressed himself in a letter\nproduced as exhibit SD-2. He has sincere regrets and accepts his\nresponsibility in this matter.[25]Since the events he changed his life and has\nrealistic goals. He is now making a positive contribution to society. He has\nlearned his lesson.[26]The accused wants to be part of his son’s life\nand to take care of him.2.OBJECTIVE\nGRAVITY[27]The maximum sentence for breaking and entering a\ndwelling is imprisonment for life.[28]The minimal sentence for a sexual assault with a\nweapon is imprisonment for four (4) years.3.POSITION\nOF THE PARTIES3.1The\nCrown:[29]Submits a global sentence of eight (8) years of\nincarceration less the pre-trial custody from December 12, 2008. The Court\nshould consider the aggravating factors of section 348.1 Cr. C. and the factors\nof denunciation and deterrence.[30]On the principle of parity, the accomplice with\nno criminal record was sentenced to five (5) years of incarceration.3.2The\nDefence:[31]Considers that a global sentence of five (5)\nyears less the pre-trial custody is appropriate. The Accused doesn’t need a\nlengthy period of incarceration and rehabilitation is possible.[32]His conduct after the event indicates he wanted\nto change his situation. He also made the effort of contacting a lawyer.4.AGGRAVATING\nFACTORS4.1Criminal\nrecord in 2000 and 2002 (exhibit S-2).4.2Conduct\nof the accused after the events:•He escaped from the police and broke and entered\na dwelling-house.•The accused made efforts to escape the police:−He quit his job.−He moved.−He escaped from the police when they went to see\nhim at his place of work in the hospital.4.3Particular\nelements of the offence:•A woman alone in her apartment.•At night at 3 A.M.•Knew she lived alone.•Death threats.•Planification:−Mask.−Gloves.−Weapon.−Condoms.−Duck tape.4.4The only reason the ordeal ended was because\nof the arrival of the police on the scene of the event.4.5Participation of the accused:•He held the gun.•He had his pants down.•He put his finger in the vagina of the victim.•He had the condoms and the duck tape.4.6Important impact on the victim (exhibit\nS-1).4.7Section 348.1 Cr. C.5.MITIGATING\nFACTORS5.1The accused pleaded guilty.5.2The victim did not have to testify.5.3The pre-sentence report is fairly positive.5.5Since the event the accused was not involved\nin criminal activity.6.FACTORS\nPROPER TO THE ACCUSED[33]The accused is 26 years old.[34]He is the father of an 18-month-old son.[35]In his youth he had problems with the law.[36]He made poor choices of friends.[37]Regarding the event, the pre-sentence reports\nindicates on page 4:“…la criminalité appert être\nsituationnelle allant de pair avec une certaine perméabilité aux valeurs du\nmilieu dans lequel l’intimé gravite. Monsieur opte, avec des individus peu\nscrupuleux, au mieux de ne pas s’interposer et au pire de se joindre à eux.\nQuoique les passages à l’acte soient peu fréquents, ils font état de ce parti\npris qui, comme le démontre les accusations actuelles, peuvent être à caractère\nviolent.”On page 5:“En effet, depuis la commission des\ndélits, il a effectué une importante remise en question et effectué des\nchangements notables. Le point central étant de rayer de sa vie tout ce qui\nn’est pas en accord avec les valeurs inculquées et socialement prônées.\nConséquemment, il a coupé tout rapport avec ses fréquentations marginales.”[38]He is remorseful.[39]Considering namely the attitude of the accused\nsince the events, the risk of recidivism is low.7.THE\nLAW[40]The purposes and principles of sentencing are\nset in sections 718 to 718.2 Cr. C.[41]The weight to be given to the factors of\ndeterrence, denunciation, rehabilitation and protection of society will vary\nwith the nature of the crime and the particular situation of the offender. The sentence\nmust be adjusted to the person and individualized.8.ANALYSIS[42]The crimes are very serious.[43]The Court acknowledges the jurisprudence\nproduced by the Crown. [1][2][3][4][44]The Court of Appeal of Quebec did not determine\na minimum sentence that should be imposed in similar matters since the sentence\napplies to an individual with particular factors. Nevertheless, the sentence\nimposed for home invasions are severe.[45]The jurisprudence establishes that the sentence\nmust reflect denunciation and deterrence even though the prognostic of the\naccused is positive.[46]I also considered the parity of the sentence.\nThe accomplice with no criminal record, whose participation was less important\nthan the accused, was sentenced to five (5) years of imprisonment.9.CONCLUSION[47]For these reasons the Court finds a global\nsentence of seven (7) is appropriate in the circumstances.[48]As suggested by the Crown and the Defence, I\nwill consider a pre-trail custody of fifteen (15) months to be credited as\nthirty (30) months: My sentence is a global sentence of fifty-four (54) months\nto be served as follows:•On counts 1 and 2, 54 months on each count; and•on count, 3 a sentence of three (3) years.[49]These sentences are to be served concurrently\nbetween them.[50]The Court:•Authorises a DNA order pursuant to section\n487.051 Cr. C.•Orders a lifetime weapon prohibition pursuant to\nsection 109 Cr. C.•Orders the accused to comply with the Sexual\nOffence Information Registration Act pursuant to section 490.012 Cr. C. for\nlife (section 490.13(2)c).[51]I do not impose a surcharge.__________________________________Louise VILLEMURE, Q.C.J.Me Annie PichéProsecutorMe Sylvie BordelaisDefendantDate of hearing:March 12, 2010[1] R. v.

C-46REASONS FOR SENTENCEPIKE, P.C.J.:INTRODUCTION[1]Robert Samuel Noseworthy\n(Noseworthy) is charged with consuming alcohol contrary to the terms of his\nlong-term supervision order (LTSO).THE FACTS[2]The facts are as agreed between\nthe parties but may be summarized as follows.In March of 2011, Noseworthy was\nfound guilty of driving while disqualified and impaired driving causing bodily\nharm.He was sentenced to a total of seven years imprisonment and declared to\nbe a long-term offender.As a result, in August 2015, when he was released\nfrom prison to continue serving his sentence outside the penitentiary, he was\nrequired to abide by certain conditions, including the provision that he not\nconsume alcohol.The LTSO was to expire in August 2025.Some five months\nlater, when reporting to his parole supervision officer, it was apparent that\nhe had been drinking alcohol and had become intoxicated.[3]The sole question for my\ndetermination is the appropriate sentence to impose.POSITION OF THE PARTIES[4]The Crown takes the position that\nNoseworthy has a lengthy record of criminal convictions involving alcohol and\ndrinking and driving offences, that the breach of the LTSO is of a serious\nnature and a period of imprisonment of 15 months is appropriate.[5]Counsel on behalf of Noseworthy\nsays that rehabilitation should be the prime consideration in these circumstances\nand that a period of three months (time served) should be imposed.THE LAW[6]In R. v. Payne, 2012 NLCA\n72 (CanLII), our Court of Appeal allowed the appeal where the sentencing judge had\nfailed to give the proper emphasis to rehabilitation as a sentencing principle.\nThe offender had sexual relations with a 13 year old girl while subject to a\nlong-term supervision order requiring him to “obey the law” and “report all\ncontact with females and the nature of the contact”.The trial judge had imposed\na consecutive three year term of imprisonment for Payne’s breach of the\nsupervision order. The three year term of imprisonment was reduced to one year by\nthe Court of Appeal.[7]The Court of Appeal explained in\nits reasons for judgment:12In\ndetermining that a three year term of imprisonment was appropriate for breach\nof the supervision order in this case, the trial judge relied on the approach\nadopted in R. v. W. (H.P.), 2003 ABCA 131 (CanLII), 18 Alta. L.R. (4th) 20, which\nheld that rehabilitation as a sentencing principle was to be given little, if\nany, effect. After the trial judge rendered her decision, the Supreme Court of\nCanada rejected the W. (H.P.) approach as being incorrect (R. v.\nIpeelee, 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII), [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433). In Ipeelee, the Court,\nin considering sentencing principles in the context of long-term supervision\norders, indicated that rehabilitation was, in fact, a relevant factor.13In Ipeelee,\nLeBel J., for the majority, began with basic principles, the fundamental\nprinciple being that “the sentence must be proportionate to both the gravity of\nthe offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender” (paragraph 36).\nLeBel J. drew attention to the rehabilitative function of long-term supervision\norders:[50] ... The purpose of\n[a supervision order] is two-fold: to protect the public and to rehabilitate\noffenders and reintegrate them into the community. In fact, s. 100 of the [Corrections\nand Conditional Release Act] singles out rehabilitation and reintegration\nas the purpose of community supervision including [supervision orders]. As this\nCourt indicated in L.M. 2008 SCC 31 (CanLII), [2008 SCC 31, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163],\nrehabilitation is the key feature of the long-term offender regime that\ndistinguishes it from the dangerous offender regime. To suggest, therefore,\nthat rehabilitation has been determined to be impossible to achieve in the\nlong-term offender context is simply wrong. Given this context, it would be\ncontrary to reason to conclude that rehabilitation is not an appropriate\nsentencing objective and should therefore play “little or no role” (as stated\nin W.(H.P.), at para. 50), in the sentencing process.(Italics in the\noriginal.)14LeBel J. went\non to emphasize that it is the trial judge's “duty” to apply all the sentencing\nprinciples set out in sections 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code\n(paragraph 51). Each factor is to be given appropriate weight depending on all\nthe circumstances. In summary:[55] It is the sentencing\njudge’s duty to determine, within this open range of sentencing options [from\nno incarceration to the maximum ten years], which sentence will be\nproportionate to both the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender. The severity of a particular breach of [a\nsupervision order] will depend, in large part, on the circumstances of the\nbreach, the nature of the condition breached, and the role that condition plays\nin managing the offender’s risk of reoffence in the community. This requires a\ncontextual analysis. As Smith J.A. states in R.v. Deacon, 2004 BCCA 78 (CanLII), 193\nB.C.A.C. 228, at para. 51, “the gravity of an offence under s. 753.3 must be\nmeasured with reference not only to the conduct that gave rise to the offence,\nbut also with regard to what it portends in light of the offender’s entire\nhistory of criminal conduct”. Breach of [a supervision order] is not subject to\na distinct sentencing regime or system. In any given case, the best guides for\ndetermining a fit sentence are the well-established principles and objectives\nof sentencing set out in the Criminal Code.15In Ipeelee,\nLeBel J. concluded that the trial judge had erred in sentencing Mr. Ipeelee to\nimprisonment for three years for breach of the supervision order because the\njudge “reached the erroneous conclusion that protection of the public is the\nparamount objective when sentencing for breach of [a supervision order] and\nthat rehabilitation plays only a small role” (paragraph 89). Again, LeBel J.\nemphasized that, while protection of the public is important, the legislative\npurpose of a supervision order, which is a form of conditional release,\nincludes rehabilitation and reintegration of the offender into society. In Ipeelee,\nthe judge’s failure to consider and give effect to all the sentencing\nprinciples, including rehabilitation, constituted error justifying the Court’s\nintervention.[8]Section 753.3(1) of the Criminal\nCode provides:753.3 (1) An offender\nwho, without reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to comply with long-term\nsupervision is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a\nterm not exceeding 10 years.ANALYSIS[9]I conclude from the decision in Payne\nthat all of the sentencing principles, including rehabilitation, must be\nconsidered by me in determining an appropriate punishment in this case.[10]Section 718 of the Criminal\nCode states that the fundamental purpose of sentencing “is to contribute … to\nrespect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society.”\nThis is to be achieved by imposing sentences which have, among others, the\nfollowing objectives:−separating offenders from society,\nwhere necessary;−denouncing unlawful conduct;−general deterrence;−rehabilitation; and−the promotion of a “sense of\nresponsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims or\nto the community”.[11]Section 718.2(d) states that “an\noffender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may\nbe appropriate in the circumstances”and section 718.2(e) states that “all\navailable sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the\ncircumstances … should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention\nto the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders.”[12]Section 718.1 of the Criminal\nCode states that any sentence imposed must be “proportionate to the gravity\nof the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.”[13]In R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010]\nS.C.J. 206 and R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII), [2015] S.C.J. 64, the Supreme Court of\nCanada considered the principles of sentencing set out above and indicated that\nany sentence imposed, regardless of the weight to be given to the factors set\nout in sections 718.1 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code must “respect the\nfundamental principle of proportionality” and that:The objectives of sentencing are given sharper focus\nin s. 718.1, which mandates that a sentence be “proportionate to the gravity of\nthe offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender”. Thus, whatever\nweight a judge may wish to accord to the objectives listed above, the resulting\nsentence must respect the fundamental principle of proportionality. Section\n718.2 provides a non-exhaustive list of secondary sentencing principles,\nincluding the consideration of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the\nprinciples of parity and totality, and the instruction to consider “all\navailable sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the\ncircumstances” …[14]The Supreme Court of Canada\nemphasized that:The credibility of the\ncriminal justice system in the eyes of the public depends on the fitness of\nsentences imposed on offenders. A sentence that is unfit, whether because it is\ntoo harsh or too lenient, could cause the public to question the credibility of\nthe system in light of its objectives.[15]The Court indicated that:The more serious the\ncrime and its consequences, or the greater the offender’s degree of\nresponsibility, the heavier the sentence will be. In other words, the severity\nof a sentence depends not only on the seriousness of the crime’s consequences,\nbut also on the moral blameworthiness of the offender.…Proportionality is\ndetermined both on an individual basis, that is, in relation to the accused him\nor herself and to the offence committed by the accused, and by comparison with\nsentences imposed for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.\nIndividualization and parity of sentences must be reconciled for a sentence to\nbe proportionate.[16]As regards rehabilitation, the Court\nstated:One of the main\nobjectives of Canadian criminal law is the rehabilitation of offenders.\nRehabilitation is one of the fundamental moral values that [distinguishes]\nCanadian society from the societies of many other nations in the world, and it\nhelps the courts impose sentences that are just and appropriate.[17]However, the Supreme Court of\nCanada also indicated that:While it is normal for\ntrial judges to consider sentences other than imprisonment in appropriate cases\n… in all cases [where] general or specific deterrence and denunciation must be\nemphasized, the courts have very few options other than imprisonment for\nmeeting these objectives, which are essential to the maintenance of a just,\npeaceful and law-abiding society.[18]It is apparent from the sentencing\ndecision of Judge Brown of this court (R. v. Samuel Robert Noseworthy, unreported\nMarch 3, 2011) that all of the crimes committed by Noseworthy were related to\nalcohol consumption. Following consideration of the report from a forensic\npsychiatrist that Noseworthy has been a proven recidivist and that having been\ncaught and punished he has exhibited a tendency to reoffend again, Judge Brown\naccepted the doctor’s conclusion that Noseworthy’s propensity to reoffend would\nincrease with age.[19]Noseworthy’s extensive criminal\nrecord, including 14 convictions for impaired driving related offences, failing\nto attend court and failing to abide by court orders are aggravating\ncircumstances.Noseworthy is 66 years of age and his convictions go back to\n1977 when he was imprisoned for seven days for impaired driving.It is\nmitigating that Noseworthy was not operating a motor vehicle when he was intoxicated\non this occasion.No one was harmed or endangered by having him behind the\nwheel of a motor vehicle. Acknowledgement of guilt, albeit not at the earliest\nopportunity, tends to mitigate as well.[20]If rehabilitation is to be\nsuccessful, Noseworthy must abide by the terms of the long-term supervision\norder.The terms of the order, particularly the one related to consumption,\npurchase or possession of alcohol, is specifically tailored to Noseworthy’s\ncircumstances and proclivities, to prevent further offences from being\ncommitted and to attenuate the risk of harm to the community. The consumption\nof alcohol and its disinhibiting effects has been clearly identified as a\ntrigger for Noseworthy’s crimes.[21]Counsel here have both agreed that\nbreach of an LTSO is more serious than a breach of probation order made by a\ncourt. Here the degree of responsibility of the offender is high.Noseworthy\nhas a long history of breaching orders. Court orders have always played an\nimportant role in managing Noseworthy’s reoffending behaviours. After consuming\nalcohol, he has committed serious offences and engaged in conduct which\nthreatens the lives and safety of other motorists in our community.Noseworthy\nhas been sentenced to periods of imprisonment of two months to one year for\ncontravening court orders over the last 25 years.[22]Counsel representing Noseworthy\nhas emphasized that Noseworthy was able to abide by the conditions of the LTSO\nfor a period of five months while residing at a halfway house in the community\nand that this is quite an accomplishment for someone who he describes as a\nlifelong addict of alcohol.Encouraging as this might be, the prophylactic LTSO\nhas been put in place for ten years. From this perspective, achieving five\nmonths without a breach of the order is hardly commendable. This is not a case\nof a minor or technical violation by an offender making efforts to reintegrate\ninto the community. Here, intoxication is a precursor to criminality and\nelevates Noseworthy’s risk to reoffend.[23]As the Court of Appeal has\nemphasized in R. v. Hutchings, 2012 NLCA 2 (CanLII), [2012] N.J. No. 12, breaches of court\norders (and by inference long-term supervision orders) almost always requires a\nperiod of imprisonment.While there is always a prospect of rehabilitation,\npunishment and specific deterrence, as well as protection of the public must be\nemphasized in this case. While there is always hope that Noseworthy will become\na law abiding citizen, hope is not a plan. An important aspect of the plan put\nin place for him by the authorities is the LTSO. His breach of it amounts to\ncriminal contempt.[24]In Payne the Court of\nAppeal took into consideration the fact that it was the offender’s first\nbreach of the LTSO in three years and that his “history since the supervision\norder took effect …indicates potential for rehabilitation and reintegration\ninto society” (see para. 24). There was no evidence before me to indicate such\na potential here. The LTSO was contravened much earlier in its term. However, I\nmust also consider that the breach by Payne was more serious.CONCLUSION[25]Rehabilitation must always be\nconsidered but it must play a lesser role when management and supervision of\nthe offender’s behavior in the community in the early days of a LTSO portends a\nrisk of danger to the public. I have come to the conclusion that a period of\nimprisonment of 15 months (457 days) is an appropriate sentence in this case.[26]Although Noseworthy was denied\njudicial interim release on January 20th, 2016, primarily due to previous\nconviction and the presiding judge endorsed the information pursuant to section\n515(9.1) of the Criminal Code entitling Noseworthy for a maximum of one\ndays credit for every day time served, I accept the position of both counsel\nthat the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v.\nSafarzadeh-Markhali, 2016 SCC 14 (CanLII), [2016] S.C.J. No. 14, declaring the restrictions on\nenhanced credit in section 719(3.1) of the Criminal Code unconstitutional,\nis applicable here. Of course that does not necessarily determine the issue of\ncredit for time served in custody particularly given the rationale for enhanced\ncredit while subject to the terms of a LTSO. However, based upon the joint\nrecommendation of counsel I would grant Mr. Noseworthy 1.5 days credit for each\nday served in this case._______________________D.\nMARK PIKEProvincial\nCourt Judge"}

Hawkins, 2009 NSSC 410Date: (20091210)Docket: SYD CRS 282648Registry: SydneyBetween:Her Majesty the Queenv.Herbert John HawkinsJudge:The Honourable Justice\nFrank EdwardsHeard:October 13 - November 3\nand December 10, 2009,in Sydney, Nova ScotiaWritten Decision:January 27, 2010 (delivered Orally December\n10, 2009)Counsel:Andre Arseneau \u0026 Shane\nRussell, for the CrownDarlene MacRury \u0026 Tony Mozvik, for the\nDefenceBy the Court:[1]This is my\ndecision on sentence.A jury had found Mr. Hawkins guilty of second degree\nmurder on November 3, 2009, and I adjourned the matter for sentence to December\n10, 2009.The sentence of life imprisonment is automatic.The only\noutstanding issue is how long Mr. Hawkins must serve before he is eligible to\napply for parole.[2]The law of\nsentencing applies here because of course determining the eligibility period\nfor parole is indicative of the minimum time that Mr. Hawkins will have to\nspend in custody.And the principles of sentence are set out in the Criminal\nCode.I will read it briefly:The\nfundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention\ninitiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and\nsafe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following\nobjectives:(a)\nto denounce unlawful conduct;(b)\nto deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)\nto separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)\nto assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)\nto provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f)\nto promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the\nharm done to victims and to the community.[3]And on that score\n[item (f)]the victim impact statements are some indication of the loss which\nthe family and the community have suffered in this case.[4]Section 745.4 of\nthe Criminal Code says that the judge in my position has to have regard to character\nof the offender, the nature of the offence, and the circumstances surrounding\nits commission and to the recommendation, if any, made by the jury.After\ndoing that, the judge can substitute for 10 years a number of years of\nimprisonment more than 10 but not more than 25 without eligibility for parole.[5]You will recall\nthat nine of the jurors in this case did not make a recommendation but said\nthat they would leave it up to me.I want to emphasize that I do not take that\nto mean that the jury is content with the ten year eligibility period.I take\nit as an acknowledgement by them that the trial judge with his training and\nexperience, and with the benefit of having read the pre-sentence report and\nhearing the submissions of counsel, would be in a better position to impose an\nappropriate figure for the ineligibility period.One of the jurors, you will\nrecall, recommended the full 25 and the others recommended 12 years and 15\nyears respectively.[6]I have considered\nthe factors outlined in the pre-sentence report and take into account that Mr.\nHawkins is relatively young.He is 33 now but he was 29 at the time of the\ncommission of this offence.He had a difficult upbringing.He is capable of\nbeing a contributing member of society.Apparently he was quite accomplished\nin his chosen work of roofing.But I also consider that he was on probation at\nthe time of this offence and that is a very serious matter.His record is set\nout in the pre-sentence report and, as Counsel have indicated, he has only one\nprior conviction for an act of violence, that being for a single count of\nassault causing bodily harm.Other than that, they were property related\noffences.So I do take that into consideration when I am determining what in\nmy judgment will be an appropriate eligibility period.[7]Mr. Hawkins’\ndenial and refusal to take responsibility for this crime is also noted in the\npre-sentence report.That does not in itself demonstrate a lack of remorse.Actions speak louder than words and, as I will relate later, Mr. Hawkins’\nactions show that he was completely unremorseful.The note he read in court\ntoday gives some cause for hope.Without admitting his involvement, he says\nhis time in jail has given him insight into his drug problem.I hope that is\ntrue.His tears, however, more likely come from the realization that he has\nmany more years in jail ahead of him.[8]The fact that\nthere is a discretion granted to the court in second degree murder cases is an\nindication that the legislature recognized that in some cases the act of\ncommitting second degree murder will be as serious or approach the seriousness\nof a first degree murder situation.Indeed, in this case, it would be hard to\nimagine how a first degree situation, which in most cases would mean that there\nwas planning and deliberation, would be worse than what occurred in Sheldon\nBoutilier’s home on that day in July 2006.That thought was encapsulated in a\nquote in the Crown brief by Justice Hart in our appeal court inR. v.\nMitchell, [1987] N.S.J. No. 430, when he wrote:“Parliament\nmust have considered that there were ways of committing second degree murder\nthat would be equally serious to first degree murder and that the court should\nbe free to ensure that the perpetrator remained in prison for an appropriate\nnumber of years....The\nemphasis clearly is not the protection of society through an assessment of the\naccused's future rehabilitative needs, or the likely progress of his\nrehabilitation ... but on the protection of society through its expression of\nrepudiation for the particular crime by the particular accused, along with that\nrepudiation's concomitants of individual and general deterrence.”[9]In R v.\nPerlin (1977), 23 N.S.R. (2d), Justice Angus MacDonald of our Court of\nAppeal said:“In\nmy opinion the over riding consideration in sentencing with respect to crimes\nof violence must be deterrence and it is for such reason that save for\nexceptional cases substantial terms of imprisonment must be imposed.”[10]It is not\npossible to say with certainty what evidence the jury accepted and what if any\nevidence it rejected.In that situation the trial judge is entitled to make\nhis own findings of fact so long as they are consistent with the jury’s\nverdict.Consequently, I will now outline the facts as I see them.[11]Facts:To appreciate the magnitude of the\ncrime Mr. Hawkins committed, it is necessary to review the facts in detail with\nparticular emphasis on the details of the actual murder.[12]Mr. Hawkins was\nthere twice on July 8th.We heard evidence that he left at\napproximately 3 p.m. and of course Dena Quinn gave evidence about having to let\nhim out of the driveway at that time.There is other evidence too and it is\nnot in dispute that that he was there and left around 3 p.m.And then he came\nback at around 5:30 p.m.and left again sometime before 8 p.m.The Quinns who\nlive next door were away. I suggest that the absence of vehicles or any\nactivity around the Quinn residence would have made it apparent that there was\nprobably no one there.But, in any event, they were away between 5:30 p.m. and\n8:00 p.m.Mr. Hawkins had plenty of time and lots of opportunity to carry out\nthe murder between 5:30 and 8:00 and I am satisfied that Sheldon Boutilier was\ndead before 8 p.m. Saturday, July 8, 2006.[13]Kenneth Burton\nwas called by the Accused.He is probably mistaken about having seen Mr.\nHawkins on that night.His statement given to police at the time said that it\nwas Friday or Saturday night, although he insisted in court here that it was\nSaturday night.But even if he did see Mr. Hawkins that night it was between 9\nand 9:30 p.m. and that was well after Mr. Hawkins had committed the murder.[14]His sister Heidi\ntestified that she had seen him between 7 and 8 that evening, and I am\nsatisfied that, if she did see him, it was closer to the 8 than the 7. It is\nhard to believe that he, as she said, looked normal at that time.I cannot\nrule out that by that time he had cleaned up and calmed down and was\ndeliberately trying to create an alibi.[15]Despite the obvious\ncredibility issues relating to the drug dealer, Christopher Marsh, and his\nwife, Deborah Marsh, I am satisfied that they were truthful regarding Hawkins\ncoming to their residence twice on the evening of July 8.Mr. Hawkins came the\nfirst time to buy cocaine with the blood-stained money he had just stolen from\nhis victim.The second time, he came to attempt to sell the cigarettes that he\nhad stolen from his victim.The bag containing the cigarettes had Sheldon\nBoutilier’s blood on it.When the Marshs’ evidence is viewed against the\nbackdrop of Sergeant Sehl’s evidence, I have no difficulty accepting their\nevidence of what happened that night.[16]It is difficult\nto overstate what that says about the personality of Herbert Hawkins.He was\nnot under the influence of alcohol or drugs, yet after the savagery of the act\nhe had just committed, he goes to the drug dealer with money he had just stolen\nfrom the victim and then comes back to sell the cigarettes he had also stolen.These are not the actions of someone who momentarily lost control in the course\nof an argument or physical confrontation.Nor are they the actions of someone\nwho has lost control because of the ingestion of drugs or alcohol.Those\nactions demonstrate a cold bloodedness and total lack of human empathy which is\nimpossible to understand.They also demonstrate the need to protect the public\nby incarcerating Mr. Hawkins for a very long time.[17]Nor was this a\nfight between persons of relatively equal physical and mental ability.The\ndeceased was a mentally handicapped, trusting, and highly vulnerable individual\nin his own home.He was killed because he apparently tried to interfere with\nMr. Hawkins helping himself to Mr. Boutilier’s money and possessions.After\nthe initial stabbing, cutting his throat, he was strangled apparently either to\nprevent further interference or to prevent him from getting to the telephone.It is hard to know because Sheldon Boutilier’s body was found in the proximity\nof the telephone on the wall at the entrance to the hallway.Sheldon Boutilier\nwas physically smaller and no match for the Accused.Mr. Hawkins actions were\nas cowardly as they were despicable.[18]There is no\nevidence, of course, that this murder was planned and deliberate and that is\nwhy it is second degree.I have no doubt however that Mr. Hawkins returned to\nSheldon Boutilier’s residence for the purpose of helping himself to whatever\nvaluables Sheldon Boutilier possessed.He claimed in one of his statements\nthat he had gone to purchase cigarettes for Sheldon Boutilier and was returning\nto deliver them at that time.Well that gave him an excuse to go back, but his\nreal purpose was made evident by the actions he took after his return.And\nwhy?So he could get a few dollars to buy cocaine.[19]As police\nsuggested to Mr. Hawkins in one of the video statements, Mr. Hawkins probably\ngot the surprise of his life by Sheldon Boutilier’s determination both to\nsurvive and possibly to protect what was his. Mr. Hawkins’ response was to cut\nSheldon Boutilier’s throat and then go about or continue ransacking Sheldon\nBoutilier’s house.When an almost lifeless Sheldon Boutilier crawled to the\nhallway, Mr. Hawkins ensured there would be no further interference and\nconsequently no chance of survival.He did so by strangling Mr. Boutilier\nfirst with a towel and then applying the telephone cord around Sheldon\nBoutilier’s neck and then tying the other end of the cord to a doorknob.[20]The presence of\nthe footprint on Mr. Boutilier’s torso is disturbing.One can reasonably infer\nthat he did not accidentally walk on Mr. Boutilier at the point but he was\nputting his foot on Mr. Boutilier’s torso in order to immobilize him or, as the\nCrown suggested, create tension on the cord.The brutality of that conduct is\nbeyond measure.[21]Mr. Hawkins\nhelped himself to whatever valuables he could find, a watch collection, a dvd\nplayer and money.The watch collection and the dvd player have never been\nrecovered so presumably Mr. Hawkins did not even profit by them, and I have\nalready referenced the money he stole.[22]During the trial,\nthere was quite a bit of contention about a pair of trousers that were found on\nthe kitchen floor.They were blood-soaked Calvin Klein jeans, and I am\nsatisfied that Mr. Hawkins had put these on sometime before attacking Sheldon\nBoutilier.It is conceivable, though there is no way of knowing, Sheldon\nBoutilier may even have given them to him because the evidence of Kelly Quinn\nwas that he had given several pairs to Shelly.What is certain is that those\njeans were in Sheldon Boutilier’s home prior to Hawkins getting there.[23]I am satisfied\nthat the barefoot and the footwear impressions found throughout the house were\nmade by the same person.I am satisfied beyond any question that Mr. Hawkins\nacted alone in this.There was one person when the jeans were changed, one\nperson in the bathroom (Mr. Hawkins says in the statement he gave to Kimberley\nBoyce that it was him in the bathroom where there were only footwear prints),\nand one person with footwear left the house and deposited Sheldon Boutilier’s\nblood on the floor mat of Mr. Hawkins’ car.There is no doubt that that one\nperson was Herbert Hawkins.[24]His actions after\nthe fact, in addition to selling the proceeds of the crime, were also indicative\nof a person without remorse or the slightest sympathy for his victim.His\npolice statements show that he did everything he could to deflect suspicion\nfrom himself.His flight to Vancouver and lying to police were no doubt\nmotivated by feelings of guilt, not remorse, guilt and the pressure of the\nimminence, as he must have perceived it, that he was going to be charged with\nthis crime.[25]Overall, as I\nhave already said, this was a particularly brutal, cruel and despicable act.Mr. Hawkins protestations of innocense are hard to fathom.They have to be for\nhis family because no one who paid attention to the evidence could have the\nslightest doubt about Mr. Hawkins’ guilt.Sheldon Boutilier died a horrible\ndeath and for what?For probably less than $200.00, some watches and\ncigarettes, cigarettes for which Mr. Hawkins got $10.00.[26]I would like to\nthink that the reason that Mr. Hawkins will not admit to what he has done is\nthat he is too ashamed to do so.But his actions after the fact are not those\nof an ashamed person, they are the actions of someone who does not have the\nslightest regret about what he has done.They are the actions of someone who\nsimply did not want to get caught.So why does he continue to deny?At this\nstage, all he has left in the world are those he has convinced that he did not\ndo it.He is only able to do that because his family do not want to believe\nthat one of theirs could possibly do such an act.[27]The jury had no\ndifficulty finding guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.I instructed them in the\npart of my charge on the doctrine of reasonable doubt that it was not necessary\nfor the Crown to prove its case to a certainty.But that is what it has done.That is the beauty of a circumstantial case, one does not have to be concerned\nthat some day an eye witness is going to recant their statement or with the\nother frailities or problems with eye witness evidence.Here we have\ncircumstantial evidence.We have foot prints which were analysed by an\nexaminer out in British Columbia and a footprint examined here locally, and\nthey both came to the same conclusion; they are Mr. Hawkins’ footprints.[28]The blood spatter\nexpert was able to reconstruct with remarkable certainty what went on in the\nhouse as I have just described it.As I noted, I have no doubt, Mr. Hawkins,\nbut that you and you alone committed this horrendous act.[29]I have looked at\nthe cases and case authorities presented to me by Counsel and they are helpful\nin the sense that they highlight the general guidelines which a sentencing\ncourt must consider in these situations.But they are of limited value because\neach case will turn on its particular facts.As the crown noted in its\ncitation from the R v. Muise (1993) 1993 CanLII 4562 (NS SC), 124 N.S.R. (2d) 105 (NSSC):“Comparisons\nwith other cases is a difficult exercise. Attempts to seek similarities with or\ndifferences from other murders committed by other people can be very\nfrustrating and counter productive. We are not dealing with an exercise of\nreviewing \"comparables\" such as is done in a property appraisal. In\nexercising the direction under s. 744 of the Code, other cases are no more than\na rough guide for the sentencing judge in identifying the types of aggravating\nor mitigating circumstances that other courts have relied on as relevant in\napplying the guidelines.”[30]As I pointed out\nto Ms. MacRury during her presentation, cases where there has been a plea\nbargain or joint recommendation are of very limited value as precedents because\nthere are all kinds of reasons why the Crown may in a given case agree to go\nalong with something which is less than what would otherwise be warranted by\nthe particular facts.In the case cited, for example,I believe it was the\ndesire to prevent or keep young witnesses from having to testify about very\ntraumatic events that motivated the Crown.[31]It should be\nobvious from what I have said that I consider that there are many aggravating\ncircumstances in this case, a vulnerable victim in his own home. And then there\nis the sequence of the murder – slashing the victim’s throat and then going\nabout committing theft of the dying individual’s possessions while the\nindividual is there bleeding to death.And then ensuring that there is no\nfurther interference from the victim by coming back and strangling the person,\nfirst with a towel and then with a telephone cord.[32]I have also\nconsidered the mitigating circumstances that I have referred to which were\noutlined in the pre-sentence report and in the defence brief.But the\noverwhelming imperative in this case is deterrence.Mr. Hawkins must not get\nanother opportunity for a very long time to commit such a brutal crime.A\nsignal to others who might be similarly inclined must also be sent.The\nsentence must also signal the community’s revulsion and abhorrence of this\ncrime.[33]Prior to hearing\nMr. Hawkins read his prepared statement, I was prepared to accept the Crown’s\nrecommendation that he would not be eligible for parole for 22 years.His\nstatement this morning, to the extent that it may in part have been motivated\nby remorse, demonstrates that there may be a faint glimmer of hope for Mr.\nHawkins’ eventual rehabilitation.[34]Stand up Mr.\nHawkins.I am ordering that you shall not be eligible for parole until you\nhave served at least 20 years of your life sentence.I am also granting the\nrequested Firearms and DNA Orders.J."}

Dusanjh, 2016 ONSC 4317R E A S O N SF O RS E N T E N C EHILL,\nJ.:(Orally)INTRODUCTIONAfter a\ntrial, the offender was convicted of robbery and of committing robbery while\nmasked. It falls to be determined what a fit sentence is for these crimes.The factual\ncontext of the offences was fully reviewed in the court’s earlier reasons (2016\nONSC 2358 (CanLII)) and accordingly need only be summarized here.Armed with\na knife, and with his face masked to avoid detection, the offender robbed a gas\nbar/convenience store attendant of $80.00.OFFENDER’S BACKGROUNDThe\noffender is currently 34 years of age. He was born in Punjab, India and\nimmigrated to Canada at about age 5.The current\nPre-sentence Report (PSR) author, in making reference to 2012 Ministry records,\nstates that the records:...indicated that the subject witnessed the\ndomestic violence during his childhood, and that his father had an substance\nabuse (alcohol) issue. It is also indicated that the subject’s father was\nstrict and had an authoritative attitude.The subject’s father set strict standards of\nconduct and punished the subject when the rules were not followed. Ministry\nrecords further indicated that the subject experienced verbal and physical\npunishment from his father.The\noffender completed high school. According to the PSR, while in school the\noffender was suspended for fighting. The offender’s employer for the past 10\nyears described him as “an unpredictable employee”, who was excellent, hard-working\nand knowledgeable “when ... sober” and not missing in action.In\naddressing the subject of substance abuse, the PSR states:As per Ministry records, it is noted that the\nsubject started consuming alcohol while in high school, and he would consume\nalcohol daily, (for stress relief), often resulting in him missing school.The subject admitted to being an addict to\nboth alcohol and cocaine. He reported to use marijuana occasionally; however,\nstated that his biggest vice was cocaine. During the PSR interview he requested\nto not discuss his issues or how it relates to the present charges before the\nCourt. The subject stated, however, that he has a future intent to attend the\nOntario Correctional Institute (OCI) in Brampton, Ontario, or an alternate\nin-patient treatment program to address and receive substance-abuse treatment.\nWhen asked if the subject is participating in any substance abuse programs\nwhile incarcerated, he stated no, and he further stated that he specifically\ndislikes attending Alcoholics Anonymous programs.The PSR\nfurther states:The subject reported that he has been intoxicated\nduring all of his past offences which have led to convictions. He stated that\nhe is now motivated to correct this behaviour and participate in treatment in a\nserious manner.According to 2009 Ministry records, the\nsubject attended anger-management counseling at the Elizabeth Fry society, as\nper his Court conditions. It is noted that the subject did not enjoy the\nintervention as the program was on a 1-1 basis, and he had difficulty\nconnecting to the counselor and the lessons. There is no reported present\npsychiatric or psychological intervention that he has completed and no\ndiagnosed mental health issues are identified presently.The subject is not currently consuming any\nprescribed medication, and he denied any history of personal mental illness.\nThe subject did report however that when intoxicated, his anger-management\nbecomes problematic, uncontrollable, and that he has been involved in physical\naltercations in the past. The subject stated that since his recent\nincarceration he has remained sober from all drugs and alcohol....During the Pre-Sentence Report, the subject\nwas not forthcoming with personal information, and was not willing to discuss\nthe offence presently before the Court. He did not express regret for his\ncurrent charges and stated due to being intoxicated at the time of the offence,\nhe does not recall the totality of the events.Ministry records indicate that the subject\nhas a record of non-compliance to community orders. Records indicate that the\nsubject has poor problem-solving skills, displayed issues with anger-management\nand with intimidation and control, which often leads to his unpredictable and\ncriminal behaviour. The subject reported that he currently has minimal friends.\nMinistry records indicate that, in the past, his peers have been a negative\ncontribution to his offending.On the\nissue of “Response to Community Supervision”, the PSR author observed:The subject has an extensive criminal record,\nalong with several convictions for fail to comply with community supervision\norders. His response to previous community supervision orders has been poor.\nAlthough he complied with counseling conditions, he has numerous failed to\nreports list[ed] on his file and he has re-offended while on probation and\nother community supervision orders.Ministry records indicate that, during\nprevious periods of community supervision, the subject never accepted full\nresponsibility for his criminal conduct and displayed little regret for his\nactions.The subject acknowledged that he does not\nwant to continue to involve himself in a criminal lifestyle, and appreciated\nthe negative impact this current involvement has had upon his life. The subject\nfailed to acknowledge, however, any empathy towards the victim or the harm\ninflicted upon them. Motivation as a barrier exists as he displays a pattern of\ngoal setting; he rarely follows through with any medium or long-term goals that\nhe sets for himself. As reflected by his criminal record, the subject has\nstruggled to comply with Court-ordered sanctions, most frequently by failing to\nkeep the peace and previously by consuming drugs....The offender’s overall and more recent\nresponse to community supervision has been unimpressive. The subject has been\nin conflict with the law since he was been a youth. The subject does not suffer\nfrom any mental illness. He has issues with managing anger and substance use....The subject’s consistent irresponsibility,\ncontinuous substance abuse and disregard for the safety of others have been a\nconcern. Support from his parents and short-term treatment has not worked in\nthe past. The subject has a history of not complying with Probation conditions\nand appears to lack problem-solving skills. Previous court sanctions involving\nprobation have failed to deter or rehabilitate the subject, especially with\nrespect to his serious drug problem.According\nto the PSR, the offender self-identifies as an addict who maintains that he\nrequires professional treatment. The offender has not committed to abstinence despite\nyears of notice and community supervision orders designed to curtail substance\nabuse.The\noffender is not a first offender. He has a prior criminal record commencing in\nYouth Court at the age of 17. In all, there are 23 entries in the record, with\n18 adult court convictions between 2000 and 2011, prior to the commission of\nthe current offences in 2013. Of relevance to the present proceeding are the\nfollowing aspects of the record:2011, robbery and wear disguise while\ncommitting an indictable offence; assault with a weapon in 1999 in Youth Court\nand subsequently in 2006; possession of a weapon in 2001; assault causing\nbodily harm, 1998, in Youth Court, and subsequently in 2006; convictions for\nassault in 2002 and 2007; and a conviction for assault resisting arrest in\n2002.The\noffender is a Permanent Resident of Canada. On August 11, 2006, he was declared\ninadmissible and ordered deported on October 10, 2007.Mr. Dusanjh obtained a\n3-year stay of that order on December 10, 2009. With the offender’s September\n26, 2011 sentencing for robbery, the Immigration Appeal Division by operation\nof statute canceled the stay on February 18, 2013. In submissions here, the\noffender was described as being currently considered “removal ready” with\ndeportation essentially inevitable.POSITION OF\nTHE PARTIESThe\nCrownOn behalf\nof the Crown, Mr. Powell submitted that a fit sentence would be 4 years’\nincarceration less credit for pre-sentence custody. While counsel described a\nrange of 2 to 4 years as the appropriate range, he submitted that, in\nparticular the offender’s history of violence supports a disposition at the\nupper end of this range. Mr. Powell took no position as to whether the amount\nof credit properly attributable for pre-sentence custody should be at an\nenhanced rate or not.Crown\ncounsel noted the aggravating facts of not only the prior record, but also the\nuse of a weapon and the inevitable impact of the crime upon the victim.\nDeterrence and denunciation, it is said, should dominate as the governing\nsentencing principles.Mr. Posner,\nwhile recognizing the general applicability of a 2 to 4 year range, submitted\nthat an appropriate sentence would be about 3 years – a global sentence comprised\nof 18 months’ imprisonment along with 1.5:1 credit for about a year of pre-sentence\ncustody referable to the current charges, in effect, about 18 months’ credit.Without\ndiminishing the gravity of the offence or the prior criminal record, Mr. Posner\nemphasized the offender’s current commitment to substance abuse treatment, and\nthe consequence of deportation and separation from his supportive family.\nCounsel submitted that a court-recommendation for treatment at the Ontario\nCorrectional Institute (OCI) would serve to conquer the chronic substance abuse\nproblem prior to deportation.ANALYSISThe\nfundamental principle of sentencing is that the sentence imposed must be proportionate\nto the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender:\nCriminal Code, s. 718.1; R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII), [2015] 3 S.C.R. 1089, at\npara. 12; R. v. Clouthier, 2016 ONCA 197 (CanLII), at para. 53.Robbery is\npunishable by a maximum of life imprisonment. The crime has been described as\n“a serious offence”: R. v. Shiwprashad, 2015 ONCA 577 (CanLII), at para. 72. As a\ncrime of violence, the overarching principles for a sentencing court are\ngeneral deterrence and denunciation in furtherance of the protection of the\npublic. Employed victims, working alone in convenience-like establishments,\neven on day shifts, are particularly exposed to robbery. In R. v. Carriére\n(2002), 2002 CanLII 41803 (ON CA), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 569 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 11 the court stated, “[a]s\nthis court has often said, operators of convenience stores are a particularly\nvulnerable group”: see also R. v. Clarke, [2012] O.J. No. 4084 (C.A.),\nat para. 11; R. v. Allison-McLeish, [2001] O.J. No. 845 (C.A.), at para.\n13.“A plea of\nguilty is an important mitigating factor”: R. v. Spencer (2004), 2004 CanLII 5550 (ON CA), 72 O.R.\n(3d) 47 (C.A.), at para. 38, leave to appeal refused [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 4.\nWhere an offender maintains his or her innocence, he or she “cannot rely on\nremorse or an acknowledgment of harm to the victim” to reduce a sentence: R.\nv. Araya, 2015 ONCA 854 (CanLII), at para. 31 (conviction appeal allowed 2015 SCC 11 (CanLII), [2015] 1\nS.C.R. 581). A sentencing court may take into account in the exercise of its\nsentencing discretion, not as an aggravating feature of sentencing, but as the\nabsence of a factor entitling sentence reduction, and as relevant to whether\nrestorative objectives can be satisfied in a particular case, an offender’s\nlack of remorse and acceptance of responsibility for his or her crime: R. v.\nProulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 113; R. v. Valle-Quintero (2002),\n2002 CanLII 45123 (ON CA), 169 C.C.C. (3d) 140 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 164; R. v. A.(K.) (1999), 1999 CanLII 3756 (ON CA), 137\nC.C.C. (3d) 554 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 570; R. v. Valentini (1999), 1999 CanLII 1885 (ON CA), 132\nC.C.C. (3d) 262 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 81-3.Mr. Dusanjh\nhas a significant prior criminal record which amounts to an aggravating factor\non sentencing: R. v. Larche, [2006] 3 S.C.R. 762, at para. 28; R. v.\nTaylor, 2004 CanLII 7199 (ON CA), [2004] O.J. No. 3439 (C.A.), at paras. 39-40. Of course, an\noffender is not to be re-punished for prior crimes and a sentencing court may\nnot raise a sentence beyond what would otherwise be a fit sentence on account\nof a prior record. Depending upon its nature, as in the present case, the\nrecord may temper the leniency to be extended by the court as the criminal\nhistory is highly relevant to specific deterrence, the chances of\nrehabilitation, and the likelihood of recidivism. Of course, on the facts here,\nMr. Dusanjh has demonstrated that he is a threat to public safety, who must be\nspecifically deterred.The PSR report,\nas said, records hearsay information that the offender has substance abuse\nissues. While there is no direct evidence that the offender was under the\ninfluence of a drug or other intoxicant at the time the current offences were\ncommitted, the Crown accepts that that was so. In all the circumstances,\nincluding the information provided to the PSR author, the court accepts this to\nhave been the case. However, there is no “linkage” between the crimes and any\naddiction, such as may have existed: see R. v. Barham, 2014 ONCA 797 (CanLII), at\nparas. 6, 8.Because, in\nsentencing, an offender’s individual circumstances must be taken into account,\nthe fact that an offender faces the collateral consequences of deportation is a\nrelevant factor for consideration – this respects the proportionality of\npunishment principle: R. v. Pham, 2013 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2013] 1 S.C.R. 739, at paras. 11-20.\nConsideration of immigration consequences cannot, however, become an invitation\nto impose an unfit sentence. While, in some instances, this factor may tip the\nscales toward a lighter sentence ameliorating specific immigration consequences,\nfor example, R. v. Frater, 2016 ONCA 386 (CanLII), at paras. 2-6, that will not\nalways be the case as here, especially where such a sentence would fall outside\nthe range of appropriate sentence: see Pham, at para. 18; R. v.\nFreckleton, 2016 ONCA 130 (CanLII), at paras. 2, 7-8; R. v. Stein, 2015 ONCA\n720 (CanLII), at paras. 5-9; R. v. Malicki, 2015 ONCA 204 (CanLII), at paras. 2, 5, 7-10; R.\nv. Badhwar, 2011 ONCA 266 (CanLII), at paras. 42-45.The\naggravating circumstances of this case are manifestly apparent, including the\nfollowing:(1)the offender robbed a gas bar/convenience store\nemployee while armed with a knife produced in a threatening manner;(2)the robbery was committed less than 2 years after\ncompletion of a penitentiary-length sentence for robbery, and during the\ncurrency of a probation order;(3)the $80.00 was not recovered;(4)the offender, a recidivist for crimes of violence,\nhas a relatively negative Pre-sentence Report.In the\nbalance, in mitigation, these factors must be considered:(1)no actual violence was inflicted beyond the terror\nimposed by menacing the threat of use of a knife;(2)the offender was very likely under the influence of\na drug or intoxicant when the crimes were committed;(3)the offender will be deported once his sentence is\ncomplete.An offender\nheld in pre-sentence custody, who is subsequently convicted, is generally\nentitled to credit on sentence for pre-sentence custody at the rate of 1.5:1: R\nv. M.O., 2016 ONCA 236 (CanLII), at para. 22. This is not an invariable rule –\n“[t]he applicable principle comes from Summers, [2014 SCC 26 (CanLII), [2014] 1 S.C.R. 575]:\n1.5 for 1 credit can be denied if the possibility of early release or parole is\nhighly unlikely”: R. v. Beckwith, 2015 ONCA 588 (CanLII), para. 2; see also Summers,\nat para 71; R. v. Johnson, 2016 ONCA 69 (CanLII), at paras. 6-7; R. v. Rotman,\n2015 ONCA 663 (CanLII), at para. 18. While, as said, double jeopardy considerations preclude\nfurther punishment for a prior criminal record, depending on specific\ncircumstances, the record may inform a Court’s prospective view of the\nlikelihood of early parole. Because this offender’s prior history, his record\nand poor response to community supervision, tends toward the profile of a\ndedicated recidivist with limited rehabilitative potential, he is not clearly a\ncandidate for early release and accordingly a full enhancement of 1.5:1 credit\nis not supportable here.A court has\na discretion to impose consecutive sentences respecting discrete crimes: Criminal\nCode, s. 718.3(4)(c)(ii). Frequently, in the case of sentencing for\nrobbery, a companion conviction for a s. 351(2) offence is ordered to be served\nconcurrently. This is not always the case: R. v. Long, 2014 ONCA 10 (CanLII), at\nparas. 1-2; R. v. Carlson, [2002] O.J. No. 1884 (C.A.), at paras. 2,\n22-3. While keeping sight of the total sentence as a fit disposition (s.\n718.2(c)), consecutive sentences are justified here. The offender is a\nrecidivist respecting the commission of robbery while disguised. The masking of\nthe face in the current robbery served to defeat the store video security system.There is of\ncourse no invariable rule that a present sentence must be no shorter than a\nprevious disposition: R. v. Vincent, 2010 ONCA 332 (CanLII), at para. 3. That\nsaid, depending upon the circumstances of a particular case,“[i]t is not an error in principle for a sentencing judge to apply the concept\nof progressive punishment, so long as the sentence imposed is proportionate to\nthe gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.”: R.\nv. McBain, 2012 ABCA 104 (CanLII), at para. 5; see also R. v. Catenacci, 2012\nONCA 187 (CanLII), at para. 1; R. v. Yeck, 2011 ONCA 768 (CanLII), at para. 6; R. v.\nE.O., 2003 CanLII 2017 (ON CA), [2003] O.J. No. 563 (C.A.), at para. 15; R. v. Borde (2003),\n2003 CanLII 4187 (ON CA), 63 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.), at para. 39.Having\nregard to the facts of the offences and the gravity of the offender’s conduct\nin light of his past criminal history, the court imposes the following\nsentences.With credit\nfor 15 months of pre-sentence custody, on the robbery count, the offender is\nsentenced to a further 18 months on that charge.On count number\n2, the offender is sentenced to 6 months less 1 day to be served consecutively.\nWhile the effective sentence is about 3 years and 3 months, the imprisonment\nremaining to be served is 2 years less one day.In\naddition, on count number 1, an 18-month probation order on the mandatory\nstatutory terms set out in s. 732.1(2) of the Criminal Code will be\nimposed along with the following optional conditions:(1)report to probation services within 2 working days\nof release and thereafter as required by your probation officer;(2)abstain from the possession and consumption of\nalcohol;(3)abstain from the possession and consumption of drugs\nexcept in accordance with a medical prescription.It is\nexpected that the probation officer, to facilitate immediate deportation, will\non the appropriate date, apply to the court, pursuant to s. 732.2(3) of the Code\nto terminate the order.By way of\ncollateral orders, the offender is sentenced to life-long weapons prohibition\norders pursuant to ss. 109(2) and (3) of the Criminal Code. In addition,\nin respect of the armed robbery, a primary designated offence as defined in s.\n487.04 of the Code, there will be an Order pursuant to s. 487.051 for the\ntaking of samples for DNA analysis.The Warrant\nof Committal shall bear the endorsement that the Court recommends that the\noffender’s imprisonment be served at the Ontario Correctional Institute with a\nview to intensive anger management and substance abuse treatment.The\nSuperior Court of Justice Trial Coordinator in Brampton shall order a copy of\nthese reasons to be forwarded to the Ontario correctional authorities and to\nthe Peel Crown Attorney’s office (Attention: Tyler Powell) to be sent on to the\nrelevant immigration authorities....WHEREUPON\nTHIS MATTER WAS CONCLUDED.FORM 2Certificate of TranscriptEvidence Act,\nSubsection 5(2)I, Sherry\nMcHady, certify that this document is a true and accurate transcription of the\nrecording of R. v.

ButlerDate: 1984-09-04Docket: 1614Between:R.andButlerBayda, C.J.S., Brownridge and Tallis, JJ.A.Counsel:Carol A. Snell, for the appellant;Darrell J. Blais, for the respondent.[1]Brownridge, J.A.: The respondent was charged:“1. That he, the said William Ross Butler, on or about the\n21st day of August, A.D. 1983, at Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did\nendanger the life of Vivian Mattern thereby committing an aggravated assault,\ncontrary to s. 245.2(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada.“2. And further that he, the said William Ross Butler, on or\nabout the 21st day of August, A.D. 1983, at Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, did without lawful authority confine Vivian Mattern, contrary to s.\n247(2) of the Criminal Code of Canada.”[2]On April 11th, 1984, before Halvorson, J., he pleaded guilty to the\nlesser and included offence on Count one of assault causing bodily harm,\ncontrary to s. 245.3 of the Criminal Code of Canada. He also pleaded\nguilty to Count two.[3]In imposing sentence of thirty days concurrent on each charge the\nlearned trial judge said:“There may be some factors in favor of leniency in this case,\nbut the assault was too severe to be other than a jail term.“I know the Crown is requesting a substantial jail term which,\nagain, may very well be warranted by the severity of the assault. However,\ntaking into account some of Mr. Butler’s problems, and perhaps being some\nattempt by him now to do something about it, I am going to set a minimum jail\nterm.“I sentence you, Mr. Butler, to 30 days in the Correctional\nCentre.”[4]The Crown appeals against the said sentences on the grounds that the\nlearned trial judge failed to properly consider the seriousness of the offences\nand the previous record of the accused; and on the ground that the learned\ntrial judge failed to properly consider the deterrent aspect of the sentencing\nand the need for protecting the public.[5]The complainant is thirty-two years of age, four feet nine inches tall\nand weighs about eighty-nine pounds. She had known the accused about three\nyears; he had become her boy friend and they had been intimate. She was asked\nat the preliminary inquiry if she ever lived with him in a common-law\nrelationship and she answered: “Not really lived with him. He stayed at my\nplace for a couple of months.” That was in July and August, 1983, at the time\nof the assault.[6]They were not getting along well together and he was trying to find\nanother place to live. On August 21st, 1983, the complainant went to her\nsister’s shower party and afterward her mother, two sisters and her stepfather\nwent to a downtown restaurant. When she arrived the accused was already there,\nseated with her brother-in-law. She sat down at the same table but neither the\ncomplainant nor the accused spoke to each other. The accused left the\nrestaurant. About ten or fifteen minutes later the complainant left to go to a\nparty with some friends. She was offered a ride in a half-ton truck and\naccepted. When the driver of the truck stopped at a store to buy some\ncigarettes, the complainant remained in the truck. All of a sudden the door\nopened and the accused grabbed her by the hair and dragged her to his car. She\nstruggled to get out of the car but he held her by the hair. He hit her in the\nmouth with the back of his hand causing some bleeding. He became angry at the\nbleeding and told her not to get blood in his car. He then hit her again on the\nside of the head. He drove out of town to a gravel pit and dragged her out of\nthe truck and pushed her against the side of the car. She testified: “he told\nme it’d be a long time before they found my body, so I didn’t think I was gonna\nget out of there alive, that’s for sure.” The complainant said she was struck\nfour or five times during the time that she was with him and then he drove her\nback to the restaurant where she had parked her car. She was taken to the\nhospital but released a short time later in care of her sister where she spent\nthe next couple of days.[7]The complainant testified that she lost a lot of hair, received black\neyes, a swollen mouth and bruises all over her body. The photographs confirm\nthis.[8]She said that she had gone out with the accused since the assault but\nwhen asked about their present relationship she answered: “I don’t know ‘cause\nwe haven’t seen each other for a while”. They now live in separate residences.[9]Butler is twenty-eight years of age. He completed grade ten. For eight\nyears he lived with a woman and her two children by a previous relationship.\nThere was one child bom of their relationship who is now eight years old.\nDuring this time they were able to purchase a new home together, as well as a\ntractor-trailer unit which Mr. Butler used to get into his own business. During\nhis travels he met the complainant and a relationship developed between them. Butler separated from the woman he had been living with and moved to Regina. He was unable\nto find work and had to sell his home. He later found employment and is\npresently negotiating the purchase of a tractor-trailer unit with which he\nhopes to again establish himself in the transportation business.[10]The record of the respondent is as follows:1974Poss. of NarcoticConditional discharge for 1 year.1976Assault Peace Officer21 days intermittently and 6 mos probation - Appealed1977Sentence varied on appeal to fine of $400. and in default -60 days1980Refuse to provide breath sample$300. and in default, 1 monthObstruct Peace Officer$200. and in default, 14 days[11]In my opinion the Crown appeal is well founded and, with deference to\nthe learned trial judge, the sentence which he imposed is inadequate under the\ncircumstances. The nature and extent of the assault together with the forced\nconfinement of the complainant and the record of the accused might well have\nmerited a sentence of six months’ imprisonment. However, I am reluctant to\nimpose such a sentence at this stage because the accused has already served the\nsentence imposed upon him at the trial; he has taken some positive steps toward\nhis rehabilitation; and the relationship between the complainant and the\naccused must not be overlooked, particularly when she is apparently agreeable\nto some form of reconciliation. Counsel for the respondent has set out in his\nfactum the present relationship between the parties as follows:“Both individuals drank heavily, but have, since this\nincident, been trying to work out their problems through a combination of\nattendance at Alcoholic’s Anonymous and self-control. They have also discussed\ntaking family counselling together. It is important to point out that, since\nMr. Butler’s release, both he and the complainant have continued to see each\nother, on one occasion coming together to the Legal Aid Office.”[12]Accordingly, I would increase the sentence from thirty days to ninety\ndays.[13]This order shall not go into effect for four days to enable the\nrespondent to apply for an order directing that the sentence be served\nintermittently.[14]Following his release from prison the respondent shall be placed on\nprobation for a period of six months during which time he shall keep the peace\nand be of good behaviour and report as and when required by the Chief Probation\nOfficer.Appeal allowed."}

J.(SENTENCE)INTRODUCTION:[1]Mr. Williams is forty-two years of\nage.From his mid-teens until 2009, he committed numerous offences.He also\nhad serious substance abuse difficulties.Today, Mr. Williams owns his own\nbusiness, is getting married and is expecting a child.[2]Mr. Williams has\npleaded guilty to the offences of assault, breach of probation and failure to\nappear in court, contrary to sections 145(5), 266(b) and 733.1(1) of the Criminal\nCode of Canada, RSC 1985. These offences occurred in 2009.The Crown\nproceeded by way of summary conviction in relation to each charge.[3]The sole issue\nfor determination is the imposition of an appropriate sentence for these\noffences. Both counsel submitted that a period of imprisonment should be\nimposed, though they differed on whether a conditional period of imprisonment\nwas appropriate.A joint submission was not presented.[4]I am unable to\naccept either submission.I have concluded that despite Mr. Williams’ previous\nconvictions this is an appropriate case for sentence to be suspended and for a\nprobation order of twelve months in length to be imposed.I have reached this\nconclusion because Mr. Williams has through his own efforts illustrated that\nthere are reasonable alternatives to the imposition of a period of\nimprisonment. As Mr. Williams said at the sentence hearing, his “life is\ntotally different” now than it was five years ago.[5]I have also\nconcluded that the Increasing Offenders’ Accountability for Victims Act,\nS.C. 2013, c. 11, has prospective effect only and that a retrospective\napplication of the Increasing Offenders’ Accountability for Victims Act\nwould offend section 11(i) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[6]Let me explain my\nreasons for these conclusions by commencing with a review of the circumstances\nof the offences committed by Mr. Williams.THE\nCIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCES[7]On April 8, 2009,\nthe police received a complaint concerning Mr. Williams’ actions inside a\nresidence in Corner Brook (Ms. Diamond’s). When the police arrived at the\nresidence, they saw Mr. Williams leaving the residence. He was under the\ninfluence of alcohol.While inside the residence, Mr. Williams had pulled Ms.\nDiamond’s hair and broken a window.[8]At the time, Mr.\nWilliams was bound by a probation order, issued on February 10, 2009, which\nrequired that he “abstain from drinking alcohol.”[9]Mr. Williams was\narrested and released on a recognizance, which required that he appear in the Provincial Court on May 26, 2009.Mr. Williams failed to appear and a warrant was issued\nfor his arrest.On January 21, 2013, Mr. Williams went to the police station.He was arrested.[10]In R. v.\nLundrigan, 2012 NLCA 43 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal indicated that a “fit\nsentence” is one “that takes account of the circumstances of the offences and\nthe offender.”THE\nCIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER[11]Mr. Williams is\nforty-two years of age.He was born in Corner Brook and advised the author of\nthe pre-sentence report that he had “a positive and loving upbringing without\nissues such as family violence, instability and so on.”Mr. Williams also\nindicated to the author of the pre-sentence report that the use of drugs has\nhad a significant impact upon his life:Following Grade 10, the defendant says that\nhis life began to spiral out of control, largely due to the influence of\nillicit drugs.He quit school in 1988 or 1989 (when he was about 16 years old)\nas a result of the advent of his illicit drug use (marijuana).It was at that\ntime that Mr. WILLIAMS travelled to Kitchener, ON to work.He stayed there for\nthree months before returning to Corner Brook.He notes that it was around\nthis time that he and his father started experiencing relationship issues,\nincluding arguing, bickering and so on. This change of relationship was likely\nthe result of Peter WILLIAMS’ drug use and the hastened end of his high school\ncareer.He later relocated to British Columbia in 1991 for employment\npurposes.He started using crack cocaine at that time.The defendant remained\nin British Columbia for approximately five years.Mr. WILLIAMS moved to Ontario in 1996 where he states he began to sell drugs.He remained in Ontario,\nspecifically in the Scarborough area, for 11 years until his return to Newfoundland and Labrador in 2007, where he has remained since.[12]Mr. Williams has a\nnumber of previous convictions.These include convictions for the offences of\nassault and breach of probation. These occurred in 2002.His last conviction\nwas in 2009, for having violated section 253(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.[13]Mr. Williams is\nself-employed.He works as a contractor installing roofing systems on residential\nstructures.He has two employees and is presently involved in completing three\ncontracts.[14]Mr. Williams is presently\ninvolved in a relationship with Ms. Candice Burden.Ms. Burden is a registered\nnurse and has two children from a previous relationship. The pre-sentence\nreport notes that Ms. Burden “is pregnant with Mr. Williams’ child.The baby\nis due in March, 2014 and is the couple’s first child together.” Mr. Williams\nhas two children from earlier relationships and is paying child support.[15]The author of the\npre-sentence report concludes that Mr. Williams “is considered a guardedly suitable\ncandidate for community-based supervision\", but “not a suitable candidate”\nfor a community service placement:In consideration of the above-noted, this\ndefendant is considered a guardedly suitable candidate for community-based\nsupervision, as a sentence in and of itself or in conjunction with other\nsanctions.This will enable the defendant to be supervised while providing him\nthe opportunity to remain in the community employed, with the goal of\naddressing his present circumstances and behaviour and decreasing any future\ncriminal activity.Any community-based intervention imposed in this\ndefendant’s case will address those issues of significance identified earlier\nin this Report as well as any which may be identified subsequent to sentencing.Arranging suitable CSO placements for\nindividuals subject to community-based supervision has proven increasingly\ndifficult in the past number of years in local areas.The nature of the\ndefendant’s offence background (if it includes convictions/findings of guilt\nfor violent offenses) can aggravate this difficulty.Peter WILLIAMS is\ntherefore not considered a suitable candidate for the CSO Program.THE\nPRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[16]It has been held\nthat the “sentencing process” is “profoundly contextual” in “nature” (see R.\nv. Webber, 2013 ABCA 189 (CanLII)).[17]Section 718 of the\nCriminal Code states that the fundamental purpose of sentencing \"is\nto contribute...to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful,\nand safe society.\"This is to be achieved by imposing sentences which\nhave, among other objectives, the objectives of:-separating\noffenders from society, where necessary;-denouncing\nunlawful conduct;-general\ndeterrence;-rehabilitation;\nand-the\npromoting of a \"sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement\nof the harm done to victims and the community.\"[18]Section 718.2(b)\nof the Criminal Code states that \"a sentence should be similar to\nsentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in\nsimilar circumstances.\"[19]Section 718.1 of\nthe Criminal Code states that any sentence imposed must be\n\"proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender.”In R. v. Cluney, 2013 NLCA 46 (CanLII),\nthe Court of Appeal, at paragraph 16, indicated that the “principle of\nproportionality applies to sentencing for all criminal offences…The appropriate\nrange of sentence is related to the gravity of the offence and the moral\nblameworthiness of the offender.”[20]Section 718.2(a)\nof the Criminal Code indicates that a \"sentence should be increased\nor reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances\nrelating to the offence or the offender.\" In R. v. Briand,\n2010 NLCA 67 (CanLII), [2010] N.J. No. 339\n(C.A.), the Court of Appeal stressed the importance of considering an offender's personal circumstances in applying section 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code.[21]Section 718.2(d)\nstates that \"an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less\nrestrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances\" and section\n718.2(e) states that \"all available sanctions other than imprisonment that\nare reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders,\nwith particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.\"[22]In R. v.\nBranton, 2013 NLCA 61 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal pointed out, at paragraph\n18, that “sentencing judges enjoy a broad discretion to craft a sentence that\nis tailored to the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the offender\nand that a sentencing judge has the discretion to decide on the particular\nblend of sentencing goals and the weight to be given to relevant aggravating or\nmitigating factors to decide each particular case (R. v. M.(C.A.),\n1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 91 and Nasogaluak at para. 43). However,\nthis discretion is constrained by statute and fettered by binding\njurisprudence, as the Nasogaluak court recognized in deciding that a\njudge’s discretion does not extend so far as to override a clear statement of\nlegislative intent (paragraph 45).”THE STATUTORY REGIME[23]As\nstated earlier, the Crown proceeded by way of summary conviction in relation to\neach of the offences committed by Mr. Williams.As a result, the\nmaximum sentence which can be imposed for each of these offences is a period of\nimprisonment “not exceeding six months.”THE\nPOSITIONS OF THE PARTIES[24]As pointed out\nearlier, both counsel recommended that a period of imprisonment be imposed.THE CROWN:[25]The Crown submitted that a\nperiod of forty-five to sixty days incarceration should be imposed.Ms. St.\nCroix referred to Mr. Williams’ related criminal record and the need to stress\nthe sentencing principle of deterrence.Ms. St. Croix indicated that the Crown\nhad no objection to an intermittent sentence being imposed, but did “not\nsupport” a conditional period of imprisonment.The Crown also sought the\nimposition of a period of probation with a condition that Mr. Williams abstain\nfrom the possession or use of drugs or alcohol.The Crown did not seek any\nancillary orders and thus I need not concern myself with whether a DNA order or\na weapon prohibition should issue.MR. WILLIAMS:[26]Mr. Williams took no exception\nto the range of sentence recommended by the Crown or to the period of probation\nsought.Mr. Luscombe argued that based upon Mr. Williams’ own efforts at\nrehabilitation and his present employment, that a conditional period of\nimprisonment should be imposed. Mr. Luscombe agreed that victim surcharges\nshould be imposed.THE RANGE OF SENTENCE[27]In R. v. Oake, 2010 NLCA 19 (CanLII), [2010] N.J. No. 94, the\nCourt of Appeal indicated that a judge has a duty \"to impose sentences in\nline with precedent, noting always that for each offence and each offender some\nelements are unique.\"In Cluney, the Court of Appeal indicated\nthat while sentencing ranges “are merely guidelines rather than hard and fast\nrules, a judge ordering a sentence outside the regular range should explain how\nit is in accordance with the principles and objectives of sentencing.”SENTENCING\nPRECEDENTS[28]Let us now consider applicable\nsentencing precedents for the three offences committed by Mr. Williams,\ncommencing with the assault offence.ASSAULT[29]In R. v. Norman,\n[2011] N.J. No. 214 (P.C.), I had the opportunity to consider a number of\nsentencing precedents for the offence of assault.I summarized them in the\nfollowing manner:In summary, these precedents illustrate a range of a\nconditional discharge [Koc, [2008] N.J. No. 161, for striking the\nvictim in the face with a glass]; a suspended sentence [S.G.,\n[2006] N.J. No. 266, for forcing the victim against a wall and Wells,\n[2011] N.J. No. 140, for punching a person on the side of his head]; 20 days\nimprisonment [Coleman, [2010] N.J. No. 87, for grabbing the\nvictim by the hair]; 3 months imprisonment [Newman, [2009] N.J.\nNo. 201, for throwing the victim against a wall]; 5 months imprisonment [Manning,\n2009 CanLII 33466 (NL PC), [2009] N.J. No. 167, for striking the victim in the face]; to 6 months imprisonment\n[Hickey, [2010] N.J. No. 88, for making a gesture \"with his\narm across his neck when he uttered the threat\" and Lyver, [2010]\nN.J. No. 92, for having assaulted the victim on two occasions after forcing his\nway into her residence while having his face concealed].[30]In R.\nv. Marche, [2013] N.J. No. 222 (P.C.), the offender pleaded guilty to\nthe offence of assault.The offender came across his former spouse and the victim (Mr. Byrne)\nparked in a motor vehicle.He “smashed the driver’s side window of Mr. Byrne’s\nvehicle with a hammer and repeatedly struck Mr. Byrne with a closed fist.Mr.\nByrne suffered a cut to his neck; scratches to his face; and a swollen eye.His glasses were broken.” I endorsed a joint submission seeking a conditional\ndischarge. The circumstances of the assault committed by Mr. Marche are\nsignificantly more serious than the assault committed here by Mr. Williams.BREACH OF\nPROBATION[31]In R. v.\nHutchings, 2012 NLCA 2 (CanLII), [2012] N.J. No. 12, the Court of Appeal indicated that the\nrange of sentence for the offence of breach of probation “can range between one\nmonth and sometimes less to upwards of six months. See Murphy (six\nmonths); Oxford (three months).In Oxford, the Court\naccepted statements in prior cases that sentences for non-compliance with\nprobation orders could be one month or less even where there are prior\nconvictions.\"[32]In R.\nv. Murphy, 2011 NLCA 16 (CanLII), [2011] N.J. No. 43,\nthe Court of Appeal in considering the principles to be applied when imposing\nsentence for breaches of court orders indicated that while \"failure to\nrespect and comply with a court order is a serious matter, it is, nonetheless,\nby its nature such as to warrant a more gradual, rather than a sudden,\nsubstantial increase in penalty.\" The Court of Appeal noted that generally,\n\"a sentence in the range of one to three months imprisonment, or up to six\nmonths where the Crown proceeds by way of indictment, is imposed for the breach\nof a probation order.\"[33]In Branton, it\nwas held that the “one-month consecutive sentence for Mr. Branton’s breach of\nprobation is not contested, and it is in accordance with the principles set out\nby Welsh J.A. in R. v. Murphy…”FAILURE TO\nAPPEAR IN COURT[34]In R. v.\nWilliams, [2007] N.J. No. 97 (P.C.), I had the opportunity to consider\nsentencing for the offence of failing to appear in court and a Consultation Paper on Bail Act Offences\nwhich was prepared for the Sentencing Guideline Council of the United Kingdom.\nThat consultation paper noted that the degree of harm caused by the offence of\nfailing to appear in court \"will vary considerably depending on the\nparticular circumstances surrounding the offence\", but that such offences\n\"can undermine public confidence in the courts.\"In Williams,\nfor the offence of failure to appear in court, I imposed a period of one day\n(his appearance in court) imprisonment.[35]In R. v. Cox, [2009] N.J. No. 333\n(P.C.), Judge Porter considered the range of sentence for the offence of\nfailure to appear in court and imposed a period of three months imprisonment.ANALYSIS[36]Mr. Williams has pleaded\nguilty to three offences and he has a related criminal record.The assault\noffence occurred inside the victim’s residence while Mr. Williams was bound by\na probation order.After being arrested and released he failed to appear in\ncourt as required.This combination of factors will normally result in a\nperiod of imprisonment being imposed.The key word being “normally.”[37]Every\nsentencing decision must reflect the applicable sentencing precedents and\nprinciples. It must also, however, “take into account the correctional\nimperative of sentence individualization\" (see R. v.\nKnott, 2012 SCC 42 (CanLII)).It\nmust be understood that the “administration of the criminal law involves\nindividualised justice, the attainment of which is acknowledged to involve the\nexercise of a wide sentencing discretion” (see Elias\nv. The Queen; Issa v. The Queen\n[2013] HCA 31, at paragraph 27).The question must always be: is the\nsentence imposed “fit in the circumstances”? (see R. v. Bacon, [2013]\nB.C.J. No. 1999 (C.A.), at paragraph 40).[38]In this case, Mr.\nWilliams has not committed an offence since 2009.He has abstained from the\nconsumption of alcohol since 2011. He is involved in a stable relationship and\nowns his own company.He has turned his life around and become a contributing\nmember of our community.Surely these factors should be reflected in the\nexercise of judicial discretion in the imposition of sentence.[39]In the specific\ncircumstances of this case, I conclude that there is a reasonable alternative to\nthe imposition of a period of imprisonment.As a result, sentence is hereby\nsuspended and Mr. Williams is placed on probation for a period of twelve\nmonths.[40]In addition to the statutory\nconditions which apply, Mr. Williams must:-report to a probation officer in\nperson as required;-refrain from the possession or\nconsumption of alcohol or any substance listed in the Controlled Drugs and\nSubstances Act;-comply with all directions received\nfrom his probation officer; and-attend all counselling or treatment\nsessions arranged by his probation officer.A VICTIM SURCHARGE[41]Mr. Williams agreed that victim\nsurcharges should be imposed.Determining the amount of those surcharges\nrequires determining whether the Increasing Offenders’ Accountability for\nVictims Act applies to the offences committed by Mr. Williams.[42]As we have seen, the offences\ncommitted by Mr. Williams occurred in 2009.On October 24, 2013, the Increasing\nOffenders’ Accountability for Victims Act was proclaimed into force.This\nlegislation has dramatically altered the law in relation to the imposition of\nvictim surcharges.For instance, in addition to increasing the amount of the minimum\nsurcharge imposed, it has made their imposition mandatory. Section 3 of the Increasing Offenders’ Accountability for Victims Act repealed\nsections 737(5) and (6) of the Criminal Code.Those provisions had allowed\na Court to waive the imposition of the victim surcharge if imposing it would have\ncaused an offender “undue hardship.” As a result, a victim surcharge must now be\nimposed for all breaches of the Criminal Code and the Controlled\nDrugs and Substances Act, RSC 1985, regardless of an offender’s ability to\npay.[43]Interestingly, the authority\nto set the time in which a victim surcharge is to be paid, when a fine is not\nimposed, resides with the provinces.As a result of section 737(4) of the Criminal Code,\nif a fine is imposed the\nvictim surcharge must be paid “at the time at which the fine imposed for the\noffence is payable.”However, if a fine is not imposed, then section 737(4)\nmandates that the victim surcharge must be paid “within the time established by\nthe lieutenant governor in council of the province in which the surcharge is\nimposed.”[44]In this Province, if a fine is\nnot imposed, then according to section 2 of the Victim Surcharge Order,\nO.C. 96-11, a court that imposes a victim surcharge must order that the victim\nsurcharge be paid “within 30 days of the date of conviction or discharge of the\noffence.” As a result, those offenders who are convicted of a summary\nconviction offence for which a fine is not imposed (including those cases in\nwhich a fine is not imposed because of an inability to pay) must now pay a\nminimum victim surcharge of $100.00 within thirty days of their conviction or\ndischarge.The Court has no authority to grant a longer period to pay the victim\nsurcharge at the time sentence is imposed.[45]In summary, because I am not\nimposing a fine, if the Increasing Offenders’ Accountability for Victims Act\napplies, I must impose a minimum surcharge of $100.00.This cannot be waived,\nregardless of inability to pay.If the Increasing Offenders’ Accountability\nfor Victims Act does not apply, I must impose a minimum surcharge of\n$50.00.This can be waived if undue hardship is established.In either case,\naccording to the Victim Surcharge Order, the surcharge must be\npaid within thirty days of the date of conviction or discharge.[46]What if a fine is not imposed,\nbut sentence is imposed more than thirty days after conviction?By when would\nany victim surcharge imposed have to be paid?RETROSPECTIVE OR PROSPECTIVE EFFECT[47]Because Mr. Williams’ offences\nwere committed prior to the proclamation of the Increasing Offenders’\nAccountability for Victims Act, the question in this case becomes: does\nthis legislation apply retrospectively?If it does, what about section 11(i)\nof the Charter (“if found guilty of the offence and\nif the punishment for the offence has been varied between the time of\ncommission and the time of sentencing, to the benefit of the lesser punishment”)?Let us start with the retrospective\napplication question.Note that the Increasing Offenders’ Accountability\nfor Victims Act is silent on this issue.[48]In R. v. Dinley,\n2012 SCC 58 (CanLII), [2012] 3 S.C.R. 272, the Supreme Court of Canada considered whether certain provisions of the Tackling\nViolent Crime Act operated retrospectively.The Court held, at paragraph 10, that “courts have long\nrecognized that the cases in which legislation has retrospective effect must be\nexceptional.More specifically, where legislative provisions affect either\nvested or substantive rights, retrospectivity has been found to be undesirable.New legislation that affects substantive rights will be presumed to have only\nprospective effect unless it is possible to discern a clear legislative intent\nthat it is to apply retrospectively.”[49]In R. v.\nClarke, [2013] O.J. No. 94 (C.A.), the offender committed a number of offences\nprior to the enactment of the Truth in Sentencing Act.However, he was\nnot charged with those offences until after the Act came into force.The Ontario\nCourt of Appeal was asked to consider whether the changes to the manner in\nwhich pre-sentence custody was to be calculated as a result of enactment of the\nTruth in Sentencing Act applied to the sentencing of this offender.[50]In considering this\nquestion, the Ontario Court of Appeal noted that one of the “cardinal” principles applicable\nto determining when new legislation applies “is that a person convicted of a\ncriminal offence should ordinarily be sentenced under the provisions in place\nwhen the offence was committed: R. v. Johnson, 2003 SCC 46 (CanLII), [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357,\nat para. 41. This principle is but an example of the broader principle that\nlegislation affecting substantive rights should be presumed not to apply\nretrospectively: R. v. Dineley, 2012 SCC 58 (CanLII), at\npara. 10.” The Ontario Court of Appeal, however, also noted in Clarke that\n“the presumption against retrospectivity can be displaced by a clear\nlegislative intent that a provision is to apply retrospectively.”[51]In R. v.\nMacIsaac, [2013] N.J. No. 233, the Court of Appeal of this Province\nindicated that it disagreed with the conclusion reached in Clarke,but it expressed no disagreement with Clarke’s reference to the\ngeneral principle against retrospective application of substantive effecting\nlegislation.[52]In R. v. Johnson, 2003 SCC 46 (CanLII), [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357,\nthe Supreme Court of Canada considered the issue of whether “the long-term\noffender provisions which were absent in the pre-1997 legislation, are\navailable in instances in which the predicate offence occurred prior to the\n1997 amendments.” In considering this issue, the Court pointed out that as “a general matter, persons accused of criminal conduct are\nto be charged and sentenced under the criminal law provisions in place at the\ntime that the offence allegedly was committed.”[53]As pointed out\nearlier, the Increasing Offenders’ Accountability for Victims Act is silent on the issue of retrospective effect. Thus,\nthe presumption that legislation affecting substantive rights only applies prospectively is\nnot displaced by the legislation.[54]I am satisfied that\nthe Increasing Offenders’\nAccountability for Victims Act affects substantive rights and in the absence of a\nlegislative intent for it to apply retrospectively, it has prospective effect\nonly, i.e., it only applies to those who committed an offence after its coming\ninto force.SECTION 11(i) OF THE\nCHARTER[55]If I had concluded to the contrary,\nI would then have to have considered section 11(i) of the Charter, which\nstates:Any person charged with an offence has the rightif found guilty of the offence and if the\npunishment for the offence has been varied between the time of commission and\nthe time of sentencing, to the benefit of the lesser punishment.[56]In R. v. Rodgers,\n2006 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2006] 1 S.C.R. 554, the Supreme Court of Canada considered “the constitutionality of\nthe DNA data bank provision contained in s. 487.055 of the Criminal Code,\nR.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, which permits a provincial court judge, on ex parte\napplication, to authorize the collection of DNA samples from three classes of\npreviously convicted and sentenced offenders.”This included a consideration\nof whether the legislation violated section 11(i) of the Charter.[57]In Rodgers,\nthe Court in considering whether the legislation offended section\n11(i) of the Charter stressed the importance of differentiating between\nthe “consequences” of a conviction and the “punishment” imposed as a result of\na conviction (at paragraphs 62 and 63):In its ordinary sense,\n\"punishment\" refers to the arsenal of sanctions to which an accused\nmay be liable upon conviction for a particular offence. The Criminal Code uses the\nwords \"punishment\" or \"punishable\" to describe the range of\nsanctions available on sentencing. For example, an offence will be described as\n\"punishable\" on summary conviction and the offender will be\n\"liable to a fine ... or [a term of] imprisonment\": s. 787(1).\nSection 718.3(1) provides that \"[w]here an enactment prescribes different\ndegrees or kinds of punishment\nin respect of an offence, the punishment\nto be imposed is, subject to the limitations prescribed in the enactment, in\nthe discretion of the court that convicts a person who commits the\noffence\". The words \"sentence\" and \"sanction\" are also\nused interchangeably: see for example s. 718.2.This does not mean, however, that\n\"punishment\" under ss. 11(h) and 11(i)\nnecessarily encompasses every potential consequence of being convicted of a\ncriminal offence, whether that consequence occurs at the time of sentencing or\nnot. A number of orders can be made by a sentencing court, for example an order\nfor forfeiture, a firearm prohibition, a driving prohibition, or an order for\nrestitution. It is beyond the purview of this appeal to determine whether or\nnot any of these consequences constitutes a punishment. As a general rule, it\nseems to me that the consequence will constitute a punishment when it forms\npart of the arsenal of sanctions to which an accused may be liable in respect\nof a particular offence and the sanction is one imposed in furtherance of the\npurpose and principles of sentencing. In this respect, the protection afforded\nby s. 11 must be contrasted with s. 12 of the Charter that protects against cruel and\nunusual \"treatment\" or punishment. For example, DNA sampling, ordered\nas a consequence of conviction, would undoubtedly constitute a\n\"treatment\" and, if the physical method for obtaining a DNA sample were\ncruel and unusual, redress could be obtained under s. 12.[58]Thus, the key\nquestion when legislation which applies retrospectively is scrutinized for\ncompliance with section 11(i) of the Charter is whether the legislation\nseeks to impose a consequence for conviction which “forms part of the arsenal\nof sanctions to which an accused may be liable in respect of a particular\noffence and the sanction is one imposed in furtherance of the purpose and\nprinciples of sentencing.”[59]I conclude that a victim surcharge forms part of the\narsenal of sanctions and it is imposed in furtherance of the purpose and\nprinciples of sentencing, namely to promote an offender’s accountability for\nher or his offence and to acknowledge the harm they have caused to the victim\nand the community (see section 718(f) of the Criminal Code).Interestingly,\nsection 673(b) of the Criminal Code defines “sentence” to include an\norder issued pursuant to section 737(3) of the Criminal Code.[60]For these reasons, I conclude\nthat the imposition of a victim surcharge pursuant to the Increasing Offenders’\nAccountability for Victims Act constitutes a variation in punishment within\nthe meaning of section 11(i) of the Charter (in MacIsaac,\nthe Court of Appeal noted that removing a judge’s discretion as regards punishment\ncan constitute a variation within the meaning of section 11(i) of the Charter)\nand thus Mr. Williams would have had a constitutionally protected right to the\nbenefit of the lesser punishment which was in existence at the time he\ncommitted his offences if I had found the Increasing Offenders’\nAccountability for Victims Act to have retrospective effect.[61]Considering Mr. Williams’\nfinancial circumstances and his significant debts, I have decided to impose a\n$50.00 surcharge in relation to each offence.Mr. Williams has thirty days to\npay the victim surcharges imposed.CONCLUSION[62]For the reasons\nprovided, sentence is suspended and Mr. Williams is placed on probation for a\nperiod of twelve months.[63]Judgment accordingly."}

Cedro,for Mr. Pich)))HEARD:February 18, 2015M. Forestell J.REASONS FOR SENTENCINGOffences[1]Mr. Pich was found guilty of several offences:four counts of robbery,\none count of using an imitation firearm in a robbery, disguising with intent,\nforcible confinement and assault with a weapon.[2]On February 18, 2015 I heard submissions on sentencing and reserved my\ndecision on sentencing until today.Circumstances of the Offences[3]The circumstances of the offences are set out in detail in my reasons\nfor judgment dated December 1, 2014.I will state them briefly here.On\nJanuary 25, 2012, Mr. Pich, along with four other men committed a robbery at\nthe Lobster Trap Restaurant.The four counts of robbery relate to the eleven\nindividuals who were the victims of the robbery that night.One of the men was\narmed with an imitation firearm.Another had a knife.All of the men who\nentered the restaurant and participated in the robbery covered their faces.During the robbery one of the patrons suffered a minor cut.As I indicated in\nmy reasons for judgment, I cannot determine the precise role played by Mr. Pich\nduring the robbery but I am satisfied that he was a party to the robbery.I am\nsatisfied that he was an integral part of the planning of the robbery because\nhe had worked at the restaurant and knew the routine and layout of the\nrestaurant.I am also satisfied that he drove the participants to and from the\nrobbery.Victim Impact[4]I have considered the Victim Impact Statements filed by Ms. Bocher and\nMr. Wu.I have also considered the evidence of the other victims of the\noffences who testified that they were understandably terrified by the robbery\nand forcible confinement.Circumstances of Mr. Pich[5]Mr. Pich is a 26 year-old first offender.He was 23 at the time of\nthese offences.He lives at home with his mother, stepfather and sister.He\ncompleted high school in 2007.In December 2012 Mr. Pich completed the Police\nFoundations Program at Seneca College.He was employed at part-time jobs from\n2006 to 2011.[6]The Pre-sentence Report for Mr. Pich was favourable.It notes that Mr. Pich\nhas a very supportive family.As Crown counsel fairly pointed out in his submissions,\nMr. Pich has been accompanied by his mother on most days if not every day\nof the trial proceedings.[7]The Pre-sentence Report notes that Mr. Pich’s family has not had any\nconflict with the law and they were shocked by Mr. Pich’s arrest.The extended\nfamily has rallied around Mr. Pich since his release on bail.In his interaction\nwith the probation officer who prepared the presentence report Mr. Pich\nexpressed remorse for his conduct.He also expressed remorse when he addressed\nme after the sentencing submissions of counsel.Mr. Pich appears to be sincere\nin his expression of remorse. Mr. Pich in the interview with the probation\nofficer and his remarks to the court said that his motivation for the\ncommission of the offences, was that he wished to ‘fit in’ or gain the respect\nof his group of friends at the time.He said that he has come to understand\nthat the respect of his family is far more important.He acknowledged the\nimpact of his conduct on the victims of the offences and also on his family.[8]Mr. Pich spent 5 days in pre-trial custody and he has spent just over\nthree years and one month on a strict bail.He was required to live with his parents\nand not to be out of his residence except in the company of one of his sureties\nor designated family members and only for court, visits to his lawyer’s office,\ncounselling appointments or school.[9]During his time on a house arrest bail, Mr. Pich completed his college\nprogramme and helped his family members.He attended some counselling sessions\narranged by his mother. Mr. Pich is reported to have had contact with a limited\nnumber of close friends who came to his home to spend time with him.He is\nreported generally to have used the time on the house arrest bail to begin a\nprocess of rehabilitation by working on school and his relationship with his\nfamily and close friends. The probation officer who authored the pre-sentence\nreport noted that the collateral sources interviewed all shared the view that\nMr. Pich has matured over the three years that he has been on bail.Positions of the Parties[10]The Crown submits that a sentence of 4 years’ imprisonment should be\nimposed on Mr. Pich in light of the seriousness of the offences, the breach of\ntrust involved and the four year sentence imposed on a co-accused who entered a\nguilty plea before trial.[11]Counsel for Mr. Pich submits that, after credit for the time spent on\nstrict bail I should impose a reformatory sentence in light of Mr. Pich’s\nstrong family support, his youth, his remorse, his good conduct on bail and his\nstrong prospects for rehabilitation.[12]In these reasons I will address the appropriate sentence to be imposed\ngiven the circumstances of this offender and this offence and the credit that\nshould be given for pre-trial custody and strict bail conditions.1.The appropriate sentence to be imposed given the circumstances of\nthis offender and this offence[13]In considering the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Mr. Pich I have\nconsidered the general purposes, principles and objectives of sentencing, set\nout in the Criminal Code. The fundamental principle of sentencing set\nout in s. 718.1 of the Code requires that the sentence be proportionate\nto the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.[14]Section 718 of the Criminal Code identifies the objectives of\nsentencing, including denunciation, specific and general deterrence, separation\nof the offender from society and the rehabilitation of the offender.[15]I have also considered s. 718.2 of the Code which requires\nthat I take into account other principles, including that a sentence may be\nincreased or decreased depending upon the presence of any relevant aggravating\nor mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender.[16]There are several aggravating factors in this case.Mr. Pich was a\nformer employee of the restaurant that was robbed and his participation in the\noffences was a breach of trust. There were multiple victims of the robbery and\nweapons, including an imitation firearm,were used to threaten the victims.[17]Mitigating factors are also present. Mr. Pich is a youthful first\noffender.The offence is out of character for Mr. Pich who has otherwise been\na person of good character and who has no history of criminality or violence.\nMr. Pich has shown remorse for his actions and has begun to rehabilitate\nhimself during his time on a restrictive bail.[18]In R. v. Hatimy,[1]\na case that is similar (although not identical) to the one before me, Campbell J.\ndescribed the conflicting sentencing principles he faced as follows:46This is a case where there are\nconflicting sentencing principles to try to balance and ultimately reconcile.47The accused is a youthful first\noffender with very promising prospects for rehabilitation. His involvement in\nthe robbery seems out of character for him. As the author of the Pre-Sentence\nReport has concluded, the accused appears to pose no imminent or ongoing threat\nto the community. Hopefully, in years to come, the accused will be able to look\nback on his participation in this robbery as an aberrant embarrassment of his\nyouth, with no lasting consequences on his productive participation in society.\nIn these circumstances, rehabilitation and individual deterrence are generally\nconsidered to be the main sentencing considerations, and usually shorter terms\nof imprisonment are imposed, followed by probationary assistance. See: R. v.\nStein (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 376 (Ont.C.A.); R. v. Vandale and\nMaciejewski (1974), 21 C.C.C. (2d) 250 (Ont.C.A.); R. v. Demeter and\nWhitmore (1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 379 (Ont.C.A.); R. v. Priest (1996),\n1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA), 30 O.R. (3d) 538, 110 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont.C.A.).48At the same time, the accused has\nbeen found guilty of participating in a planned and deliberate robbery that\ninvolved violence and the use of an imitation firearm. This was a serious\ncrime, with the inherent potential for significant personal injuries being\nsuffered by all of the participants - victims and perpetrators alike. The sheer\ngravity of such crimes requires sentences that appropriately denounce this kind\nof criminal conduct, and which deters others from committing similar such\noffences. These kinds of crimes usually require the imposition of more lengthy\ncustodial dispositions, even in the case of youthful first offenders. See: R.\nv. Gonidis, McCullough and Stevenson (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 90 (Ont.C.A.);\nR. v. Campbell (1981), 1981 CanLII 486 (BC CA), 64 C.C.C. (2d) 336 (B.C.C.A.).[19]In R. v. Hatimy, Justice Campbell resolved the conflicting\nsentencing principles by imposing a reformatory sentence followed by two years of\nprobation.[20]As explained by Campbell J., although deterrence, denunciation and the\nprotection of the public are the paramount objectives in sentencing for this\ntype of offence, rehabilitation remains a valid sentencing objective\nparticularly in the case of a first offender.[21]It is recognized that where a custodial sentence must be imposed on a\nyouthful first offender, the sentence should be a short as possible.[2]The Court of Appeal has held that sentences at the lower end of the range may\nbe appropriate for youthful first offenders with good prospects for\nrehabilitation[3].[22]The principle of parity demands that a sentence should be similar to\nsentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences in similar\ncircumstances.In this case, a sentence of 4 years was imposed on a co-accused\nwho entered a guilty plea before trial.The sentence was imposed as a result\nof a joint submission.The co-accused was younger than Mr. Pich and there was\nno breach of trust on his part.However, he was not a first offender.He had\na record and was on probation at the time of the offences.[23]In this case, considering all of the principles and in particular Mr.\nPich’s youth and his lack of any criminal antecedents, I have concluded that I will\nimpose a sentence that is less than the sentence imposed on the co-accused in\nthis case.In light of the gravity of the offence, the sentence, before credit\nfor strict bail conditions and pre-trial custody, would be 3 years imprisonment.2.The credit that should be given for pre-trial custody and strict\nbail conditions[24]The next issue to be determined on this sentencing is the credit that\nshould be given for pre-trial custody and for the period of just over three\nyears on strict bail conditions.There is no dispute that Mr. Pich is entitled\nto 8 days credit for the 5 days spent in pre-trial custody.[25]The principles governing the court’s approach to credit for pre-trial\nbail conditions were recently summarized by Campbell J. in R. v. Peterkin[4]\nas follows:In summary, credit for pre-trial bail conditions should be\napproached in the following manner:* Time spent on stringent pre-sentence bail conditions,\nespecially house arrest, is a relevant mitigating factor.* As such, the trial judge must consider the time spent on\nbail under house arrest in determining the length of sentence.* The failure of the trial judge to explain why time spent on\nbail under house arrest has not been taken into account is an error in\nprinciple.* The amount of credit to be given for time spent on bail\nunder house arrest is within the discretion of the trial judge and there is no\nformula that the judge is required to apply.* The amount of credit will depend upon a number of factors\nincluding, the length of time spent on bail under house arrest; the stringency\nof the conditions; the impact on the offender's liberty; the ability of the\noffender to carry on normal relationships, employment and activity.* Where the offender asks the trial judge to take\npre-sentence bail conditions into account, the offender should supply the judge\nwith information as to the impact of the conditions. If there is a dispute as\nto the impact of the conditions, the onus is on the offender to establish those\nfacts on a balance of probabilities in accordance with s. 724(3) of the Criminal\nCode.[26]In the case before me, as in Peterkin, there are few concrete\ndetails of the impact of the house arrest on Mr. Pich.However, Mr. Pich spent\njust over three years living with his parents and unable to leave his home without\nsupervision.In Peterkin, Campbell J. credited Mr. Peterkin with 3\nmonths for the 13-½ months of stringent bail conditions.As set out by\nRosenberg J.A. in R. v. Downes, 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA), [2006] O.J. No. 555, there is no\nmathematical formula to be applied in determining credit for stringent bail\nconditions.I have considered the nature of the conditions, the inevitable\nimpact on the life of Mr. Pich and the lengthy period of time that Mr. Pich was\nsubject to the conditions.In all of the circumstances, I conclude that it is\nfair to credit Mr. Pich with 12 months for the thirty-seven months on judicial\ninterim release.He is entitled to 8 days credit for the 5 days in pre-trial\ncustody.[27]The sentence that otherwise would have been imposed on Mr. Pich will be\nreduced by this total credit of 12 months and 8 days.[28]As I indicated earlier, the global sentence that I would otherwise have\nimposed on Mr. Pich was 3 years’ imprisonment.With credit for his\npre-trial custody and bail conditions the remaining sentence to be served is a\nglobal sentence of 2 years less 8 days.Probation[29]Having concluded that the sentence remaining to be served by Mr. Pich is\na sentence of under two years, it is open to me to place him on probation\nfollowing his release.In my opinion it is in the interests of Mr. Pich and in\nthe public interest that Mr. Pich should be subject to the supervision of\na probation officer for two years after his release.He has complied with his\nhouse arrest bail and used the time on that bail constructively.A probation\norder will provide similar structure for Mr. Pich after his release from\ncustody.Order[30]I therefore impose the following sentence:With credit of 12 months and 8\ndays for pre-trial bail and custody,On counts 1 - 4, robbery, the\nsentence is 12 months less 8 days’ imprisonment, concurrent;On count 5, using an imitation\nfirearm in the commission of the robbery, the sentence is the mandatory minimum\nsentence of 12 months’ imprisonment, consecutive;On count 6, having his face\nmasked, the sentence is 9 months concurrent;On count 7, forcible\nconfinement, the sentence is 12 months concurrent; andOn count 8, assault with a\nweapon, the sentence is 9 months concurrent.The sentence of imprisonment will be followed by a two-year\nprobation order with the statutory terms and the following additional terms:•He shall report to a probation officer within one week of his\nrelease from custody and thereafter as required by the probation officer;•He shall not possess any weapons;•He shall have no contact directly or indirectly with any of the\nwitnesses in this case;•He shall have no contact with his co-accused in this case;•He shall not be within 100 meters of the Lobster Trap Restaurant;•He shall take such counselling as is recommended by his probation\nofficer;•He shall seek and maintain employment or attend school.Ancillary orders[31]There will be a mandatory prohibition order under s. 109 of the Criminal\nCode.Mr. Pich is prohibited from possessing any firearm, cross-bow,\nrestricted weapon, ammunition or explosive substance for ten years after his\nrelease.In addition he is prohibited from possessing any prohibited firearm,\nrestricted firearm, prohibited weapon, prohibited device or prohibited\nammunition for life.[32]Robbery is a primary designated offence under the Criminal Code.I therefore make the order that Mr. Pich is required to provide such number of\nsamples of bodily substances that are reasonably required for the purpose of\nforensic DNA analysis.[33]Mr. Pich will pay a victim fine surcharge in the amount of $100.00. In\nlight of the sentence of imprisonment that I am imposing and the inability of\nMr. Pich to be employed over the past three years I have concluded that any\nadditional amount would be an undue hardship to Mr. Pich.Conclusion[34]Mr. Pich is receiving a lenient sentence.I wish to be clear that this\nleniency is not based on a conclusion that Mr. Pich’s conduct is less\nblameworthy than the other participants in this robbery.It is more\nblameworthy.Mr. Pich breached the trust of his former employer and\ndeliberately put his former co-workers in harm’s way.Further, I do not find\nthat Mr. Pich was led astray by a negative peer group.He chose his peer\ngroup.He drove from Mississauga to Toronto to be with the peer group.Mr.\nPich had choices.He needs to take responsibility for his conduct.He is\nreceiving leniency because of his youth, his status as first offender and his\nprospects for rehabilitation.This type of leniency will not be shown again if\nhe reoffends.M.\nForestell J.Released: March\n6, 2015CITATION:\nR. v.

P. MoirDate Heard:23\nNovember 2004Written SubmissionReceived:5 January 2005Counsel:Paul Scovil, for the RespondentJoel\nE. Pink, Q.C., for the AppellantMoir, J.:[1]Introduction.More than once in 2003 or early 2004\nR.D.H. enticed a young girl in his neighbourhood to touch him sexually and to\npreform oral sex on him.He is in his thirties.She was only thirteen.He\nwas charged with the dual procedure offences under s. 151, s. 152 and s. 271(1)\nof the Criminal Code, the Crown proceeding by way of summary conviction\nrather than indictment.After the defence counsel and the Crown attorney\nreached agreement for a joint recommendation on sentence, R.D.H. pleaded guilty\nto sexual assault and the other charges were withdrawn.In September 2004,\nJudge James H. Burrill conducted the sentencing hearing and received the joint\nrecommendation, nine months to be served under a conditional sentence,\nincluding house arrest during all of the nine months, and three years\nprobation.The Provincial Court Judge rejected the joint recommendation and\nsentenced R.D.H. to seven months incarceration with three years probation.R.D.H. appeals.[2]In R. v. MacIvor, [2003] NSCA 60, the Court of Appeal\nsummarized holdings of the Supreme Court of Canada on the standards for\nreviewing a decision on sentence:A sentence imposed by a trial\njudge is entitled to considerable deference from an appellate court.A\nsentence should only be varied if the appellate court is satisfied that the\nsentence under review is Aclearly unreasonable@: R. v. Shropshire\n(1995), 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at pp. 209-210.Absent an error in\nprinciple, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the\nappropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence\nif the sentence is Ademonstrably unfit@: R. v. M. (C.A.) (1996),\n1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 (S.C.C.) at p. 374.The Supreme Court of Canada reiterated\nthis standard of appellate review in reviewing a conditional sentence in R. v.\nProulx (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61 at [paragraph]\n123-126.No one argues that the sentence in this\ncase is clearly unreasonable or is demonstrably unfit.On behalf of R.D.H.,\nMr. Pink submits that the rejection of the joint recommendation was occasioned\nby errors in principle.On behalf of the Crown, Mr. Scovil, who was not the\nCrown attorney at the sentencing hearing, supports the position taken by the\ndefence.[3]Facts of the Offence.The sentencing judge found the\nfacts of the offence:The facts in this matter are\nas follows.I=m advised that during the fall of 2003 the accused, who lives\napproximately 80 yards from K.C. and her family, became close friends with that\nfamily and spend a lot of time with K.C. and her family, both at the residence\nand at other places.I=m advised that during this\nperiod the accused was drinking a lot and that some time during the fall of\n2003, he jokingly, he says, referred to their relationship as\nboyfriend/girlfriend.It=s clear that the accused cultivated that relationship\nthrough the exchange of notes with K.C. and that this passing of notes began\nnear the 1st of December, 2003.In some of those notes, he\nindicated to this 13 year old that he loved her and wanted to be with her\nforever.He indicated that he wanted to have sex with her and that if she kept\nsaying no, he would not wait forever, and after cultivating that relationship,\nthe accused ultimately committed sexual assault against that 13 year old\nindividual.I=m advised that there were\ntwo incidents where the accused drove the victim to an area on a 4 wheel all\nterrain vehicle where no other persons were present.He undid his survival\nsuit that he was wearing, undid his pants and produced his penis and had this\n13 year old preform oral sex on him while holding her head, at least on one\noccasion, and telling her not to stop.I=m advised that there was no\nejaculation during either of those incidents.In addition there were\nincidents at the home or an incident at the home, as well as incident, at least\none incident, on a 4 wheel all terrain vehicle where he had placed the hand of\nthe complainant, K.C., on his crotch area and had her rub over the clothing.This incident was discovered\non February 13th of 2004 when the victim=s mother discovered some of\nthe notes that had been passed.Those note were deemed to be of inappropriate\ncontent and ultimately those notes were caused the mother to take her daughter,\nK.C., to the R.C.M.P. Detachment where a statement was provided.[4]Facts Respecting the Offender.The record\nincludes a pre-sentence report prepared by Probation Officer Doug Bruce, an\nassessment respecting addition services prepared Clinical Therapist Bill\nMiddleton and a AComprehensive\nPre-Sentence Psychological Assessment for Sexual Offenders@ prepared by\nPsychologist Michelle St. Amand of the Sexual Offenders Program at the Nova\nScotia Hospital.Judge Burrill summarized these as follows:The Court has received a Pre\nSentence Report, an Addiction Assessment and the Sex Offender Assessment.The\nPre Sentence Report indicates that the accused is a candidate for community\nbased supervision.The Addiction Assessment indicates that there has been and\ncontinues to be a problem with regard to addiction and that continued\nabstinence from alcohol is recommended with treatment can be providedin the\ncommunity.The Sex Offender Assessment\nindicates that the accused is of moderate risk to re-offend violently, which of\ncourse includes the offence of sexual assault and indicates that there is a\ncommunity based program that can, if successfully completed, manage the risk\nwithin the community.For\npresent purposes, these reports require some elaboration.[5]The pre-sentence report describes a thirty-four year old man who\nhad a record dating from his late teens not involving sexual offences and who\nhad been a serious user of street drugs until he was twenty-five.After that,\nhe had one conviction, which was for impaired driving.At the time of his\npre-sentence report interview, R.D.H. was coming to see he had a problem with\nalcohol.The report also records that R.D.H.=s girlfriend died in a car accident when\nhe was twenty.R.D.H.=s father died in an accident at his place of work when\nR.D.H. was twenty-five and it was R.D.H. who discovered his father=s body.The\nnext year saw the death of R.D.H.=s uncle, an uncle with whom he had been\nclose.[6]The addiction services assessment concludes Aprior to the age\nof twenty-five [R.D.H.] was a poly drug user and since the age of twenty-five\nis a problem drinker who should have a serious look at his use of alcohol@.[7]The Sexual Offenders Assessment is very extensive.In addition\nto a detailed report on R.D.H.=s sexual history, an account of the offences and an\nassessment of R.D.H.=s sexual interests, the report detailed information he\ngave concerning substance abuse, prior offences, family history, education,\nemployment and mental health.A series of psychological tests were\nadministered.As will be seen, Judge Burrill=s finding that Athe accused\ncultivated that relationship through the exchange of notes@ became an important\nfactor in his rejection of the joint recommendation.This passage from the\nAClinical Analysis of Sexual Offences@ portion of the report may cast a\ndifferent light on that behaviour:By writing notes to the\nvictim, R.D.H. claimed to have thought that it made her Afeel better.@However, it is equally probable that their relationship was personally soothing\nand gratifying for R.D.H., particularly given his break-up with his girlfriend\n(after which he began spending increased time with the victim=s family).In\neither case, it is evident based on R.D.H.=s report, that he was able to\ndevelop a special relationship with the victim, where she shared problems and\nhe offered advice, and where they maintained a secret line of communication.The report concluded that R.D.H. posed Aa\nmoderate risk for recidivism@.It stated that a moderate intensity sexual\noffender treatment was available in the community and in federal prisons but\nnot in provincial jails.The report also recommended counselling Ato address\nissues related to his father=s and former girlfriend=s deaths, as well as his\ngeneral lack of assertiveness...and dependant personality.@[8]Judge Burrill also had before him victim impact statements and a\nstatement R.D.H. chose to make to the Court.Judge Burrill stated, AI accept his\nexpression of remorse uttered today as genuine.@[9]Judge’s Decision.The Provincial Court Judge\nreferred to the provisions of the Criminal Code respecting the purposes\nof sentencing, factors to be taken into consideration on sentencing and\nconditional sentences.He also stated Aa joint submission from counsel should be\nseriously considered and should not be rejected unless it is contrary to the public\ninterest or...it is unreasonable...or would bring the administration of justice\ninto disrepute.@The sentencing judge also recognized that a recommended\nsentence that would be Aunfit@, meaning outside an acceptable range of\npenalties, should be rejected by the Court.In this case, the judge was of the\nopinion that a conditional sentence would be unreasonable and would bring the\nadministration of justice into disrepute.He was also of the view that Aa\nConditional Sentence in this case would be...unfit...@.Among the aggravating\ncircumstances, Judge Burrill noted Athe premeditated nature of the act, the\ncultivation of the relationship over a period of months through the exchange of\nnotes, the fact that the conduct was repeated on more than one occasion@.[10]Counsel were given no notice that rejection of the joint recommendation\nwas under consideration and the Court made no inquiry into the reasons for\nagreement.[11]Issues on Appeal.The appellant submitted,\nfirstly, that the finding that a conditional sentence would be Aunfit@ was\ncontrary to principle.Secondly, the sentencing judge failed to inquire into\nthe circumstances underlaying the joint recommendation.Both of these are\ncharacterized as errors justifying interference within the standard to which I\nhave referred.For his client, Mr. Pink submitted that this was an appropriate\ncase in which to impose sentence on appeal rather than to refer it back to the\nsentencing court.The Crown supported the appellant=s positions.[12]Later, Mr. Pink referred me to G.P. v. R., [2004]\nNSCA 154, which was released after argument in this case.Consequently, a\nthird issue was raised as to the sentencing judge=s failure to give notice he was\nconsidering rejection of the joint recommendation.Consequently, the issues\nare:1.Whether it was reversible error for the\nsentencing judge to find a conditional sentence to be Aunfit@.2.Whether it was reversible error for the\nsentencing judge to reject the joint recommendation without conducting an\ninquiry into the circumstances that lead to it.3.Whether it was reversible error for the\nsentencing judge to reject a joint recommendation without giving notice that\nsuch was under consideration.[13]Recommended Sentence as “Unfit”.A sentencing judge\nmust not reject a joint recommendation unless the judge finds that the sentence\nis unfit, that is, it isoutside an acceptable range.The correct approach is\nexplained by Justice Cromwell at para. 31 of R. v. MacIvor,\n[2003] NSCA 90, to which Mr. Pink referred me:I am also of the view that,\nwith respect, the judge erred in Ajumping@ the joint submission.It is not\ndoubted that a joint submission from a plea bargain while not binding on the\nCourt, should be given very serious consideration.This requires the\nsentencing judge to do more than assess whether it is a sentence he or she\nwould have imposed absent the joint submission: see, e.g., R. v. Thomas\n(2000), 2000 MBCA 148 (CanLII), 153 Man. R. (2d) 98 (C.A.) at para. 6.It requires the sentencing\njudge to assess whether the jointly submitted sentence is within an acceptable\nrange - in other words, whether it is a fit sentence.If it is, there must be\nsound reasons for departing from it: see, for example, R. v. MacDonald\n(2001), 2001 NSCA 26 (CanLII), 191 N.S.R. (2d) 399; N.S.J. 51 (Q.L.) (N.S.C.A.); R. v. Tkachuk\n(2001), 2001 ABCA 243 (CanLII), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 434 (Alta. C.A.) at para. 32; R. v.C. (G.W.)\n(2000), 2000 ABCA 333 (CanLII), 150 C.C.C. (3d) 513 at paras. 17-18; R. v. Bezdan, 2001 BCCA 215 (CanLII), [2001]\nB.C.J. No. 808 (C.A.) at paras. 14-15; R. v. Thomas, supra, at\nparas. 5-6; R. v. B.(B.), 2002 Carswell NWT 17 (N.T.C.A.) at\npara. 3; R. v. Webster (2001), 2001 SKCA 72 (CanLII), 207 Sask. R. 257 (C.A.) at para.\n7.[14]The conditional sentence has its own parameters.The question of\nfitness is largely statutory.The discretion to impose house arrest and other\nconditions under supervision in the community as an alternative to imprisonment\narises if:1.There\nis no minimum imprisonment prescribed for the offence;2.Punishment\nmerits more than probation and less than two years imprisonment;3.Severing\nthe sentence in the community would not endanger the community and;4.Serving\nthe sentence in the community would be consistent with the fundamental purpose\nand principles of sentencing.We have now had ten years experience with s. 742.1 of the Criminal\nCode.The purpose of s. 742.1 and its intended operation were throughly\ncanvassed by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Proulx (2000),\n2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (SCC).For the Court, Chief Justice Lamer began his\nreasons by saying AParliament\nhas sent a clear message to all Canadian judges that too many people are being\nsent to prison.@:[para. 1].In the end [para. 127] the Chief Justice\nprovided a helpful summary of the thirteen major points made by the decision.Points one, three and seven are particularly germane to the present\ndiscussion:1.Bill C-41 in general and the conditional\nsentence in particular were enacted both to reduce reliance on incarceration as\na sanction and to increase the use of principles of restorative justice in sentencing.3.No offences are excluded from the\nconditional sentencing regime except those with a minimum term of imprisonment,\nnor should there be presumptions in favour of or against a conditional sentence\nfor specific offences.7.Once the prerequisites of s. 742.1 are\nsatisfied, the judge should give serious consideration to the possibility of a\nconditional sentence in all cases by examining whether a conditional sentence\nis consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out\nin ss. 718 to 718.2.This follows from Parliament=s clear message to the\njudiciary to reduce the use of incarceration as a sanction.In my assessment of s. 742.1 and Proulx,\na conditional sentence can never be said to be unfit unless:1.A\nminimum period of imprisonment is prescribed for the offence.2.Probation\nor two years or more in penitentiary is the appropriate punishment.3.The\ncommunity would be endangered in the sense elaborated in Proulx.4.Serving\nthe sentence under supervision in the community would be inconsistent with the\nfundamental purpose and the principles of sentencing.[15]In this case, the sentencing judge made no finding that a\nconditional sentence would be inconsistent with the purposes and principles of\nsentencing.He said that he considered Athe various principles and purpose of\nsentencing@ but, in my respectful assessment, that is not enough to justify\nrejecting a joint recommendation of a conditional sentence.There needs to be\na finding that the recommended sentence is inconsistent with purpose and\nprinciple because a recommended conditional sentence is Afit@ if it meets the\nstatutory criteria.[16]I would allow the appeal on this ground alone.[17]Duty to Inquire.In Hatt v. R., [2002]\nPEISCAD 4, the Court said at para. 15:I agree that there is no rigid\nformula that must be followed when considering a joint submission.However, if\na trial judge is considering rejecting that submission, an inquiry must be made\nas to the reasons behind the submission, and clear reasons must be given, after\nan explanation by counsel of the rationale for the joint submission, as to why\nit would be contrary to public interest and why it would bring the\nadministration of justice into disrepute to impose that recommended sentence.This followed R. v. G.W.C.,\n[2001] A.J. 1585 (CA) and it is consistent with R. v. Thomas,\n[2000] M.J. 575 (CA).[18]Mr. Scovil pointed out that had Judge Burrill asked why the\nagreement was reached he would have learned that the young complainant was a\nreluctant witness and the Crown was concerned especially about the impact upon\nher if she had to testify.Also, Mr. Scovil pointed out that Judge Burrill\nmight have reached a different conclusion on Agrooming@ if the Crown had been\nchallenged.The Crown would have drawn the judge=s attention more acutely to\nthe evidence in the Pre-Sentence Psychological Assessment for Sex Offenders.[19]Because under our system judges adopt a passive rather than an\ninquisitorial stance, I think it better to speak of a duty of notice rather\nthan a duty of inquiry.In any event, an authority binding on me determines\nthe next issue.[20]The Need for Notice.Very recently, our Court of\nAppeal followed R. v. Sinclair, 2004 MBCA 48 (CanLII), [2004] M.J. No. 144 (MCA) at\npara. [17] where Steel, JA summarized Athe law with respect to joint submissions@ in five\npoints, the third and forth of which most concern this discussion:3.In determining whether cogent reasons\nexist (i.e., in weighing the adequacy of the proposed joint submission),\nthe sentencing judge must take into account all the circumstances underlying\nthe joint submission.Where the case falls on the continuum among plea bargain,\nevidentiary considerations, systemic pressures and joint submissions will\naffect, perhaps significantly, the weight given the joint submission by the\nsentencing judge.4.The sentencing judge should inform\ncounsel during the sentencing hearing if the court is considering departing\nfrom the proposed sentence in order to allow counsel to make submissions\njustifying the proposal.In R. v.\nG.E.P., [2004] NSCA 154 Bateman, JA, for our Court, stated, at para. 19:[B]efore rejecting the joint\nrecommendation the judge should have advised counsel that he was considering\ndeparting from the agreed sentence and afforded them an opportunity to make\nsubmissions justifying their proposal (R. v. Sinclair,\nsupra).This applies\nat least in cases of Aa genuine plea bargain@ [para. 17].[21]There was no notice in this case.I would allow the appeal on that\nground also.[22]Disposition Under s. 687.I will vary the sentence from\nseven months incarceration followed by probation to nine months house arrest\nunder a conditional sentence followed by three years probation.My orders will\ninclude all of the conditions set out in the transcript.J."}

Saunders on June 10, 1999DECISIONJune 10, 1999 (Orally)COUNSEL:John Scott, Esq., for the CrownDeirdre Murphy for the AccusedSAUNDERS,\nJ.: (Orally)Mr. Nathan Peter Dykstra elected trial by judge alone on\nthis charge of robbery. I presided at your trial April 22 and 23, 1999. You\ntook the stand in your own defence. I was satisfied based upon all of the\nevidence presented as to your guilt on the charge on the Indictment and I\nremanded you into custody pending your sentence this morning.For the reasons that I recall describing in detail at\nthe time of your conviction I was not left with any reasonable doubt that you\nand the four other young men described by counsel left Trisha Fudge’s apartment\nintending to go in search of someone to rob and to steal what you could of\nvalue. I was satisfied that you all waited together in the dark by a wall of\nEaton’s parkade at the Halifax Shopping Centre to see who might happen to pass\nby as a mark. Upon seeing Mr. Daniels you chased after him and ran him down and\nproceeded to beat him with kicks and punches while stealing his belongings.Mr. Daniels tried to defend himself but he was no match\nagainst the five of you. Included among the items stolen from Mr. Daniels were\nhis leather university jacket, his keys, his wallet containing money and\nvarious credit cards, a gold bracelet, a matching gold necklace with cross, a\nring bearing the Lebanese cedar and a Longine watch.Mr. Daniels described the\njewellery taken from him that night as having a value of $7,000.00. Of those\nitems the only things of value recovered and returned to him upon the evidence\nbefore me were his Visa card, his MSI card, and his university jacket.Mr. Daniels was badly beaten by you and the four others\nwho joined you in that cowardly and senseless attack. When he made it home and\naroused his sister, the sight of him and his injuries made her vomit or want\nto. They called the police and he was taken to hospital. Photos were taken two\ndays after the robbery. Those photos were introduced in evidence and showed\nmuch of the physical damage Mr. Daniels suffered. His injuries included serious\ndamage to his left eye and eye socket, severe abrasions when the skin on his\nface was scraped on the pavement during the course of the robbery, bruising to\nhis ribs, shoulder blades and waist, an imprint on the right side of his skull\nsaid to have been made by the sole of a shoe, serious discolouration behind his\nright ear when people tried to tug the leather jacket up over his head, and\nfriction burns to his waist, said to have been caused when people tried to roll\nhim over by yanking on his jeans. Fortunately for Mr. Daniels and fortunately\nfor you, none of those injuries proved to be life-threatening, nor apparently\nleft Mr. Daniels with any permanent or debilitating injury.As Mr. Scott has indicated, robbery is a most serious\noffense.In Section 344 of the Criminal Code Parliament has decreed that\nanybody found guilty of robbery may be liable to imprisonment for life. Many of\nthe principles of sentencing that have guided this Court over the years are now\ncodified in Section 718 and following and I have taken all of those into\naccount in your case.Protection of the public is the primary objective. In\ncrimes of violence, which this is, deterrence of both you and of people who may\nbe so inclined are given the greatest emphasis in attaining that objective. I\nhave considered all of the cases Ms. Murphy included in her most helpful\npre-hearing brief. For your benefit I want to refer to extracts from three of\nthose cases. I am going to take them chronologically, the oldest being comments\nof Mr. Justice Jones writing for the Appeal Division (as it then was) in a case\ncalled The Queen v. Tarbox. Among other things, when dealing with a\nyoung woman with no previous record Justice Jones commented:“The primary consideration must be deterrence. This Court has\nrepeatedly pointed out the serious nature of the offense of robbery.”The Court affirmed a term of 30 months’ imprisonment in a federal\ninstitution.Then I want to refer to the decision of the Court of\nAppeal as it now is in the Emmerson case, decided in 1993.Justice\nMatthews observed:“This was a crime of violence as such the overriding consideration\nmust be deterrence both specific and in particular general.”And he quoted from previous comments of the then Chief Justice of\nNova Scotia in a case called The Queen v. Hingley where MacKeigan,\nC.J.N.S. said:“We must begin with the premise that robbery with violence requires\nstrongly deterrent sentences of imprisonment.”And finally, Mr. Dykstra, I would refer to the same\ndecision cited by your counsel, it being the most recent judgment of the Court\nof Appeal in the case of The Queen v. Izzard, a judgment handed down in\nJanuary of this year and in particular two observations of now Chief Justice\nGlube. First where she remarked at p. 10:“I accept the principle that each case must be examined individually\nto arrive at the appropriate sentence. However, I would find the circumstances\nhere are not so exceptional and mitigating that the Court can ignore the\nbenchmark of a sentence of two but more often three years.”And finally, at the bottom of p. 11 of her judgment where she\nstated:“I would impose a two year term with two years’ probation. I leave\nthe two years’ probation in place as the respondent, that being the accused,\nwill benefit from the supervision in restructuring his future. Probation\nimposes a level of control over Mr. Izzard for a longer period than just two\nyears’ incarceration would alone. This will equate closer to a sentence of\nthree years or more and will assist him in maintaining the goals he said he\nneeds to stay out of trouble.”Now in deciding what is a proper and fit sentence in\nyour case I have tried to apply the principles from those cases as well as\ncounsels’ careful submissions this morning, the content of the presentence\nreport to which I will refer in a moment,and those features of your case that\ncan be considered aggravating and mitigating.I am going to start with the factors I consider to be\nthe most aggravating.First, the randomness of the attack. You and these four\nother young men went out as a group looking for a mark.Mr. Daniels, your\nvictim, happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.Second, I consider an aggravating feature to be the\nfrequency of such attacks and such robberies. Since your conviction by me in\nApril I recall three other newspaper accounts of similar crimes and amazingly\none almost identical incident described in the paper at the very same location\nwithin a week of my conviction of you.Third I recall that you were the eldest among this group\nof five. You claimed the need for money quickly and by your own evidence you\nwere willing to get it by unlawful means. One can reasonably infer from the\nevidence before me that it was on account of your suggestion and encouragement\nthat this crime occurred.And fourth, the aggravating feature that I want to\nemphasize is the sheer unfairness of it all. It used to be that fights were\nsettled with fists between two people, one against the other and the\naltercation usually ended when one person gave up or other people intervened or\nthe police arrived. That old equation seems to be skewed. Now too often the\nattacks involve others - three, four,five or more people against one, and\nweapons or kicks to the head while the victim is down or hurt or outnumbered\nand no longer able to defend himself. And here the evidence proves at least one\nkick to Mr. Daniels’ head that left that imprint of the sole of the shoe on the\nright side of his skull, and a knife held to his throat by one of your gang.\nWhile I cannot say to what exact degree you were involved personally in\nadministering these particular assaults upon Mr. Daniels, you were there\nrobbing him with your friends. Those are features that I find especially\ntroubling in your case. And they are circumstances that this community through\nits courts seeks to denounce and deter.Let me now turn, Mr. Dykstra, to those features I\nconsider to be mitigating circumstances in your case. First I agree with Ms.\nMurphy that there is no evidence before the Court of any careful planning in\nthis crime.Secondly when I look at the content of the presentence\nreport it is generally positive notwithstanding the very poor upbringing you\n“enjoyed” in various homes in your youth. As Ms. Murphy pointed out, you were\ntaken from your family home at age 11 and then shunted among a series of foster\nor group homes or placed in a situation with a stepmother where you were abused\nby her. There was nnever any kind ofadult authority or support or example and\nyou fell in with a bad crowd.I take into account the fact that your Uncle Tom has\nbeen here throughout your trial and is here this morning for your sentence\nhearing and I accept the representations made by your lawyer, Ms. Murphy as to\nthe support and example he has provided and continues to provide to you.Despite all these negative features in your life you\nhave managed to complete at least a high school education and one year of\nuniversity, all to your credit. I take into account your relative youth at the\ntime of this offense, the fact that you were 23 years of age at the time. I also\ntake into account that you have no previous record for robbery or crimes of\nviolence. When I look at the record passed to me this morning by Mr. Scott, the\ngeneral themes appearing in all of these offenses, either as a young offender\nor as an adult, are dishonesty, offenses of B \u0026E and theft which depict\nsomeone who at least at that stage of your life, was content to take things\nthat didn’t belong to you, or reflect dishonesty on your part either to others\nor to the Court. When you get out of prison you will have to continuously\ndemonstrate to other people that all of that is part of a dark history of your\nyouth and that you are quite a different person upon your release. Your success\nin that respect will be entirely up to you.I consider as other mitigating features the fact that\nyou have considerable potential to rehabilitate yourself and there have been no\nother convictions in recent years.Ordinarily, Mr. Dykstra, a person in your position would\nface imprisonment for more than two years and therefore probation added on\nwould not be an option. Initially when I reflected upon your case between April\nand today I had in mind a sentence of something close to two and a half years\nwith some credit for your time in remand pending your sentence.But that would\nhave still left you with a period of imprisonment of more than two years, thus\ndepriving you, and depriving the community of the benefits that can be obtained\nfrom a meaningful and properly supervised period of probation.I have come to the conclusion, Mr. Dykstra, that you are\npresently at a crossroads.You have some talent and some motivation to become\nreintegrated into society as a productive member of this community.I find\nthat you will benefit from supervision following your release from prison which\napparently has been so lacking to this point. In this way the interests of this\ncommunity in the protection of its citizens from crimes such as these will be\nachieved. I agree with the recommendations made by Mr. Scott on behalf of the\nCrown and Ms. Murphy on your behalf that a fit and proper disposition in your\ncase is a sentence of two years in a federal penitentiary to be followed by two\nyears of probation.I am going to specify some specific terms of your\nprobation in just a moment but the consequences attendant upon your failure to\ncomply with those terms will undoubtedly be explained to you by your counsel\nand will in any event be stated on the copy of the probation order.Mr. Dykstra, the compulsory terms of your probation order\nwill be as follows:(1)Under s. 732.1(2) of the Canadian Criminal\nCode to keep the peace and be of good behaviour;(2)To appear before me following your release\nfrom prison with your probation officer so that I can hear from you and the\nofficer how and what you have been doing. II would expect that appointment\nbefore me in this Court to be at about the mid-way point of your probationary\nterm.The scheduling of the precise date for that attendance is to be arranged\nbetween the probation service and the coordinators in these Law Courts;(3)That you will notify the probation officer in\nadvance of any change of name or address and promptly notify your probation\nofficer of any change of employment or occupation.In addition to those mandatory terms, Mr. Dykstra, I\nimpose the following additional terms. Firstly you will be obliged to report\nupon your release to your probation officer at such times and places as she or\nhe may direct. Secondly, you will remain within the jurisdiction of this Court\nunless written permission to go outside the jurisdiction of this Court is first\nobtained from this Court. Thirdly, you will abstain from owning, possessing or\ncarrying a weapon. Next, you will be obliged to perform 180 hours of community\nservice during your probationary period, performing such tasks and assignments\nas may be directed by your probation officer.Finally, in terms of other\nreasonable conditions I impose the following order which has two parts to it.\nYou are obliged to use best efforts to:(1)either find and keep employment during the\ncourse of your two years on probation, or(2)enroll in and complete courses towards your\neducation, upgrading and job training.As well, pursuant to s. 100 of the Criminal Code I\nimpose a ban for 10 years prohibiting you from possessing any firearm,\nammunition or explosive device.J.CASE NO.VOL.\nNO.THIS INFORMATION SHEET DOES NOT FORM PART OF THE\nCOURT'S DECISION.QUOTES MUST BE FROM THE DECISION, NOT THIS COVER SHEET.Her Majesty the QueenvsNathan Peter DykstraJustice Jamie W.S.

BrysonMotionsHeard:July 31, 2014, in Halifax, NovaScotia in ChambersWrittenDecision:Held:August 5, 2014Motions for interim release andleave to appeal are denied.Counsel:J. Patrick Atherton andDavid Dalrymple, for the appellantJames Gumpert, Q.C., for therespondentDecision:[1]David William Johnston seeks interim release and\nleave to appeal his nine-month sentence for assault causing bodily harm and attempting\nto administer a noxious substance (respectively ss. 267(b) and 245(b) of the Criminal\nCode).At Mr. Johnston’s hearing on July 31st, I denied leave\nand interim release, with reasons to follow.These are they.[2]Mr. Johnston pleaded guilty. As a result of his\nguilty plea, the Crown withdrew charges of dangerous driving, assault with a\nweapon and leaving the scene of an accident. Sentencing proceeded by way of\nagreed statement of facts before the Honourable Judge Michelle Christenson in\nTruro.The sentencing judge reserved her decision and delivered sentence on\nFriday, July 18, 2014.[3]Mr. Johnston was involved in a relationship with\nthe victim’s wife, prior to their marriage.He was obviously disappointed that\nhis attentions were not fully reciprocated.Mr. Johnston stalked the victim,\nJason Nichols.He placed some items on top of Mr. Nichols’ car while it was\nparked in a grocery store parking lot, including a drink of Pepsi that had been\nlaced with old prescription medication that Mr. Johnston had around the house.Mr. Johnston waited until Mr. Nichols came out to his car and then ran into him\nand drove off.Mr. Nichols was hurled into the air.Fortunately, examination\nat hospital confirmed that he only suffered a head laceration and soft tissue\ninjuries.It could have been much worse.[4]Although Mr. Johnston prevaricates about\nintentionally striking Mr. Nichols, the fact is that he knew Mr. Nichols had\nbeen struck and left anyway.He did not report the incident to anyone and, in\nfact, avoided taking any responsibility until confronted by police some days\nlater.[5]At the hearing, Mr. Johnston was cross-examined\nas was his proposed surety, his mother, Carol Johnston.The Crown also led\nevidence from the victim’s mother, Janet Crowell.[6]While not much turns on it, I agree with the\nCrown that Mr. Johnston was evasive in some of his answers to the Crown’s\nquestions.He refused to acknowledge the premeditation of lacing the Pepsi\nwith prescription drugs, and placing them atop of Mr. Nichol’s car.He\nprofessed ambivalence about his actions saying, for example:“I can’t say I\nwanted him to drink it …” [the Pepsi].He claimed his behaviour was not\nplanned or deliberate, but “impulsive”.He clearly was distancing himself from\nhis conduct, which was also observed by the sentencing judge:“The [presentence]\nreport illustrates some level of remorse, although he does distance himself\nsomewhat from the offence by blaming - - by placing the blame on his\nmedication.”Leave to Appeal:[7]An appellant may only challenge sentence with\nleave of the Court of Appeal or a judge thereof, (Criminal Code, s.\n675(1)(b)).The Code requires that in a sentence appeal like this one,\ninterim judicial release may only be granted if a judge of the Court of Appeal\nhas granted leave to appeal:679. (1) A judge of the court of appeal may, in accordance with this\nsection, release an appellant from custody pending the determination of his\nappeal if,…(b) in the case of an appeal to\nthe court of appeal against sentence only, the appellant has been granted leave\nto appeal;[8]Civil Procedure Rule 91.24(1) addresses leave to appeal and interim release:91.24 (1) An appellant who appeals against sentence only, is in custody,\nand wishes to be released pending appeal must make a motion to a judge of the\nCourt of Appeal for leave to appeal, which motion may be heard together with a\nmotion for an order for release under section 679 of the Code and be determined\nbefore or at the same time as the motion for release is determined.[9]In R. v. Amin, 2010 MBCA 15 (CanLII), Justice\nFreedman commented on leave as follows:4The\nCode does not spell out the circumstances that must exist before leave\ncan be granted (as it does, for example, regarding judicial interim release).\nThose circumstances have, however, been discussed in a number of appellate\ndecisions. See, for example, R. v. Perrier, 2009 NLCA 61 (CanLII), where at\nparas. 23-28, Green C.J.N.L. refers to a number of such decisions, such as R.\nv. Jesso (H.), 2008 NLCA 30 (CanLII), 276 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 147. In that case,\nBarry J.A. denied leave to appeal against sentence because the submissions on\nthe length of sentence had “no arguable basis or sufficient merit to support\nthe conclusion that there is a reasonable prospect for success regarding length\nof sentence if leave to appeal is granted” (at para. 13).5Chief\nJustice Green also noted Bailey v. R., 2008 NLCA 5 (CanLII), where “sufficient\nmerit” was equated with “arguable merit” (at para. 5) as the test for granting\nleave to appeal. He referred to cases from other jurisdictions (at para. 25):.... ... R. v. Laliberte,\n2000 SKCA 27 (CanLII), (per Jackson J.A. at para. 119: “an arguable case”; or\n“sufficient merit”); R. v. Hawthorne (1992), 1992 CanLII 1753 (BC CA), 21 B.C.A.C. 173 per Gibbs\nJ.A. at para. 6: (“not frivolous and has a reasonable chance of success”; or\nnot “doomed to fail”); R. v. Shacklock [2000 NSCA 68], (2000), 2000 NSCA 68 (CanLII), 185\nN.S.R. (2d) 119 (CA) (per Roscoe J.A. at para 4: “not frivolous and ... raise\narguable issues”; R. v. Smith, 2005 NSCA 45 (CanLII) (per Fichaud J.A. at para. 10:\n“raise arguable issues”); and R. v. Mahamud, 2001 BCCA 558 (CanLII) (per Esson J.A. at\npara. 7: “lacks any substantial merit”); R. v. Bodnarchuk (2007), 2007 BCCA 450 (CanLII), 246\nB.C.A.C. 91 (per Levine J.A. at para. 5: “not frivolous and has a reasonable\nchance of success”).6He\nconcluded that the words, an “arguable” appeal and an appeal with “sufficient\nmerit,” were used as alternative descriptors of the test to be applied.7In\nR. v. Green (J.R.), 2005 PESCAD 21 (CanLII), 249 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 150, Webber\nJ.A. said (at para. 17):.... There must be some foundation\nlaid to strongly suggest an error in law by the trial judge in passing\nsentence. The words “clearly excessive or inadequate,” “error in principle,” “failure\nto consider a relevant factor,” \"overemphasis of appropriate\nfactors,\" \"demonstrably unfit,\" \"marked departure\"\nfrom other sentences signal what must be shown for there to be an arguable\nappeal. ....8See\nalso R. v. Langlois (D.J.), 2008 MBCA 72 (CanLII), 228 Man.R. (2d) 256 at para.\n3, and R. v. Laliberte, 2000 SKCA 27 (CanLII), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 503 (above, at para.\n5), where Jackson J.A. said (at para. 119):In my respectful opinion, a Court\nof Appeal has the authority to grant leave not only when there is an arguable\ncase for intervention but also to settle an issue of significance either in\npractice or law. The onus on counsel seeking leave is to demonstrate a case of\nsufficient merit and importance to warrant intervention or review. ....9For\nthe applicant to be granted leave he must demonstrate that his appeal presents\nan arguable case. In my opinion, this means a case with some merit, and some\nrealistic chance of success.[10]At least in Nova Scotia, the test for leave\nrequires that the grounds of appeal raise “arguable issues” or are “not\nfrivolous”; see for example:R. v. Smith, 2005 NSCA 45 (CanLII) at para. 10; R.\nv. MacIntyre, 2003 NSCA 68 (CanLII) at para. 6; R. v. J.E.S., 2009 NSCA 91 (CanLII) at\npara. 6; R. v. Bennett, 2006 NSCA 86 (CanLII) at para. 23.[11]The potential merits of an appeal are also taken\ninto account under s. 679(4)(a) of the Code.Accordingly, whether the\nappeal has merit in the sense of raising an arguable issue, is addressed later\nin this decision.[12]The Crown submits that this appeal lacks merit\nand that leave and interim release should be denied.I agree.For reasons\ndeveloped below, the appellant has not shown that his appeal has merit.Interim Judicial Release[13]Section 679(4) of the Criminal Code sets\nout the criteria for interim judicial release pending appeal:679(4)In\nthe case of an appeal referred to in paragraph (1)(b), the judge of the court\nof appeal may order that the appellant be released pending the determination of\nhis appeal or until otherwise ordered by a judge of the court of appeal if the\nappellant establishes that(a) the appeal has\nsufficient merit that, in the circumstances, it would cause unnecessary\nhardship if he were detained in custody;(b) he will surrender\nhimself into custody in accordance with the terms of the order; and(c) his detention is not\nnecessary in the public interest.[14]The onus of establishing the criteria in s.\n679(4) is upon Mr. Johnston.In R. v. Barry, 2004 NSCA 126 (CanLII), the Court\nheld:[8]Mr. Barry has the onus\nto establish each of the three conditions stated by s. 679(3). The conviction\nhas substituted his initial presumption of innocence with a status quo of\nguilt.Unlike a pre-trial bail applicant, a convicted appellant “seeks to\nreverse the status quo by obtaining a reprieve from a court order for his\ndetention following conviction” and, therefore, has the burden to prove the\nconditions for release pending determination of the appeal: R. v. Branco\n(1993), 1993 CanLII 1444 (BC CA), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 71 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 75 per Finch, J.A.; R. v.\nButler, 1997 N.S.J. 391 at paras. 4-5; R. v. Ryan 2004 NSCA 105 (CanLII) at\nparas. 2-3.[15]The fundamental issue is not one of guilt or\ninnocence:that is established.The question is whether the sentence was\ninappropriate or nine months too lengthy.The issue of “arguable issue” or “merit”\nmust be examined in light of the grounds of appeal.They are:1.The sentence passed is manifestly excessive;2.The judge erred in\noveremphasizing the principles ofdenunciationand deterrence;3.The judge failed to\nconsider the principle of restraint in s.718.2(d) of\nthe Criminal Code.[16]It is difficult to disturb sentencing decisions\non appeal because substantial deference is accorded them by courts of appeal.\nAs the Supreme Court observed in R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII):[46] Appellate courts grant\nsentencing judges considerable deference when reviewing the fitness of a\nsentence.In M. (C.A.), Lamer C.J. cautioned that a sentence could only be\ninterfered with if it was “demonstrably unfit” or if it reflected an error in\nprinciple, the failure to consider a relevant factor, or the over-emphasis of a\nrelevant factor (para. 90; see also R. v. L.M., 2008 SCC 31 (CanLII), [2008] 2\nS.C.R. 163, at paras. 14-15; R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R.\n61, at paras. 123-26; R. v. McDonnell, 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at paras.\n14-17; R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227).As Laskin J.A. explained\nin R. v. McKnight (1999), 1999 CanLII 3717 (ON CA), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 41 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 35,\nhowever, this does not mean that appellate courts can interfere with a sentence\nsimply because they would have weighed the relevant factors differently:To suggest that a trial judge\ncommits an error in principle because in an appellate court’s opinion the trial\njudge gave too much weight to one relevant factor or not enough weight to\nanother is to abandon deference altogether.The weighing of relevant factors,\nthe balancing process is what the exercise of discretion is all about.To\nmaintain deference to the trial judge’s exercise of discretion, the weighing or\nbalancing of relevant factors must be assessed against the reasonableness\nstandard of review.Only if by emphasizing one factor or by not giving enough\nweight to another, the trial judge exercises his or her discretion unreasonably\nshould an appellate court interfere with the sentence on the ground the trial\njudge erred in principle.[Emphasis added][17]In R. v. E.M.W., 2011 NSCA 87 (CanLII), Justice\nFichaud helpfully summarized the principles governing sentence appeals:[6]In R. v. Shropshire,\n1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, paras 46-50, Justice Iacobucci for the Court stated or\nadopted the views that:(a)An appellate court\nshould vary a sentence only when “the court of appeal is convinced it is not\nfit” or “clearly unreasonable”, or the sentencing judge “applied wrong\nprinciples or [if] the sentence is clearly or manifestly excessive”.(b)“If a sentence imposed\nis not clearly excessive or inadequate it is a fit sentence assuming the trial\njudge applied the correct principles and considered all relevant facts”.(c)“[S]entencing is not an\nexact science”, but rather “is the exercise of judgment taking into\nconsideration relevant legal principles, the circumstances of the offence and\nthe offender”.(d)“The most that can be\nexpected of a sentencing judge is to arrive at a sentence that is within an\nacceptable range”.(e)“Unreasonableness in\nthe sentencing process involves the sentencing order falling outside the\n‘acceptable range’ of orders”.Merits of Appeal and Hardship[18]Mr. Johnston expresses concern that the normal\ndelays of appeal may render his appeal moot.He may have served his sentence\nbefore being heard.Relying on Bennett, supra, Mr. Johnston\nsubmits:The court found that the\npossibility of serving more time in prison than justice requires is sufficient\nto satisfy this requirement. At para. 28, the court stated:[28]…If Mr. Bennett were\nsuccessful in this appeal, his success will be rendered illusory since by the\ntime the sentence is varied on appeal as requested, he will have served more\ntime in prison than justice requires.Thus, his continued incarceration will\nhave caused him unnecessary hardship.[19]Certainly, this argument correctly addresses\nhardship but with respect, it glosses over the question of the appeal’s merit.Section 679(4)(a) of the Code links “merit” and “hardship” – the\nlanguage is “the appeal has sufficient merit that, in the circumstances,\nit would cause unnecessary hardship if he were detained in custody;”[Emphasis added][20]In Bennett, there were extensive\npotential grounds of appeal which supported the appellant’s argument on the\nmerits.As Justice Saunders said:[14]These assertions are\namplified in Mr. Arnold’s thorough written memorandum.First, he argues that\nthe learned sentencing judge erroneously classified the appellant as “a\nwholesaler” when - given the quantity of marijuana and hashish seized - she\nought to have classified him as a mere “petty retailer.”The appellant alleges\nthat the judge misconstrued and misapplied the leading jurisprudence in such\nmatters.He says the judge’s decision as to the appropriate length and type of\nsentence was clearly influenced by her classification of the appellant as a\nwholesaler, and as a result of that flawed analysis, she erred in law and\nimposed a sentence that was demonstrably unfit.[15]Further, the appellant\nclaims the trial judge erred in finding that he was not a good candidate for a\nconditional sentence because the judge was not satisfied that the appellant\ncould safely serve his sentence in the community.Mr. Bennett submits that in\nmaking this determination the judge seriously erred in her analysis and in\nultimately rejecting a conditional sentence in his case.Specific examples of\nmistakes allegedly made include the assertion that the judge made palpable and\noverriding errors in certain factual findings; failed to consider or misapplied\nthe legal principles relating to conditional sentences from R. v. Proulx,\n2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] S.C.J. No. 6, and other leading authorities; overemphasized certain\n“aggravating” features while ignoring other important factors including the 18\nmonth conditional sentence that Mr. Bennett’s co-accused had received, thus failing\nto consider the doctrine of parity; and failing to properly account for the\nappellant’s guilty pleas in mitigation.[21]It is important to emphasize the connection\nbetween “sufficient merit” and “unnecessary hardship” in s. 679(4)(a).Some\ncases give the impression that simply pointing out the mootness of appeal,\nowing to delay, creates unnecessary hardship which satisfies this section.But\nthere is no unnecessary hardship in serving an appropriate sentence.Only if\nthe appellant raises arguable issues can incarceration constitute an\nunnecessary hardship in such circumstances.Parroting the grounds of appeal\nalone would rarely meet the test, absent some detail.[22]Mr. Johnston advances no such detailed arguments\nin this case.He simply repeats the assertions in his notice of appeal that\nnine months is excessive and that the trial judge improperly emphasized\ndenunciation and deterrence.Nothing in the record suggests that she did so.To the contrary, the sentencing judge quoted extensively from the relevant\nsections of the Criminal Code, together with leading jurisprudence and\nthen married those principles to the facts before her.To repeat the comments\nof Justice Webber in R. v. Green, supra, there is no foundation\nlaid to strongly suggest an error in law by the trial judge in passing\nsentence.Simply saying that a sentence is excessive or that some sentencing\nprinciples were overemphasized, does not establish an arguable case on appeal.Manifestly Excessive[23]Mr. Johnston cited no case to this Court that\nsuggested nine months for assault causing bodily harm and attempting to\nadminister a noxious substance was manifestly wrong or excessive.Nor did he\npoint to any passage in the sentencing judge’s decision that would suggest\ninappropriate considerations leading to the sentence.[24]In his Notice of Appeal, Mr. Johnston proposes a\nfine of $1.00 and probation.In oral submissions, his counsel argued that\nsimilar cases of aggravated assault might attract a sentence of “3 to 6\nmonths”.In doing so, counsel minimized Mr. Nichols’ physical injuries and\nignored the traumatic psychological effect of Mr. Johnston’s attack on the\nvictim – an effect that has prompted him to leave the province out of fear of\nMr. Johnston.[25]The suggestion of a fine for a violent crime like\nthis, in all the circumstances, is patently unreasonable.Although no\nauthorities were cited by counsel, an incarceration difference of between six and\nnine months has the appearance of tinkering with the sentencingjudge’s\ndiscretion.[26]Nothing in the record, the judge’s decision or\nMr. Johnston’s submissions, establishes an arguable issue that nine months\nincarceration was excessive in all the circumstances of these offences and this\noffender.Denunciation and Deterrence[27]It is well established that violent offenders\nshould usually be admonished with a term of incarceration.In R. v.\nChisholm, [1998] N.S.J. No. 274 (C.A.), Justice Bateman observed that\ndeterrence should be emphasized in crimes of violence:16In R. v. Coleman\n(1992), 1992 CanLII 2589 (NS CA), 110 N.S.R. (2d) 65 (N.S.S.C.A.D.), Hallett, J.A. reaffirmed the\naccepted principle that crimes of violence require an emphasis on general and\nspecific deterrence most commonly reflected by a significant period of\nincarceration in a provincial institution.[28]The sentencing judge noted:The crime that you committed is a\nviolent crime.You located him, you identified him, you followed him into the\nparking lot, you then struck him from behind in a vehicle that accelerated\ntowards Mr. Nichols.It is extremely fortunate that his injuries were not more\nsevere.Your actions were deliberate, as acknowledged in your agreed statement\nof facts in paragraph 11.Your lawyer has argued that you can accept what you\ndo, meaning your actions, without fully understanding why you do them, and I\naccept that.You have had a public shaming.However, your actions were serious and there must be serious consequences for\nthem.Clearly, the case law speaks of the need to address specifically the\nprinciples of denunciation and deterrence.The Crown has suggested a sentence\nrange of 12 to 15 months actually (sic) custody and Defence has suggested\nprobation.The case law submitted can be distinguished in the manner outlined\nby the Defence.The cases proffered involve somewhat different charges,\ndifferent offences and different aggravating and mitigating factors.Having said that, the offence is\nserious and Mr. Nichols is fortunate that he is not more severely injured.But\nby your actions you have harmed Mr. Nichols, his wife, the child, your family,\nthe entire community to which you belong.A sentence must be imposed that\nsends a message not only to you but to others that crimes of violence, serious\nviolence, will have serious consequences before this Court.[29]Denunciation and deterrence are proper\nconsiderations when sentencing for a violent offence.The judge made no error\nin taking them into account, nor did she unduly emphasize them.Principle of Restraint[30]It is incorrect to accuse the judge of failing\nto consider the principle of restraint, as Mr. Johnston does in his third\nground of appeal. The judge quoted ss. 718, 718.1 and 718.2 from the Code.She then cited the Ontario Court of Appeal decision of R. v. Hamilton\n(2004), 2004 CanLII 5549 (ON CA), 186 C.C.C. (3d) 129, noting, amongst other things, that:“…The Criminal Code views\nimprisonment as a sentence of option of last resort.An offender should not be\ndeprived of liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate.In the\ncircumstances, all available sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are\nreasonable in the circumstances should be considered.”[31]She went on to refer to s. 718.2 including s-s.\n(e) which counsels against imprisonment when other sanctions are reasonable.[32]The sentencing judge found:It is clear from the facts presented\nthat the actions of Mr. Johnston were planned and deliberate.That is an\naggravating feature.A mitigating feature, however, is that he cooperated\nfully with the RCMP and provided a cautioned statement admitting his\ninvolvement.He has also pled guilty and accepted responsibility, saving the\nvictim and the victim’s family from having to testify before this court.[33]The sentencing judge noted that Mr. Johnston had\nno prior record and remarked on other mitigating factors:He is 40 years of age, he is\nappearing before this Court without a prior criminal record.He had the benefit\nof a positive upbringing. He is supported by his family.He has a strong connection\nto the workforce, he’s been employed in the past as a part-time teacher and is\npresently working as a musician and a magician.It is clear from the pre-sentence\nreport that there have been some mental health issues.To his credit, he’s\nsought out the services of a psychiatrist who he has been seeing on a fairly\nregular basis.He has had some suicide thoughts in the past.There’s no\nhistory of drug or alcohol abuse.[34]In her 20 page reserved decision, the sentencing\njudge reviewed the evidence, appropriate jurisprudence, and the principles of\nsentencing, before imposing a nine-month sentence and related orders.Nothing\nsuggests that a successful attack can be made on her findings.Conclusion:[35]In view of my determination with respect to\n“arguable issues”, and leave, it is unnecessary to address the last two\ncriteria for interim release.[36]The appeal fails to raise arguable issues.Leave to appeal and interim release are denied.Bryson, J.A."}

Wein of the Superior Courtof Justice dated September 6, 2006 and the sentence imposed dated January29, 2007.ENDORSEMENT[1]Theappellant was charged with eleven offences.Four of the counts involvedsexual assaults and seven involved other assaults.The victims of the assaultswere the appellant’s daughter and three of his stepdaughters.The offenceswere historical in nature and were alleged to have occurred over a fifteen-yearperiod.The appellant was tried by a judge alone and convicted on all counts.Hereceived a total sentence of 3 years imprisonment.The appellant appealsconviction and requests leave to appeal sentence.[2]Wepropose to address the arguments urged on us by counsel for the appellantin oral argument.We will not address the submissions in the factum thatwere not advanced in oral argument.Conviction Appeal(i)The Conviction on Count 4[3]Count4 alleged gross indecency involving Rachel, one of the stepdaughters.Counselsubmits that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence at para. 164 ofher reasons and disbelieved the appellant because of that misapprehension.[4]Wedo not accept this interpretation of the trial judge’s reasons.It was opento the trial judge to find, based on the appellant’s admissions as to when(1980-81) and where the events underlying this allegation of gross indecencyoccurred, that Rachel was between the ages of eleven and thirteen when theevent occurred.The appellant’s evidence on cross-examination that his presentrecollection was that Rachel was younger than that when the event occurreddoes not detract from the appellant’s own evidence as to when the event occurredand Rachel’s actual age (eleven to thirteen) at that time.(ii)The Convictions on Counts 7 and 8[5]Thesecounts alleged a sexual assault and an indecent assault involving the stepdaughter,Mary Lyn.The appellant submits that the trial judge erred at para. 51 ofher reasons when she said:… The realityis that her evidence (Mary Lyn) was largely confirmed by the evidence ofthe other witnesses.…[6]Theappellant submits that the other witnesses, in fact, did not confirm MaryLyn’s evidence on its central features and that one of the stepsisters (Elizabeth)contradicted significant parts of Mary Lyn’s evidence.[7]Thetrial judge reviewed the evidence in relation to these counts in some detailbetween paras. 173 and 179.This review included the evidence of the stepsister,Rachel, which did confirm the evidence of Mary Lyn.The trial judge alsoreviewed the evidence ofElizabeth.We are not satisfied that any part of that review was inaccurate.WhileElizabeth’s evidence certainly did not confirm Mary Lyn’s evidence to thesame extent as did the evidence of Rachel, there were aspects ofElizabeth’s evidence that were potentially supportive of Mary Lyn’s evidence.Wesee no error in the trial judge’s review of the evidence or in her referenceto the existence of confirmatory evidence from the other sisters.(iii)The Conviction on Count 1[8]Count1 alleged an ongoing sexual assault against the appellant’s own daughter,Jessica.Although all of the charges were serious, this charge was probablythe most serious.The trial judge reviewed the evidence in relation to thiscount in detail.She was aware of the specific difficulty inherent in assessingthe reliability of Jessica’s evidence.Jessica testified that she recalledthe events that were relevant to the sexual assault charges some time shortlyafter she left the appellant’s home when she was seventeen years of age.Sherecalled that these events occurred when she was between the ages of sevenand thirteen.Jessica also testified that her memory became more detailedafter she sought counselling for herself.[9]Atpara. 216 of her reasons, the trial judge specifically indicates that an “additionallayer of scrutiny” was needed in respect of Jessica’s evidence because ofthe manner in which she purported to recall the details of the relevant events.Thereis no reason to think that the trial judge did not do exactly what she saidshe had to do and examine that evidence with additional scrutiny.[10]Inthe end, the trial judge believed the evidence of Jessica and accepted thather recollection was reliable.We see no misapprehension in the relevantevidence affecting that determination.The trial judge was entitled, asa matter of law, to accept the evidence of Jessica even though special scrutinywas required given the way in which she came to recall the relevant events.(iv)The Trial Judge’s Overall Approach[11]Inaddition to the attack on specific convictions, counsel for the appellantargues that the trial judge shifted the burden of proof and placed that burdenon the appellant on all counts.Counsel also submits that the trial judgeapplied a different standard when testing the credibility and reliabilityof the appellant’s evidence than she did when testing the reliability andcredibility of the evidence of the complainants.[12]Thissubmission is a very familiar one to this court and requires a review ofthe entirety of the reasons of the trial judge.We have examined those lengthyand detailed reasons.In our view, there is no support for the submissionthat the reasons placed a burden of proof on the appellant or subjected theappellant’s evidence to a higher level of scrutiny.The trial judge’s reasonsfor rejecting the appellant’s various explanations and denials were fullysupported in the evidence and were, in our view, reasonable.The trial judgealso expressly referred to W.D. and applied the formula set out in W.D. inassessing whether the Crown had met its burden of proof.[13]Theconviction appeal is dismissed.The Sentence Appeal[14]Thetrial judge imposed a total sentence of 3 years imprisonment.This sentencewas in the low end of the appropriate range given the seriousness of thesecrimes, the blatant breach of trust and the number of victims involved inthis matter.In imposing a sentence near the bottom end of the range, thetrial judge took into account the appellant’s many and significant medicalproblems.She also expressed the belief that the prison authorities couldadequately address those medical problems.[15]Themain thrust of the argument before us on the sentence appeal is that theevidence establishes that the prison authorities are not able to meet theappellant’s medical needs.Counsel submits that it would be appropriateto reduce the sentence to 2 years less a day so that a conditional sentencecould be imposed.The appellant submits that a conditional sentence involvingvirtual house arrest except for medical reasons would meet the needs of deterrenceand denunciation.[16]Wecannot agree.In our view, a sentence of 2 years less a day is simply toolittle to adequately reflect the seriousness of these offences.In addition,the evidence placed before us to the effect that the correctional authoritieshave not met the appellant’s medical needs is not persuasive.We are notsatisfied that the evidence demonstrates that those needs have not been metand will not be met.No doubt, it would be better for the appellant’s medicaltreatment if he were not incarcerated.That is, however, no justificationfor interfering with an entirely appropriate sentence that takes into accountthe added difficulties the appellant will face in custody.[17]Leaveto appeal sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.“Doherty J.A.”“J.

Crawford ..............................................................................................................for\nMr. LithgowBLOUIN J.:[1]Terrence Lithgow entered guilty pleas to\ncounts of Sexual Exploitation pursuant to s. 153(1) and Internet Luring\npursuant to s. 172.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.[2]The complainant was 14 and 15 during the\ngrades 9 and 10 years that Mr. Lithgow, then in his early fifties, was her\nteacher.During those two years they e-mailed and chatted using a computer.The discussion became increasingly more sexual in nature and developed into\nvisits at lunch where touching occurred.Mr. Lithgow told the complainant that\nhe loved her.[3]When the complainant was in Grade 11, Mr.\nLithgow was no longer her teacher but continued in a position of trust acting\nas her math tutor.They continued contact by electronic means, which\nultimately lead to oral sex and then unprotected intercourse on 25 to 30\noccasions.He supplied alcohol and made her promise not to tell anyone.Except for the law, which prohibits consent under 18 in these situations, there\nwas no indication of any lack of consent.[4]Eventually the complainant told her mother\nand the police were called.Mr. Lithgow, to his credit, gave an inculpatory\nstatement to the police and made no attempt to get bail.When his wife found\nout, she ordered him out of the house.[5]Section 718 of the Criminal Code:The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to\ncontribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and\nthe maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions\nthat have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the\ncommunity; and(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and\nacknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.[6]The pre-sentence report indicates a previous\nrecord which includes an entry for Uttering Threats where a conditional\ndischarge with two years probation was ordered on May 11, 2006, and another\nentry on November 11, 2006 for Fail to Comply Probation, which, after five days\npre-trial detention, Mr. Lithgow was granted a conditional discharge with 18\nmonths probation.[7]However, I note that the offences before the\ncourt cover a time range ending in April 2006, so the entries to the record\npost-date these offences.[8]A victim impact statement was filed.The\ncomplainant’s mother has been devastated by this offence and read the victim\nimpact statement in court.The complainant, according to the pre-sentence\nreport, did not appear to be interested in responding to the offence.[9]The Crown takes the position that the\nappropriate sentence is two years less a day with respect to the combination of\nboth sentences minus any pre-trial detention.Mr. Crawford urges a sentence of\n10 months incarceration minus pre-trial detention, then a conditional sentence.The Law[10]In R. v. Gaukrodger (2006) 2006 CanLII 31292 (ON CA), O.J. No.\n3614 the Ontario Court of Appeal affirmed a sentence of 15 months incarceration\nfollowed by two years probation following a guilty plea for seven acts of\nsexual intercourse over a one-month period involving a 26-year-old teacher and\na 14-year-old former student.[11]In R. v. Byford [2000] O.J. No 2134,\nGauthier, J. of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice imposed an 18-month\nperiod of incarceration followed by 18 months of probation.Mr. Byford had no\nrecord, entered a guilty plea, and showed public remorse.The complainant had\na long-term sexual relationship with him as her teacher.[12]Other cases of sexual exploitation in this\nprovince have attracted similar sentences.The Crown provided cases that would\nassist with respect to the appropriate sentence on the Internet Luring offence.[13]In R. v. Folino 2005 CanLII 40543 (ON CA), [2005] O.J. No. 4737,\nthe Ontario Court of Appeal examined a nine-month sentence of incarceration for\na 35-year-old man who communicated with a person who he believed to be a\n13-year-old girl.At paragraph 25, McMurtry C.J.O. stated,Having come to this conclusion, I wish to\nfirst make it clear that I fully agree with the sentencing judge that the\noffence of child luring must be dealt with seriously by the courts.The social\npolicy underlying the enactment of this offence is clear.Many Canadian\nfamilies have home computers with Internet access.Children are frequent users\nof the Internet.Children, as vulnerable members of our society, must be\nsafeguarded against predators who abuse the Internet to lure children into\nsituations where they can be sexually exploited and abused.In most\ncircumstances involving the offence of child luring, the sentencing goals of\ndenunciation and deterrence will require a sentence of institutional\nincarceration.Indeed, it will only be in the rarest of cases that a\nconditional sentence will be appropriate in a case involving this offence.In\nmy view, however, this is one of those rare cases.In those rare\ncircumstances, an 18-month conditional sentence was substituted.[14]In Folino, McMurtry C.J.O. concluded\nthat the trial judge did not consider significant mitigating factors such as\nuncontradicted expert evidence that the risk of repeating these offences was\nnegligible, the significant remorse, progress in counselling and devastating impact\non the accused and his family.[15]Mr. Lithgow has been in detention since June\n13, 2007.The pre-sentence report outlines a history of anxiety, depression\nand suicidal ideation culminating in a diagnosis of a major mood disorder. He\nneeds mental health intervention.Despite this, the report’s author was of the\nopinion that Mr. Lithgow does not pose an imminent risk to the greater community\nbut is not, at this time, suitable for community supervision.Mr. Lithgow\nappears to be motivated to receive mental health assistance while in custody\nand upon release.[16]In concluding, the aggravating factors\ninvolve the breach of trust inherent in both of these offences.The difference\nin age between the complainant and the accused in this case was as great as one\ncould imagine.Only time will tell the damage done to the complainant.[17]In mitigation, Mr. Lithgow pleaded guilty at\nthe earliest opportunity, did not apply for bail, admitted his offence to the\npolice, and has publicly showed great remorse for his offending behaviour.[18]At the time of both offences, he had no\ncriminal record.Despite his mental health problems, his estranged wife spoke well\nof his commitment to his two young children.His 30-year teaching career and\nhis marriage have both been decimated as a result of these criminal acts.[19]When I weigh all of the above factors and\nconsider the principles of parity and totality I conclude the least restrictive\nsanction that is appropriate for this offence of sexual exploitation is 15\nmonths of incarceration.Since Mr. Lithgow has been in custody since June 13,\n2007 he will be given credit for 10 months.He will serve an additional five months\nin custody commencing today.[20]Now, with respect to the Internet Luring\ncount, in consideration of the mitigating factors and the fact that this case\ninvolved communication which led to the Exploitation charge which has attracted\na significant sentence of incarceration, I am of the view that denunciation and\ndeterrence can be met by a conditional sentence involving house arrest for 12\nmonths.[21]Like R. v. Folino, there is some\ninconclusive evidence that makes it unlikely Mr. Lithgow is suffering from pedophilia,\nand like R. v. Folino, I find this to be the rare case that does not\nrequire institutional incarceration for the additional offence.Released:November 9, 2007Signed: “Justice R.

Andres Hannah-Suarez, for the CrownPaulAubin, for the Accused)))HEARD:March 9, 2012DUNNET J. (Orally)REASONS FOR\nSENTENCE[1]Omar Lawson has been found guilty of possession of a restricted firearm\ntogether with readily accessible ammunition capable of being discharged in the\nfirearm.[2]The evidence satisfied me beyond a reasonable doubt that on December 4,\n2009, police entered apartment 208 at 11 Catford Road in Toronto to execute a\nsearch warrant.Mr. Lawson, his wife, mother-in-law and five children were\npresent in the apartment.[3]As the police were clearing the apartment, they received information\nfrom officers on the ground, who had been tasked to watch the balcony and\nwindows that they saw Mr. Lawson force a handgun through a window screen.The\ngun fell to the ground below. During the search of the apartment, seventy-seven\nrounds of ammunition were found on top of a dresser in the room with the damaged\nscreen.[4]The next day, Mr. Lawson's wife asked the police to return to the\napartment.When they arrived, she led them to a suitcase in a bedroom.In an\noutside pocket, they found a loose bullet and a magazine with bullets.When\nthe officer asked if “Omar” lived at the address, she said that he “just stayed\nthere sometimes”.[5]At the outset of his trial, Mr. Lawson brought an application for an\norder excluding all incriminating evidence discovered as a result of the search.The application proceeded by way of submissions.I concluded that the search was\nconducted in violation of Mr. Lawson’s section 8 Charter rights, because\nthe redacted information from a confidential informant was insufficient to\nraise a reasonable probability that Mr. Lawson would be in possession of the\nsuspected handgun.[6]I found, however, that the police who were executing the search warrant believed\nthat they were acting pursuant to a legally authorized search.Also, there was\nno evidence that officers inside the apartment were aware that Mr. Lawson had tossed\na gun out the window before he entered the hallway in response to their\ncommands.Following my ruling, counsel brought to my attention the notes of\npolice officer Michael West which stated that he saw Mr. Lawson use a gun to\nslice through the screen and he stood by until he received confirmation that\nMr. Lawson was in custody before advising the officers inside the apartment\nabout the “property out the window”.I concluded that any causal connection\nbetween the constitutional violation and the discovery of the gun was tenuous,\nat best, and, in any event, the police actions were not in deliberate disregard\nfor Mr. Lawson’s Charter rights.[7]To the extent that there was a breach of his right to be free from\nunreasonable search and seizure of the contents of his suitcase, I found that it\nwas of an inadvertent nature and not a willful or egregious act.Further, the magazine\nand ammunition in the suitcase would have been discovered through the search\nwarrant process, in the absence of consent from Mr. Lawson’s wife.[8]Balancing the lines of inquiry mandated by R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC\n32 (CanLII), I was of the opinion that the gun offence was serious. Mr. Lawson was a\ntemporary inhabitant in a residence with young children where he kept a gun, a magazine\nand ninety-four rounds of ammunition.In the absence of this crucial and\nreliable information, the prosecution would fail.Thus, a reasonable person\ninformed of all relevant circumstances and the values underlying the Charter\nwould not conclude that admission of the evidence would bring the\nadministration of justice into disrepute.[9]After his arrest, Mr. Lawson acknowledged to police that the gun\nbelonged to him. He told them that he had purchased the gun in order to protect\nhimself and his family, because he had been shot at a nightclub in September\n2008, and he and his wife had been receiving threatening telephone calls.[10]Mr. Lawson is a 37 year old Canadian citizen.He is married with five\nchildren between the ages of two and thirteen years.Between 2003 and 2009, he\nworked at Jamaica House Kitchen in Brampton. While he has been subject to\nconditions of his bail, he has worked with his brother at That Guy Corp. in\nToronto.[11]His criminal record consists of the following offences: theft under\n$1000 in 1991; two convictions for possession of property obtained by crime and\ndangerous operation of a motor vehicle in 1993; conspiracy to commit robbery in\n1995, for which he was sentenced to two years less a day and probation for 18\nmonths; obstruct peace officer in 1999; assault with intent to resist arrest\nand failing to comply with his recognizance in 2000, for which he received the\nequivalent of a 16 month sentence and a section 109 mandatory prohibition order\nfor ten years in relation to weapons offences.[12]The Crown submits that a penitentiary sentence of five years is\nwarranted in order to denounce Mr. Lawson’s repeated criminal conduct and deter\nhim from committing further crimes.[13]On behalf of Mr. Lawson, it is asserted that an upper end reformatory\nsentence to be served in the community would reflect the exceptional circumstances\nof this case.It is submitted that after his marriage and the birth of his\nchildren, Mr. Lawson abandoned his criminal lifestyle.When he was the victim\nof a shooting in a nightclub, he cooperated with police.After the\nperpetrators were convicted, he began to receive threats and acquired a firearm\nfor his protection.It is the position of the defence that while on bail, Mr.\nLawson has conducted himself appropriately and he is remorseful.Numerous letters\nfiled on his behalf reflect that he is a loving husband and father whose family\nwould be affected emotionally and financially by a lengthy penitentiary sentence.[14]Mitigating factors relevant to sentence are as follows:(a)Mr. Lawson's criminal record is dated.(b)He has not breached conditions of his bail.(c)He has a supportive family.(d)He has saved court resources by waiving his preliminary inquiry and admitting\nthe Crown's case when his Charter application failed.(e)The firearm was not loaded.(f)He cooperated with police. Although he initially threw the gun out the\nwindow in order to evade criminal association, he provided a statement to\npolice where he admitted that the gun was his.It is noteworthy that he told\nthe police that there was no magazine in the apartment, when in fact, a high\ncaliber magazine was found in the suitcase.[15]It is submitted that there is no evidence that Mr. Lawson had the gun for\nreasons other than self defence because he was receiving threatening telephone\ncalls from individuals whom he suspected had been involved in the shooting at\nthe nightclub.This is not a mitigating factor.Moreover, it does not explain\nwhy he was in need of ninety-four rounds of ammunition.I concur with the\ncomments of Crown counsel that we do not live in a state where people have to\ntake protection into their own hands.That is why we have the police.Parliament\nhas specifically legislated against guns.The potential exists for the all too\ncommon crossfire situation.[16]Aggravating factors relevant to sentence are as follows:(a)Mr. Lawson was in possession of an illegal high capacity magazine capable\nof causing significant carnage.(b)Every bullet carried with it the potential for fatal consequences,\nwhether intended or accidental.(c)The gun, magazine and ammunition were kept in a home with young\nchildren.(d)There is no indication that the items were kept in a secure location.The\ngun did not have a trigger lock.Seventy-seven bullets were on top of a\ndresser.A high capacity magazine and seventeen bullets were in an outside\npocket of a suitcase in a bedroom.(e)This is Mr. Lawson’s ninth conviction and his seventh as an adult.He\nhas had four custodial sentences.(f)He has a criminal record for violence.He received an upper reformatory\nsentence for conspiracy to commit robbery and the equivalent to an upper\nreformatory sentence for assault with intent to resist arrest.(g)He chose to purchase a handgun when he was subject to a mandatory\nprohibition order.[17]On May 1, 2008, the previous minimum sentence for a section 95 offence\nincreased from one to three years for a first offence (Tackling Violent\nCrime Act, S.C. 2008, c. 6, s. 8).In R. v. Smickle, 2012 ONSC 602 (CanLII),\nMolloy J. declared that the reference to a minimum punishment of imprisonment\nof, “in the case of a first offence, three years,” as set out in s. 95(2)(a)(i)\nof the Criminal Code, was inconsistent with the Charter of Rights and\nFreedoms and of no force and effect.Counsel agree that if this court is\nsatisfied that a fit and appropriate sentence for Mr. Lawson is three years or\nmore, there is no need to deal with the issue of the constitutionality of the\nmandatory minimum sentence provision.[18]The constitutional issue was canvassed at length by Code J. in R. v.\nNur, 2011 ONSC 4874 (CanLII).Mr. Nur was a 19-year-old first offender who pleaded\nguilty to possession of a loaded prohibited firearm. He had been standing\noutside a community center when the police arrived and a chase ensued during\nwhich he threw away a semi-automatic loaded handgun with an oversized\nammunition clip.[19]Code J. analyzed sentences prior to Parliament’s introduction of the\nthree-year mandatory minimum sentence (paras. 49-52).He concluded that the\nappropriate range of sentence for a first offence of possession of a loaded\nhandgun was between two years less a day and three years imprisonment and much\nlonger sentences were imposed for recidivists.[20]In 2005, Toronto experienced a dramatic increase in gun-related\nhomicides and that year came to be known as “the year of the gun”.Code J.\nobserved that as the proliferation of handguns and homicides involving handguns\nincreased, the justice system responded to public alarm by stiffening its\napproach to sentencing in cases involving handguns.He noted that in the seven\nyear period leading up to passage of the 2008 legislation, there was an\nincrease of 139% in the number of s. 95 firearms charges (paras. 49, 91).[21]With respect to the constitutional issue, while Code J. found that the\nsection 7 ground had merit, Mr. Nur had no standing to raise it.He remarked\nthat there was little sentencing case law to provide guidance concerning the\napplication of the new minimum sentence.He then reviewed R. v. Dene,\n[2010] O.J. No. 5192, where the offender was sentenced to five and one half\nyears, including four years for his first s. 95 offence and six months for breach\nof a section 109 order.Mr. Dene was 21 years old and had a prior conviction\nfor trafficking cocaine.He fled from the police in a high crime area and when\nhe was caught, he was found in possession of a gun and 28 rounds of ammunition.\nThe sentence was upheld on appeal (2010 ONCA 796 (CanLII)).[22]Code J. found that Mr. Nur should receive a sentence of more than the\nminimum, because of aggravating features, notably that he threw away the gun in\na public parking area and the over-sized magazine.Although he would have\nimposed a sentence of two and one-half years under the earlier legislation, he\nconcluded that the appropriate sentence for Mr. Nur under the post-2008 regime\nwas forty months imprisonment (para. 87).[23]Notably, in Dene, a sentence of five and one-half years was\nconsidered by the Court of Appeal to be at the “high end” for an offender with\na criminal record, who fled from police, was found in possession of a gun and\nammunition and breached a section 109 order.In Nur, there were fewer\naggravating factors and a sentence of just over three years was imposed.[24]The Crown also relies upon a number of recent cases in support of his\nsubmission that a five year sentence is warranted.In R. v. Velez-Lau,\n2011 ONSC 4805 (CanLII), a 24 year old first offender received a sentence of four\nyears for possession of two firearms, a magazine containing fifteen bullets and\nboxes containing sixty-eight bullets that were discovered by police in a\nstorage locker.[25]In R. v. Morris, 2011 ONSC 5206 (CanLII), a 25 year old man, who\ndid not have a firearms related record received a sentence of fifty months,\nincluding forty-four months for firearms offences, one of which was for\npossession of a loaded restricted firearm.[26]In R. v. James, 2011 ONSC 241 (CanLII), following a plea, the court\nimposed a sentence of three and one half years for possession of a loaded\nprohibited firearm and eight months for breach of a prohibition order.Mr.\nJames was in front of a community center when police approached and in the\ncourse of the pursuit, he tossed a handgun with a magazine holding six rounds into\nthe rear of a dump truck. He was 26 years of age and had a criminal record,\nincluding a trafficking conviction for which he received a sentence amounting\nto twenty-five months.[27]At para. 26 in James, Spies J. held:Furthermore, although in his mind he had a reason\nfor carrying a firearm, which I understood was for his own protection, that reason\ncannot be endorsed by this court. There was no legitimate reason for Mr. James\nto carry a firearm and, in fact, he had been ordered by the court not to do so.Tragically, many young people in this city have foolishly decided to carry a\nfirearm in the misguided belief that it will afford them some protection.It\nis decisions like these that have no doubt contributed to the unnecessary and\ntragic deaths of many young people in this city.[28]The Crown submits that even absent the sentencing regime after 2008, the\ntrend towards increasing sentences was already recognized in jurisprudence\ncorresponding with a national concern over gun crime and the need for\nsignificant sentences to emphasize denunciation and deterrence in such cases\nevidenced by the loss of life occasioned by their use.See R. v. Reid, 2009\nONCJ 582 (CanLII) at para. 22 and R. v. Ferrigon, 2007 CanLII 16828 (ON SC), [2007]\nO.J. No.1883 at paras. 25, 26.[29]The position of the defence is that Mr. Lawson is approaching 40 years\nof age and has remained crime free for almost a decade.It was only after he\nwas the victim of a shooting and started receiving threats from those associated\nwith the shooting that he acquired the firearm for protection.Moreover, there\nis no evidence that the firearm was loaded, or carried in public, or associated\nwith drugs.[30]The defence contends that the mitigating circumstances in this case\nwarrant an exceptional punishment analogous to the sentence imposed in\nSmickle.Mr. Smickle was reclining on a sofa in his cousin’s apartment\nusing a webcam on his computer to pose with a loaded handgun in one hand in order\nto take his picture for a Facebook page. When the police entered the apartment\nto execute a search warrant, he immediately put down the gun, lay on the floor\nand cooperated fully. Mr. Smickle was a relatively youthful first time offender\nwith a positive pre-sentence report.[31]Molloy J. concluded that Mr. Smickle found the gun in the apartment and\ntook the opportunity to “show off” with it for the benefit of his friends on\nFacebook.She determined that he never intended to use the gun and it was\nnothing more than a prop for the photograph.[32]The defence also relies upon the case of R. v. Los, [2008] O.J.\nNo. 3248.Mr. Los found a rifle in a dumpster and kept it for self\nprotection.During a fracas in the neighbourhood, he fired it into the air to\nstop the fight and disperse the crowd.The court found that this was a case of\nbad judgment and misguided intention.[33]Mr. Los was 30 years of age and the sole breadwinner for his large\nfamily.His remorse was mitigating, as was the minor nature of his dated\nrecord.The court was impressed with how Mr. Los had turned his life around\nafter his difficult teenaged years and found that incarceration would put an\nemotional and financial strain on the family.The court concluded, however,\nthat the minimum sentence of one year should not be imposed because of the\nserious consequences that could have resulted from the discharge of the firearm\nin the community.Mr. Los received a sentence of 18 months for the firearms\noffences, including possession of a prohibited firearm under s. 95(1) of the\nCode.[34]The defence also relies on the following cases:R. v. Canepa, 2011\nONSC 1406 (CanLII), R. v. Williams, 2011 ONSC 3914 (CanLII), R. v. McIntosh, 2010\nONSC 916 (CanLII), R. v. Brown, [2006] O.J. No. 4681 (S.C.), R. v. Grant,\n2006 CanLII 18347 (ON CA), 81 O.R. (3d) 1 (S.C.), R. v. Newman, [2003] O.J. No. 5574 (S.C.), R.\nv. Beckford, [2008] O.J. 1781 (S.C.), R. v. Z.S., [2005] O.J. No.\n1716 (S.C.), R. v. Manickavasagar, [2002] O.J. No. 5828; aff’d, 2004 CanLII 26063 (ON CA), [2004]\nO.J. No. 1595 (C.A.), R. v. B.S., 2011 ONSC 6463 (CanLII), R. v. Lawes,\n2007 ONCA 10 (CanLII) and R. v. Z.L.M., 2011 ONSC 4051 (CanLII).[35]It is notable that in Williams, the offender who was in\npossession of a gun and threw it into a dumpster in a busy area received a one\nyear sentence.Mr. Williams, however, had a minor criminal record involving no\nfirearms related offences.[36]In McIntosh, where a fifteen month sentence was imposed for\npossession of a firearm, Quigley J. noted that the minimum sentence under the\nlegislation at the time of the offence was one year and if he had been\nsentencing Mr. McIntosh for other drug-related charges that were not heard at\nthe same time, he would have imposed a two year penitentiary sentence.The\ncourt was influenced by Mr. McIntosh’s prospects for rehabilitation in that he\nwas disassociating himself from those involved in criminal activities and his\npast involvements with the law were related to illegal substances and domestic\nviolence; both issues he appeared to addressing successfully through counseling.Also, there were delays associated with the trial unrelated to Mr. McIntosh.[37]Most of these cases are fact-specific and of little assistance.Some\nwere decided before the justice system stiffened its approach to sentencing in\ncases involving handguns.Many involve youthful first offenders with minor\nrecords.[38]I accept that Mr. Lawson is remorseful and that incarceration would put\nan emotional and financial strain on his family.His criminal record is dated\nand he has complied with his conditions of bail.[39]On the other hand, Mr. Lawson is not a first offender.He has a\ncriminal record for violence and has served four previous custodial sentences.Knowing that he was the subject of a prohibition order, he chose to buy a Taurus\n9 mm handgun and bring it into an apartment housing five young children where\nhe also kept a high capacity magazine and ninety-four 9 mm Lugar bullets,\nseventy-seven of which were sitting on top of a dresser in a bedroom.They\nposed a distinct danger to the children because of the consequences that could\nensue if the gun were to be discharged.[40]Further, in order to avoid criminal responsibility when the police\narrived, Mr. Lawson chose to abandon the gun by tossing it out the window to\nthe ground below.If the police had not observed his actions and retrieved the\ngun, it would have created serious concerns for public safety.Mr. Lawson told\nthe police that he had the gun for self-protection.The logical inference is\nthat if the need arose, he would have used the firearm for an unlawful purpose.[41]In R. v. Danvers, {2005 CanLII 30044 (ON CA), 2005] O.J. No. 3532 at para. 78, the Court of\nAppeal held:There is no question that our courts have to\naddress the principles of denunciation and deterrence for gun related crimes in\nthe strongest possible terms. The possession and use of illegal handguns in the\nGreater Toronto Area is a cause for major concern in the community and must be\naddressed.[42]In my view, unlike the facts in Smickle and Los, this case\ndoes not involved “misguided intention” or “bad judgment”.Mr. Lawson intended\nto keep a firearm and a large quantity of ammunition in the apartment.He\nbought the firearm and then attempted to hide it by throwing it out the window\nwhen the police arrived. In contrast, both Mr. Los and Mr. Smickle had found\nthe firearm they possessed.[43]Despite the mitigating factors, there are strong aggravating factors\nthat warrant a penitentiary sentence.I am not persuaded, however, that a\nsentence at the “high end” for these offences is appropriate in the\ncircumstances.[44]Mr. Lawson, would you please stand.I sentence you to a term of\nimprisonment of forty-four months.You are entitled to a credit of ten days\nfor pre-trial custody and three and one-half months for time served under house\narrest.[45]There will be a section 109 mandatory prohibition order for life.As the\noffence is a secondary offence as defined in s. 487.04 of the Code, I exercise\nmy discretion and order that Mr. Lawson provide a DNA sample under s. 487.051.__________________________________DUNNET\nJ.Released:April 5, 2012CITATION:R. v.

He was found guilty\non all counts and today is the day fixed for sentencing.[3]The\nfacts before the Court were that Mr. Hatfield entered a bar called Bikini\nBeach, a place he had previously worked, wearing a mask and carrying a loaded\nsawed-off .22 caliber rifle.At the time the only person present was Bonnie\nMoore, the person hired by the owner of Bikini Beach to clean the premises. Mr.\nHatfield placed the sawed-off loaded .22 caliber rifle between Bonnie Moore’s\neyes and it touched her forehead. He then proceeded to rob the premises of cash\nwhich was kept in the refrigerated area.[4]This\nwas a terrifying event in the life of Boonie Moore for which she has still not\nrecovered. She stated during the trial that she thought she was going to die.\nShe stated through her Victim Impact Statement that she has required\ncounseling, has nightmares, is nervous around people; she was so depressed that\nshe tried to commit suicide. All her friends say that she is a changed person.She feels it is not fair that her life has been affected in such a way.[5]It\nis clear that the robbery is going to have a lasting effect on Bonnie Moore.[6]I\nam mindful of the sections of the Criminal Code namely sections\n718, 718.1, and 718.2 which deals with the principles and purposes of\nsentencing. In R. v. Basque (1999), 1999 CanLII 9448 (NB CA), 211 N.B.R. (2d) 273, the New\nBrunswick Court of Appeal varied a trial judge’s sentence of a person who\ncommitted a robbery while armed with an imitation offensive weapon. At the time\nthe accused was also masked. At paragraph 30 of the decision, Drapeau J. A., as\nhe then was, said:A\nreview of the relevant case law quickly reveals that the sentence imposed in\nthis case differs markedly and unreasonably from sentences usually imposed for\nrobbery and disguise with intent offences committed in circumstances similar to\nthe ones in this case.Consequently, the sentence is not consistent with the\nprinciple of similar sentences for similar offences.This court has recognized\nthat robbery is a very serious offence and that Parliament has deemed fit to\nacknowledge this gravity by providing that every one who commits robbery is guilty\nof an indictable offence and liable to life imprisonment.Indeed, this court\nhas approved a range of sentences from three to eight years of imprisonment in\na penitentiary for this offence when committed by someone other than a young\noffender.See R. v. Matthews (1983), 45 N.B.R. (2d) 265 (C.A.)\nat 268 and R. v. Vautour (1987), 76 N.B.R. (2d) 380 (C.A.)[7]A major purpose of sentencing is to provide a deterrence to the person\nwho committed the crime but also to provide deterrence to others. As well, it\nis essential that the Court denounce this activity in the clearest possible way\nthrough the sentence.[8]Counsel\nfor Mr. Hatfield has suggested that Mr. Hatfield should only receive a sentence\nin the three to eight year range and because this was an impromptu robbery and\nshowed no planning or organization consequently it should be in the lower\nrange.[9]The\nCrown, on the other hand, says that this is a serious offence, which was\npremeditated, and the victim has been traumatized for life. In addition Mr.\nHatfield has a lengthy criminal record therefore the Crown suggests that the\nsentence should be in the 12 to 15 year range.[10]Mr.\nHatfield was given an opportunity to speak at this hearing. He apologized to\nBonnie Moore and explained that he has a major problem with drugs and when he\nis on drugs he does crazy things and this was another in a series of crazy\nthings.[11]Weighing\nall of these comments, applying the principles and purposes of sentence as\noutlined in sections 718, 718.1 and 718.2 and the aggravating and mitigating\nfactors, I believe it is important to denounce what Mr. Hatfield did and at the\nsame time attempt to deter Mr. Hatfield, who has an extensive record, from any\nsuch activities in the future. I pause for a moment to try to image what any\nperson, Bonnie Moore or anyone else, would feel with a loaded shotgun placed\nbetween a person’s eyes not knowing whether the gun is loaded or not loaded, in\nthis case it was a loaded rifle that is capable of firing very easily, and the\neffects that that has on a person is quite frankly beyond my understanding. But\nI do understand why Bonnie Moore has indicated that this is a life sentence for\nher.[12]As\nwell, I agree with the Crown Prosecutor that we seem to have in Moncton a fair\nnumber of these types of offences and some people seem to be of the view that\nit’s just a frivolous offence.We’re just trying to get money for drugs or\nwe’re trying to get money for something else, whatever the need may be, and it\nis okay to use whatever means are available in order to extract this from\npeople who are lawfully running stores or bars or other businesses. I think\nit’s important that this Court and all the Courts in New Brunswick send out a\nclear message that there will be serious repercussions if you are caught and\nconvicted of these offences.[13]Section\n718.2 of the Criminal Code of Canada requires\nthat I give a sentence which is similar to other offenders who have committed\nsimilar crimes in similar circumstances. Glennie, J. in R. v.\nLeaver 2002 NBQB 25 (CanLII) considered a similar case and he\nimposed a sentence of 7 ½ years. The Court of appeal in Basque said\neight years as the upper maximum. In my view I don’t believe that that upper\nmaximum is sufficient and I believe that the upper maximum should be higher.[14]Mr.\nHatfield has been incarcerated since the commission of the crime for\napproximately 13 months.While not a requirement, there is a generally held\nview that such a time should be considered as double time and therefore he\nshould be considered to have spent 26 months in jail.[15]Mr.\nHatfield would you please stand.Considering\nthe purposes and principles of sentencing and the authorities and the comments\nthat have been made I am imposing a sentence on Shawn Michael Hatfield as\nfollows: Recognizing that Mr. Hatfield has served what is the equivalent of 2\nyears, I am sentencing Mr. Hatfield to eight years for the armed robbery.\nRecognizing the need for denunciation and deterrence as pointed out in section\n743.62, I am ordering that one half of the sentence to be served before Mr.\nHatfield will be eligible for parole.I further order 2 years each for the\nremaining four counts which will be served concurrently.[16]I\nam further ordering, pursuant to section 109(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada\nthat Shawn Michael Hatfield be prohibited for life from possessing any firearm,\ncrossbow, restricted weapon, ammunition or explosive substance. In addition, I\nam imposing a victim surcharge of $100.00 for each count or the equivalent of 2\nweeks consecutive to any sentence that I have pronounced in lieu of payment of\nthat fine. Finally, I order that Mr. Hatfield provide a DNA sample.SIGNED\nat\nMoncton, New Brunswick, this 8th day of September, 2003._________________________________________George\nS.

On\nDecember 6, 2008, he contacted the Centre jeunesse de la Montérégie to verify\nthe existence of an extrajudicial sanction in the young person’s record. He\nreceived confirmation of this on December 17, 2008.[4]The pre-sentence report, drafted on December 20, 2007, informed the\nCourt that the young person had already completed an extrajudicial sanction for\nmischief.[5]The agreement between the youth and the delegate of the Provincial\nDirector took place on November 28, 2005. It stipulated that he complete\nfifteen hours of volunteer community work and write a letter of apology to the\nvictim. This measure was successfully completed on January 20, 2006.[6]At the sentencing hearing, counsel for the defense opposed sending this\ninformation to the Court. Essentially, defense counsel maintained that the\nperiod of access to such records as laid down in the Youth Criminal Justice\nAct (YCJA), had expired, and that consequently, the Court could not\nlegally be informed of it.[7]The Crown responded that the information under dispute was legally\naccessible at the time of the conviction on November 2, 2007.[8]The Crown pointed out that the Court, at the suggestion of the parties,\nordered the preparation of a pre-sentence report at time. Because of this\norder, the Crown withheld its representations, including any information\nrelated to the existence of an extrajudicial sanction, for submission at the\nsentencing hearing on January 8, 2008.[9]On January 8, 2008, the parties requested that the hearing be postponed\nuntil February 28, 2008 in order to complete the evidence and their\nrepresentations.Issue under dispute[10]Can the Court be legally informed of the extrajudicial sanction\ncompleted by the young person given the restrictions relating to the period of\naccess to such records set forth in the YCJA?Analysis[11]The purpose of pre-sentence reports is to inform the Court of the\nsituation of a young person so that any orders made or sentences passed are in\naccordance with the purpose and principles of the Act.[12]The report is either mandatory or optional depending on circumstances.\nIn particular, it is mandatory[1] before\nthe Court passes a youth custody sentence, which testifies to the importance\nthe legislator accords to this document at the sentencing stage.[13]The content of the pre-sentence report is governed by s. 40 (2) of the YCJA,\nwhich states:A pre-sentence report\nmade in respect of a young person shall, subject to subsection (3), be in\nwriting and shall include the following, to the extent that it is relevant to\nthe purpose and principles of sentencing set out in section 38 and to the\nrestrictions on custody set out in section 39:(a) the\nresults of an interview with the young person and, if reasonably possible, the\nparents of the young person and, if appropriate and reasonably possible,\nmembers of the young person's extended family;(b) the\nresults of an interview with the victim in the case, if applicable and\nreasonably possible;(c) the\nrecommendations resulting from any conference referred to in section 41;(d) any\ninformation that is applicable to the case, including(i) the age,\nmaturity, character, behaviour and attitude of the young person and his or her\nwillingness to make amends,(ii) any plans put\nforward by the young person to change his or her conduct or to participate in\nactivities or undertake measures to improve himself or herself,(iii) subject to\nsubsection 119(2) (period of access to records), the history of previous\nfindings of delinquency under the Juvenile Delinquents Act, chapter J-3\nof the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970, or previous findings of guilt for\noffences under the Young Offenders Act, chapter Y-1 of the Revised\nStatutes of Canada, 1985, or under this or any other Act of Parliament or any\nregulation made under it, the history of community or other services rendered\nto the young person with respect to those findings and the response of the\nyoung person to previous sentences or dispositions and to services rendered to\nhim or her,(iv) subject to\nsubsection 119(2) (period of access to records), the history of alternative\nmeasures under the Young Offenders Act, chapter Y-1 of the Revised\nStatutes of Canada, 1985, or extrajudicial sanctions used to deal with the\nyoung person and the response of the young person to those measures or\nsanctions,(v) the availability and appropriateness of community\nservices and facilities for young persons and the willingness of the young\nperson to avail himself or herself of those services or facilities,(vi) the relationship between the young person and the young\nperson's parents and the degree of control and influence of the parents over\nthe young person and, if appropriate and reasonably possible, the relationship\nbetween the young person and the young person's extended family and the degree\nof control and influence of the young person's extended family over the young\nperson, and(vii) the school attendance and performance record and the\nemployment record of the young person;(e) any information that may assist the court in\ndetermining under subsection 39(2) whether there is an alternative to custody;\nand(f) any information that the provincial director\nconsiders relevant, including any recommendation that the provincial director\nconsiders appropriate.(Emphasis added.)[14]The YCJA specifies that the pre-sentence report must inform the\nCourt of the young person’s prior history with regard to the application of\nextrajudicial sanctions and their effects on him. On the other hand, this\ndisclosure is subject to the restriction on the period of access to the record\nset forth in s. 119 (2), which states:(2) The period of access referred to in subsection (1) is(a) if an extrajudicial sanction is used\nto deal with the young person, the period ending two years after the young\nperson consents to be subject to the sanction in accordance with paragraph\n10(2)(c);(b) if the young person is acquitted of\nthe offence otherwise than by reason of a verdict of not criminally responsible\non account of mental disorder, the period ending two months after the expiry of\nthe time allowed for the taking of an appeal or, if an appeal is taken, the\nperiod ending three months after all proceedings in respect of the appeal have\nbeen completed;(c) if the charge against the young person\nis dismissed for any reason other than acquittal, the charge is withdrawn, or\nthe young person is found guilty of the offence and a reprimand is given, the\nperiod ending two months after the dismissal, withdrawal, or finding of guilt;(d) if the charge against the young person\nis stayed, with no proceedings being taken against the young person for a\nperiod of one year, at the end of that period;(e) if the young person is found guilty of\nthe offence and the youth sentence is an absolute discharge, the period ending\none year after the young person is found guilty;(f) if the young person is found guilty of\nthe offence and the youth sentence is a conditional discharge, the period\nending three years after the young person is found guilty;(g) subject to paragraphs (i) and (j) and subsection (9), if the young person is found guilty\nof the offence and it is a summary conviction offence, the period ending three\nyears after the youth sentence imposed in respect of the offence has been\ncompleted;(h) subject to paragraphs (i) and (j) and subsection (9), if the young person is found guilty\nof the offence and it is an indictable offence, the period ending five years\nafter the youth sentence imposed in respect of the offence has been completed;(i) subject to subsection (9), if, during\nthe period calculated in accordance with paragraph (g) or (h),\nthe young person is found guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction\ncommitted when he or she was a young person, the latest of(i) the period calculated in\naccordance with paragraph (g)\nor (h), as the case may be, and(ii) the period ending three years\nafter the youth sentence imposed for that offence has been completed; and(j) subject to subsection (9), if, during\nthe period calculated in accordance with paragraph (g) or (h),\nthe young person is found guilty of an indictable offence committed when he or\nshe was a young person, the period ending five years after the sentence imposed\nfor that indictable offence has been completed.(Emphasis added.)[15]Section 119 appears in Part VI of the YCJA, which deals with\nrecords and the confidentiality of information. This part of the Act comprises\nvarious measures aimed at protecting the privacy of young persons and\npreventing their stigmatization. It is one of the many measures in the Act\naimed at rehabilitating and reintegrating young people into the community.[16]Part VI of the YCJA is not entirely new law. A similar concern\nwas already expressed in ss. 38 and following of the Young Offenders Act.[17]Commenting on these provisions of the Young Offenders Act in Reference re Young Offenders Act (P.E.I.)[2], the Supreme Court\nstated:Under the Young\nOffenders Act, the stigma attached to the commission of an offence is reduced\nto a minimum since only a limited number of persons will normally ever become\naware that a young person has committed a criminal act. A whole series of measures are designed to restrict as much as\npossible the public knowledge of the commission of the offence.[18]The YCJA echoes this fundamental concern of the legislator with\nregard to the confidentiality and limited period of access to a young person’s\nrecords.[19]On the other hand, the Quebec Court of Appeal found that the presumption\nof disclosure of the identity of a young person found guilty of one of the\ndesignated offences set out in subsections 2(1) (a) and (b) YCJA\nand subjected to a youth sentence was contrary to section 7 of the Canadian\nCharter of Rights and Freedoms.[3][20]Finding that the presumption constitutes a serious violation of the\npsychological security of young persons, the Court of Appeal wrote:[4][translation]In our legal tradition,\nin which the legislator recognizes the need to deal with young offenders\naccording to a regime distinct from that for adults, a set of measures\nregarding the sentencing of young persons aims at limiting disclosure of the offence as much as possible. That exception to\nthe public’s right to information is justified, as we indicated earlier, by the\nsocial consideration that [translation]\n“publication increases a youth's self-perception as an offender, disrupts the\nfamily's abilities to provide support, and negatively affects interaction with\npeers, teachers, and the surrounding community”. Unless he or she receives help\nand guidance, the young person, once stigmatized as a wrongdoer, may act in\nsuch a way that the stigma becomes a reality.…As\nwe have seen, fundamental justice requires a fair balance between the rights of\na young person and the protection of society. The violation of the young\nperson’s psychological security stemming from that breach of the principle of\nconfidentiality completely disregards the nature and scope of the protections\ngiven the young person under the criminal justice system as a whole. The\napplicable principles and the policies that inspire legislative and legal\npolities in this area have always favoured confidentiality in cases now\ncontemplated by the new measures laid down in the YCJA. In principle, it has\nalways been accepted that, in the long run, society is better protected by a\nban on publication, since such an approach maximizes the chances of\nrehabilitation for young persons found guilty of crimes. While\naccepting that rehabilitation cannot be at the expense of the security of the\npublic, we must nevertheless be certain that the lifting of a publication ban\nthat compromises that rehabilitation meets objectives that trump the need for\nconfidentiality. That has not been demonstrated, and that subject is discussed\nin the second part of the analysis, dealing with justification within the\nmeaning of section 1 of the Charter.(Emphasis added.)[21]It is in the light of these guiding principles of the YCJA and\nthe lessons derived from the case law, and in the search for a just balance\nbetween the young person’s right to privacy and the need to obtain access to\ninformation relevant to his or her case, that the Court now turns to s. 119 (2)\nYCJA.[22]In R. v. R. L[5]., M.L.\nCohen J. of the Ontario Court of Justice describes the restrictions and limitations\nin the period of access to young persons’ records in s. 119(2) as a just\nbalance between the protection of the privacy of young persons and various\nother considerations, including the sound administration of justice.[23]The Court shares this opinion, which formulates the same interpretation\nas that expressed in paragraph 21.[24]Authors Lee Tustin and Robert E. Lutes[6]\nfavour a strict interpretation of this legislative provision:The\nyouth criminal justice system would not be able to function without access to\nany of the information about young persons. It is, therefore, necessary to\nallow access to records of young persons, but, at the same time, control access\nto those records. It is important to restrict access to only those pieces of\ninformation that are necessary for the individual to perform his or her\nparticular function.[25]The text of s.119 (2)(a) limits the period of access to the\nrecord concerning the completion of an extrajudicial sanction by a young person\nto “the period ending two years after the young person consents to be subject\nto the sanction in accordance with paragraph 10(2)(c)”.[26]Section 119(2)(a) is clear and requires no interpretation. The\ncalculation of the two-year period begins precisely on the date of the\nagreement reached between the young person and the delegate of the Provincial\nDirector.[27]The Court notes in paragraphs (i) and (j) of the same section that the\nperiod of access to the record of a young person found guilty of a summary\noffence or an indictable offence shall be prolonged in the event of a repeat\noffence during this same period. However, the period of access to the record\nrelated to the serving of an extrajudicial sanction contains no such extension.\nThe period of access is limited to two years whether or not there is a repeat\noffence.[28]The only exceptions that make it possible to obtain access beyond the\nperiod of access to records kept in compliance with s. 19 (2) are listed in s.\n123 of the YCJA. The situations listed in s. 123 of the YCJA are\nlimited to offences for which there was a conviction. Consequently, records\nrelated to the serving of an extrajudicial sanction are not covered by this\nprovision and access by court order upon the expiry of the period of access to\nthis record is not permitted.[29]On this point, the Department of Justice Canada website states:Furthermore, section 123\nrefers only to youth records that deal with guilty verdicts, excluding\nconsequently any information related to acquittal, dismissal, stay and\nfront-end measures.[30]DISPOSITION[31]In the present case, the young person consented to perform an\nextrajudicial sanction on November 28, 2005.[32]The author of the pre-sentence report made a request to consult this\nrecord to the Centre jeunesse de la Montérégie on December 6, 2007, that is to\nsay, 8 days after the expiry of the two-year period stipulated in s. 119 (2) YCJA.[33]The fact that the young person was found guilty of a new offence on\nNovember 2, 2007, does not constitute an event such as to warrant a\nprolongation of the period of access to this record, unlike the other\nsituations listed in ss. 119 (i) and (j) and 123 of the YCJA.[34]Consequently, release of this information is illegal and all mention\nthereof must be stricken from the pre-sentence report.[35]For these reasons, the Court UPHOLDS the objection and ORDERS the\nsuppression of the information recorded on page 6 of the pre-sentence report,\nunder the heading “Other Measures”.________________________________Mario Gervais, J.C.Q.Mtre Jacques DiamantCounsel for the D.P.P.Me Marie-Pierre BlouinCounsel for the young person[1] Section 39(6) YCJA.[2] 1991 CanLII 8377 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 252.[3]Renvoi\nrelatif au projet de loi C-7,2003 CanLII 52182 (QC CA), AZ-50168661.[4]Paras.\n235 and 253.[5][2008 ] O.J.

The Respondent (Crown) was represented by Ms. Nora Isak.Statutory\nProvisions and Case Law2.The Applicant’s Notice of Application and\nConstitutional Question relied upon the statutory provisions in Sections 7,11\n(d) \u0026 24,of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Section 54 of\nthe Provincial Offences Act and Section 789 (2) of the Criminal Code of Canada which\nstate the following;Canadian Charter of Rights\nand Freedoms7. Everyone has\nthe right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be\ndeprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental\njustice.11. Any person charged with an offence has the right(d) To be presumed innocent until\nproven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent\nand impartial tribunal;24. (1) Anyone\nwhose rights or freedoms, as guaranteed by this Charter, have been infringed or\ndenied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as\nthe court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances.Provincial Offences Act, R.S.O. 1990,\ncP.33, as amended54.(1)Where\na defendant does not appear at the time and place appointed for a hearing and\nit is proved by the prosecutor, having been given a reasonable opportunity to\ndo so, that a summons was served, a notice of trial was given under Part I or\nII, an undertaking to appear was given or a recognizance to appear was entered\ninto, as the case may be, or where the defendant does not appear upon the\nresumption of a hearing that has been adjourned, the court may,(a)\nproceed to hear and determine the proceeding in the absence of the defendant;\nor(b)\nadjourn the hearing and, if it thinks fit, issue a summons to appear or issue a\nwarrant in the prescribed form for the arrest of the defendant. 2009,\nc. 33, Sched. 4, s. 1 (43).Proceeding\narising from failure to appear(2)Where\nthe court proceeds under clause (1) (a) or adjourns the hearing under clause\n(1) (b) without issuing a summons or warrant, no proceeding arising out of the\nfailure of the defendant to appear at the time and place appointed for the\nhearing or for the resumption of the hearing shall be instituted, or if\ninstituted shall be proceeded with, except with the consent of the Attorney\nGeneral or his or her agent. 2009, c. 33, Sched. 4,\ns. 1 (43)Criminal Code of Canada789(2)No information in respect of an\noffence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a great punishment may be\nimposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions.3.The\nApplicant and Respondent also presented to the Court relevant case law to\nassist in its analysis of the constitutional question; the cases included;•The\n1993, Ontario Court of Justice decision, Regina vs. Walcot•The\n1995, British Columbia Court of Appeal decision, Regina vs. Novak•The\n2003, Ontario Superior Court decision, Regina vs.Kinnear•The\n2010, Ontario Court of Appeal decision, Regina vs. JenkinsThe Constitutional\nIssue4.The Applicant submits\nthe endorsement “Jenkins Caution given “on the reverse side of\nthe subject Information, impairs his ability to receive an impartial trial. He\nargues that the presence of the endorsement effectively puts trier of fact\non notice of the likelihood that the Applicant has a record of previous\nconvictions for the offence of driving while under suspension, prior to the\ncommencement of the trial proceedings. He goes on to submit that viewing of the\nJenkins Caution endorsement by the trier of fact during the course of\nthe trial proceedings, would serve to bring the administration of justice into\ndisrepute.Furthermore,\nthe Applicant submits that since an amendment to the Information as the subject\nendorsement may not be made without his consent, the Information must be\ndeclared a nullity. He suggests that the existing prejudice in these\ncircumstances cannot be remedied by any means other than a stay of proceedings.The\nGrounds for the Application5.In\nthe Court’s analysis of this constitutional question, it carefully considered the\naccepted chronology of events pertaining to the subject case. That chronology\nis summarized as follows;On\nOctober 12th, 2012 at 2:58pm, the Applicant was charged and arrested\nby members of the Ontario Provincial Police with the offence of Driving while under\nSuspension, pursuant to Section 53 (1) of the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario.\nThe Applicant was released from custody and served with a Form 104 Summons,\ncharging him with Driving While Suspended, requesting him to attend Court on\nNovember 13th, 2012 at 1:30pm, courtroom 2 at 2051 Plains Road East\nBurlington, to answer to the said charge.The\nApplicant retained the services of Mary Plant, para-legal licensee who attended\ncourt on November 13th, 2012 on behalf of the Applicant. She received\ndisclosure from the provincial prosecutor, Mr. C. Gelbard at that time.During\nthis appearance, the prosecutor stated for the purposes of the record, that the\nApplicant met the test for a “Jenkins” caution, making reference to the 2010, decision\nof the Ontario Court of Appeal, Regina vs. Jenkins.The words “Jenkins Caution\ngiven “were written on the reverse side of the charging information by the\npresiding justice of the peace.A trial date in this matter was set for March\n13th, 2013 at that time.On\nFebruary 12, 2013 at 9:00 a.m., the Applicant applied to adjourn the date of\nthe subject trial.The said application was granted and the subject trial\nproceeding was rescheduled for June 26th, 2013 at 1:30 p.m.On that\ndate, the Applicant’s current representative, Mr. G. Lewin attended on behalf\nof the Applicant and sought a further adjournment of the trial proceeding in\norder to prepare, serve and file the Charter application therein.The\nApplicant’s Submissions6.The Applicant began\nhis submissions by advising the Court of the history of appearances with the\nCourt, as a result of a Driving Suspended Offence, charge on October 12th,\n2012, contrary to Section 53(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. The Applicant,presented\nnumerous submissions and relevant case law in support of his assertion that the\nendorsement, “Jenkins Caution given” on the reverse side of the charging\nInformation of Glenn St. John, on November 13, 2012,was an infringement of his\nCharter rights, pursuant to sections 7 \u0026 11(d). He argued that he was\naccordingly prejudiced from receiving an impartial trial on the basis that in\nsuch circumstances the trier of fact would be aware that he had a\nprevious conviction for Driving While Suspended.7.This Court\nsummarized the submissions of the Applicant as being two fold; (1) the 2010\nOntario Court of Appeal decision, R. vs. Jenkins, enunciated guidelines to\nminimize any potential miscarriages of justice occasioned by trial proceedings,\nespecially in exparte circumstances.In the case at bar, the defendant, Glenn\nSt. John, was not an ex-parte situation as he was present, in and through his\npara-legal, Mary Plant on November 13, 2012, when the prosecution advised the\nCourt of the Jenkins Caution, which was subsequently endorsed by the\npresiding Justice of the Peace. In an ex-parte setting, the Applicant asserts\nthat the prosecution’s verbal acknowledgement of the Jenkins Caution would\nhave fulfilled the obligations as set forth by the appellate court, that is, the\nprosecution must advise the Court of its intention for a custodial sentence ifthe\nApplicantis convicted of the subject charge .The Applicant further argues\nthat the subsequent endorsement of the Jenkins Caution by the Justice of\nthe Peace, red flags the trier of fact as to the existence of a\nprevious conviction of the defendant and the Court could take judicial\nnotice that when the Jenkins Caution is raised by the\nprosecutor, it immediately communicates to the Court, that a previous\nconviction exists. Thus, the Applicant’s first argument in support of their\napplication is as follows; the Jenkins Caution is only applicable to ex-parte\ncircumstances and considering that Glenn St. John, was not an exparte setting,the Applicant asserts that the submission of a screening form by the prosecutor\nto the defendant, would have been more appropriate in his situation.8.Secondly,\nthe Applicant invited the Court to turn its mind to\nthe issue of a remedy, if the Court were to find that the Applicant’s section 7\nand 11(d) charter rights had been infringed.In particular, the Court was\npresented with two pertinent court decisions which addressed the issue of\nsevering offending charges in a multiple count Information.The Court was\ninvited to carefully review, the 1993 Ontario Court of Justice decision, R.\nvs. Walcot and the 2003, Ontario Court of Appeal decision, R. vs.\nKinnear.Both decisions supported the argument that certain offences under\nthe criminal code of Canada, imply the presence of a previous conviction and in\nmultiple count information, a simple remedy of severance can address the\nconcerns that Section 789 (2) of the Code raises. In the case at bar, Glenn St.\nJohn’s Information is a single count information of Driving Suspended, contrary\nto Section 53 (1) of the Highway Traffic Act,thus it cannot be severed.\nBecause, the applicant’s charging information is a single count information and\nseverance is not a remedy, the Court, if satisfied that Glenn St. John’s,\nsection 7, \u0026 11 (d) charter rights were infringed, the Court was invited by\nthe Applicant to stay the proceedings.The\nRespondent’s Submissions9.The Respondent substantially agreed with\nthe facts set out in paragraphs 1-13 of the Applicant’s Notice of Application\nand Constitutional Question and addressed the Applicant’s issues surrounding\nthe assertion that his right to a fair trial (as per Section 11 (d) of the\nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms) was compromised when the learned\nJustice of the Peace endorsed the reverse side of his Information with a\nJenkins Caution. The Respondent relied upon the 2010 Ontario Court of Appeal\ndecision of R. v. Jenkins, Section 54(1) of the Provincial Offences Act, the\n1993, Ontario Court of Justice decision R. vs. Walcot and the 1995, British\nColumbia Court of Appeal decision, R. vs. Novak for its responses.The respondent’s\nresponses could be best summarized in the following four arguments;a)\nThe decision of R. v. Jenkins\nprovided guidelines to prosecutors when addressing matters where a defendant\nfailed to appear at court for their hearing, especially when the intention of\nthe prosecution was to seek a custodial sentence upon conviction. It is the\nassertion of the Respondent at paragraph 4 of their Response to the Applicant’s\nNotice of Constitutional Question that;……Jenkins does not stand\nfor the proposition that only when previous convictions exist would a\nprosecutor be seeking a custodial sentence, and only when previous convictions\nexist would a prosecutor raise the issue of a potential custodial sentence to\nthe Presiding Justice of the Peace.The\nRespondent further asserts that custodial sentences are available upon first\nconvictions on a handful of Highway Traffic Act Offences, other than Driving\nSuspended, pursuant to Section 53(1) of the HTA. Other examples, which can\nwarrant a custodial sentence on first time convictions include; Violations\nas to Number Plates, Section 12(1); Careless Driving, Section 130 HTA and Stunt\nDriving, Section 172 (1) of the HTA.Thus, the Respondent submitted to the\nCourt that the decision of Jenkins and its guidelines for the prosecution to\nadvise the Court, when a custodial sentence is being sought upon conviction,\nit’s not synonymous with previous convictions.b)\nThe Respondent also asserts that although the Applicant was present in Court,\nthrough his legal representative and his matter was not proceeding in his\nabsence as was the case in the Jenkins decision, the application of the\nguidelines enunciated in the said decision, that is, the prosecution’s\ndirection to advise the Court of the Jenkins Caution was a good faith and\npro-active measure.At paragraph 8 of the Respondent’s Response to the\nApplicant’s Notice of Application and Constitutional Question, the Respondent\nsummarizes their reason for the application of the Jenkins Caution, while the\ndefendant was present in the case of Glenn St. John;….it was a\nwell-intentioned attempt by the Prosecutor to ensure the risk of a potential\nmiscarriage of justice was minimized if the defendant did fail to appear at\ntrial, and the matter was to proceed in his absence at some point in the futurec) Further, the Respondent in response to the Applicant’s argument\nthat the Jenkins Caution endorsement on the reverse side of the Information,\nprejudices their case andcannot be remedied by any means, but only a Stay in\nproceedings, the Court was directed to paragraphs 19, \u0026 36-39, of the 1995\nOntario Court of Justice decision of Regina vs. Walcot.In R. vs. Walcot,\nthe Court was invited to quash or stay the information as a similar argument\nwas raised by the defendant as to the validity of the information. In Walcot,\nthe defendant, Jason Walcot, made an application to\nquash the information on the ground that it was void as it violated Section 664\nof the Criminal Code. The applicant was charged with failing to stop at the\nscene of accident, impaired driving, driving while alcohol blood content was\nover .08 and with driving while disqualified. The applicant submitted that the\ncharge of driving while disqualified necessarily implied a previous conviction\nleading to the disqualification and that the reference violated section 664 of\nthe Code in that it could result in increased punishment to him. The\napplication made by Andy Walcot was eventually dismissed by the appellate court, on the basis of its interpretation of Section 664\nof the Criminal Code of Canada, it concluded that;Section 664 required that a reference\nbe made to a previous conviction by virtue of which a higher punishment may be\nimposed on the accused if convicted of any of the offences listed on the\ninformation. While the count four referred to disqualification and therefore\nindirectly to a previous conviction, there was no reference to an increased\npenalty. It was not apparent on the face of the information that a higher\npenalty might be imposed as a result of a previous conviction.d)\nFinally, the Respondent invited the Court, in its analysis of the Applicant’s\nNotice of Constitutional Question, to turn its mind to the 1995, British\nColumbia Court of Appeal decision of Regina vs. Novak, in particular,\nparagraph 8, which addresses the duty of trial judges to disabuse their minds\nof any prejudicial information which might arise during the proceedings and\ntheir responsibility to determine their findings on the admissible evidence\nplaced before them;Judges are routinely called upon to disabuse their minds of evidence\nwhich they have heard but which as a matter of law, is not admissible in the\ntrial before them. It is fundamental to their role to decide the case only on\nthe evidence properly admissible in that case…..The\nAnalysis of the Application10.In any charter application, it is the\ndefendant’s onus to establish on a balance of probabilities that their rights have\nbeen breached.In a section 11 (d) and 7 charter application, the defendant\nmust establish to the Court that their rights to a fair and impartial trial\nwould be infringed. Reaching a decision and applying the correct case law that\nsupports both sides of the issue fairly is a difficult task. The paramount\nguideline in assessing each charter motion is that each case must be tried on\nits merits. Thus, the purpose of sections 7, 11 (d) \u0026 24 (1) applications\nexists to protect the defendant’s right to a fair and impartial trial versus\navoiding a trial on its merits.In other words, Charter rights should be\nviewed as a shield and not as a sword.11.Although,\nthe Applicant asserts that the Jenkins Caution was not applicable to his\ncase, since he was represented by counsel on the date of November 13, 2012,\nwhen the caution was submitted to the Court. The Applicant submitted that the\nsubsequent endorsement of such a caution on the reverse side of the charging\nInformation breached his charter rights, contrary to sections 7 \u0026 11(d). The\nCourt’s response to this constitutional question will be two-fold in its\nassessment. Firstly, the Court must determine as to the constitutionality of\nsuch an endorsement in an ex-parte setting and secondly, if this Court\ndetermines that the Applicant’s circumstance did not warrant a Jenkins caution,\ndid such an endorsement breach their charter rights?12.The Court begins its analysis, by turning its mind to the 2010 Ontario\nCourt of Appeal decision, Regina vs. Jenkins. Here the appellate court outlines\nin paragraph 3, the three crucial questions surrounding the Jenkins case;Does s.\n54(1)(a) of the Provincial Offences Act, which permits ex parte\ntrials even in circumstances where there is a possibility of incarceration,\nviolate s. 7 or s. 11(d) of the Charter?Did the appeal judge err in law in dismissing the\nappellant's appeal from conviction either by requiring him to demonstrate a\ndefence on the merits or by failing to give him a fair opportunity to present\nhis case?Did the appeal judge err in failing to consider\nthe appellant's sentence appeal and, if so, was the fine imposed harsh and\nexcessive in the circumstances?13.In\naddressing the first of the three questions posed in R. vs. Jenkins,\nwith respect to the constitutionality of exparte trials, as per section\n54 of the Provincial Offences Act, which is applicable to the Glenn St. John\nanalysis, the appellate Court concluded at paragraph 31 that;31In upholding the constitutionality of ex\nparte trials under the Act, I do not suggest that they are or should become\nthe norm.4 Clearly, there is a risk of a\nmiscarriage of justice inherent in an ex parte proceeding that does not\nexist where the defendant is present. This risk exists despite the significant\nlegislative and administrative safeguards in place to facilitate a defendant's\nappearance at trial personally, by counsel or through an agent. For example, a\ndefendant can, with a simple phone call to the location identified in the\nsummons, find out when his or her trial is scheduled even if the defendant has\nmissed the return date on the summons. In addition, some, but not all,\nmiscarriages occasioned by ex parte proceedings can be rectified on\nappeal. To acknowledge that an ex parte proceeding can result in a\nmiscarriage of justice does not, however, advance the constitutional analysis.\nA procedure need not be foolproof to be constitutional.14.Further, at paragraphs 32 and 33, the appellate court in Jenkins stressed the roles and guidelines to be\nembraced by prosecutors and judges in minimizing the potential for miscarriages\nof justice in exparte proceedings, especially when incarceration is\nsought by prosecution upon conviction;32Prosecutors\nand judges have a role to play in minimizing the risk of miscarriages of\njustice through ex parte proceedings. An ex parte trial is not\nautomatic when a defendant fails to appear in answer to a charge under Part III\nof the Act. The prosecutor must request an ex parte trial and the trial\njudge has the discretion to proceed ex parte or to take other steps,\nusually the issuance of a warrant, to compel the attendance of the defendant.33The\ncourt was told in oral argument that there are no formal guidelines in place to\nassist prosecutors in deciding when to request an ex parte trial. In\nevery case where the prosecutor will seek a custodial sentence upon conviction,\nthe prosecutor would be well-advised to consider whether an ex parte\nproceeding is appropriate. The longer the period of imprisonment sought, the\nless inclined the prosecutor should be to request an ex parte trial. If\nthe prosecutor ultimately decides that it would be proper to proceed ex\nparte, he or she should advise the trial judge, before the trial begins, of\ntheir intention to seek a custodial sentence and the range of sentence that\nthey anticipate will be appropriate. The trial judge can use this information\nto decide whether to proceed with the trial or take other action, such as\nadjourn the hearing and issue a warrant for the defendant's arrest.15.At\nparagraph 35, the appellate court in R. v. Jenkins, summarizes its\nanalysis of the constitutionality of s. 54(1) of the Provincial Offences Act;35I would\nuphold the constitutionality of s. 54(1) (a) of the Act. The court has\njurisdiction to proceed with an ex parte trial when the conditions\nprecedent under the statute are met. Whether the court should do so, will\ndepend on the circumstances.The exercise of that discretion in a specific\ncase is reviewable on appeal.Besides re-iterating the constitutionality of exparte trials, the appellate court in Jenkins cautions both prosecutors and trial judges to be\ncareful to minimize the risk of miscarriages of justice through ex-parte\nproceedings, which are not always automatic.In the absence of the defendant\nand before proceeding with an exparte trial, the appellate court stressed the duty of the prosecution to carefully present submissions\nto the trier of fact, which can include the prosecution’s intent for a period\nof a custodial sentence upon conviction. This intention of the prosecution assists\nthe court in its determination on whether to proceed with an exparte hearing or\nthe issuing of a bench summons or bench warrant.Thus, the decision of R. v. Jenkins\npredicates and dictates to the presiding jurist how he/she will proceed with\nrespect to an exparte hearing.16.Overall,\nit is this Court’s opinion that the decision of R. v. Jenkins attempted\nto alleviate any miscarriages of justice when faced with absent defendants\nat exparte trials, especially when the prosecution was seeking a custodial\nsentence upon conviction.In the case at bar, the defendant, Glenn St. John was\npresent through his para-legal, Mary Plant on November 13, 2012, when the\nProsecutor, Claude Gelbard made submissions with respect to a Jenkins Caution,\nwhich was eventually endorsed on the reverse side of the Information by the\npresiding Justice of the Peace.The endorsement of the information as to a Jenkins\nCaution, has a twofold purpose; (1) it is a means of keeping record of the\nprosecution’s obligation to the Court when seeking a custodial sentence, as\ndirected in R. v. Jenkins, at par. 33;If the prosecutor ultimately\ndecides that it would be proper to proceed ex parte, he or she should\nadvise the trial judge, before the trial begins, of their intention to seek a\ncustodial sentence and the range of sentence that they anticipate will be\nappropriate.And(2) such an endorsement would be valuable information for the\ntrial judge when determining whether to proceed with the exparte trial or take\nalternative action as set forth in par. 33;The trial judge can use this\ninformation to decide whether to proceed with the trial or take other action,\nsuch as adjourn the hearing and issue a warrant for the defendant's arrest.17.Overall,\nthis court finds that such an endorsement is a pro-active and good faith\nmeasure on behalf of the prosecutor, whose intention is to alleviate any\nmiscarriages of justice.When in the absence of transcripts, the\nendorsement serves as a record for defendants, prosecutors and jurists that the\nobligations enunciated in Jenkins have been met.Since the decision of R.\nvs. Jenkins, it is this Court’s opinion that such an administrative\npractise of endorsing the Jenkins Caution on the reverse side of the\nInformation originated and evolved, as a result of the prosecution’s\ninterpretation and understanding of the guidelines of the appellate\ncourt in Jenkins, which directs prosecutors to advise the court if\nan exparte trial is appropriate as set out in paragraph 33;If the prosecutor ultimately decides\nthat it would be proper to proceed exparte, he or she should advise the trial\njudge, before the trial begins, of their intention to seek a custodial sentence\nand the range of sentence that they anticipate will be appropriate.18.It\nis this endorsement of Jenkins Caution that the Applicant asserts, prejudices\nhis case, by alerting the trier of fact, to the reality of previous convictions.\nThus, the Applicant argues that such an endorsement of the Jenkins Caution\nis synonymous with previous convictions and therefore prejudices his case, thus\nbreaching his constitutional rights under section 7 and 11 (d) of the Canadian\nCharter of Rights and Freedoms. The Applicant further asserts, that such an\nendorsement disrespects Section 789(2) of the Criminal Code of Canada which\nstates;No information in respect of an offence for which, by reason of\nprevious convictions, a great punishment may be imposed shall contain any\nreference to previous convictions.Thus, in the mind of the Applicant, such an endorsement is\nprejudicial and warrants the Information be declared a nullity and a Stay of\nProceedings be entered by the Court.19.After careful review of the appellate court’s decision\nin R. v. Jenkins, this Court finds that the assertion made by the\nApplicant that the endorsement of the Jenkins Caution is synonymous with\nprevious convictions, is not founded in the said decision. This Court\nfound no mention or discussion of previous convictions in the appellate’s decision when proceeding with an exparte trial. It is this\nCourt’s opinion that the guidelines of Jenkins directsprosecutors and\njurists at paragraphs 32 \u0026 33 “to minimize the risk of\nmiscarriages of justice “and its direction is not limited in its\napplication to defendant’s where previous convictions exists or when previous\nconvictions do exist that the prosecution’s intent for custodial sentence is\nimplied.Thus, this Court would conclude that the decision of Jenkins is not\nsynonymous with previous convictions and thus the nexus cannot be established\nto the court at trial, that previous convictions are implied with the Jenkins\nCaution and the subsequent administrative practise of endorsing the reverse\nside of the Information.20.Although,\nthe appellate court in R. v. Jenkins was not presented with any oral arguments with respect to formal\nguidelines which would assist prosecutors in deciding when to request an\nex-parte trial, the appellant Court does compel prosecutors at paragraph 33;\nthat when intending to seek a custodial sentence upon conviction to consider\nwhether an exparte trial is appropriate. This Court would acknowledge that the\nproposed actions on behalf of prosecution to proceed or not proceed with an\nexparte trial, is predicated upon on a number of factors placed before the trier\nof fact, one possibility, could be the intention of the prosecution to seek a\ncustodial sentence and what length of sentence would be appropriate.21.It\nis this Court’s opinion, since the 2010 Ontario Court of Appeal decision of R.\nv. Jenkins, the application of the principles enunciated in Jenkins and the\npractise of the endorsement of the Jenkins Caution on the reverse side\nof the Information has come to be misinterpreted as caution for a custodial\nsentence, due to previous convictions.It is this Court’s opinion that such a misunderstood\nevolution of thought associating a Jenkins Caution with previous\nconvictions is the crux of the Applicant’s argument with regards to their alleged\nbreach of their rights pursuant to sections 7 and 11(d) of the Canadian Charter\nof Rights and Freedoms. After carefully reviewing the decision of Jenkins and\nthe circumstances surrounding the appellate decision, it is this Court’s\nopinion that such an endorsement of the Jenkins Caution, falls under the\ndefinition of information, that the appellate Court in Jenkins, directs the trial judge can use and review in\nits analysis of whether or not to proceed with an exparte trial;33. The trial judge can use\nthis information to decide whether to proceed with the trial or take other action,\nsuch as adjourn the hearing and issue a warrant for the defendant's arrest.22.Further,\nthis Court in its analysis of the Applicant’s constitutional question\nacknowledges that a custodial sentence sought by the prosecution is not solely\ndependent on a defendant’s previous convictions or lack therof. The Court\nrecognizes that there are a number of aggravating factors, other than previous\nconvictions, that can be considered by the prosecution when seeking a custodial\nsentence and thus a subsequent Jenkins Caution. And considering that\nthere are offences under the Highway Traffic Act, that can potentially result\nin a custodial sentence, upon a first conviction, it is my opinion, that the\ndirection and guidelines of the appellate court in R. v. Jenkins were intended\nto minimize any miscarriages of justice, embracing all circumstances of\ndefendants. In other words, the principles directed to both prosecutor and\njurist on when to commence with an exparte trial are equally related to all\ndefendant’s circumstances and not simply limited in its application to previous\noffenders.23.Recognizing that the appellate court in R. vs. Jenkins primarily\naddressed ex-parte trials and bearing in mind the case of the Glenn St. John was\nnot an exparte situation, the Court, in its analysis, must answer two\nquestions; (1) In the case of Glenn St John, was the Jenkins caution and the\nsubsequent endorsement on the charging Information proper? And (2) if not, did\nsuch an endorsement infringe Glenn St. John’s charter rights, by creating a\nprejudice in the trier of fact’s mind as to the existence of a previous\nconviction? After carefully examining the totality of the evidence in this\ncase, the relevant case law and the submissions from the Applicant and\nRespondent, I am of the opinion, that the prosecution’s\nverbal caution and the justice of the peace’s endorsement of the caution on the\nreverse side of the charging information in the case at bar, was not\nprejudicial to Glenn St. John.The Court is also of the mind that even if Glenn\nSt. John’s case was an exparte matter; such an endorsement would not have\ninfringed his constitutional rights, contrary to sections 7 \u0026 11 (d) of the\nCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.24.On\nthe contrary, this Court found that such an endorsement was an administrative\npro-active practice, documenting the prosecution’s obligations, as set forth in\nR v. Jenkins. Thus, confirming to the Court that prosecution’s intention\nfor a custodial sentence would be sought upon conviction.The pro-active\nnature of such an endorsement is further substantiated when contemplating the\npossibility that if Glenn St. John, were to fail to appear at trial at some\npoint in the future, the recorded endorsement, would serve as a reminder to the\nCourt, that the prosecution’s obligation as per Jenkins was met and the Court can\nproceed accordingly, thus potentially minimizing any miscarriages of justice. Although,\nthe Jenkins Caution is specifically applicable to ex-parte situations\nand that a screening form might have been more appropriate in the circumstance,\nI was not compelled by the Applicant’s arguments that the Jenkins Caution and\nthe endorsement on the reverse side of his charging Information, infringed his\ncharter rights, contrary to sections 7 \u0026 11(d).25.This Court found that the Applicant’s argument that such an endorsement elicits\nthe existence of previous convictions to the trier of fact was not established\nand such an argument the Court found speculative in nature, thus failing to\nsubstantiate a finding of a constitutional breach.The Court also found that Applicant’s\nargument with respect to the requirement of the defendant’s consent when\nendorsing the charging Information for validity, lacked any statutory basis or\ncase law to substantiate such an assertion.Therefore, it is this Court’s\nfinding, that on a balance of probabilities, the applicant, Glenn St. John, did\nnot establish to this honorable court that his constitutional rights contrary\nto sections 7 and 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, were breached\nand thus the request for a stay of proceedings, pursuant to Section 24 of the\ncharter is not justified. The application is dismissed and Glenn St. John’s\nmatter will proceed and tried on its merits.__________________________His\nWorship, Justice of The Peace Mark J. Curtis,January\n29th, 2014, B2 @ 9:00am, Burlington, Ontario."}

Dismissed.Counsel:H. E. Sampson, K.C., for the Crown.No one appearing for prisoner, appellant.[1]Mackenzie J.A.:—This\nis an appeal from sentence. The prisoner did not appear on his appeal but by\nhis notice of appeal claimed that he had been too severely sentenced.[2]Mr. Sampson, K.C., appeared for the Crown and made a statement of\nthe facts to the Court. From such statement as well as from a perusal of the\nrecord of the proceedings before the Police Magistrate it appears that the\nprisoner was charged before Mr. Fred M. Brown, the Police Magistrate at\nSaskatoon on November 21, 1941, with commission of the following three\noffences: (1) perjury; by making on or about October 31, 1941, a false\ndeclaration under the Marriage Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 231, contrary to ss.\n172 and 174 of the Criminal Code. The maximum penalty for this offence\nis 14 years' imprisonment. (2) Forgery; by making a false document, to wit, a\nbank cheque on November 17, 1941, at Saskatoon for the sum of $350, contrary to\nss. 466 and 468 of the Criminal Code. The maximum penalty for this\noffence is imprisonment for life. (3) Attempt to commit false pretences on\nNovember 17, 1941, at Saskatoon, contrary to ss. 405 and 571 of the Criminal\nCode. The maximum penalty for this offence is one and a half years'\nimprisonment.[3]The prisoner pleaded guilty to each of the foregoing charges and\nwas on November 26, 1941, sentenced by the said Magistrate to one year's\nimprisonment on each charge. All such sentences were made to take effect\nconcurrently. These are the sentences from which the prisoner now appeals.[4]Upon being asked if the prisoner had been previously convicted,\nMr. Sampson reported that he had been convicted several times for vagrancy in\nvarious parts of Canada and once for theft. He however mentioned no instance in\nwhich he had been previously convicted of any offence at all as serious as two\nof those now before the Court in this appeal.[5]Having regard to the gravity of the charges referred to and the\ncircumstances under which they appear to have been committed, as well as to the\nprisoner's previous record, which indicates an indisposition on his part to\nlead a law-abiding life, we find that the sentences in question are not too\nsevere. His appeal is therefore dismissed. The sentences shall run from the\ndate of his conviction.[6]Appeal dismissed.Alberta Supreme CourtCitation: Fiell\nv. SobuliakDate: 1942-02-06Counsel:A. L. Marks, for plaintiff.W. Morrow, for defendant.[1]This was an\napplication by originating notice to recover possession of a house, its\ncontents, and a garage. The plaintiff alleged that she had purchased the lumber\nfor the house out of her own moneys during the time she was employed as a\nhousekeeper by W. Sobuliak deceased. The house had been erected on a lot which\nSobuliak held under a lease from his employers, a mining company, and defendant\nin this action was his widow. Counsel for defendant contended that there was no\njurisdiction under Rules 432 and 433 (Alta.) to hear this application. His\nLordship said that while R. 433 was formerly limited to the determination of\nquestions affecting rights under trusts arising from construction of a document\nand that it had been held that similar rules did not apply to resulting trusts,\nRule 433 had now been amended to include trusts arising by implication of law.\nHis Lordship was of opinion that in any event there was jurisdiction under R.\n432, \"to recover possession of land.\" As to the contention that the\nhouse and garage were movable and therefore chattels, His Lordship said that\nthe contents were chattels, but the buildings were erected under a tenancy and\nwere in his opinion land. The present R. 432 was much wider than the former R.\n469 under which Porter v. Rooney (1908), 8 W.L.R. 289, was\ndecided.[2]His Lordship then referred to s. 12 of the Alberta Evidence\nAct, R.S.A. 1922, c. 87, which requires corroboration of a claim against a\ndeceased person. His Lordship referred to the judgments of Harvey J. (as he\nthen was) in Bakewell v. Mackenzie (1905), 6 Terr. L.R. 257 at p.\n259, and of Sir James Hannen in Re Hodgson, Beckett v. Ramsdale (1885),\n31 Ch. D. 177, which indicated that even if this action was not covered by the\nstatute corroboration of the claim was necessary, at least if the\nuncorroborated story of the claimant did not bring complete conviction. His\nLordship then said that he was not satisfied that the plaintiff was the owner\nof the house and garage or that the late W. Sobuliak held it subject to a\nresulting trust for her. The latter had the right to occupy the lot, he did the\ncarpenter work, the lumber for an addition to the house was furnished on his\ncredit and he gave a chattel mortgage and note in payment.Manitoba Court of AppealCitation: Boskawich\nv.

No.346068Registry: HalifaxBetween:Her Majesty the Queenv.Bruce Elliott ClarkeDefendantSentencing DecisionJudge:The Honourable Justice JamieCampbellHeard:April 4,5,6 and 7, 2016 inHalifax, Nova ScotiaWrittenDecision:April 15, 2016Counsel:Mark Covan, James Martin andScott Millar for Her Majesty The QueenBarry Whynot and Josh Nodelmanfor the DefendantCampbell,\nJ. (orally)[1]On Monday of this week (April 11) I received\nwritten notice of the joint recommendation of counsel as to the appropriate\nsentenced to be imposed on Mr. Clarke. I have had an opportunity over the\ncourse of the week to review and consider it along with the materials filed\nsome time ago in the sentencing hearing itself.It’s important for the public\nrecord to say how that recommendation is to be considered. It’s not simply a\nmatter of rubberstamping.[2]The recommendation here is for a period of\nincarceration of three years.[3]It must be said at the outset that there are a\nlot of good people in jail. Sadly some, if indeed not most, are there because\nof mental health and addiction issues that propelled them toward the occasion\nof crime. Others are there because they acted impulsively. Others made one bad\njudgement call that had catastrophic consequences. It is somehow reassuring to\nthink that jails are where society separates the bad and the dangerous from the\nrest of us. Like a lot of reassuring thoughts it’s simplistic and it’s wrong.[4]Bruce Clarke is neither bad nor dangerous.Sending him to jail will not protect the public from anything.It won’t repair\nthe damage that’s been done. It won’t teach a financially ruined 71 year old\nman any lesson he hasn’t already learned.It’s unlikely that any sharks will\nthink twice about a high return corporate scam even on the off chance that the\nname Bruce Clarke seems oddly familiar to them. But still, justice sometimes\ndemands retribution.Joint Recommendations[5]Joint recommendations are an integral part of\nthe criminal justice process. The system simply could not function without\nthem.[6]Plea bargaining involves entering a guilty plea\nin return for an agreement from the prosecution to withdraw some charges or to\nrecommend a particular sentence to the court. Counsel sometimes recognize that\nthe Crown may have practical difficulties in securing a conviction. That may be\nbecause an important witness has recanted. It may be because a complainant is\nvery anxious about testifying given that it will involve disclosing very\npersonal information or involves travelling across the country. It may be\nbecause the admissibility of key pieces of evidence rests on the uncertain\noutcome of a Charter application. Rather the facing the risks of the trial\nprocess or exposing a witness to the stresses of the adversarial process, the\nprosecution may agree to recommend a lighter sentence in return for a guilty\nplea. From the perspective of the accused person, the prospect of the lighter\nsentence avoids the risk of being found guilty and receiving a harsher\nsentence.[7]The vast majority of criminal matters are\nresolved without going to trial. That’s to some extent because the plea\nbargaining system permits both the prosecution and defence to avoid the\nuncertainty of the trial and sentencing process. The efficacy of that system\nrelies on the ability to opt out of uncertainty. If a joint recommendation as\nto sentence had only the persuasive power of a helpful suggestion there would\nbe little benefit to be gained.[8]While joint recommendations are not binding on\njudges there is a recognition of the importance of providing some relief from\nthe uncertainty otherwise inherent in a highly individualized sentencing\nprocess. The system does not replace uncertainty with certainty. What it does\noffer is a high degree of predictability. When presented with a joint\nrecommendation the court should give it very serious consideration. That\ninvolves more than deciding whether the sentence is one that the judge would\nhave imposed without the joint recommendation. R. v. MacIvor 2003 NSCA\n60 (CanLII).[9]The judge has to assess whether the jointly\nsubmitted sentence is within an acceptable range. If it is, there have to be\nsound reasons for departing from it. Even when the sentence falls outside the\nacceptable range of sentences a judge ought to give it serious consideration.There are reasons for that. There are things that counsel know that may not be\ndisclosed to the judge at the time of sentencing. There may be weaknesses in\nthe case or legitimate reasons for not wanting to proceed to a trial and those\ncircumstances may not be appropriate to be disclosed in court.[10]While joint recommendations are generally\naccepted the judge remains the guardian of the public interest. The judge\nshould not accept a joint recommendation if it is unreasonable, is contrary to\nthe public interest or would bring the administration of justice into dispute.\nThat is most certainly not the same thing as a sentence with which the public\nmay disagree. The judge’s reference point is always the law and not public\nopinion. Before “jumping” a particularly light sentence judges not only have to\nconsider what they know about the case, but also have to bear in mind what they\ndon’t know and perhaps can’t know about the case. They also have to consider\nthe implications for the system of reducing the high level of predictability on\nwhich it depends.[11]In this case, there has been no plea bargain in\nthe strict sense. Mr. Clarke pleaded guilty before any joint recommendation on\nsentence was agreed upon. Counsel have agreed on an appropriate sentence,\nseparate from any compromises as to the facts to be presented.[12]The joint recommendation of counsel should still\nbe given real consideration.The Charges[13]Mr. Clarke has pleaded guilty to two counts in\nan indictment relating to the time period from January 1, 2000 to September 13,\n2001. The first count alleged that he unlawfully conspired with Blois Colpitts,\nDan Potter and others, through fraudulent means to affect the public price of\nshares in Knowledge House Incorporated. That is conspiracy under s. 465(1) (c)\nto commit an offence contrary to s. 380 (2) of the Criminal Code. The second\ncount to which the guilty plea was entered alleged that Mr. Clarke defrauded\nthe Benefits Trust Fund of two locals of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters\nand Joiners of America of an amount exceeding $5000. That is an offence contrary\nto s. 380 (1) (a) of the Criminal Code.Brief Summary of the\nFraud[14]It seems that anything that relates in any way\nto Knowledge House Incorporated is tremendously complicated. Statements about\nit involve caveats, limitations and boxes of supporting documents. Almost any\nsummary prepared by anyone will be seen by others as suspiciously incomplete or\nnaively inaccurate or just failing to appreciate the vitally important nuances.\nThe entire story of Knowledge House Incorporated is yet to be written. This\nmatter involves only Bruce Clarke’s part in the greater scheme of things. What\nfollows is not intended to be a recitation of each of the relevant facts put\nforward in the sentencing. It is also a summary only of his actions as they\nrelate to the offences to which he has pleaded guilty. Because one of the\nguilty pleas is to a conspiracy any summary necessarily involves references to\nco-conspirators and their alleged actions. Mr. Clarke’s pleas establish the\nfacts supporting his guilt and only his guilt.[15]Knowledge House itself goes back to 1984. In\n1988 it was being publically traded on the Montreal Exchange. In December 1999\nit began trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In the late 1990’s the company\ngrew by acquiring other established companies. Those companies had a number of\ngovernment contracts to bring computer systems into Nova Scotia schools. Those\ncontracts created a positive cash flow for Knowledge House through 2000 and\ninto 2001.[16]On March 10, 2000 the tech stock crash or\ndot-com collapse happened. That resulted in an overall decline in the price of\ntechnology stocks. Knowledge House stocks were under pressure from the market.\nThat was at a time when it seemed the company might actually be agood news\nentrepreneurial story in Nova Scotia.[17]Mr. Clarke’s fraudulent activities took place\nbetween March 2000 and the eventual and total collapse of Knowledge House in September\n2001. During that period, Mr. Clarke was involved in the conspiracy to maintain\nthe stock price. It’s important to recognize that this did not involve gross\ninflation of the price with a view to cashing out and leaving the investors\nwith a worthless shell. The purpose was to keep the company afloat when market\nforces would otherwise have caused its collapse. That was in the hope that\nKnowledge House would eventually rise with the tide of better times and a\nbetter market.[18]The conspiracy as admitted by Mr. Clarke,\ninvolved Dan Potter, the CEO of Knowledge House, Blois Colpitts the corporate\nlegal counsel and 10 other unindicted co-conspirators who were part of the\nagreement to manipulate the stock price. Those people included investment\nadvisors and Knowledge House insiders. They agreed to purchase large amounts\nKnowledge House stock in the market place with the stated intention of\nsupporting the value of the stock. They did that in an organized and\ncoordinated way. The market was overwhelmed by the purchase of a very\nsignificant portion of the stock made available. The price of Knowledge House\nshares was not a reflection of market forces but a reflection of manipulation\nthrough, among other things, concentrated purchasing.[19]Mr. Clarke’s involvement was to administer the\naccounts that were used to make the purchases. Much of the purchasing was done\nthrough an account associated with his own numbered Nova Scotia company. When\nthat account could no longer sustain the level of purchases required others\nwere used. Much of the buying was done through margin accounts by which money\nwas borrowed based on the value of the shares purchased and offered as security\nfor the loan. Share value was critical to the calculation of the borrowing room\navailable on the margin account. If share values decreased the amount of money\nthat could be accessed to support the price of the shares would reduce.[20]Bruce Clarke was the point of contact for the\nmembers of the group and it was he who executed many of the trades and managed\nthe use of the margin accounts.[21]The buying of shares was strategically timed.\nWhen negotiations were underway with outside investors, the purchase of shares\nwas ramped up to drive the price higher. The group would buy the vast majority\nof shares at the right time. From January to May 2001 the group buying of\nKnowledge House stock by month was 75%, 73.6%, 63.3%, 58.2% and 74.7%. The group\nused 30 accounts and Bruce Clarke managed somewhat less than half of those.[22]In addition to buying stock the group also\nsuppressed stock sales. That was done by pressuring investors not to sell and\nby ignoring requests to sell. Mr. Clarke was involved in both. A number of\nnamed investors came to Mr. Clarke asking to sell their Knowledge House stocks.\nMr. Clarke would pressure them not to sell and attempt to convince them to sell\nother stocks instead. The company also delayed issuing or failed to issue shares\nto those who were entitled to receive them. Unissued stock can’t be sold in the\nmarket and therefore can’t depress the share price.[23]Mr. Clarke was also involved in the strategy\nknown as high closing. That involves going to the market in the last few\nminutes of the day and purchasing or offering to purchase stocks at increasing\nprices to give false the impression of better performance. The closing price is\nimportant because it is the closing price that is reported in the media and the\nfinal bid of the day is use to set the stock value for margin account purposes.[24]Mr. Clarke was instrumental in carrying out the\nhigh closes for Knowledge House stock. Mr. Clarke would allow orders to stack\nup through the day and would divide them up among himself, his son and another\nperson with instructions to place the orders within minutes of closing. This\ndeceptive strategy was used at times when the value of the stock was otherwise\nunder pressure.[25]During the period from March 200 to September\n2001 the value of Knowledge House shares was not set by market forces but by\nthe manipulation of the market using those strategies and others. Bruce Clarke\nwas a critical part of that market manipulation.[26]The second count relates to the fraud on Local\nUnion 83 and 1392, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America\nBenefits Trust Fund. That fund was established in 1971 to maintain a benefits\nprogram for members of the Union. Those benefits included health and welfare\nbenefits, income security and other forms of income protection. The money in\nthe fund was invested in order to increase the size of the fund and limit the\ncontributions required from members. It was not an investment fund. The\ninvestments made had to be both liquid and secure. Speculative or high risk\ninvestments were improper and imprudent for such a fund.[27]In 1981 the trustees of the fund retained J.D.\nMack to serve as an investment manager. Bruce Clarke was a part owner of the\nfirm. Bruce Clarke became the principle investment advisor in 1996, through the\nmerger with Levesque Securities and National Bank Financial. He kept that\nposition until his employment was terminated by National Bank Financial in\nOctober 2001.[28]Bruce Clarke attended annual meetings with the\nBoard of Trustees to present them with an overview of the fund’s performance.\nThe value of the portfolio grew steadily. Until November 1999, the securities\nheld by the fund were high quality, well known equity securities and the fund\nwas not heavily invested in any one of them.[29]Mr. Clarke had discretionary trading authority\nover the account. The trustees received monthly statements and a record of each\ntrade. The trustees did not monitor the day to day investment decisions and\ntrusted those decisions based on the fund’s yearly performance. The trustees\ntrusted that Bruce Clarke was making investment decisions in the best interest\nof the fund and not based on his own self-interest.[30]After 1999, Mr. Clarke embarked on a very\ndifferent trading strategy. The trustees were not consulted about that. At the\nSeptember 2000 annual meeting of the trustees of the fund, the written overview\nshowed 4500 Knowledge House shares. The trustees didn’t know about Knowledge\nHouse or the nature of its stock. They didn’t know that it was a speculative\ntech stock. They knew nothing about Mr. Clarke’s personal involvement in the\nmanipulation of its price. Instead of telling them about that, Mr. Clarke\nreported that the portfolio was diversified. After that presentation he went on\nto buy Knowledge House for the fund in 75 different transactions.[31]The union paid Mr. Clarke a commission for each\ntransaction. Many of the purchases were made when his own account that he had\nbeen using to buy Knowledge House stock in order to keep the price inflated was\nat its limit. Mr. Clark sold other investments in the fund to buy up Knowledge\nHouse stock. He was selling provincial bonds and blue chip equities to acquire\nKnowledge House stock.[32]The Carpenters’ Union trust fund lost $849,000.\nAn amount was recovered from National Bank Financial as part of a privileged\nsettlement agreement.[33]The overall amount of money involved is massive.\nKnowledge House went from having a capitalized value of $100 million to being\nessentially worthless.To begin with, 641 non-insider accounts bought\nKnowledge House stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange during the period when the\nprice was being artificially maintained. Millions of dollars were invested\ntrusting that market forces determined the price of the shares. During that\ntime, approximately $19 million was invested in Knowledge House shares.[34]Financial institutions that loaned money on the\nbasis of the share value put close to $12 million at risk. That amount was\nloaned secured by what eventually turned out to be worthless stock.[35]Given the nature of the fraud it is impossible\nto calculate the financial losses. How much money was lost in total is\ndifficult to even estimate. For purposes of sentencing the precise amount is\nnot the issue. The fraud clearly involved millions of dollars and had very\nsignificant implications for investors many of whom lost very substantial\namounts.[36]Obviously, the foregoing is not intended as a\ndetailed accounting of the fraud that took place in maintaining the price of\nKnowledge House stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It is at most a brief\nsummary intended to set out only some of the information relevant to the\nsentencing of Bruce Clarke and to provide a factual context for that sentence.Purposes, Objectives\nand Principles of Sentencing[37]The purposes, objectives and principles of\nsentencing are set out in section 718 to 718.3 of the Criminal Code. Sentencing\nis intended to denounce unlawful conduct and to deter the offender and others\nin the community from committing offences. It can also be used to separate\noffenders from society where necessary. It can assist in rehabilitation. It can\nprovide reparations for harm done to victims and the community and it is\nintended to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders.[38]A sentence should be proportionate to the\ngravity of the offences and the degree of responsibility of the offender. The\nsentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating\nor migrating circumstances. A court must consider evidence that an offender\nabused a position of trust and must consider the impact of the offence on\nvictims.[39]A sentence should be similar to sentences\nimposed on similar offenders for similar offences in similar circumstances.\nWhere consecutive sentences are imposed the combined sentence should not be too\nlong or too harsh. An offender should not be deprived of liberty if less\nrestrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances. All available\nsanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances and\nconsistent with the harm done to victims or the community should be considered\nfor all offenders.[40]Those principles and objectives apply to almost\nevery sentencing, from a petty theft to manslaughter or robbery. They may\nappear to be contradictory but they are not. They operate in tension, so that\ncourts are required to consider factors that militate toward different\nconclusions. They offer guidance but rarely give answers. In some cases,\nrehabilitation will be the primary focus and in others, the main concern may be\ndenunciation of unlawful conduct. In many cases, courts try to give effect to a\nnumber of the principles and objectives at the same time.[41]The Criminal Code was amended in 2004 in\nresponse to the international impact of corporate scandals such as the Enron\ndebacle. Those amendments came into effect after these offences were committed.\nThey increased the maximum sentence for fraud and fraud affecting the market\nfrom 10 years to 14 years. The amendments also included a series of aggravating\nfactors to be considering in sentencing for offences which include section 380\n(2) which is one of the offences to which Mr. Clarke has pleaded guilty.[42]Section 380.1(1) provides that the court has to\nconsider as an aggravating circumstance that the magnitude, complexity,\nduration or degree of planning of the fraud committed was significant. It is\nalso an aggravating circumstance if the offence adversely affected or had the\npotential to adversely affect the stability of the Canadian economy or\nfinancial system or any financial market in Canada or investor confidence in\nany such market. If the offence involved a large number of victims, or had\nsignificant impact on victims given their personal circumstances including\ntheir age, health and financial situation, it is an aggravating circumstance.\nIt is an aggravating circumstance if the offender took advantage of the high\nregard in which the offender was held in the community. If the offender did not\ncomply with licensing requirement or professional standard that is normally\napplicable to the activity or conduct or if the offender concealed or destroyed\ndocuments related to the fraud, those are also aggravating circumstances. It is\nan aggravating circumstance if the value of the fraud is over $1 million.[43]There are some things that are specifically not\nmitigating circumstances. The court cannot consider the offender’s employment,\nemployment skills or status or reputation in the community if those circumstances\nwere relevant to, contributed to or were used in the commission of the offence.[44]These provisions were enacted after the offence.\nThey are applicable because they offer a set of principles derived from fraud\nsentencing appellate jurisprudence.The amendments to the fraud provisions made\nin September 2004, while inapplicable to this case, both raise the maximum\nsentence and specifically identify certain factors found in sophisticated\nfrauds as aggravating factors. Those are the same factors that have caused\nappellate courts to stress deterrence and denunciation in the sentencing of\nthose engaged in large-scale premediated frauds on the public marketplace: see An\nAct to Amend the Criminal Code (Capital Markets Fraud and Evidence Gathering),\nS.C. 2004, c.3, ss. 2 and 3. The statutory amendments follow the sentencing\npath cut by the appellate courts. R. v. Drabinsky, 2011 ONCA 582 (CanLII) para.\n161.[45]There was no minimum sentence for fraud under\ns.380 of the Criminal Code when these offences were committed. That was changed\nwith the enactment of s. 380 (1.1) which imposes a minimum sentence of two\nyears for fraud affecting the public market where the subject matter is valued\nat over $1 million. But when Mr. Clarke committed these offences, there was no\nminimum sentence set out in the Criminal Code.That is significant. It means\nthat the purposes, objectives, and principles of sentencing have to be\nconsidered in determining a sentence that can include the full range of\nnon-custodial and custodial sentences up to the maximum.Case law[46]No two cases are exactly the same. While\nsentences should reflect a degree of consistency, sentencing is an\nindividualized process. People are sentenced. Crimes are not.[47]It is instructive though to look at two cases\nwhere judges in Nova Scotia have carefully considered the options and come to\ndifferent conclusions.[48]The first is a decision of Judge Warren Zimmer\nof the Provincial Court in the unreported case of R. v. Allen.Mr.\nAllen was charged with 21 counts of forgery involving risking approximately $1.2\nmillion though the actual losses could not be calculated.He was an investment\nadvisor and falsely inflated his clients’ incomes and assets. That allowed them\nto borrow more and be exposed to more risk. Mr. Allen however, honestly\nbelieved that the scheme was to his clients’ advantage and he took no money\nhimself. During the stock market crash the clients lost money that they were\nunable to repay.[49]Judge Zimmer sentenced Mr. Allen to an 18 month\nconditional sentence. In doing so he noted that all of the money obtained from\nthe lenders by way of the forged documents went to the benefit of the clients\nin that it was used to purchase the investments for which it was intended. It\nwas not diverted for any other purpose. Judge Zimmer was satisfied that the\nconditional sentence was sufficiently punitive in the circumstances. Mr. Allen\nwas then permitted to serve his sentence in the community with a period of\nhouse arrest.[50]In that case, Mr. Allen did not divert money\nfrom his clients. The fraud was predominantly motivated a misplaced sense of\nthe clients’ best interests.[51]In R. v. Black, 2003 NSSC 99 (CanLII), Justice\nJohn Murphy imposed a period of incarceration and refused to grant a\nconditional sentence. Mr. Black solicited a $1 million loan from a German\ninvestor and rather than using the money as proposed in the arrangements he\ndiverted it to prop up other businesses that he owned. Justice Murphy\nconsidered whether a conditional sentence might be appropriate but determined\nthat general deterrence and denunciation were important in large scale fraud\ncases. Those goals of sentencing would not be satisfied by a conditional\nsentence.[52]Both R. v. Black and R. v. Allen provide\ncomprehensive reviews of the sentencing case law as it relates to large scale\nfraud. In some cases conditional sentences have been granted and in others they\nhave not been. There is no hard and fast rule. Clearly however, both\ndenunciation and general deterrence are highly import considerations in the\nsentencing of corporate crime and large scale premeditated fraud.[53]Considerations are weighed in the balance.\nSometimes the personal circumstances of the offender justify avoiding\nincarceration. Yet, serious crimes require serious punishment if justice is to\nmean anything at all.[54]Strict sentences do little or nothing to deter\nmost offenders. Few people caught up in the nasty synergistic spiral of\npoverty, addiction, mental health concerns and crime take the time to calculate\nthe risk of being caught, the range of potential criminal sanctions and the\npersonal benefit however vague of committing an assault. Enterprise crime has\nbeen argued to be an exception. Some people do consider the risk of being\ncaught and going to jail before embarking on a criminal course of action and\nthose people are often the ones who plan complicated corporate scams. The risks\nof being caught and punished have to be significant to deter people from taking\nthe chance at rigging the system to make a fortune. Individual sentences may\nnot often “send a message” but cumulatively they do establish that corporate\ncriminals risk spending years in jail.[55]There are also circumstances when a sentence\nmust simply serve as punishment. If it deterred no one it wouldn’t matter. When\na person cheats at a high level there have to be serious consequences. A system\nthat incarcerates people who commit street level crime cannot cringe at the prospect\nof punishing people who commit their crimes in boardrooms and office towers.Background[56]Bruce Clarke poses no risk of any kind to\nanyone. He has just turned 71 years old. He has no criminal record.[57]He has been married for 50 years. He and his\nwife have four adult children and seven grandchildren. Mrs. Clarke has suffered\nfrom serious illnesses and relies very much on her husband to provide\neverything from medical assistance to hospital visits and meal preparation.[58]Together they provide care for Mr. Clarke\nelderly parents.[59]Taking Mr. Clarke away from his family would\nhave devastating consequences. The cost his crimes would be imposed on him and\non his family. That sadly is the case in most circumstances in which people are\nincarcerated.[60]Bruce Clarke grew up in Advocate Harbour. He\ngraduated from school at 16 and went to Montreal. He got a job in the\ninvestment industry in 1964 as a messenger and worked his way up in the\nbusiness. In 1975 he moved back to Nova Scotia and opened a brokerage firm with\nthree friends. He was the Operations manager of J.D. Mack and remained with the\nfirm until it was sold in 1995. He remained with the firm that bought them out\nand that firm itself was bought by National Bank. He was with the investment\narm of National Bank when these offences took place.[61]He has been fired from that job and has lost his\nsecurity licence. He was fined $150,000.[62]Bruce Clarke has now lost everything he ever\nhad. The couple lives on CPP, old age pension and the income from Mr. Clarke’s\nseasonal work with a cruise line. The damage caused by the stock manipulation\nwas huge. The potential benefit to Bruce Clarke could have been very\nsignificant. Had Knowledge House gone forward as an operating business Mr.\nClarke could have made a handsome profit from his shares.But Knowledge House\ntanked. People lost huge amounts of money, Bruce Clarke among them. This is not\nthe story of a rogue who made off to Panama with other people’s money.[63]By all accounts Bruce Clarke is a good friend, a\ngood employee and a devoted family man. It’s painful to read the letters\nwritten to support him knowing what he’s facing. He’s not a high roller who\nlived the life of conspicuous consumption. It leaves one to ask how someone\nlike that could get involved with something like this. It’s tempting to think\nthat Bruce Clarke was a dupe or a rube, who just did what he was told without\nknowing that it was wrong or appreciating the consequences. That would be to\nunderestimate him.[64]Bruce Clarke was described by Crown Counsel Mr.\nCovan as the engineer in the conspiracy. He was not in the wheelhouse calling\nthe shots but was down in the engine room, pulling levers and monitoring what\nwas going on.[65]Like an engineer, Mr. Clarke needed to have an\nunderstanding of the detailed workings of the conspiracy from top to bottom. He\nwas not merely translating directions into action. He knew precisely what he\nwas doing and why. He wasn’t the strategic mastermind but appears instead to\nhave been the willing and competent tactician.[66]It’s unlikely that the full scope of the\nconspiracy and the fraud were set out on a Gantt chart from the first day. Each\nshady manoeuvre to respond to a perceived immediate need to keep things afloat\ntemporarily makes the next move morally easier and the following ones\npractically necessary until a self-sustaining network of fraud has been\ncreated.Aggravating Factors[67]The magnitude, complexity, duration and degree\nof planning of the fraud are aggravating factors.[68]On any measurement the size of this fraud was\nsignificant. It is impossible to quantify the exact scale of the loss but there\nis no doubt that this involved millions of dollars. It was not a check kiting\nscheme or social assistance fraud. This was maneuvering millions of dollars to\nmanipulate the price of a stock publically trading on the Toronto Stock\nexchange.[69]On one level it was not complex at all. It can\nbe explained fairly easily. But again, this was not simply a matter of failing\nto report income or a onetime lie. This was a concerted effort over a period of\nmonths. It involved a number of techniques that would for the most part be\nunknown to those not familiar with stock trading. It required cooperation and\ncoordination involving a number of well-resourced individuals with a common\ngoal. Yes, it can be explained fairly easily in one sentence. But that does not\ndiminish its complexity. The conspirators manipulated the price of stocks on\nthe TSX. That is no small matter.[70]The fraud took place over a number of months.\nThe buying of stock was carefully planned and coordinated to coincide with the\ninterest of outside investors in acquiring stock. There had to be a level of\nflexibility and cooperation as well to respond when the main account used to\nprop up the share value had run out of borrowing room.[71]The manipulation had the potential to affect\ninvestor confidence in the market. There is of course no proof that investors\nlost confidence in the Canadian markets as a result of this specific\nmanipulation. Public stock exchanges operate on the basis that members of the\npublic can invest trusting that the value of the stock that they buy is set by\nmarket forces. Each time someone rigs the market a message is sent that things\nmay not be as above board as they might seem.[72]Mr. Clarke was motivated by financial\nself-interest. He was not doing this simply to make money for his clients with\nno potential gain for himself. Bruce Clarke held a significant number of\nKnowledge House shares and his own wealth was tied to the performance of that\nstock. The trustees of the union pension fund trusted that he was acting for\nthe benefit of the fund and not for his own benefit.[73]Mr. Clarke brought his own son, Steven Clarke\ninto the fraud. He recruited both Steven Clarke and Lynn MacDonald to\nparticipate.Mitigating\nCircumstances[74]There are mitigating factors as well. Bruce\nClarke entered guilty pleas in this matter four weeks into the trial itself. As\nMr. Martin has noted that is a very significant factor.These are difficult\ncases to prosecute.[75]Mr. Clarke has no criminal record. There is a\nrecord of professional discipline arising from this matter. In 2004 he entered\ninto a settlement agreement with the Nova Scotia Securities Commission for his\nrole in the commission of these offences. He agreed to the suspension of his\nlicence for 5 years, an administrative penalty of $75,000 and a further $75,000\nin costs.[76]Mr. Clarke has been facing these charges since\n2011. The investigation started in 2004. A motion for a stay was denied by\nJustice Coady in August 2015. Delay which causes prolonged uncertainty for an\naccused person but which falls short of constitutional limits can be taken into\nconsideration in sentencing. R. v. Bosley, 1992 CanLII 2838 (ON CA), [1992] O.J. 2656 (ONCA), at\npara. 44. Mr. Clarke and his family have been facing the very real potential of\njail time for some time now.[77]Over those years, Bruce Clarke’s name has been\nassociated publically with the collapse of Knowledge House and with these\noffences. It is hard to imagine that his life has been anything liked normal\nover that period of time.Conclusion[78]There is no joy or even any sense of\nsatisfaction or closure that comes from imposing a jail sentence. A person may\nhave inflicted devastating physical harm or massive financial loss on others\nbut a jail sentence can do nothing to restore what has been lost. Justice can’t\nright the wrong. At this moment the person facing prison must be seen in the\nfullness of their own humanity by those who play at part in sending them there.[79]Bruce Clarke was a conspirator in a multimillion\ndollar complex stock manipulation fraud. He also defraud a union pension fund\nof close to $900,000. Those are serious crimes for which only a significant\nperiod of time in jail is the fit and proper sentence.[80]I accept the joint recommendation of counsel and\nimpose the sentence of imprisonment for a period of three years. That sentence\nof three years will apply to both counts and the sentences will be served\nconcurrently.J."}

KOVATCH, JFACTS[1]The accused, M.G.V. is charged that on April 3, 2008, he committed a\nsexual assault on BF contrary to section 271 of the Criminal Code.The\nCrown proceeded by way of indictment.Hereafter, I sometimes refer to this\ncharge as the principal charge.On this principal charge, a preliminary\ninquiry was held before myself on March 11, 2009.The accused was committed to\nstand trial by a Queen’s\nBench judge sitting without a jury.[2]The court was advised that a date was set for this matter to be spoken\nto in the Court of Queen’s\nBench.However, prior to that date, the accused became scared and fled the\njurisdiction.This resulted in the four other informations being laid, all\nunder section 145 of the Criminal Code.All of these additional charges\nwere laid in 2009.For much of the intervening time, M.G.V. was living with a\ngirlfriend in the Edmonton area.Following the break up of that relationship,\nhe returned to the Moose Jaw area.I gather that he turned himself in, and was\nreleased on bail.He re-elected trial by this court, entered a guilty plea to\nall of the charges and sentencing submissions were held before me on August 18.[3]Counsel did considerable work to reach an agreement on all of the\nessential facts related to the principal charge.The court was advised that on\nthe date of the offence the accused was 18 years and 74 days old.On the date\nof the offence, the victim was 37 days short of her 14th birthday.At the time, the accused was suffering depression, and was not doing very well\nin his life.He became friends with the complainant’s family.The accused and the complainant\nconsidered themselves boyfriend and girlfriend.Only one incident of sexual\nassault is alleged.On the date in question, the accused and the complainant\nboth skipped school and went to the complainant’s\nhome.At the complainant’s\nhome, both took off their own clothes, and they were about to engage in\nintercourse.[4]Meanwhile, the school contacted the complainant’s mother and advised that she was in\ninexplicably absent from school.Themother immediately returned to her home\nwhere she located the complainant and the accused in a state of undress and\nready to engage in intercourse.The court was advised that there was no\npenetration and no intercourse.According to the pre-sentence report, the\nvictim has issues trusting people and an ongoing fear that something could\nhappen to her own children.She has asked that the existing no contact order\nremain in place.THE RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS AND POSITIONS OF THE\nPARTIES[5]In 2008, section 271 of the Criminal Code provided that where an\naccused is guilty of the indictable offence of sexual assault, he is liable to\na term of imprisonment of not exceeding 10 years.At the time, section 742.1\nof the Criminal Code provided that the court could deal with such a\nmatter by way of a conditional sentence order, if the sentence imposed was less\nthan two years and the court was “satisfied\nthat serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the\ncommunity and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles\nof sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2”.[6]In the intervening years between 2008 and today, Parliament has made\nsignificant legislative amendments.Section 271 now has a minimum mandatory\nterm of imprisonment for sexual assault against a complainant under the age of\n14 years.Section 742 now provides that a conditional sentence order is not\navailable where the Code provides for a mandatory term of actual\nincarceration, as is the case with section 271.[7]Both counsel addressed the issue of these legislative changes.Both\ntook the position that this accused must be sentenced according to the law as\nit existed in 2008.As a result, for this sentencing, there is no mandatory\nminimum period of incarceration and a conditional sentence is available for\nconsideration by the court.Having said that, Mr. Hendrickson argued that when\nI consider all of the facts, together with the sentencing principles in section\n718 to 718.2 and the relevant case law, that a sentence of actual jail in the\nrange of nine to 15 months is appropriate.[8]He said the breaches committed by the accused and the lengthy delay\nbefore sentencing, were aggravating factors.He agreed that this was a one\ntime occurrenceand there was no evidence of grooming.Further, that these\nwere mitigating factors. He pointed to the complainant’s very young age and the fact that she was\nunder age.He pointed out that there was no consent in law.On the basis of\nR v Revet, 2010 SKCA 71 (CanLII), he said that this is a serious sexual offence and\nthe primary sentencing considerations are denunciation and deterrence. He asked\nfor a term of actual jail in the range of nine to 15 months.[9]Ms. Jeanson pointed out that the accused was 18 years and 74 days old at\nthe time of the offence.The complainant was 37 days short of her 14th\nbirthday.She said that there was consent in fact, but not in law.She said\nthe complainant felt that she was mature and she had made her own decision on\nthis matter.She pointed out that the accused was at a difficult point in his\nlife at this time.He is now at a much better time in his life, and will\nsuffer a set back and negative ramifications from an actual term of\nincarceration.She indicated that he has expressed remorse and shame and takes\nfull responsibility for his action.She said the accused was not in a position\na trust.Given these mitigating factors, Ms. Jeanson characterized this as a\nlow end sexual assault.She asked for a two month conditional sentence order,\nfollowed by 10 months of probation.ANALYSIS AND DECISION[10]I begin by responding to a couple of specific points argued by each\ncounsel.Mr. Hendrickson argued that the breaches and the delay in sentencing\nwere significant aggravating factors.It is obvious that the accused fled the\njurisdiction, and avoided this matter for a lengthy period of time, resulting\nin the delay.It is equally obvious that the court can never condone an individual\nfor taking flight to avoid the law and significantly delay an outcome.Having\nsaid that, I substantially accept Ms. Jeanson’s\nexplanation of this.She advised that M.G.V. was approximately 19 years of age\nwhen the breaches occurred and he fled.The preliminary inquriy had been held,\nand this matter was on its way to the Court of Queen’s Bench.He had not previously spent any time\nin actual custody.He correctly ascertained that there was a significant\npossibility, if not a probability, that he would receive a term of actual\ncustody.He panicked.While avoidance and flight cannot be condoned, it is\nsomewhat understandable that a young person facing actual incarceration might\npanic and take flight.As a result, while I cannot condone his avoidance and\nflight, I do not regard this as a serious aggravating factor and will attempt\nto focus on the punishment to be rendered for the principal charge.[11]As mentioned above, Ms. Jeanson emphasized that there was consent in\nfact, and characterized this as low end sexual assault.I cannot accept that\nthis was a low end sexual assault.Some decisions in this area point out that\nthe very purpose of a section stating the minimum age for consenting to sexual\nactivity is to protect children from having to make such decisions.The law is\nsupposed to be a protection for children from sexual abuse and exploitation.As a result, any sexual offence against an under age child, incapable of\nproviding legal consent, must be regarded as a serious sexual offence.In the\ncase of R v Whiting, 2013 SKCA 101 (CanLII), the court specifically said the\ntrial judge was in error in not characterizing this as a major sexual offence.The court referred to the Revet decision and indicated that denunciation\nand deterrence were the primary sentencing considerations.In Whiting,\nRevet and other decisions, the court has said thatmost sexual offences\nwill attract a term of actual incarceration.Further, a penalty that does not\ninvolve actual incarceration is to be considered the exception, as opposed to\nthe norm.[12]Having stated all of this, there are some exceptional cases where a term\nof incarceration was not imposed for sexual assault.Mr. Hendrickson has\nfairly acknowledged and agreed that the accused must be sentenced on the basis\nof the law as it existed at the time of this offence in April of 2008.At that\ntime, section 271 of the Criminal Code simply provided that an\nindividual convicted of the indictable offence of sexual assault would be\nsubject to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 10 years.Under section 742.1,\nthe court could and I am obligated to consider whether a conditional sentence\nis appropriate.In the case of R v Proulx (2000) 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 1 SCR 61, the court\nspecifically stated that there is no presumption that a conditional sentence\norder is not appropriate for specific offences.This same principle was made\nand ennunciated by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R v D.J.J. (1998)\n1998 CanLII 12411 (SK CA), 172 Sask R 182.[13]As is often the case in situations like this, there are a large number\nof sentencing decisions, and those decisions go both ways.The following\ndecisions impose significant periods of incarceration: R v Miller, 2016\nSKCA 32 (CanLII); R v Whiting, 2013 SKCA 101 (CanLII); R v Tetlow, 2014 SKPC 156 (CanLII); R\nv J.R., 2012 SKPC 167 (CanLII) and R v Glasser, 2011 SKPC 50 (CanLII).I note\nhowever, that in a number of these situations, there was actual sexual\nintercourse, which was not what happened here.Also, in a number of those\ncases, there was a prolonged relationship and a number of sexual encounters\nthat the accused was being sentenced for.That also is not the situation.[14]The following cases dealt with the matter by some form of community\nbased sentence: R vD.J.J. (1998) 172 Sask R 82 (CA); R v R.R.,\n2013 SKPC 83 (CanLII) and R v V.J.S., 2016 SKPC 112 (CanLII).There are also some\ndistinguishing features from these cases to the case at bar.Two of the cases\ninvolved an individual with diminished mental or cognitive capacity and thus a diminished\ncriminal responsibility.I have no evidence before me that would allow me to\nconclude that M.G.V. suffered from any diminished mental capacity.In my view,\nit is significant to note that in V.J.S., Her Honour Judge Daunt\nsentenced under the law as it presently exists.She dealt with the matter by\nway of intermittent sentence and probation.I was advised that no appeal was\nfiled in that case.[15]For the following reasons, I have determined it would not be\ninappropriate for me to deal with this matter by way of a conditional sentence\norder.I begin by noting that a term of incarceration would be in the range of\nnine months to 15 months.Indeed, this is the length of sentence requested by\nMr.Hendrickson.Section 742.1 of the Criminal Code says that the court\nmay consider a conditional sentence order where the court imposes a sentence of\nless than two years and the court “is\nsatisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the\nsafety of the community and would be consistent with fundamental purpose and\nprinciples of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2.”The sentence here would\nbe under two years.The pre-sentence report indicates that the accused is\nassessed as a low risk to reoffend.He is assessed as a moderate to low risk\nto re-offend sexually.In my view, a conditional sentence order would not\nendanger the safety of the community.When I consider the relatively young age\nof this accused person at the time of the offence, his lack of a significant\ncriminal record, the fact that this was a single incident, that there was no\nactual sexual intercourse, that the accused has taken responsibility for his\nactions and shown remorse, and the present state of his life with supportive\nfamily and friends around him, I am of the view that a conditional sentence\norder is the most appropriate way of dealing with this matter.In reaching\nthis conclusion, I have not disregarded the importance of denunciation and\ndeterrence in sentencing this kind of charge.In the R.R. decision, His\nHonour Judge Bazin specifically addressed these factors and imposed a\nconditional sentence order.He stated in part as follows;DenunciationDenunciation\nbeing a primary consideration in child sexual assault is best satisfied by a\nterm of incarceration.The Court of Appeal as set out in Laliberte has\nheld that conditional sentence orders have the ability to satisfy the\nprinciples of denunciation as long as they adequately restrict the offender’s liberty.Severe\nrestrictions on conditional sentence orders are to be the norm not the\nexception.DeterrenceIn\nboth general and specific deterrence, the effectiveness of the deterrence is\nclosely related to the conditional sentence orders ability to denounce\noffending behaviour.If a conditional sentence order gives the public the\nappearance that there are no restrictions on liberty, they will have little\ndeterrent effect generally.In many ways a conditional sentence order with\nappropriate restrictions demonstrates to the larger community, on a daily\nbasis, the punishment that is imposed upon an offender as they have the\noffender in the community, and the restrictions remind the community daily of\nthe punishment and the offence.Deterrence could be satisfied with a\nconditional sentence order with appropriate conditions.[16]Like Judge Bazin in the R.R. decision, I am satisfied that I can\nmeet the principles of denunciation and deterrence by a conditional sentence\norder that is fairly lengthy and fairly restrictive.For these reasons\nhowever, that conditional sentence order must be more lengthy and more\nrestrictive than was requested by defence counsel in her submissions.[17]On the principal charge of sexual assault, I sentence M.G.V. to 12\nmonths to be served conditionally and in the community on the following\nconditions:i.Keep the peace and be of good behaviour;ii.appear before the court when required to do so;iii.report to the supervisor forthwith and thereafter as and when required\nand in a manner directed by the supervisor or their designate;iv.remain within the jurisdiction of the province of Saskatchewan unless\nwritten permission to go outside of that jurisdiction is obtained through the\ncourt or supervisor;v.Notify the court or supervisor in advance of any change of name or\naddress and promptly notify the court or supervisor of any change of employment\nor occupation;vi.live in a residence approved by the supervisor and not change that\nresidence without the prior written permission of the supervisor or designate\nof the court;vii.For the first six months of this order, stay within your approved\nresidence 24hrs a day unless you have the written permission of your supervisor\nor designate of the court.During this time, you will comply with the terms of\nthe electronic monitoring program.You may be outside of your residence for\nwork, programming, and other matters deemed appropriate by the supervisor in\nwriting, and you shall come to the door of your approved residence when asked\nto do so by a police officer/supervisor or designate who may be checking the\nresidence and curfew conditions of this order;viii.Not possess or consume alcohol or drugs that have not been prescribed\nfor you by a medical doctor and not enter or be in any place where the main\npurpose is the sale of alcohol such as bars or liquor stores;ix.Provide suitable samples of your breath for testing upon the request of\na police officer who has reasonable grounds to believe you are in breach of a\ncondition of this order regarding the consumption of alochol;x.Participate in assessments and complete programming for sexual\noffending, mental health concerns or cognitive challenges and or personal\ncounselling as directed by and to the satisfaction of the supervisor;xi.You are to have no contact directly or indirectly except through a\nlawyer acting on your behalf with B.F.You are not be within five metres of\nthat individual or within 50 metres of any residence, place of education or place\nof employment of this individual.[18]On each of the other charges to which the accused has entered a guilty\nplea, he will be sentenced to 30 days to be served conditionally and in the\ncommunity.Each of these other sentences are to be served concurrently with\nthe sentence on the principal offence.[19]All of these matters arose under the old criminal victims surcharge\nregime, where imposition of the criminal victim surcharge was within the\ndiscretion of the court.I waive all of the criminal victim surcharges.[20]This is a primary designated offence within the meaning of section\n487.04 of the Criminal Code.As a result, there will be an order\nrequiring M.G.V. to attend at the Moose Jaw City Police Station no later than\n4:00 p.m. on Wednesday November 23 to provide suitable bodily samples for\nforensic DNA analysis.[21]This is also a designated offence withing the meaning of section 490.011\nof the Criminal Code.Accordingly there will be an order requiring the\naccused to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for\na period of 20 years from today’s\ndate.[22]There will also be an order under section 109 of the Criminal Code prohibiting\nthe accused from being in possession of any firearm prohibited and\nrestrictive firearms and other weapons and explosive substances.That order\nwill be in place for 10 years.[23]I express my thanks to both counsel for their thorough and helpful\nsubmissions.Dated at the City of Moose Jaw, the Province of Saskatchewan\nthis ____ of November 2016._______________________Kovatch,\nJ"}

ZELENSKY* Manitoba Court of Appeal, Guy, Monnin, Hall, Matas and O'Sullivan, JJ.A. November 29, 1976. *Leave to appeal to Supreme Court of Canada granted (Pigeon, Dickson and de Grandpré, JJ.) January 25, 1977. D. A. Yanofsky, Q.C., for accused, appellant. C. Newcombe, for the Crown, respondent. D. G. Frayer, for Federal Government. GUY, J.A. (dissenting):—The question of the constitutionality of s. 653 of the Canadian Criminal Code and the question of the propriety of its application in the circumstances of this case are still under consideration by this Court. We are, however, unanimous in our view that the appeal must be dismissed in so far as it relates to that portion of the sentence providing for incarceration of two years less one day, followed by one year of supervised probation. That portion of the appeal is accordingly dismissed and the incarceration and probation sentence is affirmed. In due course, we will deliver a judgment concerning the question of compensation and restitution. In the meantime, of course, the certificate of title to the house property will remain in the Court pocket. MONNIN, J.A. (dissenting):—As to the sentence of two years less one day to be followed by one year of supervised probation imposed by Collerman, Prov.J., I see absolutely no reason to disturb it. The only possibility would be to increase it, since it is at the lowest portion of the scale for theft of this magnitude. I do not disturb it. As to s. 653 and whether it is intra vires of the Parliament of Canada: Section 653 reads as follows: Compensation 653(1) A court that convicts an accused of an indictable for loss of offence may, upon the application of a person aggrieved, at the property time sentence is imposed, order the accused to pay to that person an amount by way of satisfaction or compensation for loss of or damage to property suffered by the applicant as a result of the commission of the offence of which the accused is convicted. Enforcement (2) Where an amount that is ordered to be paid under subsection (1) is not paid forthwith the applicant may, by filing the order, enter as a judgment, in the superior court of the province in which the trial was held, the amount ordered to be paid, and that judgment is enforceable against the accused in the same manner as if it were a judgment rendered against the accused in that court in civil proceedings. Moneys (3) All or any part of an amount that is ordered to be paid un-found on der subsection (1) may, if the court making the order is satisfied accused that ownership of or right to possession of those moneys is not disputed by claimants other than the accused and the court so directs, be taken out of moneys found in the possession of the accused at the time of his arrest. In R. v. Littler (1972), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 530, 41 D.L.R. (3d) 523, Loranger, J.Sess., dealt with the matter of compensation after a formal request had been made by the aggrieved parties. The application was strongly objected to by counsel for the accused on the ground that the section was unconstitutional. Loranger, J.Sess., re- jetted the argument and ordered compensation for the loss suffered as a result of the commission of three offences of fraud for which the accused had been convicted. Turcotte v. Gagnon, [1974] Que.P.R. 309, is another example of its application. Hugessen, J. , in dealing with the matter said at pp. 317-8: In R. c. Cohen and Miller (1922), 38 C.C.C. 334, the Manitoba Court of Appeal refused to deal with a question raising the constitutional validity of the predecessor of section 653, but, in an obiter dictum, Perdue C.J. stated: \"The matters dealt with in sec. 1044-1050 of the Cr. Code, relating to costs, pecuniary compensation and restitution of stolen property, seem to me to be incidental to the exclusive legislative authority of Parliament over criminal law and procedure in criminal cases and therefore within its powers.\" In my view, an order for restitution to the victim of a crime is not only incidental to criminal law and procedure; it may be an inherent part of the sentencing process. While it may be true that, historically, the Common Law did not recognise compensatory orders as being part of the criminal process, I can see no reason why appropriate legislation within the exercise of the criminal law power should not render them so. As stated by the Law Reform Commission of Canada in Working Paper No. 3, on \"The Principles of Sentencing and Dispositions\": \"Compensation to victims of crime is not purely a matter of private civil law, for a public interest is at stake; it is not only a matter of humanitarian concern and welfare law but a matter of fairness and justice.\" (at page 31). In my opinion, Parliament has attempted to provide for such compensation, albeit in an imperfect and partial manner, by the provisions of section 653. As is made clear by section 601, an order under section 653 is a part of the sentence rendered by the criminal court. Proceedings such as the present ones taken in a civil court in order to effect the execution of such an order do not cause it thereby to lose its criminal law character. In effect, all that Parliament has done is to impose upon the provincial superior courts, which are equipped for such purpose, the duty of providing for the execution of an order already given by a court of competent jurisdiction. As already stated in the present judgment, the function of the civil court in such a case is not so much judicial as administrative and I would have no right, on a petition of the present sort, to vary the order made by the Court of Sessions of the Peace even were I minded to do so. That Parliament may, by appropriate legislation, vest in a provincial superior court a jurisdiction which it did not possess at common law has been established almost since the time of Confederation As stated by Ritchie C.J., in Valin c. Langlois (9), [1945] S.C.R. 600. \"To hold that no new jurisdiction, or mode of procedure, can be imposed on the provincial courts by the Dominion Parliament in its legislation on matters within its legislative power, is to neutralize, if not destroy, that power and to paralyze the legislation of Parliament.\" (Emphasis mine.) Fifty-four years ago the matter was examined by a Bench consisting of Perdue, C.J.M., Cameron, Dennistoun and Prendergast, JJ.A. [R. v. Cohen and Miller (1922), 38 C.C.C. 334, [1923] 1 D.L.R. 687, [1922] 3 W.W.R. 1126]. Though the constitutional question was not dealt with specifically, because the Court was dealing with a stated case in which the question of the constitutional validity of s. 1048 was not submitted, the matter was raised by way of written argument. I realize that it is not a binding decision, because the question was not properly put before the Court. Cameron stated that he was not called upon to decide whether Parliament had authority to enact s. 1048. Dennistoun and Prendergast, without written reasons, concurred in the result, but Perdue, C.J.M., dealt with it as follows [p. 335 C.C.C., pp. 688-9 D.L.R.]: Since the argument counsel for the accused has by a written memorandum raised the question of the constitutionality of sec. 1048. This Court can only consider questions raised in the reserved case and the question of the constitutional validity of the section is not submitted. I would not favour the granting of an application to have the reserved case sent back for amendment in order to raise this question. The Parliament of Canada has exclusive legislative authority over the criminal law and the procedure in criminal matters, B.N.A. Act, sec. 91 [27]. The matters dealt with in sec. 1044-1050 of the Cr. Code, relating to costs, pecuniary compensation and restitution of stolen property, seem to me to be incidental to the exclusive legislative authority of Parliament over criminal law and procedure in criminal cases and therefore within its powers. I would refer to Tennant v. Union Bank, [1894] A.C. 31, at p. 46; also Corp'n of Toronto v. C.P.R., [1908] A.C. 54, at p. 58. Compensation for loss of property limited to the sum of $1,000 but in language similar to s. 653(1) can be traced through to R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, s. 1048; to R.S.C. 1906, c. 146, s. 1048, and to the original Criminal Code, 1892, c. 29, s. 836. It is therefore nothing new but has been in the Code in varying language since its inception. Re Torek and the Queen (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 296 at pp. 298-9, 44 D.L.R. (3d) 417 at p. 418-9, 2 O.R. (2d) 228, the matter was dealt with specifically by Haines, J., wherein he said: ... The applicant argues that had Mr. Kaminsky been forced to undertake a civil action to recover the sum, he would have been forced to prove his loss in a stricter manner. However, under s. 653, all that the complainant need do is merely testify as to value and the accused cannot really disprove it. In other words, the protection afforded to a defendant by the Judicature Act R.S.O. 1970, c. 228, and the Rules of Practice, are removed, but the consequence is really the same in the sense in that the complainant gets what is, in effect, a judgment, which by s. 653(2) can be enforced in the provincial superior Courts in the ordinary manner. I do not think that there can be any doubt that the right to bring and defend an ordinary civil action is a civil right, which is within the competence of provincial legislation. Nor can there be any doubt that in these circumstances, Mr. Kaminsky could have commenced an action against the applicant. However, it does not follow that the federal Government is entirely without power to order restitution or compensation in some circumstances. In my view, proceedings under s. 653 can be considered to be part of the sentencing process. It is worth noting that in s. 601, which deals with appeals on indictable offences, the word \"sentence\" is defined to include an order made under s. 653. It seems to me that it is a valid object in sentencing to prevent a convicted criminal from profiting from his crime by serving a jail term and then keeping the gains of his illegal venture. Counsel for the applicant admitted that it would be proper for the order complained of to have been made as a term of probation, pursuant to s. 663(2) (e) and (h), which state that the Court may impose as a condition of a probation order, conditions that the accused: \"(e) make restitution or reparation to any person aggrieved or injured by the commission of the offence for the actual loss or damage sustained by that person as a result thereof; \"(h) comply with such other reasonable conditions as the court considers desirable for securing the good conduct of the accused and for preventing a repetition by him of the same offence or the commission of other offences.\" I fail to see that there is any meaningful distinction between an order requiring an accused to make restitution or reparation as set out in s. 663(2)(e) and an order requiring an accused to pay by way of satisfaction or compensation as set out in s. 653(1). That statement appeals to me and I find therein no error in principle. In pith and substance, s. 653 is part and parcel of the sentencing process set out in the Criminal Code of Canada. If it were not, the hands of our Courts would be sadly tied and the victims of crimes would of necessity have to seek recovery of property or moneys illegally taken away from them through civil Courts on the basis that one cannot mix that which is criminal with that which is civil and on the further basis that provincially appointed Judges are not fit persons to deal with matters of civil law. Can one think of a more ridiculous proposition and one bound to bring the entire legal process — already badly challenged — in disrepute? Distinctions for the sake of distinctions have no place in Courts of law. Section 653(1) entitled \"Compensation for loss of property — Enforcement — Moneys found on accused\" is to the effect that at the time the sentence is imposed, a Court may order an accused to pay to the person aggrieved an amount by way of satisfaction or compensation for loss or damage to property suffered by the applicant as a result of the commission of an offence of which the accused has been convicted. Surely, when Parliament spoke of loss or damage to property, it must also have had in mind that goods or merchandise are not always the only subject of an offence, but that at times moneys -- namely, cash, cheques, securities and other valuable documents — and no longer available \"in specie\" to the victim, can be the subject of offences. Section 663 [am. 1974-75-76, c. 93, s. 81] deals with probation orders and it is to the effect that certain matters may be included in probation orders imposed by the sentencing Judge, amongst which is a matter of making \"restitution or reparation to any person aggrieved or injured by the commission of the offence for the actual loss or damage sustained by that person as a result thereof\": see s. 663(2)(e). I see little or no difference between restitution and compensation as they are described in ss. 653 and 663. Compensation must be re- quested by the aggrieved person at the time sentence is about to be imposed and there is case law to the effect that a request for compensation must be made at the time of sentencing and cannot be made at a later date. Restitution can be ordered by the sentencing Judge as a part of his total sentence if it forms part of the probation order. In ordering restitution, the Judge may act pursuant to a request by Crown counsel or by the aggrieved party or may also do so of his own free will without any request by anyone. Restitution has often been equated with compensation except that there is a special section, namely, s. 653, which deals with compensation for loss or damage of property suffered by a victim. So much so that even this Court, though differently constituted in R. v. Butkans, decided June 18, 1970, [unreported] — a Court composed by Smith, C.J.M., Dickson, J.A. and myself, — confirmed what we called in that particular case an order of restitution under s. 638(2)(e) of the Criminal Code, which section is identical to the existing s. 663(2)(e). In the Butkans case the Court was actually dealing with a matter of compensation, though it had been called an order of restitution. Was that Bench acting per incuriam? I doubt it. In R. v. Butkans, supra, the accused was convicted of theft of cash in excess of $50. The amount he was guilty of stealing was $7,925.40. The trial Judge suspended sentence for two years upon condition that the accused make restitution of the amount stolen. This was a case where a friend gave $14 to Butkans in order to place seven $2 bets on the daily double pool at the Assiniboia Downs, a well-known horse-racing track in the City of Winnipeg. The accused placed these bets and received $7,925.40 and converted the moneys to his own use, by not paying them to his friend and alleging that there had been no winnings. If there ever was a case where the moneys or property was never in the hands of the aggrieved person or in the custody of the police officers, this was one. Butkans throughout denied that the arrangement were for bets on the daily double pool and alleged that they were for other combinations of bets which turned out to be unsuccessful on that particular date. No challenge was made to the constitutionality of the section by Mr. Harry Walsh, Q.C., counsel for the accused, since the matter was dealt with under s. 663. But it was obvious by the factums submitted that restitution and compensation were equated and in effect the order of restitution in the Butkans case bears great resemblance to an order of compensation. The aggrieved person, Dawshka, was to be the recipient of the moneys, the proceeds of the restitution. In fact, restitution was never made and the executrix of Dawshka's estate had to sue But-kans in a civil action in the Court of Queen's Bench for the recovery of such moneys. Judgment was obtained in favour of the es- tate and affirmed in this Court in Suit No. 87/75 on October 22, 1975. Had the matter been dealt with in the first place by virtue of s. 653 instead of restitution under a probation order under s. 663, the sentencing Judge's order could have been entered as a judgment in the Court of Queen's Bench and it would have avoided the filing of the statement of claim, statement of defence and other documents filed in Dawshka v. Butkans [unreported]. It appears that recourse to the civil Court for recovery of the moneys was required because a charge of breach of the probation order was dismissed by Hewak, Co.Ct.J., in Butkans v. The Queen, [1972] 4 W.W.R. 262, on the ground that the proceedings were initiated more than six months after the date of the probation order. I am, therefore, of the view that s. 653 being in pith and substance legislation forming part of the sentencing process under the Criminal Code of Canada is intra vires of the Parliament of Cana-da. Now as to the merits of the order of compensation and restitution in the present case. The transcripts of the proceedings on April 14, 29, and June 4, 1976, consisting of more than 125 pages, are no masterpiece of clarity. Counsel seemed to have confused the Court more than helped it to obtain the precise information in order to arrive at the exact amount of the theft. Throughout the proceedings there appears to have been a strong reticence on the part of various counsel for the accused who appeared throughout the three hearings and on the part of various counsel appearing on behalf of T. Eaton Co. to come out clearly with the exact facts. The Court was not provided with a positive statement of the exact amount involved, although Coller -man, Prov.J., attempted to the best of his ability to get the facts from counsel. That is a factor in this case and counsel are responsible for that situation. Nevertheless, it is clear in my mind that police investigation has led to a charge of theft of moneys in the approximate amount of $18,000 and the theft of merchandise in the approximate amount of $7,000 and that throughout the proceedings, advised by counsel, the accused entered into a plea of guilty of these approximate amounts. The charge read: ... at the City of Winnipeg aforesaid, between the 1st. day of January 1974 and the 17th day of December in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and seventy-five / both dates inclusive did unlawfully steal monies to the amount of eighteen thousand dollars more or less and merchandise to the amount of seven thousand dollars more or less the property of The T. Eaton Co. Limited and did thereby commit theft Words mean something. Persons do not lightly plead guilty to theft of moneys and merchandise. When they admit to theft of such large amounts, even if the amount is \"more or less\", he or she must mean it, otherwise the entire system of entering pleas in criminal matters is frustrated and appears ridiculous. The plea entered dealt with theft of moneys in the amount of $18,000 \"more or less\" and theft of merchandise in the amount of $7,000 \"more or less\". Counsel for the accused and the aggrieved person failed to supply the Court with the exact amount and they cannot be surprised if, at the conclusion of three hearings, they find their clients with an order of compensation for $18,000 and an order of restitution of the goods recovered in the amount of $7,000, this despite the fact, that counsel for the accused indicated that some of the goods recovered may have been legitimately purchased by his client. That could easily have been ascertained before the plea and before the hearings. I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal. HALL, J.A., concurs with MATAS, J.A. MATAS, J.A.:—This is an appeal from sentence. Anne Zelensky was charged (with her husband Steve Zelensky), with stealing from The T. Eaton Company Limited (the company), \"monies to the amount of eighteen thousand dollars more or less and merchandise to the amount of seven thousand dollars more or less\". Appellant was employed by the company in its catalogue sales department. At the material times her duties included the authorization of refunds of money to customers who had placed orders which could not be filled. By using a fraudulent scheme, the details of which need not be set out for the purposes of these reasons, appellant was able to convert funds and other property of the company. It was stated by Crown counsel that the amount of stolen money was $18,551.13 arising from 111 transactions and the value of other converted property, i.e., merchandise, was $7,682.13. Upon entry of guilty pleas, the learned trial Judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment on Anne Zelensky of two years less one day to be followed by a period of one year's supervised probation; in addition, the learned trial Judge ordered compensation to the company of $18,000 and an order for restitution of goods recovered by the police. The order for compensation and the order for restitution was made against both Mr. and Mrs. Zelensky. Mr. Zelensky was placed on three year's supervised probation. He has not appealed. At the hearing in this Court the matter was reserved. On Octo-ber 27, 1976, judgment was delivered dismissing the appeal in respect of the term of imprisonment but further reserving the appeal in respect of the orders for compensation and restitution. Parallel proceedings were taking place in the civil and criminal Courts over a period of several months. The following chronological table will indicate the course of proceedings: CIVIL December 17, 1975 — The company filed a statement of claim against Anne Zelensky in Court of Queen's Bench claiming payment of $18,564.13 and obtained a garnishing order ($10,563.50 was caught under the order and paid into Court). February 12, 1976 — Statement of claim was served on appellant. February 20, 1976 — Counsel for Anne Zelensky requested particulars of the claim from counsel for the company. April 12, 1976 — Particulars were supplied by counsel for the company to counsel for appellant. April 28, 1976 — Statement of defence by Anne Zelensky was filed in the Queen's Bench action, denying liability (counsel for appellant said that the defence was intended to admit liability but dispute quantum, but that is not in accord with my reading of it). April 30, 1976 — Counsel for the company was served with a notice for discovery of documents and an appointment for examination for discovery of an officer of the company to be held on May 12, 1976. May 6, 1976 — Counsel for the company wrote to counsel for Anne Zelensky advising of their intention to amend the statement o claim and requesting consent to the amendments. The amendment was to add a claim for conversion of merchandise in the amount of $7,000 more or less and to add Steve Zelensky as a defendant in respect of the total of $25,000. The letter also proposed a meeting of counsel and clients to review the documentation of amounts claimed. May 11, 1976 — Counsel for Anne Zelensky replied, reviewed the proceedings to date and advised that examination for discovery had been rescheduled for June 29, 1976. May 18, 1976 — Notice of motion was filed, returnable on May 21, 1976, to compel production of documents or to have the statement of claim dismissed. The motion was adjourned sine die at the request of counsel for the company. Counsel for appellant understood that the statement of claim would be amended, amended statement of defence would be filed and examination for discovery of an officer of the company would be held on June 29, 1976. In April and May, counsel for the company furnished documents to appellant's counsel in support of the company's claim. Affidavit on production of documents was not filed. CRIMINAL December 18, 1975 — Mr. and Mrs. Zelensky were charged with defrauding the company of money and merchandise to a value of $18,000 more or less. Both were arrested and released on their own recognizance. As security, title to their house was deposited with the Court. (The title, with the consent of appellant, is now on deposit with the Registrar of this Court.) December 19, 1975 — In a related proceeding, two relatives of Mrs. Zelensky were charged with receiving stolen goods. February 3, 1976 — Accused pleaded not guilty. Preliminary hearing was scheduled for April 14 and 15, 1976. February 28, 1976 — Also in a related proceeding, a charge of fraud was laid against another relative of Mrs. Zelensky. April 1, 1976 — The Crown advised counsel that a joint charge of fraud against the five accused had been authorized and the new charge would be dealt with first at the preliminary hearing scheduled for April 14, 1976. April 7, 1976 — The joint charge was laid alleging theft of money in the amount of $18,000 \"more or less\" and merchandise in the amount of $7,000 \"more or less\". April 14, 1976 — Stay of proceedings was entered on the three charges against the three relatives, the joint charge against the five accused and the charge of fraud against Mr. and Mrs. Zelen-sky. There remained the charge against Mr. and Mrs. Zelensky of stealing \"monies to the amount of eighteen thousand dollars more or less and merchandise to the amount of seven thousand dollars more or less\". Anne and Steve Zelensky elected to be tried before Collerman, Prov.J., and pleaded guilty to that charge. After the plea of guilty had been entered, counsel for the company Mr. Labman, advised that he would be moving for an order for compensation; Crown counsel, Miss Krindle, advised the Court that the actual amount claimed to be owing to the company had not been agreed to. Counsel for accused, Mr. Ornstein, stated his position on the amounts claimed. Miss Krindle said: ... I might also indicate at this point that as between Mr. Ornstein [defence counsel] and myself, at any rate, there is no agreement as to the amount, actual amount of compensation owed. And the figure that is laid in the Information is $18,000.00 more or less but there is a considerable variance in where he stands and where I stand, and I will just appraise the Court of that fact. Mr. Ornstein said: ... Now, I simply point that out to your honour that although there is a plea of guilty to the sum of $18,000.00 more or less, merchandise to $7,000.00 more or less, in no way is that to be construed as an admission by the Defendants that they are liable in the sum of $18,000.00 and $7,000.00. It is an amount of any where between $200.00 and $25,000.00 and it is something that is to be either worked out or it can be agreed upon or it could be adjudicated on by either this Court or the Court of Queen's Bench. And I simply point out to your honour that it is a matter of a Civil suit and your honour may wish to have the Civil Court set the exact amount and we will be putting the Plaintiff to the strict proof of each item of damage which they seek. Mr. Labman, in setting out the position of the company, said: .. As I understand it, there will likely be a Pre-Sentence Report requested and the Court, in that case, will re-convene in approximately two weeks time at the time of sentence. As I look at Section 653, that is the time the person aggrieved can make the application. I am here today to indicate that would be my intention at time of sentence to make that application. I have indicated to my learned friend Mr. Ornstein that between now and the time of sentencing that we should get together and attempt to be in a position by the time we come back to the Court to say that this is the amount that is agreeable to both the accused person, who are pleading guilty, and the aggrieved corporation. And if we are to do that, then, of course, there is no problem. If we are not able to do it, then at that time, your honour may wish to hear further submissions. The Court heard a detailed submission from Crown counsel with respect to the background of the offence and how appellant had managed the thefts. The hearing was adjourned to April 29, 1976. April 29, 1976 — Pre-sentence report was filed. By agreement, the matter was further adjourned for the purpose of obtaining medical reports. Mr. Flett appeared for the company, referred to the delays on the part of counsel for appellant, and went on to deal with the questions of compensation and restitution. He said: Well, my concern, at the time of the application I will be applying under Section 653 for this amount of $18,547.07. That's the amount covered by the money orders. In addition, we will be applying for a restitution order. Now, I want to say one thing, so there won't be any confusion between Mr. Ornstein and myself and, certainly, the Court, and that is that it is my understanding in this type of application that is that we are not to embarass [sic] the Court in terms of amounts. There is no intention to do that. If your honour feels satisfied in due course that these amounts are the appropriate ones, and are not in dispute, presumably, we will have the benefit of your orders. We don't intend to place you in the position of having to make findings in terms of these amounts. I don't think that is appropriate. Counsel for Anne Zelensky denied being uncooperative. On this point Miss Krindle said: Your honour, there is just one thing that I should put on the record for the benefit of the accused and that is that if there appeared to be a dragging of the heels, on the part of counsel for the accused, between your initial demand for particulars and the time of the guilty plea, it was at the request of the Crown that that information was not turned over by way of demand for production of documents. Mr. Labman checked with me as to whether it was okay with me and I asked him to hold off until after the criminal matters were completed. So that was not any deliberate delay on the part of the counsel for Eatons. There was an exchange between the Court and counsel for the company as follows: THE COURT: Let me indicate that in view of the fact that there is a duo [sic] proceeding here, a proceeding in another Court, if it reaches that, I take the position I am not going to enter into such a hearing. MR FLETT: Quite properly so. If we are not in that position, I will instruct you whether or not that application will be made. If we are not able to resolve it, then it may well be that we will have to do that in the other proceeding. The matter was adjourned to May 27, 1976, and further adjourned to June 4, 1976. June 4, 1976 — The Crown, the accused and the company were represented at the hearing. The Court was advised that the question of quantum was still in issue. The Crown gave a further exposition of how the fraud was perpetrated and argued the question of sentence. Mr. Ornstein dealt with accused's background, touched on the question of compensation or restitution (using the terms interchangeably) and also discussed the type of sentence which might be imposed. Mr. Ornstein was asked if he had anything further to say on the subject of Mr. Labman's application for compensation but he said that he had \"exhausted\" the subject. In dealing with the question of compensation, Mr. Labman explained that statement of claim had been issued in order to get a garnishing order and because it was thought that the criminal trial was a \"considerable period of time\" away. He went on to say: ... That matter has changed, and now I submit that this Court is the appropriate Court to deal with the question of compensation and restitution. The Courts I submit, your honour, don't deal in isolation, and what happens in one building in terms of the ends of justice being different and isolated from what happens in another building. Parliament has seen fit to make provisions in the Criminal Code for situations such as this. The statement of claim, as I say, was issued only against one of the accused. It was issued in the amount of $18,564.13 relating to money orders. We are now seeking restitution and compensation against both Mr. Zelensky and Mrs. Zelensky and if this Court is prepared to make that order in the amount of $18,000.00 in terms of the compensation, that is fine. Very practically and pragmatically, your honour, sure we can proceed in Court of Queen's Bench, but to do so involves an abundant amount of time on behalf of employees of the grieved [sic] corporation, as well as an abundance of cost, which I submit for the ends of justice are not necessary. And that being the case, we are prepared to say the people have pleaded guilty to $18,000.00 in terms of dollars more or less, and are prepared to say more or less that's the amount we'll accept, whether it's $17,000.00 or $18,000.00. The statement of claim can be discontinued tomorrow. The learned trial Judge, relying on the plea of guilty and the information he had received from counsel, proceeded to make the orders of compensation and restitution. He said: ... I am becoming increasingly concerned about one particular area, and I feel that perhaps counsel are not being as cooperative in this Court as they could be. I am advised that there are 111 money orders and that these money orders bear the endorsement of the accused Zelensky and that the total amount of these money orders comes to eighteen thousand, seven hundred and some odd dollars. I am aware further, and I have heard from Mr. Labman to the effect that legitimate purchases by Zelensky amounted to a hundred and seventy some odd dollars and that proof could be made of them. I have asked on repeated occasions that counsel get together for the purpose of my being better able to deal with the application for compensation in this Court, regardless of what other application may be taken in some other forum, and there appears to have been very little in the way of cooperation, and I am referring specifically from Mr. Ornstein's office. I am faced at this point in time with evidence of all these money orders endorsed by the accused amounting to eighteen thousand plus dollars, combined with, and this cannot be overlooked, combined with a plea of guilty to an offence of theft of eighteen thousand dollars more or less, plus the certain amount of merchandise that was stolen. Now bearing that in mind, and keeping in mind completely that there is an application in another forum and there has been an application for compensation made before me in this Court, there is evidence before me in this Court to support that application. I have, short of begging counsel, I have requested time and time again for them to get together and come up with the figure which the two of them would be in agreement with, and they are no closer to agreement now than they were at the commencement, except for the fact and I say, I have before me the plea, and I have before me the evidence, and I might indicate that I have given this matter an awful lot of thought over the past few weeks and I came to the conclusion that were the matter not improved, that is had the matter not reached some finality through the cooperation of counsel, then I was going to rely on the plea of guilty to the offence of theft, combined with the information which has been provided me and I am prepared on today's date to make an order with respect to compensation. As to the amount, I will deal with that in a short while. I just feel that there has not been the degree of cooperation that should have existed in this particular matter. I just wanted that on the record. Mr. Ornstein asked if he could make a comment but the learned trial Judge said: \"Not at this point in time with respect to that\" and proceeded to impose sentences on Mr. and Mrs. Zelensky. After dealing with the question of incarceration, the learned trial Judge dealt with compensation and restitution in this way: Dealing with respect to the application for order of compensation, pursuant to the provisions of Section 653, I am satisfied that a case has been made out for such an order for compensation and I am making that order for compensation in the sum of $18,000.00. In addition, there will be an order for restitution of the recovered goods. That is the disposition of the Court ... perhaps I might indicate by the way that the order for compensation and the order for restitution of the recovered goods is with respect to both accused, that is the order is made on both. Counsel for the company advised this court that the company had intended to amend its statement of claim to include Mr. Zelen-sky as a party defendknt but when the conviction was entered against him \"there was no need to amend\". Since Mr. Zelensky has not appealed the sentence and orders against him, I say no more now about that aspect of the proceedings. Counsel for appellant argued that: (1) s. 653(1) of the Criminal Code (the basis of the order for compensation) is ultra vires the Parliament of Canada because the subject-matter is within exclusive provincial jurisdiction as a matter of \"property and civil rights\"; (2) in any event, the discretionary order for compensation was made improperly; and (3) the order for restitution (under s. 655(1)) should not have been made in view of the pending civil action, the dispute over ownership of the goods and the absence of evidence to support the order. Sections 653 and 655 read in part: 653(1) A court that convicts an accused of an indictable offence may, upon the application of a person aggrieved, at the time sentence is imposed, order the accused to pay to that person an amount by way of satisfaction or compensation for loss of or damage to property suffered by the applicant as a result of the commission of the offence of which the accused is convicted. (2) Where an amount that is ordered to be paid under subsection (1) is not paid forthwith the applicant may, by filing the order, enter as a judgment, in the superior court of the province in which the trial was held, the amount ordered to be paid, and that judgment is enforceable against the accused in the same manner as if it were a judgment rendered against the accused in that court in civil proceedings. 655(1) Where an accused is convicted of an indictable offence the court shall order that any property obtained by the commission of the offence shall be restored to the person entitled to it, if at the time of the trial the property is before the court or has been detained so that it can be immediately restored to that person under the order. Appellant's counsel did not contend that s. 655(1) is ultra vires: see Benesiewicz v. Dionne (1945), 85 C.C.C. 8, [1946] 1 D.L.R. 426, [1945] 3 W.W.R. 297; Laskin's Canadian Constitutional Law, 4th ed. (1975), p. 836 and Tremeear's Annotated Criminal Code, 6th ed. (1964), p. 1197 et seq. Constitutionality of s. 653(1) I should say at the outset that it is not enough to argue, as appellant has, that the legislation is ultra vires in that \"it dealt with `Property and Civil Rights' which are the exclusive domain of the provinces\". As Lord Atkin said in A.-G. B.C. v. A.-G. Can. et al. (1937), 67 C.C.C. 193 at p. 195, [1937] 1 D.L.R. 688 at p. 690, [1937] A.C. 368, [1937] 1 W.W.R. 317 at p. 319: The only limitation on the plenary power of the Dominion to determine what shall or shall not be criminal is the condition that Parliament shall not in the guise of enacting criminal legislation in truth and in substance encroach on any of the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92. It is no objection that it does in fact affect them. If a genuine attempt to amend the criminal law it may obviously affect previously existing civil rights. The object of an amendment of the criminal law as a rule is to deprive the citizen of the right to do that which apart from the amendment he could lawfully do. In support of the constitutional validity of s. 653(1), counsel for Attorney-General for Manitoba argued that compensation pursuant to s. 653(1) is a constituent part of the sentencing process and is in pith and substance legislation in relation to criminal law and procedure: Re Torek and The Queen (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 296, 44 D.L.R. (3d) 417, 2 O.R. (2d) 228. Counsel for Attorney-General for Canada relied on R. v. Littler (1972), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 530, 41 D.L.R. (3d) 523; Turcotte v. Gagnon, [1974] Que.P.R. 309; Torek, supra and Industrial Acceptance Corp. v. The Queen (1953), 107 C.C.C. 1, [1953] 4 D.L.R. 369, [1953] 2 S.C.R. 273. One of the difficulties in this case is the blurring of differences in meaning among \"satisfaction or compensation\" (s. 653(1)), \"restitution\" (s. 655(1)), and \"restitution or reparation\" (s. 663(2)(e)). In Littler, Loranger, J. Sess., compared the discretionary order under s. 653(1) with other examples of the \"use of such discretion\" under the Code \"such as payment of damages under probation orders, of alimony in suspended sentences, payment to dispossessed bona fide purchasers, etc.\". The learned trial Judge said at p. 555 C.C.C., p. 548 D.L.R. that: ... all these orders cover civil relief and the Court cannot see why in this particular case an order for payment by way of satisfaction or compensation for the loss suffered through the fraud committed should not be made. In Turcotte, Hugessen, A.C.J., was dealing with an application to have an order pronounced by the Court of the Sessions of the Peace entered as a judgment of the superior Court under s. 653(2) of the Code. The learned Associate Chief Justice said that, in his view [p. 317]: \"an order for restitution to the victim of a crime is not only incidental to criminal law and procedure, it may be an inherent part of the sentencing process.\" The learned Associate Chief Justice then referred to compensation orders and in the next paragraph went on to say [p. 318]: \"In my opinion, Parliament has attempted to provide for such compensation, albeit in an imperfect and partial manner, by the provisions of section 653.\" In Torek, Haines, J., dealt with an application by the accused to quash an order for satisfaction or compensation, on the ground that s. 653 is ultra vires. At p. 299 C.C.C., p. 419 D.L.R. the learned trial Judge said: I fail to see that there is any meaningful distinction between an order requiring an accused to make restitution or reparation as set out in s. 663(2)(e) and an order requiring an accused to pay by way of satisfaction or compensation as set out ins. 653(1). I refer to three differences between s. 655(1) and s. 653(1): (1) s. 653(1) uses the verb \"may\"; s. 655(1) uses the verb \"shall\"; (2) under s. 653(1) the application for satisfaction or compensation is to be made by \"a person aggrieved at the time sentence is imposed\"; there are no such limitations in s. 655(1); (3) s. 655(1) refers to property being before the Court or capable of being restored to the person entitled to it; logically there is no similar provision in s. 653(1). And see R. v. Lebansky; Kushner v. Williams et al. (1938), 70 C.C.C. 260 at p. 262, [1938] 3 D.L.R. 196 at pp. 197-8, [1938] 2 W.W.R. 247 at p. 249 (Man.C.A.), where the distinction between compensation and restitution is referred to by Prendergast, C.J.M. The distinction between an order for compensation on the one hand, and a probation order on the other, is delineated in R. v. Dashner (1973), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 139 at p. 141, 25 C.R.N.S. 340, [1974] 2 W.W.R. 11 at pp. 11-2 (B.C.C.A.), where McFarlane, J.A. (Bull, J.A., concurring), said: I think I should resist the temptation to embark on a discussion which might tend to restrict or limit the discretion which Parliament has given to the Courts by s. 663 [am. 1972, c. 13, s. 58]. I think, however, that great care should be taken to ensure that restitution or reparation will not be made a condition of a probation order unless the Court is satisfied that the convicted person is able to pay and that the circumstances come clearly within the paragraph, particularly that the amount ordered represents \"actual loss or damage sustained\". My reason for this view is that breach of a probation order is itself an offence under the Criminal Code which may involve very serious consequences. I think assistance in the task of interpretation and application of s. 663(2)(e) may be found in para. (h) which authorizes: \"(h) ... such other reasonable conditions as the court considers desirable for securing the good conduct of the accused and for preventing a repetition by him of the same offence or the commission of other offences.\" It appears that the general purpose of probation orders is to secure the good conduct of the convicted person as opposed to compensating victims of crime. The remedies available to them by ordinary civil suit and under the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act, 1972 (B.C.), c. 17, should not be over-looked: nor the difference between compensation on the one hand and restitution or reparation on the other. It should also be noted that s. 653 refers only to \"loss or damage to property\" while s. 663(2)(e) is not so limited. In Industrial Acceptance Corp. the Supreme Court of Canada dealt with the constitutionality of a provision for forfeiture under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929 (Can.), c. 49. It was held that forfeiture of an automobile used in connection with a criminal offence was intra vires. Kerwin, J. (Taschereau, J., concurring), said at p. 3 C.C.C., pp. 371-2 D.L.R., p. 275 S.C.R.: On the other question, s. 21 of the Act is, in my opinion, within the competence of Parliament as it is part and parcel of \"The Criminal Law ... including the Procedure in Criminal Matters\" which, by head (27) of s. 91 of the B.N.A. Act is within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament: A.-G. Ont. v. Hamilton St. R'y., 7 Can. C.C. 326, [1903] A.C. 524; Proprietary Articles Trade Ass'n v. A.-G. Can., [1931], 2 D.L.R. 1, A.C. 310, 55 Can. C.C. 241. The mere fact that s. 21 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act affects property and civil rights is of no concern since in pith and substance it does not attempt to invade the provin- cial legislative field. It provides for the forfeiture of property used in the commission of a criminal offence and is, therefore, legislation in relation to criminal law. But Kerwin, J., expressly excluded from his consideration those sections of the \"Criminal Code providing for forfeiture or dealing with what might be argued are civil rights\" because they were not in question upon that appeal. The question of forfeiture does not arise here. Our consideration is limited to the compensation provisions of s. 653(1). It is my conclusion that, notwithstanding the overlap in dictionary meanings of the several terms of \"reparation\", \"compen-sation\", \"satisfaction\" and \"restitution\", it is necessary to keep in mind the real distinctions enunciated by the Code. Provisions similar to those found in s. 653(1) have been part of the Code since 1892 (Can.), c. 29, s. 836. This alone, will not validate the section: Proprietary Articles Trade Ass'n v. A.-G. Can. (1931), 55 C.C.C. 241 at p. 243, [1931] 2 D.L.R. 1 at p. 3, [1931] A.C. 310 at p. 317. It must be remembered that in this case we are not considering the general power of Parliament to create new crimes, or to legislate on criminal procedure generally, or to legalize conduct or activity formerly proscribed as criminal. (See Laskin's Canadian Constitutional Law, ibid, p. 825). We have to decide whether this procedure for compensation to victims of crime is necessarily incident to effective criminal legislation. It is well established that Parliament must have wide powers over the sentencing process in order to carry out its constitutional duty in the field of criminal law. Notions of appropriate punishment change with the times: see Rand, J., in Goodyear Tire \u0026 Rubber Co. of Canada Ltd. et al. v. The Queen (1956), 114 C.C.C. 380 at p. 382, 2 D.L.R. (2d) 11 at pp. 12-3, [1956] S.C.R. 303 at p. 311. Innovative and creative use of the sentencing process is a desirable objective. But this does not obviate the necessity of examining the impugned legislation to see whether it is a valid function of the criminal law or whether it is merely an expedient conjunction of civil and criminal remedies. The question of civil remedies in relation to criminal law was considered in another context by the Supreme Court of Canada recently in MacDonald et al. v. Vapour Canada Ltd. et al. (1976), 66 D.L.R. (3d) 1, 22 C.P.R. (2d) 1, 7 N.R. 477. The Court considered the validity of s. 7(e) of the Trade Marks Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. T-10. In rejecting the argument that the particular section was legislation in relation to the criminal law within s. 91(27) of the British North America Act, 1867, Laskin, C.J.C. (Spence, Pigeon, Dickson and Beetz, JJ., concurring), said at p. 10: This last-mentioned basis of validity deserves no more than a brief statement of reasons for rejecting it. Assuming that s. 7(e) (as, indeed, the other paragraphs of s. 7) proscribe anti-social business practices, and are thus enforceable under the general criminal sanction of s. 115 of the Criminal Code respecting disobedience of a federal statute, the attempt to mount the civil remedy of s. 53 of the Trade Marks Act on the back of the Criminal Code proves too much, certainly in this case. The principle which would arise from such a result would provide an easy passage to valid federal legislation to provide and govern civil relief in respect of numerous sections of the Criminal Code and would, in the light of the wide scope of the federal criminal law power, debilitate provincial legislative authority and the jurisdiction of provincial Courts so as to transform our constitutional arrangements on legislative power beyond recognition. It is surely unnecessary to go into detail on such an extravagant posture. This Court's judgment in Goodyear Tire \u0026 Rubber Co. of Canada Ltd. et al. v. The Queen (1956), 25 C.P.R. 1, 2 D.L.R. (2d) 11, [1956] S.C.R. 303, upholding the validity of federal legislation authorizing the issue of prohibitory order in connection with a conviction of a combines offence, illustrates the preventive side of the federal criminal law power to make a conviction effective. It introduced a supporting sanction in connection with the prosecution of an offence. It does not, in any way, give any encouragement to federal legislation which, in a situation unrelated to any criminal proceedings, would authorize independent civil proceedings for damages and an injunction. The compensation order under s. 653(1) arises during the course of criminal proceedings (at the time sentence is imposed) and, thus, does not suffer the disability referred to in the last sentence of the above passage. I do not cite this judgment as authority for holding s. 653 as ultra vires. In my view, it has relevance in indicating that, granted the wide federal powers in relation to criminal law and procedure, there are still constitutional limitations in the exercise of that power. It is argued that since the order for compensation is part of the sentencing process it must be valid legislation in the field of criminal law: see Re Torek and the Queen (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 296, at p. 298, 44 D.L.R. (3d) 417 at p. 418, 2 O.R. (2d) 228, and Turcotte v. Gagnon, [1974] Que.P.R. 309 at p. 318. In my view, such an order is part of the sentence, at least for purposes of determining rights of appeal. Support for this view may be found in cases decided under the former Code when the definition of sentence was (R.S.C. 1927, c. 36, s. 1012(e)): \"sentence\" includes any order of the trial court made on conviction with reference to the person convicted or his wife or children. The question of the right of appeal from such an order came before the Court in R. v. Graves; R. v. Rose (1950), 97 C.C.C. 16, [1950] O.W.N. 238, 9 C.R. 365 (Ont. C.A.). It was held, following R. v. Jones, [1929] 1 K.B. 211, that an order for compensation under s. 1048 of the 1927 Code was part of the sentence and appealable to the Court of Appeal. In my view, the matter is now put beyond doubt,under the present Code, s. 601 [am. 1974-75-76, c. 93, s. 72]. That section reads in part: \"sentence\" includes ... an order made under ... section 653 ... But merely saying that a compensation order is part of the sentencing process does not mean that the legislation is necessarily valid, constitutionally. The Court must still decide the crucial question: whether authorization of such an order is a valid exercise of constitutional authority in respect of the sentencing process and, thus, of the power in relation to criminal law and procedure. There are reported decisions where the constitutional validity of s. 653 was assumed, e.g., R. v. Scherstabitqf, [1963] 2 C.C.C. 208, 39 C.R. 233, 40 W.W.R. 575. It should be noted, parenthetically, that in the report of the judgment found in Western Weekly Reports and Criminal Reports, DesBrisay, C.J.B.C., is quoted as saying: I think the Court is against you on both points: The matter is, as you will observe, a provision in the Criminal Code which enables the Court to order compensation to be made. It then becomes an enforcement on the civil side. I think it is perfectly clear that the definition of the word \"sentence\" in s. 628(1) is placed there for the purpose of enabling an appeal to be taken on such an order as this, which is a discretionary order which might otherwise have been said not to have been appealable. Apart from that, I do not think that it is not part of the sentence. It is not as though he fined him as well. (Emphasis mine.) But in the report in Canadian Criminal Cases, the learned Chief Justice is reported as saying: \"Apart from that, I do not think that it is part of the sentence.\" (Emphasis mine.) In an early Manitoba decision, R. v. Cohen and Miller (1922), 38 C.C.C. 334, [1923] 1 D.L.R. 687, [1922] 3 W.W.R. 1126, Perdue, C.J.M., in an obiter dictum, said that matters dealt with under the Code relating to \"costs, pecuniary compensation and restitution of stolen property\" seemed to be \"incidental to the exclusive legislative authority of Parliament over criminal law and procedure in criminal cases\". None of these cases are authority for holding that s. 653 is intra vires. With respect, I do not agree with Tarek, where Haines, J., said at p. 299: I might also note that, in my opinion, the argument that the procedure set out in s. 653 deprives an accused of his right to make a full defence is not entirely correct. It should be noted that the section applies to indictable offences only, and therefore, unless the accused exercises his rights and elects a summary trial, he is entitled to a preliminary hearing. At this preliminary hearing he can get discovery as broad or broader than he could in a civil action, because he is entitled to cross-examine the complainant. An accused's right to make a full defence should not depend on the kind of trial he elects to have. He may have a very good reason for electing to have a summary trial. Having done so, he should not be left without any of the procedures now available to a defendant in a civil action to get at the basis of a plaintiff's claim. During the course of a criminal trial it is not the aggrieved party who is in contest with the accused. It, surely, is the Crown, representing the public interest. In a criminal trial, there are no plead-ings; there is no right to an affidavit on production of documents; in general, there is no organized system of procedure available to the accused. There is also the difficult question of whether an accused should testify; different considerations would govern civil as opposed to criminal cases. Assuming there is a preliminary hearing, the accused may be in a slightly better position but again not anywhere near an equivalent position to a civil suit defendant. The Crown is not obliged to introduce all its evidence at a preliminary hearing. The sole purpose of the preliminary inquiry is to satisfy the Court that there is sufficient evidence to put the accused on trial: see Caccamo v. The Queen (1975), 21 C.C.C. (2d) 257 at p. 275, 54 D.L.R. (3d) 685 at p. 703, 29 C.R.N.S. 78 at p. 97 (S.C.C.). As well, on a theft charge, the Crown need only prove a theft over $200 in order to qualify the offence as falling within the provisions of s. 294. Even assuming that it is considered an accused has sufficient rights of discovery on a preliminary hearing, the criminal law should not force an accused into a particular kind of election in order that he might obtain information about the case against him in respect of a possible compensation order. In my view, there is, under s. 653(1), a serious deprivation of an accused's right to defend himself against allegations of loss or damage to property. The section may well effectively deprive an accused of the opportunity of making a full answer and defence. It would be stretching the meaning of \"punishment\" or \"sanction\" to include an order under the section. In R. v. Rogers (No. 2) (1972), 6 C.C.C. (2d) 107, 17 C.R.N.S. 294, 2 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 371, although the constitutional point was not in issue, there is a relevant comment by Trainor, C.J. At p. 116 C.C.C., p. 305 C.R.N.S., he said: I do not think such an order can strictly be said to be in the way of punishment for a crime committed. In the case at bar it merely prevents the respondent from profiting in full by the amount of money which he has stolen. Indeed, in that respect, he still gets away easy, because according to the trial Judge's statement to the jury, the total amount stolen was probably in the vicinity of $50,000. That being so, I would not consider the order as actually inflicting punishment upon the respondent, but merely as saving the injured parties from the necessity of bringing civil actions against him. No doubt compensating victims of crime is a worthy goal. And I agree with the statement by Haines, J., in Torek, that it is a valid object in sentencing \"to prevent a convicted criminal from profiting from his crime by serving a jail term and then keeping the gains of his illegal venture.\" But the two objectives do not need to be tied together. Prevention of profit by a criminal can be dealt with by fines scaled to the magnitude of the offence. There are means of compensating victims of crime now available. There are other constitutionally valid ways of accomplishing this purpose. The point is, that a compensation order which is invalid, as an unwarranted invasion of provincial jurisdiction, does not become valid because of the objective in preventing a criminal from profiting from his crime. In my view, the section is not legislation in truth and substance in relation to criminal law and procedure, is not necessarily incidental to effective legislation by Parliament, and cannot be supported under s. 91(27). It falls within the category delineated by Lord Atkin in A.-G. B.C. v. A.-G. Can. et al. (1937), 67 C.C.0 193, [1937] 1 D.L.R. 688, [1937] 1 A.C. 368, [1937] 1 W.W.R. 317, as legislation which, in the guise of enacting criminal legislation, in truth and substance, encroaches on a class of subjects enunciated in s. 92, i.e., civil rights. In my opinion, the section is an unauthorized invasion of provincial jurisdiction and is ultra vires Parliament. I will deal with the other two points of appeal together. Compensation and Restitution Appellant's counsel argued that it had been understood that the guilty plea of Mrs. Zelensky was \"qualified\". Generally, a plea of guilty would constitute an admission of all of the essential ingredients of the offence: Tremeear's, supra, p. 1504. But there are special circumstances in the case at bar. Here, the Crown charged theft of moneys to the amount of $18,000 \"more or less\" and theft of merchandise to the amount of $7,000 \"more or less\". Zelenskys were on the horns of a dilemma. They wished to plead guilty but they did not acknowledge the extent of the liability which was alleged by the Crown and the company. Counsel for appellant advised this Court that, until the last day of hearings before the learned Provincial Court Judge, the Zel-enskys were under the impression that the civil proceedings would resolve the dispute. There is some support on the record for their thinking so. Neither the Crown nor the company called any evidence. It is true that proceedings during the course of sentencing are more informal than that part of a trial dealing with guilt or innocence. A trial Judge will often act upon statements made by counsel for the Crown or by the accused, particularly in dealing with the circumstances of the offender. The same situation will apply on a guilty plea where counsel will outline circumstances of the offence. Generally, there could not be any objection to this procedure where essential facts are not in dispute. Here, notwithstanding the guilty plea, there were matters which were very much in dispute and which were understood to be so from the beginning. In my view, it was not a case which would justify reliance merely on a plea of guilty and information from counsel. I said earlier in these reasons that, in my view, s. 653(1) is ultra vires. But, assuming it is intra vires an order for compensation should only be made with restraint and with caution, notwithstanding the efficiency of disposing of all matters in one proceeding. The same reasoning applies to an order for restitution. In this case, it seems that convenience for the company assumed inordinate importance. Although the statutory provisions in England are more elaborate, there is a useful comment on this subject in the case of R. v. Church (1970), 55 Cr.App.R. 65. There, the question of restitution was before the Court. Sachs, L.J., said at pp. 72-73: It only remains to emphasise what has been stated in FERGUSON (1970) 54 Cr.App.R. 410; [1970] 1 W.W.R. 1246. There the Court referred to STAMP V UNITED DOMINION TRUST [1967] 1 Q.B. 418, decided under the Larceny Act 1916, and went onto state that the same principles as to how the Court's discretion should be exercised should be maintained, saying: \"If there is any doubt at all as to whether the money or goods in question belong to a third party, the criminal courts are not the correct forum in which that issue should be decided It is only in the plainest cases when there can be no doubt that the jurisdiction shall be exercised.\" That applies equally well to cases such as the one now before the Court: it is to be emphasised that this summary jurisdiction cannot appropriately be exercised where the matter is one which would mare properly be litigated under the procedure, including discovery, available in a civil court.\" (Emphasis mine.) And see R. v. Dashner (1973), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 139 at p. 141, 25 C.R.N.S. 340, [1974] 2 W.W.R. 11, at p. 13, where the Court approved the following quotation from R. v. Stewart, [1968] 4 C.C.C. 54 at p. 57, 63 W.W.R. 442 at p. 445: \"It must be remembered, however, that it is most important that the sanctions of the criminal law and its administration should not be used, or be permitted to appear to be used, for the purpose of enforcing civil obligations.\" Counsel for the Crown said, in this Court, that possibly the learned Provincial Court Judge was frustrated because counsel had not come to agreement on the matters in dispute. This is not a justification for making an order for compensation or restitution. Courts are provided to decide disputes where parties cannot agree. In my view, it is improper to use the powers of the criminal process as a means of enforcing a financial settlement. In my respectful view, in light of the circumstances outlined above, the learned trial Judge was wrong in exercising his discretion in making an order under s. 653(1) and was wrong in ordering restitution under s. 655(1). If it should turn out that appellant's claims are frivolous, the Court of Queen's Bench can take care of that matter by its power to award costs against an unsuccessful party, and by its power to allow interest to a successful party where payment of a just debt has been improperly withheld. I would, accordingly, allow the appeal from the grant of orders for compensation and restitution and set the orders aside. I mentioned earlier that Mr. Zelensky has not appealed. If he should apply for leave I would be inclined to grant it so as to effect the same result for him. The goods recovered shall remain in the custody of the police and the certificate of title shall remain with the Court pending final disposition of the civil proceedings commenced by the company. O'SULLIVAN, J.A.:—I concur with the reasons for judgment of my brother Matas and desire to add only a few words of my own in view of the importance of the question before us. The distinction between civil injuries and criminal acts was well known to the framers of the British North America Act, 1867. The distinction is discussed in Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England (1809), Book III, 15th ed., p. 2 and Book IV, p. 6. It is the consequence which distinguishes a crime from a tort. The example given by Blackstone in Book IV at p. 6, that of a battery, shows that the same act can be both a crime and a tort. Considered as a crime, battery is visited with penal sanctions; considered as a tort, battery gives rise to a right of action in damages. What Parliament has purported to do by s. 653(1) of the Criminal Code is to confer on the victim of a crime a right of action in damages against the wrongdoer. Such right of action arises on sentence and contemplates a lis between the victim and the wrongdoer and directs that the lis may be determined by a provin-cially appointed Judge without any of the ancillary procedures for discovery and issue determination that civil Courts normally have. The right thus purported to be given to a victim of crime is a civil right. What s. 653(1) purports to do is to treat an act not only as a public wrong or crime but also as a civil injury. In my opinion, this is beyond the power of Parliament. I do not say that Parliament cannot impose punishments which may result in benefit to victims of crime. It is well settled that fines and other monetary penalties may be directed to be paid for the benefit of others besides the Crown: see Toronto v. The King (1931), 56 C.C.C. 273, [1932] 1 D.L.R. 161, [1932] A.C. 98, [1931] 3 W.W.R. 698. I see no reason why such monetary penalties cannot be directed to be paid for the benefit of victims of crime as well as for the benefit of a city. However, in imposing a pecuniary penalty, even if it were to result ultimately in a benefit to the victim, the Court would still be imposing a penal sanction and would have regard to the nature of the wrong, the circumstances of its commission and the circumstances of the wrongdoer. The pecuniary penalty would be punishment; any compensation to a victim would flow from the imposition of the penalty. The vice of s. 653, in my opinion, is that it does not regard the payment of an amount equivalent to damage done by a criminal as part of a punishment which will vary with the circumstances of the offence and the offender. It seeks to confer directly on the victim of a crime a right to claim compensation from the wrongdoer. The section, if valid, would confer on the victim of a crime an additional and alternative civil right to sue in a criminal Court for that for which he already has the right to sue in a civil Court. In my opinion, this constitutes an invasion of the field of property and civil rights and is beyond the powers of Parliament. I do not refer to any cases because they have been dealt with by my brother Matas with whose reasons I fully concur. Appeal allowed."}

G.S.T.Date: 1992-01-03Docket: 1990 No. 120Between:Her Majesty the Queen (Appellant)andG.S.T. (Respondent)Gushue, Mahoney and O'Neill, JJ.A.Counsel:Wayne Gorman, for the appellant;Ted Goodridge, for the respondent.[1]Gushue, J.A.: [G.S.T.] was convicted in Supreme Court at St.\nJohn's by Justice Leo Barry of the offence of indecent assault, contrary to s.\n149(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, and of sexual\nassault, contrary to s. 246.1(1)(a) of the Code. Both offences are now\nencompassed by s. 271 of the Code as amended in 1985.[2]Following the convictions, the respondent was sentenced to 14\ndays' imprisonment on the indecent assault charge and to a consecutive term of\none month's imprisonment on the sexual assault charge. The Crown has appealed\nboth these sentences on the grounds of inadequacy.[3]The complainants were step-children of the respondent. The sexual\nassaults, which involved the 13 year old step-son of the respondent, occurred\non four occasions over a one month period at the family home. On each occasion,\nthe respondent was wrestling or playing with the complainant and dropped ice\ncubes down his pyjamas. The respondent then said to the complainant that\ninasmuch as he had made his penis cold he would warm it up for him. The\nrespondent fondled the complainant's genitals and sucked his penis. The\ncomplainant stated that he attempted to get away on each occasion but was held\ndown by the respondent.[4]The indecent assault offence happened on two different occasions,\nalso in the family home. The complainant was the respondent's step-daughter,\naged 7. On each occasion, the respondent, wearing only a bathrobe, held her\ndown on her stomach and tied her hands with the cord of the bathrobe on the\npretext of massaging her back and playing. On both occasions, the respondent\nlifted her nightgown and lay on top of the complainant with his bathrobe open\nand she felt his penis close to her vagina.[5]There was no violence during the commission of any of these offences\nand the force used was as stated above.[6]The respondent denied at trial that any of these incidents\noccurred and apparently still maintains his innocence.[7]The position taken by the Crown is that the sentences imposed by\nthe trial judge were manifestly inadequate, particularly where such serious\noffences were committed by a person standing in the position of a parent.\nCounsel for the respondent took the position that these were isolated incidents\nin an otherwise normal parent-child relationship with the two complainants and\nthat, further, the sentence should not be disturbed inasmuch as the jail term\nimposed by the trial judge has long since been served and some 16 months have\npassed since the date of the convictions and sentencing.[8]This court has on occasion expressed a reluctance to return a\nperson to jail where a sentence has been served, where a considerable period of\ntime has passed between that time and the hearing of the appeal, and where the\noffender has made a genuine effort at his own rehabilitation. Even though the\ncourt may have felt at times that a sentence was inadequate, certain such\ncircumstances could make it counterproductive to take a person \"off the\nstreets\" and return him to jail. I speak here not only of the best\ninterests of the offender, but, as well, of society as a whole.[9]That direction, however, is normally followed only in\nproperty-related offences and not when the court is dealing with offences\ndirected against persons as in the case at bar. While rehabilitation cannot\never be completely overlooked, it is not a factor in the present case because\nthe respondent still denies having committed the offences.[10]The sexual abuse committed by the respondent on the complainants\nwhich, while not violent, did involve the application of force, and was most\nserious indeed. That seriousness is exacerbated by the fact of the parent-child\nrelationship which existed between the respondent and the complainants. There\nis perhaps nothing more offensive to right-thinking members of society than the\nsubjecting of young children to sexual abuse by a person who has control and\ndomination over them and against whom they have no real defence. That distaste\nis reflected by the courts in their sentencing of such offenders, the principal\nof deterrence, both specific and general, being of prime importance. That\nprecept has been expressed many times by this court and others.[11]The gravity of the offences here is such that they should have\nattracted a much higher prison term than that imposed by the trial judge. The\nsentence he imposed is inordinately low and must be set aside. Further, the\nimportance of setting a proper term must override any concern we might feel for\nreturning the respondent to prison.[12]In our view a fit sentence for the sexual assault would be a\nperiod of eight months' imprisonment and for the indecent assault on the female\ncomplainant a further consecutive sentence of four months. Were it not for the\nlengthy delay between sentencing and the bringing of the matter before the\ncourt (which delay, it should be added, was institutional delay), it may well\nhave been higher.[13]Leave to appeal is granted. The sentences are varied accordingly\nfor a total period of 12 months' imprisonment. That sentence will be decreased\nby the one month and two weeks' sentence imposed at trial. Appeal allowed."}

Mandelcorn for the appellant)Respondent))Gillian\nRoberts for the respondent- and -))GARY ELWOOD NICHOL))Appellant)Heard:June 23, 1995)OSBORNE J.A. :Upon his arraignment, the appellant pleaded guilty to a\ncharge that he \"...did break and enter a certain place, to wit:the\ndwelling-house situated at 17 Bowden Street and did commit therein the\nindictable offence of aggravated assault contrary to the Criminal Code.\"Following his plea of guilty the appellant was convicted by His Honour Judge\nPorter and sentenced to a term of imprisonment for five years.The trial judge\nalso made an order under s. 741.2 of the Criminal Code increasing the\nappellant's parole ineligibility to one-half of the sentence imposed, that is,\nto two and one-half years.The appellant appeals his sentence.The appellant raises three issues.They are:1.The fitness of his five year\ncustodial sentence.2.Whether in the circumstances the\ntrial judge was correct in law in making an order under s. 741.2 of the Criminal\nCode increasing the appellant's parole ineligibility.3.Whether, in all of the\ncircumstances, that part of the sentence increasing the appellant parole\nineligibility period was fit.THE\nFACTSIdo not propose to review the facts in great detail.It\nwill be sufficient to note that the facts read into evidence in support of the\nappellant's guilty plea are not in dispute.In May 1994 the appellant was\nseparated from his wife.The tragic events of May 21, 1994 began some time\nearlier when the appellant became aware of the fact that his wife was having an\naffair with another man, Roberto Andurray.The appellant and his wife had\nattempted therapy to salvage their marriage but it was unsuccessful.The\nappellant believed that his wife was controlled by Mr. Andurray.In due course\nthe appellant and his wife separated.The appellant sought a reconciliation.On May 20, 1994, having received Mr. Andurray's permission, the appellant\narranged to meet his wife so that they could attend a movie together.The\nappellant's wife did not appear.In result, the appellant proceeded to 17\nBowden Street, a house in Toronto which contained a number of apartments\nincluding a room occupied by Mr. Andurray.He said that his purpose in going\nto 17 Bowden Street was to ask Mr. Andurray \"...to leave my family alone\n...\".When the appellant saw his wife's purse at 17 Bowden Street\nhe ran out of the residence and cried for about half an hour.He then\nproceeded to retrieve some acid that he said he had thrown away some two weeks\nearlier.He took the acid with him and returned to 17 Bowden and hid in a\ncloset.He explained the purpose of his actions in respect of the acid by\nsaying he wanted to \"make him afraid and that he wouldn't attack\nme\".When he returned to 17 Bowden Street he said he expected to\nencounter his wife and Mr. Andurray.Shortly after 1:00 a.m., Mr. Andurray and the appellant's\nwife returned to 17 Bowden Street.Mr. Andurray undressed and lay on the bed.The appellant's wife stood beside the bed.At that point the appellant lost\ncontrol, came out of the bedroom closet and sprayed Mr. Andurray with the\nconcentrated sulphuric acid.The acid came into contact with Mr. Andurray's\nchest, legs, arms and genitals.During the assault the appellant was in an\nenraged state.He yelled he wanted to burn Mr. Andurray so that the\nappellant's wife would not love him any more.Upon being sprayed with the sulphuric acid, Mr. Andurray ran\nfrom the bedroom.The appellant chased him and continued to spray his back.Eventually, Mr. Andurray locked himself inside the bathroom.The\nappellant kicked the bathroom door open and sprayed more sulphuric acid on Mr.\nAndurray.Mr. Andurray collapsed on the bathroom floor and the appellant ran\nfrom the house. The appellant's wife called the police, who in short order\narrested the appellant who quickly confessed.During the incident the appellant's wife received\nsuperficial burns, as did the appellant.Both the appellant and Mr. Andurray\nwere taken to hospital for treatment.The evidence discloses that Mr. Andurray\nsuffered third-degree burns to his neck, face, chest, back, arms, and genitals.On May 27, 1994, he underwent surgery during which split thickness skin grafts\nwere harvested from his left thigh and applied to his chest area.The grafts\nwere successful and Mr. Andurray was released from hospital on June 6, 1994.At the time of sentencing, on September 14, 1994, Mr. Andurray was still\nundergoing some medical treatment.THE\nREASONS FOR SENTENCEThe trial judge noted that the appellant had no criminal\nrecord and that he had had a disturbing upbringing.He took account of the\nbrutality of the assault, the permanent consequences to the victim, and the\nfact that the appellant's assaultive behaviour was planned some two weeks\nbefore he broke into Mr. Andurray's residence and assaulted him.The trial judge also concluded that the appellant was\nremorseful and that as an aspect of his remorse he had pleaded guilty.As\nstated, he sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for five years.He also\nmade an order under s. 100 of the Criminal Code that the appellant be\nbanned from possessing any firearm, ammunition or explosive substance for\nlife.No issue is taken with the s. 100 order.After imposing the s. 100\norder the trial judge made an order under s. 741.2 of the Criminal Code.In\ndoing so, he said:\"...because of the brutality of this matter, I ask and\norder that at least one-half of his sentence be served before he is considered\neligible for parole.\"We did not call upon Crown counsel to respond to the issue\nwhether the sentence of five years imprisonment was fit.In my view the\nsentence was fit when it was imposed and is fit now.I turn, therefore, to the\nissues of the court's jurisdiction to make an order under s.741.2 and, assuming\njurisdiction, the fitness of the parole ineligibility order.The s.\n741.2 OrderSection 741.2 of the Criminal Code provides:Notwithstanding\nsubsection 120(1) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, where\nan offender is sentenced, after the coming into force of this section, to a\nterm of imprisonment of two years or more on conviction for one or more\noffences set out in Schedules I and II to that Act that were prosecuted by way\nof indictment, the court may, if satisfied, having regard to the circumstances\nof the commission of the offences and the character and circumstances of the\noffender, that the expression of society's denunciation of the offences or the\nobjective of specific or general deterrence so requires, order that the portion\nof the sentence that must be served before the offender may be released on full\nparole is one half of the sentence or ten years, whichever is less.Section 741.2 refers to the offences set out in Schedules I\nand II of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992,\nc. 20.\"Conviction\" of one of those listed offences is a condition\nprecedent to making a parole ineligibility order under s. 741.2.The appellant was convicted of the offence established by s.\n348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.The offence of breaking and entering and\ncommitting an indictable offence, as established by s. 348(1)(b), is not a\nlisted offence for the purposes of s. 741.2.It is not listed either by\nsection reference or verbal description.It follows, therefore, that it was\nnot open to the trial judge to make an order under s. 741.2 extending the appellant's\nparole ineligibility period.This conclusion is consistent with the Quebec\nCourt of Appeal's decision in R. v. Prince, [1994] A.Q. 271 and the\nNewfoundland Court of Appeal's decision in R. v. Semigak, [1995] N.J.\n22.I note that access to s. 741.2 could have been achieved in\nthis case had the information set out two counts; break and enter, and\naggravated assault.Had the appellant been convicted of aggravated assault,\nthe \"conviction\" requirement of s. 741.2 would have been\nsatisfied.Moreover, if Parliament wishes to extend the ambit of s. 741.2\nto secondary offences, as in this case, it can of course do so.In any case, although the offence of which the appellant was\nconvicted was serious and one which caused permanent injuries to the victim,\nMr. Andurray, the appellant is a first offender who received a substantial\ncustodial sentence.When he sentenced the appellant, the trial judge did not\nhave the benefit of this court's judgment in R. v. Goulet (1995), 1995 CanLII 1198 (ON CA), 22\nO.R. (3d) 118.In that case Griffiths J.A., at pp. 124-25, commented on\napplication of s. 741.2 in these terms:In my view,\ns. 741.2 should only be invoked as an exceptional measure where the Crown has\nsatisfied the court on clear evidence that an increase in the parole\nineligibility is \"required\".There should be articulable reasons for\ninvoking s. 741.2 and, as suggested in R. v. Dankyi, supra, the\ntrial judge should give clear and specific reasons for the increase in parole\nineligibility....The distinguishing\ncharacteristics of the offender may provide more fruitful grounds for invoking\ns. 741.2 as an exceptional measure.Where the Crown has adduced clear evidence\nthat the offender will not be deterred or rehabilitated within the normal\nperiod of parole ineligibility, an order under s. 741.2 will be appropriate.A\nhistory of prior parole violations, or violations of other forms of conditional\nrelease, or evidence that significant prior custodial sentences have had little\nimpact would be appropriate factors to consider in applying s. 741.2.In this case, there is nothing to suggest that the appellant\nwill not be deterred or rehabilitated within the normal period of parole\nineligibility, having in mind the five year sentence that he is serving.Accordingly, I think it was not appropriate in this case for the trial judge to\nhave resorted to s. 741.2.DISPOSITIONFor these reasons, leave to appeal sentence is allowed and\nthe sentence varied so as to delete that part of the trial judge's order\nrequiring that the appellant serve one-half of his sentence before being\neligible for parole.C19846COURT OF\nAPPEAL FOR ONTARIOMcKINLAY, CATZMAN and\nOSBORNE JJ.A.B E T W E E N :HER MAJESTY THE QUEENRespondent- and -GARY ELWOOD NICHOLAppellantJ\nU D G M E N TReleased:"}

Cho, 2017 ONCA 723DATE: 20170918DOCKET: C60076Watt, Epstein and Brown JJ.A.BETWEENHer Majesty the QueenRespondentandQuen Hao ChoAppellantJanani Shanmuganathan, for the\nappellantHannah Freeman, for the respondentHeard and released orally:\nSeptember 7, 2017On appeal from the conviction entered on\nDecember 29, 2014 and on appeal from the sentence imposed on February 2, 2015\nby Justice Thomas P. Cleary of the Ontario Court of Justice, sitting without a\njury.REASONS FOR DECISION[1]After a single witness trial the appellant was\nconvicted of assault with a weapon and two counts of sexual assault.Each\ncount related to the same complainant, a person with whom the appellant had an\nintermittent relationship.[2]The day following the second sexual assault, the\ncomplainant went to a police station.At first, she complained of sexual\nharassment and sought a no contact order against the appellant. Over time, she\nreturned to the police station with a more fulsome account of her allegations,\nincluding two instances of forced sexual intercourse, several months apart.[3]The appellant appeals his convictions and seeks\nleave to appeal the sentence of 51 months in the penitentiary imposed by the\ntrial judge.[4]The appellant advances a single ground of appeal\nagainst conviction. He says that the trial judge erred by reversing the onus of\nproof by finding guilt established on the basis of his rejection of the defence\nsubmissions without going on to consider whether the evidence as a whole\nestablished the appellant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.[5]We do not give effect to this ground of appeal.[6]In our view, when the reasons for judgment are\nread as a whole, as they must be, they reveal no reversal of the burden of\nproof.[7]This was a one witness case. The relevant issue\nfor the trial judge to decide was whether the whole of the complainant’s\nevidence met the standard of proof required of the Crown in a criminal case or\nfell short of the mark. The trial judge outlined and rejected the defence\nattacks on the credibility of the complainant and the reliability of her\nevidence.[8]Without more, addressing and rejecting defence\nsubmissions about the credibility of the complainant and the reliability of her\nevidence does not amount to reversal of the burden of proof. Further, the\nreasons demonstrate the trial judge’s correct understanding of the presumption\nof innocence and the burden and standard of proof. While the reasons could have\nbeen clearer and better delivered in one piece rather than in two instalments,\nwe are satisfied that they sufficiently explain why the trial judge\ndecided the case as he did.[9]We are further satisfied that the trial judge\ndid not err in rejecting the defence submissions that the manner in which the\ncomplainant disclosed the offences to the police undermined her credibility and\nthe reliability of her evidence.These findings represent inferences that the\ntrial judge drew from primary facts. They were inferences that were available\nfor him to draw.That he might have drawn other inferences is beside the point.\nHe didn’t. And that he didn’t does not make the inferences he drew unavailable\nor wrong.They were available and are entitled to deference in this court.[10]While we do not agree that the failure to embellish her account of\nthe instances of which she testified was a factor that enhanced the\ncomplainant’s credibility or the reliability of her evidence, we prefer to view\nthis comment as more a characterization of the straight forward manner in which\nthe complainant testified at trial.[11]The appeal from conviction is dismissed.[12]On the appeal from sentence, the appellant says that the sentence\nimposed by the trial judge violates the principles of totality and restraint.[13]The appellant acknowledges that the individual sentences imposed by\nthe trial judge on the convictions of sexual assault fall at the lower end of\nthe range of fit sentences for their offences.Further, the appellant takes no\nissue that consecutive sentences were appropriate in this case.[14]This case bristles with aggravating factors. The number of sexual\nassaults committed.Their demeaning and degrading nature. The fact that the\nparties were in a domestic relationship. The extent of the physical violence,\nthe evidence of planning. And the significant impact of the offences on the\ncomplainant.[15]In our view, the sentences imposed reflect no error in principle; no\nimproper emphasis on any relevant factor; and no failure to consider any\nrelevant or consideration of an irrelevant factor. The total sentence imposed\nin our view was fit.[16]Leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal from sentence is\ndismissed.“David Watt J.A.”\n“Gloria Epstein J.A.”\n“David Brown J.A.”"}

R.C.Date: 1996-10-21Jerome Kennedy, for the Appellant;Wayne Gorman, for the Respondent.(1988 No. 166)October 21, 1996.[1]Steele, J.A.: The appellant was charged with three counts of sexual assault (s.\n246.1(1)(a)) against his three children: S. age 10 years, A. age eight years\nand L. age six years. The charge in respect to S. was dismissed but convictions\nrecorded on the other two counts. Following the convictions Crown counsel gave\nnotice of an application to have the appellant declared a dangerous offender\npursuant to s. 688 (now s. 753) of the Criminal Code. The appellant was\ndeclared a dangerous offender and an indeterminate sentence was imposed [see 1988 CanLII 5484 (NL SCTD), 71\nNfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 332; 220 A.P.R. 332]. This appeal is from the two\nconvictions and the sentence to detention in a penitentiary for an\nindeterminate period.Convictions\n- Sexual Assault[2]The sexual assaults against the three children\nof the appellant are alleged to have occurred between the first day of August,\n1987 and the 24th day of October, 1987. At the date of the trial, June of 1988,\nthe appellant was 31 years of age.[3]P.C. stated that some five to six years after\ntheir separation and divorce the appellant started telephoning and writing her\nrequesting permission to visit to see the children. She said that in August\n1987 she telephoned the respondent informing him that he could come home. It\nwas during that period, August to October 1987, that the sexual assaults\nallegedly occurred.[4]P.C. testified that after the appellant returned\nhome to reside with his family in St. John’s, at first he seemed “pretty good\nwith the kids” but their behaviour soon changed in that they would not talk to\nher and he would not permit them to do their homework with her. She said that\ntheir school work “started to go down” and the children were “withdrawing into\nthemselves”. She said that A. had a lot of nightmares. It appears that there\nwas no bed for the appellant to sleep in. For some unknown reason P.C. did not\nlike sleeping in the bedroom upstairs and both slept on separate couches\ndownstairs. P.C. stated that the appellant did not physically abuse her after\nhis return to St. John’s.[5]P.C. testified that she telephoned the appellant\nfrom a neighbour’s house asking him to leave; she was “afraid to tell R.C. to\nleave face to face because I was afraid I was going to get beat up”, as he had\ndone before. She said that because the children stopped talking to her - became\nwithdrawn - she “knew something was going on … and decided she had to do\nsomething”. She consulted her family doctor, a Dr. Doucet. As a result of his\nconsultation with the children, and particularly A., Dr. Doucet contacted the\nChild Welfare authorities. Following an investigation by the police the appellant\nwas charged on November 24,1987 with three counts of sexual assault.[6]A., nine years old at the date of the trial,\ntestified that “the appellant touched him on the penis, smacked his bum with\nhis hand and a stick, and put his finger in his bum”. A. also stated that the\nappellant “kissed him on the back of the neck and on the bum”. He also\nindicated that his father had touched him on the “private parts” while in the\nshower. A. said that his father told him not to tell his mother anything.[7]At the date of the trial the appellant’s\ndaughter, S. was 11 years of age. She testified that the appellant “touched her\nin places she did not want to be touched … the touching took place inside her\nclothing”. When asked in what places she meant she stated it was the breasts.\nWhen asked what she would do on the occasions in question she replied “I would\ntry and pull away”. S. also stated that sometimes the appellant would tickle or\npinch her bum in a teasing fashion but that sometimes it was not teasing. She\nsaid she did not ask him to stop because she was afraid. She described the\ntouching of her breasts as happening “often”. S. described the feeling of her\nbreasts by her father as “sometimes … like he was playing around”. She would\nask him to let her go, and that “he’d just hold on to my wrists tight”.[8]At the date of the trial the appellant’s\ndaughter L. was seven years of age. The examination-in-chief of L. was\nobviously an arduous experience. Her evidence was that on one occasion the\nappellant, lying on her bed, had pulled her nightdress up and put his hand on\nher “flower” (vagina) and that his hand was moving.[9]The trial judge gave an oral judgment stating in\npart as follows:S.“… I have some doubt as to whether that\nsexual assault occurred based on the evidence presented on that count and I\nresolve that doubt in favour of the accused and dismiss that charge …”A.“I find that the Crown had proven that\ncharge beyond a reasonable doubt, and I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the accused sexually assaulted A. by touching his penis in the shower as\nwell as in the living room, inserting his finger in A.’s rectum, touching his\nbehind and also kissing him on his behind …”L.“… Again having regard to the evidence\nand the test as applied by the Supreme Court of Canada, I find that the Crown\nhas proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused sexually assaulted L. by\ntouching her vagina.”[10]Counsel for the appellant says that the trial\njudge failed to adequately review the evidence, neglected to properly consider\nthe appellant’s testimony, and failed to properly apply the principle of proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. The appellant also alleges that the trial judge\nerred in allowing the Crown to cross-examine the appellant on statements made\nto Dr. Nizar Ladha, a psychiatrist, and about a letter to Dr. Ladha without\nfirst holding a voir dire. Counsel for the appellant further alleges that the\nappellant’s right to a fair trial was breached by Crown counsel’s improper use\nof leading questions, and by improper redirect examination and\ncross-examination.[11]Counsel for the appellant identifies the issues\nby asking whether the trial judge erred in law by: failing to adequately review\nthe evidence; not properly applying the principle of proof beyond a reasonable\ndoubt; and failing to properly consider the appellant’s testimony. In his\nargument, counsel refers to certain cases supporting the proposition that\nalthough the law does not require a judge to give reasons, he must consider all\nthe relevant evidence and particularly where the evidence might raise a\nreasonable doubt and further that the trial judge must “take the time to show”\nthat such evidence has been considered. Cases were also cited to show that when\nan accused testifies, the trial judge must instruct the jury (or himself if\nsitting alone) that the ultimate question is not whether the trier of fact\nbelieves the complainant or the accused but, whether on the totality of the\nevidence the Crown has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.[12]As a generality, I have no doubt the cases\ncounsel for the appellant mentions are authority for the principles or\npropositions he suggests. However, I gather that his underlying complaint is\nthat the trial judge’s decision was a “terse one and a half page decision” -\ntoo meagre and deficient to properly comply with the law. Counsel argues, and I\nparaphrase, that a reading of the decision signifies that the trial judge did\nnot consider all the relevant evidence; that he failed to properly explain and\napply the principle of reasonable doubt; and finally, that he did not consider\nthe appellant’s testimony. Defence counsel acknowledges that reasons for\njudgment are not always necessary. However, by his grounds of appeal and\nidentification of the issues, counsel for the appellant is really claiming\ninsufficiency of stated reasons as the root problem that constitutes an error.[13]In R. v. Burns (R.H.), 1994 CanLII 127 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R.\n656; 165 N.R. 374; 42 B.C.A.C. 161; 67 W.A.C. 161; 89 C.C.C.(3d) 193; 29\nC.R.(4th) 113, at p. 664 S.C.R., McLachlin, J., in delivering the judgment of\nthe court commented:“Failure to indicate expressly that all\nrelevant considerations have been taken into account in arriving at a verdict\nis not a basis for allowing an appeal under s. 686(1)(a). This accords with the\ngeneral rule that a trial judge does not err merely because he or she does not\ngive reasons for deciding one way or the other on problematic points: see R.\nv. Smith, 1990 CanLII 99 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 991, affirming (1989), 1989 ABCA 187 (CanLII), 95 A.R. 304, and Macdonald\nv. The Queen, 1976 CanLII 140 (SCC), [1977] 2 S.C.R. 665. The judge is not required to demonstrate\nthat he or she knows the law and has considered all aspects of the evidence.\nNor is the judge required to explain why he or she does not entertain a\nreasonable doubt as to the accused’s guilt. Failure to do any of these things\ndoes not, in itself, permit a court of appeal to set aside the verdict.“This rule makes good sense. To require\ntrial judges charged with heavy caseloads of criminal cases to deal in their\nreasons with every aspect of every case would slow the system of justice\nimmeasurably. Trial judges are presumed to know the law with which they work\nday in and day out. If they state their conclusions in brief compass, and these\nconclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict should not be overturned\nmerely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects of the case.”The Supreme Court of Canada in a recent\ndecision, R. v. Barrett (D.), 1995 CanLII 129 (SCC), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 752; 179 N.R. 68; 80\nO.A.C. 1; 96 C.C.C.(3d) 319, reiterated its position that it was desirable that\na trial judge give reasons, and in some cases imperative, but by itself the\nabsence of reasons by a trial judge is not fatal. Iacobucci, J., speaking for\nthe court stated:“We all agree that this appeal is\ngoverned by the principles recently discussed by our court in R. v. Burns\n(1994), 1994 CanLII 127 (SCC), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 193, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656; 29 C.R.(4th) 113, and related\ncases. The decision in Burns was not available to the Ontario Court of\nAppeal when it rendered its judgment. While it is clearly preferable to give\nreasons and although there may be some cases where reasons may be necessary, by\nitself, the absence of reasons of a trial judge cannot be a ground for\nappellate review when the finding is otherwise supportable on the evidence or\nwhere the basis of the finding is apparent from the circumstances. The issue is\nthe reasonableness of the finding not an absence or insufficiency of reasons.”[14]The appellant’s position as expressed in his\ntestimony was a simple denial of any sexual pursuit or intent in his conduct\ntowards his children. The issue was solely one of credibility and the appellant’s\nposition did not include a complex explanation or defence that demanded careful\nanalysis and complete reasons. This was the usual case where reasons by the\ntrial judge may have contributed to a more comprehensive explanation, but not a\nsituation where a full explanation was needed. On reviewing the transcript and\nreading the trial judge’s decision I see no reason to share the concern of\ndefence counsel that the trial judge may have committed the errors he suggests.[15]Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial\njudge made an error in allowing Crown counsel to cross-examine the appellant on\ncertain statements made to Dr. Ladha (between December 7, 1987 and January 8,\n1988 - 30 day psychiatric assessment) and to cross-examine the appellant on a\nletter written by the appellant to Dr. Ladha, the evening of January 5, 1988\nwhile still at the Waterford Hospital, without holding a voir dire to determine\nadmissibility. In his factum Crown counsel concedes that there ought to have\nbeen a voir dire to determine whether Dr. Ladha was a person in authority and,\nif necessary, the voluntariness of the statements and letter to Dr. Ladha\nbefore cross-examination of the appellant. The Crown contends, however, that no\ninjustice or unfairness occurred. The consequence of the failure to hold a voir\ndire will be discussed shortly when considering the application of s.\n686(1)(b)(iii) - the no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice provision\nin the Code.[16]Respecting the other grounds of appeal,\nappellant’s counsel maintains that the right to a fair trial was breached by\nCrown counsel’s improper statements and questions, and particularly by leading\nquestions, during all stages of the testimony of the three complainants. In R.\nv. G.B. et al. (No. 2), 1990 CanLII 7308 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 30; 111 N.R. 31; 86 Sask.R. 111; 56\nC.C.C(3d) 200; 77 C.R.(3d) 347, Wilson, J., made the following statement at p.\n54 S.C.R. concerning the approach that should be taken when assessing the\ncredibility of child witnesses:“Dealing first with Wakeling, J.A.’s,\ncomments regarding the credibility of child witnesses it seems to me that he\nwas simply suggesting that the judiciary should take a common sense approach\nwhen dealing with the testimony of young children and not impose the same\nexacting standard on them as it does on adults. However, this is not to say\nthat the courts should not carefully assess the credibility of child witnesses\nand I do not read his reasons as suggesting that the standard of proof must be\nlowered when dealing with children as the appellants submit. Rather, he was\nexpressing concern that a flaw, such as a contradiction, in a child’s testimony\nshould not be given the same effect as a similar flaw in the testimony of an\nadult. I think his concern is well founded and his comments entirely\nappropriate. While children may not be able to recount precise details and\ncommunicate the when and where of an event with exactitude, this does not mean\nthat they have misconceived what happened to them and who did it. In recent\nyears we have adopted a much more benign attitude to children’s evidence,\nlessening the strict standards of oath taking and corroboration, and I believe\nthat this is a desirable development. The credibility of every witness who testifies\nbefore the court must, of course, be carefully assessed but the standard of the\n‘reasonable adult’ is not necessarily appropriate in assessing the credibility\nof young children.”[17]Appellant counsel’s objections are not directed\ntoward conflicting evidence, lack of precise detail, or contradictions. Rather,\nthe protest is that Crown counsel manipulated the children by employing leading\nquestions and questions that elicited simple yes and no answers and generally\npursued a succession of questions or suggestions that inevitably had to evoke\nthe desired response. To a degree counsel for the appellant has a valid point\nas examples of improper examination of witnesses as alleged are obvious.[18]It is evident from the cases that today trial\njudges exercise discretion generously in permitting prosecutors considerable\nleeway when examining young children during trials on sexual offences. I\nsuspect that leniency in this regard is far more prevalent than acknowledged.\nThe reasons are well understood. The testimony of the children - the\ncomplainants - is essential for the prosecution of any sexual offence but the\nevidence is very difficult to evoke from bewildered and bashful children,\nfrequently very young, under great stress. It is apparent that the complainants\nwere very reticent and uncommunicative witnesses and the prosecutor experienced\ngreat difficulty eliciting replies. Be that as it may, prosecutors, having much\nfamiliarity with the background and circumstances of the case, must not be\ninveigled into abandoning the rules; frustration in the examination of young\nchildren does not justify a lax application of the rules. There are limits. A\nduty of a Crown prosecutor is always one of fairness to the accused.[19]Appellant’s counsel disparaged the trial judge’s\nruling to permit the complainant, A., to sit next to him on the bench while\ntestifying. My reading of the transcript is that the trial judge, apparently\nagainst his better judgment, acceded to the entreaties of the prosecutor, who\nreferred to a precedent established by another judge of the court permitting a\nchild to sit on the bench. The perception by an accused of seeing a Crown\nwitness, a child, sitting with the judge would not be favourable and not likely\nto promote a sense of objectivity by the court. On this ground alone it is a\npractice not to be encouraged - not to be sanctioned. Having said that, there\nis no suggestion whatsoever that in this case the event jeopardized a fair\ntrial.[20]Notwithstanding that the prosecutor asked\nleading questions and made statements encouraging the children with some of\ntheir testimony, I have come to the conclusion that the evidence of the sexual\nassaults was derived from the testimony of the children and not elicited\nimproperly by the involvement of the prosecutor. The quandary for the trial\njudge in any case of this nature is where to draw the line between reasonable\nflexibility in the application of the rules to facilitate the Crown in its\nacknowledged difficulty of extracting testimony from young children, and\nexcessive co-operation, amounting to collaboration with the Crown, that\njeopardizes an accused’s right to a fair trial. The question in such a\ncircumstance, as in this case, is whether the evidence wrestled from the\nchildren in the manner indicated by appellant’s counsel was thereby so tainted\nthat the appellant did not have a fair trial. Expressed in other words, that\nthe rules for the examination of witnesses, in this case child witnesses, were\nso relaxed or moderated by the trial judge, and the testimony so diluted and\ndubious that the convictions cannot stand. On the basis of that test I am\nsatisfied that this ground of appeal must fail. There were irregularities in\nthe examination of the children by the Crown prosecutor but not such as to\nbring into question the trustworthiness of the testimony of the sexual\nassaults. As I have already said, the evidence of the sexual assaults was\nultimately the testimony of the children, not that of the prosecutor. It is\nimportant to remember that in respect to the count concerning S., the trial\njudge had a reasonable doubt and dismissed the charge. The matter of improper\nquestions by the prosecutor will be considered further when reviewing the\npowers of the Court of Appeal found in s. 686(1)(b)(iii).[21]In summary therefore, appellant’s counsel raises\na valid objection that the trial judge was in error in allowing Crown counsel\nto cross-examine the appellant on certain statements made to Dr. Ladha and also\nin error in permitting cross-examination on a letter written by the appellant\nto Dr. Ladha without first holding a voir dire to determine admissibility; and\nsecondly, although the examination of the three children by Crown counsel\nincluded leading questions, it was not so irregular that the objection should\nbe sustained.[22]As the trial judge erroneously allowed\ncross-examination of the appellant on certain statements and also on a letter\nhe had written to Dr. Ladha, without holding a voir dire, and in view of the\nconcern expressed by counsel for the appellant over the nature of the examination-in-chief\nof the complainants, it is expedient to consider s. 686(1)(b)(iii) and the\npowers of the Court of Appeal to dismiss an appeal in circumstances where the\nappeal might be decided in favour of the appellant but the court is satisfied\nthat there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.[23]Section 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code reads\nas follows:“686(1) On the hearing of an appeal\nagainst a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand\ntrial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of\nappeal(b) may\ndismiss the appeal where(iii)\nnotwithstanding that the court is of the opinion that on any ground mentioned\nin subparagraph (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant,\nit is of the opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has\noccurred.”The Court of Appeal may dismiss an appeal if it\nis of the opinion that, notwithstanding the error, no substantial wrong or\nmiscarriage of justice has occurred.[24]Criminal Pleadings and Practice in Canada, (2nd Ed.), vol. 2, by Justice Eugene G. Ewaschuk at para. 23:8070\nlists nine “tests”, drawn from cases cited, that may be utilized in deciding\nwhether the “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice” proviso should be\napplied. In R. v. Huot (C), 1994 CanLII 35 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 827; 174 N.R. 311; 75 O.A.C.\n322 at p. 828 S.C.R., Sopinka, J., referred to a recent judgment of the Supreme\nCourt, R. v. Haughton (D.), 1994 CanLII 73 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 516; 179 N.R. 1; 79 O.A.C.\n319; 93 C.C.C.(3d) 99 at pp. 516-517 S.C.R., where the court stated:“The application of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of\nthe Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, requires the court to consider\nwhether a jury properly instructed could, acting reasonably, have come to a\ndifferent conclusion absent the error.”In a real sense the “test” as mentioned in Huot\nand Haughton is the sum of the principles or tests recounted in\nEwaschuk. The question to be asked is whether the trial judge, properly\ninstructing himself and acting reasonably, could have come to a different\nconclusion (not guilty), if he had not permitted both the offending\ncross-examination of the appellant on certain statements and letter to Dr.\nLadha or allowed the leading questions on the examination-in-chief of the\ncomplainants. As I view the evidence there is a very sound and compelling\nreason to find that, absent the errors by the trial judge as alleged, a trial\njudge properly instructed and acting reasonably, could not have come to a\ndifferent conclusion other than the verdict of guilty. I am referring here to\nthe self incriminating testimony of the appellant and the even more damming\nstatement by the appellant given to the police.[25]The testimony of the children must be weighed\nand determined in the light of the evidence of the appellant as flowing from\nhis examination and cross-examination and from his written statement to the\npolice. The appellant testified and the following is a summary of what he had\nto say with respect to the allegations by his three children, as summarized by\nthe Crown in its factum:A.“The appellant admitted to touching A.’s\npenis in the shower stating that it was to show him how to wash himself\nproperly under the foreskin. He admitted to instructing A. to spank him, but\nsaid that it was to teach him that he did not enjoy disciplining him in that\nmanner. The appellant denied that he had ever instructed his son to ‘touch him’\nand denied he had ever kissed his son on the bum or inserted his finger into\nhis rectum, calling these allegations ‘lies’ and ‘made up’.S.“The appellant admitted that he teased\nand tickled his children in a playful manner and that he teased S. a couple of\ntimes about her breasts. He admitted tickling under her shirt on the ribs and\nthat he ‘might have on occasion’ touched her bare breasts, but that his\nintention was never sexual. The appellant admitted to lying on the bed with S.\nand L. and admitted that he did rub S.’s back and told her that he loved her.\nHe also conceded that in teasing S. about her breasts he called her ‘Dolly\nParton’. He admitted to ‘goosing her on the rear end’.”L.“As stated above the appellant admitted\nto lying on the bed with both S. and L. He admitted to rubbing L.’s stomach,\nbut denied he had ever touched her vagina.”[26]During the course of the investigation by the\npolice the appellant gave a statement. Following a voir dire, counsel for the\nappellant not objecting, the trial judge ruled the statement admissible. The\nfollowing is the statement of the appellant:“At around the 28th day of August, 1987,\nI returned to Newfoundland and lived with my ex-wife, P.C., at [address\nomitted], St. John’s. Also at that residence were my three kids: A., S. and L.\nDuring my stay at [address omitted], I on two occasions, spanked A., both times\nfor lying. I smacked S. once in the face with an open hand for mouthing off at\nme. I hit L. a couple of times. About twice while I was home, I took a shower\nwith A. I asked him to clean under his foreskin, but he appeared to be afraid\nto do it. I then pulled his foreskin back for him and cleaned his penis for\nhim. The times that we lay on the chesterfield, I may jokingly touch A.’s\npenis, but not sexually. I know that S.’s breasts were started to mature and I\nwas teasing her by tickling her around the stomach and chest and pretended I\nwas grabbing the breasts. I would pinch her breasts outside her blouse a couple\nof times but again just teasing her. I may have teased L. a couple of times as\nwell. I was drinking when I came home and lay down on the bed with L. and S.,\nbut they were asleep. I probably had my arms around L., but I never touched her\nbetween the legs inside the pyjamas. The girls woke when I was going to sleep\nhere at night. I said I was going to sleep here at night. They said, no, so I\nsaid, you’re a bunch of weinies and walked out. I do remember showing A. my\nbirthmark, but I don’t know that L. was there. The birthmark is on my buttocks.\nI got back to Sydney, Nova Scotia, around Halloween.”[27]It would not be correct to call the evidence of\nthe appellant, and in particular his statement, an admission of wrongdoing, but\ncertainly it is an acknowledgement of the circumstances and conduct his\nchildren indicated had occurred. There are several contradictions between the\nwritten statement and his testimony, but in large part the only variation\nbetween the testimony of the children and the evidence by the appellant is the\nquestion of intent. The appellant essentially admits the acts but denies any\nsexual intention or design. On hearing the testimony of the children and\nevaluating the evidence of the appellant the only issue was whether the\nbehaviour of the appellant was of a sexual nature or had a sexual connotation\nin the sense that the acts were an affront to the children’s sexual integrity.\nThe finding of guilty by the trial judge is understandable -a conclusion based\non evidence. It is clear to me that had the trial judge not permitted\ncross-examination of the appellant on certain statements and on the appellant’s\nletter to Dr. Ladha, and not allowed leading questions by the prosecutor, the\nresult would have been the same and the reason is the condemnatory admissions\nby the appellant in his testimony, and particularly in his written statement,\nevidence that is decidedly incriminating. In these circumstances s.\n686(1)(b)(iii) is to the point.[28]I have already mentioned that s. 686(1)(b)(iii)\nallows the Court of Appeal to dismiss an appeal that might have been decided in\nfavour of the appellant if it is of opinion that no substantial wrong or\nmiscarriage of justice has occurred. I have come to the conclusion that such is\nthe case here. Absent the errors by the trial judge in permitting the improper\ncross-examination, and assuming for argument’s sake that the trial judge was in\nerror in allowing leading questions by the Crown prosecutor during\nexamination-in-chief of the children, I am satisfied that a jury (or judge\nsitting alone) properly instructed and acting reasonably, could not have come\nto a different conclusion, that is, arrived at any result other than a guilty\nverdict. For reasons mentioned it is conceivable that the appeal might be\ndecided in favour of the appellant, but this appeal is to be dismissed as,\nerrors aside, there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.[29]The appeal from conviction is dismissed.SentenceDangerous\nOffender Application: s. 688 (now s. 753)Appeal From Indeterminate Sentence[30]On June 14, 1988, the appellant R.C., was\nconvicted of the offence of sexual assault against his two children A. and L.\nand remanded until June 24th for sentencing. On the 16th of June the Attorney\nGeneral of Newfoundland filed an application in the Supreme Court of\nNewfoundland, Trial Division, to have the appellant declared a dangerous\noffender pursuant to s. 688(b) of the Criminal Code. On June 24th the\ncourt set September 18th, 1988 as the date to commence the hearing of the\ndangerous offender application. The hearing of the application concluded\nSeptember 29th and the appellant was again remanded pending a decision on the\nCrown’s application. On October 14th, 1988, the Trial Division Justice hearing\nthe application found the appellant to be a dangerous offender and imposed a\nsentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period [see 1988 CanLII 5484 (NL SCTD), 71\nNfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 332; 320 A.P.R. 332]. The appellant appeals the\nindeterminate sentence.[31]The Crown’s application to have the appellant\ndesignated a dangerous offender is under paragraph (b) of s. 688. The following\nis s. 688 in its entirety as paragraph (a) helps shed light on the intended\ncharacter of a dangerous offender:“688. Where, upon an application made\nunder this Part following the conviction of a person for an offence but before\nthe offender is sentenced therefor, it is established to the satisfaction of\nthe court(a) that the\noffence for which the offender has been convicted is a serious personal injury\noffence described in paragraph (a) of the definition of that expression in\nsection 687 and the offender constitutes a threat to the life, safety or\nphysical or mental well-being of other persons on the basis of evidence\nestablishing(i) a pattern\nof repetitive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he has\nbeen convicted forms a part, showing a failure to restrain his behaviour and a\nlikelihood of his causing death or injury to other persons, or inflicting\nsevere psychological damage upon persons, through failure in the future to\nrestrain his behaviour,(ii) a\npattern of persistent aggressive behaviour by the offender, of which the\noffence for which he has been convicted forms a part, showing a substantial\ndegree of indifference on the part of the offender as to the reasonably\nforeseeable consequences to other persons of his behaviour, or(iii) any\nbehaviour by the offender, associated with the offence for which he has been\nconvicted, that is of such a brutal nature as to compel the conclusion that his\nbehaviour in the future is unlikely to be inhibited by normal standards of\nbehavioural restraint, or(b) that the\noffence for which the offender has been convicted is a serious personal injury\noffence described in paragraph (b) of the definition of that expression in\nsection 687 and the offender, by his conduct in any sexual matter including\nthat involved in the commission of the offence for which he has been convicted,\nhas shown a failure to control his sexual impulses and a likelihood of his\ncausing injury, pain or other evil to other persons through failure in the\nfuture to control his sexual impulses.the court may find the offender to be a\ndangerous offender and may thereupon impose a sentence of detention in a\npenitentiary for an indeterminate period, in lieu of any other sentence that\nmight be imposed for the offence for which the offender has been convicted.”[32]Section 688 provides in part that upon an\napplication following conviction of a person for an offence, but before the offender\nis sentenced, the court may find the offender to be a dangerous offender if,\namongst other things, the offence for which the offender has been convicted is\na “serious personal injury offence” as described in paragraph (b) of the\ndefinition of that expression found in s. 687 (now s. 752). Section 687\nprovides that:“‘serious personal injury offence’ means(a) an\nindictable offence (other than high treason, first degree murder or second\ndegree murder) involving(i) the use\nor attempted use of violence against another person, or(ii) conduct\nendangering or likely to endanger the life or safety of another person or\ninflicting or likely to inflict severe psychological damage upon another\nperson.And for which\nthe offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years or more, or(b) an offence\nor attempt to commit an offence mentioned in section 246.1 (sexual assault),\n246.2 (sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily\nharm) or 246.3 (aggravated sexual assault).”We are concerned with paragraph (b) of s. 687\nand again I have inserted paragraph (a) only because it helps explain the type\nor kind of a dangerous offender that Parliament had in mind.[33]The appellant has been convicted of two counts\nof sexual assault and by definition therefore, the offence, usually referred to\nas the predicate offence, is a serious personal injury offence.[34]Section 688(b) provides that if the offender, by\nhis conduct in any sexual matter, including the predicate offence, “has shown a\nfailure to control his sexual impulses and a likelihood of his causing injury,\npain or other evil to other persons through failure in the future to control\nhis sexual impulses”, the court may find him to be a dangerous offender.\nIn that eventuality the court may, instead of sentencing him for the\noffence for which he has been convicted (predicate offence), impose a sentence\nof detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period. More will be said\nlater about the term “may” appearing twice toward the end of s. 688, a word that\nordinarily connotes discretionary powers.[35]Section 690 (now s. 755) of the Code states\nthat on the hearing of a dangerous offender application the court must hear the\nevidence of at least two psychiatrists and all other relevant evidence,\nincluding the evidence of any psychologist or criminologist called as a witness\nby either the prosecution or the offender. Subsection (2) of s. 690 is explicit\nin that one of the psychiatrists shall be nominated by the prosecution and one\nshall be nominated by the offender. As we shall see shortly, the appellant\nwrote a letter to Dr. Nizar Ladha, the psychiatrist nominated by the Crown, and\nI have little doubt that that perplexing letter was one of the primary reasons\nthe appellant was accorded the status of dangerous offender.[36]Section 692 (now s. 757) of the Code concerns\ncharacter evidence and it confirms the right of an offender to tender evidence\nas to his character and repute; the section also authorizes evidence of\ncharacter and repute, if the court thinks fit, on the question of whether the\noffender is or is not a dangerous offender.[37]Section 694 (now s. 759) concerns appeals\nagainst a sentence of indeterminate detention and against the dismissal of a\ndangerous offender application. For our purposes only subs. (1) and (3) of s.\n759 are relevant. In R. v. Boutilier (J.H.) (1995), 1995 CanLII 4205 (NS CA), 144 N.S.R.(2d) 293;\n416 A.P.R. 293; 101 C.C.C.(3d) 1 (C.A.), Flinn, J.A., of the Nova Scotia Court\nof Appeal explains the right of appeal as follows:“It is necessary to examine the appeal provisions\nof the Code with respect to dangerous offender applications. The\nrelevant provisions of s. 759 of the Code are as follows:759(1) A\nperson who is sentenced to detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate\nperiod under this Part may appeal to the court of appeal against that sentence\non any ground of law or fact or mixed law and fact..\n. . . .‘(3) On an\nappeal against a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate\nperiod, the court of appeal may(a) quash the\nsentence and impose any sentence that might have been imposed in respect of the\noffence for which the appellant was convicted, or order a new hearing; or(b) dismiss\nthe appeal.’“Therefore, as to the sentence of\nindeterminate detention, the appellant has an appeal as of right. He does not\nrequire leave.“However, on the hearing of the appeal,\nthis court’s power is limited to quashing the sentence and imposing an\nappropriate sentence for the predicate offence, ordering a new hearing or\ndismissing the appeal.“There is no express right to appeal the\nfinding of the trial judge that the appellant is a dangerous offender, nor does\nthis court have the power to quash that finding. R. v. Langevin (1984),\n1984 CanLII 1914 (ON CA), 11 C.C.C.(3d) 336; 8 D.L.R.(4th) 485; 39 C.R.(3d) 333 (Ont. C.A.), is regularly\ncited to define the role of the Court of Appeal in this type of case. As\nLacourciere, J.A., said at p. 341:‘The Court of\nAppeal has express power to quash the sentence of indeterminate detention but\nnot the finding of dangerous offender.. . . . .‘However, in deciding whether to quash the sentence, the court must\nnecessarily consider whether the finding of dangerous offender is justified in\nfact and law.’“See also R. v. Lyons (1984), 1984 CanLII 48 (NS CA), 15\nC.C.C. (3d) 129 at p. 140, 65 N.S.R.(2d) 29 (C.A.), per Macdonald, J.A.”[38]It is not possible to adequately assess the\nappropriateness of an indeterminate sentence without evaluating and reflecting\non the evidence and conclusions of the trial judge hearing the dangerous\noffender application. The provisions of the Code in question do not\nsanction an appeal from the trial judge’s finding of dangerous offender, but in\nhearing an appeal against the indeterminate sentence, “on any ground of law or\nfact or mixed law and fact”, it is inevitable that the Court of Appeal examine\nthe regularity of the finding of dangerous offender. If in the opinion of the\nCourt of Appeal the finding of dangerous offender is unsound or flawed, s. 694\nallows the court to quash the sentence and impose any sentence that might have\nbeen imposed in respect of the predicate offence or, alternatively, order a new\nhearing.Trial\nDivision[39]The Trial Division judge reviewed briefly the\nfacts and in the course of doing so referred to the appellant’s criminal record\nin these terms:“The Crown introduced evidence of the\nextensive criminal record of the respondent (Consent No. 30). His criminal\nrecord began on July 2nd, 1974 and ended with the conviction of sexually\nassaulting his children on June 14th, 1988. These convictions included break,\nentry and theft, loitering, uttering forged documents, theft, several charges\nof possession of a narcotic and possession of a narcotic for the purposes of\ntrafficking, violations of United States Immigration Laws, deportation to\nCanada, various breaches of bonds to keep the peace in relation to his former\nwife, and convictions in 1986 and 1987 which involved assault, unlawful\nconfinement and assault causing bodily harm.” [see p. 335][40]At the hearing of the application in the Trial\nDivision, four of the Crown’s witnesses were W.B., H.W., K.S. and P.C., all of\nwhom gave testimony from personal experience of the appellant’s abuse and\npersistent sexual demands.W.B.[41]W.B. testified that when she was nine years old\nliving in Fremont, Nebraska, the appellant was her babysitter when he repeatedly\nsexually assaulted her. She stated that the sexual activity continued through\nthe summer. The sexual activity included sexual intercourse. Counsel for the\nappellant points out that the incidents were not reported to the police, there\nwere no charges laid and there was no medical examination. W.B.’s mother, C.B.\n(another Crown witness), stated that the appellant’s mother was her best\nfriend, and that the appellant would have been about 16 or 17 years of age at\nthe time. W.B. said that during the sexual assaults she was crying and telling\nthe appellant to stop.H.W.[42]H.W. testified that she met the appellant in\nMedicine Hat, Alberta, in June of 1986 and very shortly thereafter they\nmarried. Five days after the marriage they separated, H.W. stating that she left\nbecause the appellant became violent and raped her. Her evidence was that she\ntold him she was going to the bank and he informed her she was not allowed to\nleave. He started kicking the door frames and damaging the furniture. She says\nhe choked her up against a wall and struck her in the face and although she\nrejected his advances the appellant had sexual intercourse with her. H.W.\ntestified that she left the appellant after this incident but that he\nrepeatedly breached the recognizance that required him not to have any contact\nwith her.[43]In his factum counsel for the appellant\nparaphrases the testimony of H.W., an interpretation that the prosecution did\nnot expressly accept or reject. I assume therefore, that it is a reasonably\naccurate portrayal of what she said. The following is borrowed from the factum\nof the appellant commencing on p. 47:“H.W. further testified that during\nsexual intercourse the appellant would masturbate a lot and that ‘sex was\nalways on his mind’ (V. 2, p. 173).“Under cross-examination H.W. testified\nthat at the time she married the appellant she was under a lot of stress. She\nwas being harassed by another man who even had private eyes following her (V.\n2, pp. 175-177). H.W. described this other individual as having an ‘obsession’\nfor her (V. 2, p. 178).“H.W. testified that she received some\nmarks on her neck and some minor bruises from this physical assault (V. 2, p.\n181). As for the incident of physical assault H.W. testified that the appellant\n‘thought that sexual intercourse would make things right’ but she rejected that\nidea and the appellant ‘proceeded anyway’ (v. 2, p. 182).“Under questioning about the letters sent\nto her by the appellant, H.W. admitted that in such letters the Appellant told\nher he loved her and that he wanted her to come home (V. 2, p. 185). H.W. felt\nthis was a ‘ploy’ to make her feel sorry for him and take him back.“Although he would phone her the\nappellant never threatened her on the telephone (V. 2, p. 186). She described\nthe appellant as a ‘possessive and jealous person’.“Under questioning by the court, H.W.\ndescribed the harassment by the other individual which commenced in January,\n1986 (V. 2, pp. 200-103). H.W. testified that this other individual was part of\nthe reason that she married the appellant. She further testified that the\nappellant had never hit her prior to their marriage (V. 2, p. 204).“H.W. testified that she had previously\nbeen involved in a marriage where there was a lot of physical violence (‘a lot\nworse that I suffered with R.C.) and she did not want to be put in that\nposition again (V. 2, 206).”K.S.[44]I have compared both counsels’ summary of the\nevidence of K.S. and see no contradictions, though one is longer than the\nother. My review of the testimony of K.S. is taken from both accounts.[45]K.S. testified that she met the appellant at the\nFull Gospel Church in Medicine Hat, Alberta, in late summer or early fall of\n1986. She alleges that on two occasions she was sexually assaulted by the\nappellant.[46]The first incident occurred at the appellant’s\napartment the night before K.S. left on a trip to Bermuda. They drank wine and\nthe appellant told her he loved her and tried to kiss her. K.S. said she\nattempted to leave but the appellant grabbed and threw her on the floor. She\nsaid she tried to push him off but he proceeded to have sexual intercourse. The\nsecond incident occurred when K.S. returned from her trip to Bermuda. The\nappellant told her he wished to speak to her and she agreed to meet him at the\nhome of a friend of the appellant, one M.T. The appellant gripped her by the\narm and dragged her into a small bedroom, threw her on to the bed, and although\nshe screamed and tried to leave, he got on top of her. He pushed her against\nthe wall calling her a “slut” and a “whore”. She said he was punching the wall\nnext to her head. She also says he tried to strangle her. He threw her against\nanother wall causing it to cave in.[47]K.S. testified that when M.T. returned she ran\nout of the house although it was 3:00 a.m. and -30 degrees Celsius. M.T. persuaded\nher to come back to the house to call a taxi or the police. According to the\ntestimony of K.S. when M.T. left the room the appellant again became violent\nand started screaming at her. He punched her in the face knocking her\nunconscious. She next remembers lying on the floor with her nylons and\nunderwear gone and her dress and slip pulled up to her waist. As a result of\nthis second incident the appellant was convicted of assault causing bodily harm\nand forceable confinement and although he had been charged with sexual assault\na stay of proceedings was entered.P.C.[48]The appellant married P.C. (nee C.) April 9th,\n1976 when he was 18 years of age and she was 20 and from that marriage were\nborn the three children, the complainants in this case. During the next five\nyears or so, the couple separated on numerous occasions; the respondent was\nfired from many jobs and the family changed addresses frequently. The\nrespondent was admitted to the Waterford Hospital and St. Clare’s Hospital\n(psychiatric ward) on a couple of occasions. He was prosecuted by United States\nImmigration authorities for illegal entry to the United States and deported on\nmore than one occasion. R.C. enlisted in the U.S. Army but, not adapting to\nmilitary life, was discharged as an illegal alien and for enlisting in the army\nunder fraudulent circumstances. He was deported. The record indicates several\nsuicide attempts and throughout all of the period he was heavily involved in\nthe use of illegal drugs.[49]This witness related how, prior to her divorce\nfrom the appellant, they had separated on many occasions because of her husband’s\nphysical and sexual abuse; that she always went back as she was afraid of him.\nShe also said that she had him “bonded” and had had him charged With breach of\nprobation. She told the court that she often said “no” to his demands for sex\nbut gave in because she was afraid of him: “after all the beatings that I took\nfrom him, if I didn’t give in to him, he would beat me up anyway”.Psychiatric\nEvidence[50]As already pointed out, on the hearing of a\ndangerous offender application the court is required to hear the evidence of at\nleast two psychiatrists, one to be nominated by the prosecution and one to be\nnominated by the offender (s. 690). The psychiatrist summoned by the prosecution\nwas Dr. Nizar B. Ladha and Dr. Douglas Paulse by the offender, R.C.Dr.\nN.B. Ladha[51]Dr. Ladha is a psychiatrist certified by the\nRoyal College of Physicians of Canada and the American Board of Psychiatry and\nNeurology with sub-specialty training in forensic psychiatry. Dr. Ladha has\nbeen actively engaged in the practice of forensic psychiatry since 1980. He was\ndeclared an expert in forensic psychiatry for the purposes of this application.[52]In preparation for the hearing of the dangerous\noffender application Dr. Ladha prepared a report in September of 1988. The\nfollowing is a very brief review of certain portions of the report.[53]Dr. Ladha examined the appellant during three\nadmissions to the Waterford Hospital, July and August of 1980, and as a result\nof a court order for a psychiatric examination in December of 1987. He also\nexamined the appellant at Her Majesty’s Penitentiary in St. John’s following\nreceipt of the letter as mentioned above. Dr. Ladha reviewed discharge\nsummaries from the Waterford Hospital when the appellant was admitted under Dr.\nPaulse’s care and discharge summaries from St. Clare’s Mercy Hospital following\ntreatment on at least three admissions to that institution. He also interviewed\nthe appellant’s mother, D.S., and reevaluated statements from W.B., P.C.\n(ex-wife), H.W., K.S. and a R.C.[54]Under the heading of “psychiatric data” Dr.\nLadha briefly reviewed the appellant’s history from his birth in Stephenville\nCrossing, Newfoundland, May 4th, 1957. His parents separated and his mother,\nD.S., moved to the United States with another man whom she later married,\ntaking the appellant with her. He says he never knew his father. Dr. Ladha’s\nreport mentions that the appellant says he had an unpleasant childhood and was\nphysically abused by his mother and stepfather and sexually abused by his\nstepfather. D.S. said that her relationship with her son, the appellant, was\nnot affectionate and they quarrelled often. The appellant told Dr. Ladha that\nhis mother beat him often and blamed him for her marital difficulties. He\ndisliked his mother. She described him as a hyperactive child, mischievous and\ngetting into difficulties at school where he set off fire alarms, did not\nlisten to teachers and fought with peers. He lived in the United States with\nhis mother and stepfather until about age 15. At that point he returned to\nStephenville Crossing living with his maternal grandparents returning again to\nthe United States in a few months. His mother reported to Dr. Ladha that he was\nasked to leave the United States when it was discovered “that he had allegedly\nsexually abused a nine year old girl, W.B., a neighbour and a friend’s daughter”.\nThe appellant has a grade eight education.[55]The report by Dr. Ladha indicates that the\nappellant used alcohol since the age of 15 years. Further, he has used many\nhallucinogenic drugs including marijuana, mescaline, LSD, amphetamines and\ncocaine. According to Dr. Ladha at least some of his violent acts were carried\nout when he was intoxicated with alcohol and drugs.[56]Dr. Ladha states that the appellant has been\nmarried twice, the first marriage at the age of 18 years (P.C.) lasted five\nyears. He had three children from that marriage, the children mentioned in the\npredicate offence. He married a second time in 1986 to then K.G., now known as\nH.W. As already mentioned that marriage lasted five days.[57]In concluding his report Dr. Ladha offered the\nfollowing psychiatric opinions:“PSYCHIATRIC OPINIONS:“(1) R.C. suffers from multiple sexual\ndeviations including sadism, paedophilia, bisexuality, bestiality and possibly\nhypersexuality.His sexual\nconduct over the last sixteen years would suggest that his sexual practices\nhave escalated. This may be either increasing need for varied and deviant\nsexual excitement or decreasing capacity for control and self inhibition.“(2) He sees women as powerful and\ncontrolling persons. He resents them as a result.“(3) He has traits of antisocial\npersonality including impulsivity and poor anger control.“(4) There is no evidence of mental\nillness which could suggest that R.C. is out of touch with reality.“(5) He has frequently abused alcohol and\nhallucinogenic drugs.“(6) Future Behaviour:Prediction of\nbehaviour in the future is difficult and unreliable. The least unreliable\nprediction of behaviour in the near future is past behaviour. R.C.’s behaviour\nover the last sixteen years shows an escalation of deviant sexual behaviour.\nThis would suggest that he is likely to exhibit similar behaviour at least in\nthe near future. Behaviour in the distant future is difficult if not impossible\nto predict.“(7) Harm to his potential victims -It is well\nknown that victims of sexual assault both children and adults are often harmed\nin some way. It is reasonable to assume that R.C.’s possible future sexual\nvictims would suffer harm.“(8) Treatment -R.C. has\nexpressed that he does not like his sexual feelings and that he would like to\nbe treated. He was agreeable to taking antilibido drugs that would produce\nchemical castration in him. All the effects and side effects of the drugs were\npointed out to him.It is risky to\ntreat impulsive violent patients in a non-sexual environment. R.C. should be\noffered the treatment with drugs and psychological methods in a secure\nenvironment. It must be pointed out that not all patients respond to treatment\nand that many patients drop out of treatment.”The\nLetter[58]In December of 1987 on the laying of the charges\nof sexual assault, the Provincial Court ordered the appellant be remanded for\nthirty days to undergo a psychiatric assessment at the Waterford Hospital, St.\nJohn’s. Dr. Ladha prepared the report for the court -the appellant’s fitness\nassessment. He explained that subsequent to the preparation of his report for\nthe court, about January 5th or 6th, 1988, he received a letter from the\nappellant. The letter was postmarked January 5th, was unsigned and addressed to\nDr. Ladha. On the envelope it said it was from R.C. Dr. Ladha explained that\napparently he had advised the appellant he could write him if there were other\nmatters he wished to mention. The letter was written while the appellant was in\nhospital and he gave it to a nurse who mailed it to Dr. Ladha. The letter,\nexhibit “Consent 1A”, reads as follows:“Dr. Ladha“I am writing this for it is easier for\nme to put how I feel on paper than to say it. Lately I’ve been thinking a lot\nabout death. I have done just about everything in my life. Except kill, but I\nknow something inside me wants to try it someday. Someday I would like to rape\na woman then kill her while I am climaxing. This is what I think about\neveryday. When I do something that is wrong with children, or gays, it’s like I\ngo in to some kind of daze and voices tell me what to do. I can’t seem to stop\nmyself it’s like the impact of what I’ve done doesn’t hit til it’s over. The\nscenes keep going through my mind like a continuous film like a movie, it’s\nburning desire in me that can be only quenched by orgasm.“These voices aren’t audible, they are\nvoices in my mind. I don’t think that anyone but those involved in the act can\nhear them. I love children what really turns me on is their big puffy pussy\nlips no hairs on them. I love just putting my tongue in there and licking their\nlittle assholes, then sticking my cock in there. Then I hear them saying fuck\nme, fuck me, let me suck on that cock of yours and come in my mouth. To me this\nis the ultimate turn on.“I had a dream the other night that I\nkilled my family. I cut off my oldest daughters head and placed it at the top\nof the stairs. My wife is tied up the whole time. I then cut off my sons head\nand put it in the microwave an turn it on. I then make love to my youngest\ndaughter she loves it screaming at me to fuck her harder. I then cut her head\noff and threw it in the dryer. I then cut the arms and legs off my children and\nput them in the oven and turned it on 500 degrees. Then I go to my wife and\nuntie her she looks around and sees what I’ve done and turns around and looks\nat me and starts screaming and I shoot her in the face with a shotgun. I am the\nDark Angel. I am a servant of Satan he rewards me with the desires that burn\nwith in me. He is the one who gives me these children to make love to. I tried\nto follow God but he has given me nothing but trouble. Besides there is more\nrewards in this life if you follow Satan. Satan has told me the only way that I\ncan become a high priest is to kill someone. A woman or a child gains the\nhighest merits. Yes death is the ultimate orgasm and I need release. Something\nis going to happen Satan has to be appeased, so far sacrifice has not been\nexcepted.”Dr. Ladha was very alarmed by the letter’s\ncontent and concerned that he may have misjudged the patient’s case, it being “a\nmuch more serious situation than I’d judged it to be before”. He reported the\nletter to all appropriate authorities including the Crown prosecutor and\ndefence counsel.[59]Dr. Ladha interviewed the appellant at the\npenitentiary concerning matters arising from the letter. He eventually\nconcluded that the letter revealed the appellant’s feelings and true state of\nmind. Dr. Ladha subsequently reviewed the complete file on the appellant.[60]Dr. Ladha’s opinions and conclusions were\nsummarized in his report prepared in September of 1988 in preparation for the\ndangerous offender application referred to above.Dr. D.\nPaulse[61]Dr. Paulse, the psychiatrist nominated by the\ndefence, had views contrary to those of Dr. Ladha on several issues,\nparticularly on the question of whether the letter was a hoax. A brief summary\ntherefore of the main opinions and conclusions of Dr. Paulse.[62]Dr. Paulse had practised forensic psychiatry in\nNewfoundland for some 20 years and was declared an expert in that field for the\npurposes of this application. He had known the appellant since 1975. Dr. Paulse\ncommenced his testimony by making several general statements concerning the\nappellant: that he is not suffering from any mental illness but suffers from\npersonality flaws that get him into trouble; that he is of relatively superior\nintelligence meaning that he functions mentally on the high level of normal. He\ndescribed the appellant as immature and extremely impulsive; that he has\npsychopathic tendencies and tends to act in an antisocial way, being a person\nwhose needs have to be gratified immediately.[63]Dr. Paulse also stated that the appellant was\nmanipulative, manipulating people and circumstances to his own advantage.[64]Dr. Paulse first met the appellant when he was\nin the penitentiary serving a nine month sentence for a narcotics offence. R.C.\nbecame depressed and wanted to get out of the penitentiary. Dr. Paulse said\nthat he had to send R.C. to the hospital because of wrist slashing and\ngenerally being upset. He said that the appellant told him that he did not like\nit in the penitentiary and wanted to get into the hospital. He eventually\nconcluded that the wrist slashing was a manipulative act on his part and the\nway he functions. He explained that on one occasion the appellant’s wife “kicked”\nhim out of his house and he had no place to go and saw the hospital as a haven\nand tried to get in. Sometimes the appellant said the most ridiculous things to\nmembers of the staff and Dr. Paulse recited one occasion when he walked down\nWaterford Bridge Road in his bare feet when it was cold and wet, indicating he\ncould not cope on the outside and wanted to be admitted to hospital. There was\nanother occasion when he came to the hospital saying that he had raped a 14\nyear old girl and had had sex with a cat. Dr. Paulse related how he was having\na cup of tea in the doctor’s common room when he spoke to the doctor then\nlooking after R.C. and, having discussed the matter, he advised the doctor: “I\ndon’t think he should be allowed to make use of the hospital the way he does”.\nThe matter of the rape was reported to the police. According to Dr. Paulse, “they\njust passed it by”; the appellant stayed in the hospital for a short period.[65]In his testimony, Dr. Paulse also mentioned that\nthe appellant had spoken to him on many occasions of having studied religion\nand being very interested in religion with involvement in church movements. Dr.\nPaulse stated, “everything - everything that R.C. says to me - I tend to be a\nlittle suspect of what he says because anyone as manipulative is the sort of\nperson that I am always suspicious of and I don’t take everything they say as\ngospel”.[66]During examination-in-chief, Dr. Paulse was\nasked to explain the appellant’s manipulative character. He replied by stating\nthat manipulation was part of his method of making his way through life; that\nthe appellant had never been able to direct himself into any meaningful occupation\nand had never been able to integrate himself into society properly in that his\nwork record was poor, his family history poor, and his marriage always\nturbulent because of his serious personality flaws. He said that the appellant\nwas not able to function as an average reasonable citizen. It was Dr. Paulse’s\nopinion that it was because of the appellant’s inability to integrate himself\ninto society that he relied on other means, primarily the manipulation of\npeople, and it was a mechanism he used all the time.[67]It is against that background that Dr. Paulse\nreferred to the appellant’s letter to Dr. Ladha. The following is taken from\nthe transcript and is Dr. Paulse’s response to a request from defence counsel\nto comment on the letter:“…. Well, I was very troubled when that\nwas brought to my attention. I immediately confronted him with it, and he had\nthe following explanation. He said, ‘I wrote that letter’, as he said it in the\ntestimony that he gave, ‘I wrote that letter to Dr. Ladha because I knew I was\ngoing to be pilloried in the Penitentiary. I couldn’t see myself going through\ntwo or three or five years in a penal institute as a sex offender, and I\nthought that in writing that letter I would look absolutely crazy to Dr. Ladha\nand that he would in fact then certify me and put me into the Waterford as a\nLieutenant-Governor warrant case’. That to me seemed just a further extension\nof the manipulation that’s been going on always with him..\n. . . .“… . Now, I decided in the light of what\nhe said, I decided then to get into a very detailed review of the contents of\nthat letter and everything, every topic that was brought up there, researched\nout very diligently to me. I spent many hours with him, trying to cheese out of\nhim any validity for any of the things in his own mind and his own behaviour in\nthe past, and there was just a massive denial, … whatever I touched on,\nwhatever was brought out in the dialogue that went on between us. He just\ndenied anything that was contained in that letter. He told me very very frankly\nthat this was an effort on his part to get Dr. Ladha to get him admitted to the\nhospital on the Lieutenant-Governor’s warrant, and that he would do his time\nthere, whatever - and this would keep him out of the prison system.”[68]At one point during cross-examination Crown\ncounsel observed that R.C. always said what is suitable (convenient) at the\ntime - what he thinks is the most impressive. To that statement, Dr. Paulse\nresponded:“Well that’s what I’ve been trying to\nindicate all of the time that he’s a manipulator par excellence, this young man\nresorts to lies and fabrications, distortions and so on, and they’re all\nself-serving all the time.”Decision\n- Trial Judge[69]The trial judge reviewed the appellant’s\ncriminal record and the testimony of the sexual assaults involving W.B., H.W.\nand K.S. and his ex-wife P.C., He accepted their account of physical and sexual\nabuse by the appellant.[70]The trial judge noted that the opinions by the\npsychiatrists differed significantly in that Dr. Ladha conducted his\npsychiatric analysis on the basis that the letter from the respondent outlined\nhis true feelings and accurately represented his state of mind, whereas Dr.\nPaulse viewed the letter as a hoax, just another manipulative manoeuvre.In this\nregard, the trial judge stated:“After hearing the evidence presented by\nboth the Crown and the defence including the evidence of the respondent, and\nhaving reviewed the exhibits filed with the court, I find that the letter\nwritten to Dr. Ladha by the respondent accurately depicts the respondent’s\nfeelings. I reject the proposition that the letter was a ‘hoax’. I therefore\naccept the psychiatric testimony of Dr. Ladha.”At this point in his decision the trial judge\nreviewed the report and testimony of just Dr. Ladha.[71]The trial judge considered the burden of proof\nunder s. 688(b) of the Code observing that in R. v. Carleton, 1983 CanLII 157 (SCC), [1983]\n2 S.C.R. 58; 52 N.R. 293; 47 A.R. 160; 36 C.R.(3d) 393; 6 C.C.C.(3d) 480,\naffing. (1981), 1981 ABCA 220 (CanLII), 32 A.R. 181; 23 C.R.(3d) 129; 69 C.C.C.(2d) 1 (C.A.), the court\nheld that the burden on the Crown to establish to the “satisfaction of the\ncourt”, the criteria set out in s. 688(b) of the Code, is proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt.[72]In his decision the trial judge also refers to\nthe statement of La Forest, J., in R. v. Lyons, 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309; 80\nN.R. 161; 82 N.S.R.(2d) 271; 207 A.P.R. 271; 37 C.C.C.(3d) 1; 61 C.R.(3d) 1; 44\nD.L.R.(4th) 193, to the effect that s. 688(b) requires proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the offender represents a threat of some sort to\nsociety and that it is not required that the Crown establish beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the offender will act in a certain way. In other Words,\nit must only be proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the offender is\ndangerous, the test for dangerousness being whether there is a certain\npotential or a risk of harm in the future.[73]The trial judge was aware that once an\nindividual is declared a “dangerous offender” he had the discretion to impose a\nsentence of indeterminate detention or, in the alternative, a sentence of fixed\nduration appropriate to the predicate offence. He mentions the public interest,\nthe need for protection of the public and the psychiatric prognosis. He points\nout that the appellant has a severe personality disorder and will respond\npoorly to treatment, a cure not being probable within the immediate future. In\nconclusion, the trial judge stated that he found the appellant to be a\ndangerous offender and imposed a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an\nindeterminate period.Grounds\nOf Appeal[74]Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial\njudge made an error in law in finding the appellant to be a dangerous offender\nin view of the relatively minor nature of the predicate offences; that the\ntrial judge failed to apply the proper standard of proof in relation to\noffences for which the appellant had not been previously convicted; that the\nleading of evidence of unproven offences violated the appellant’s right to a\nfair hearing and his right to make full answer and defence as guaranteed by the\nCharter; that the trial judge made an error in law in considering the\nevidence of W.B. when the alleged offence had no legal nexus to Canada having\ntaken place entirely within the United States; that the trial judge made an\nerror in law in attaching undue weight to the letter to Dr. Ladha by the\nappellant considering the appellant’s explanation for having written the\nletter; that the trial judge made an error in law in accepting the testimony of\nDr. Ladha over the testimony of Dr. Paulse; and finally, that the trial judge\nwas in error in imposing an indeterminate sentence.Analysis\nAnd Conclusions[75]The trial judge in very brisk language dismissed\nDr. Paulse’s testimony by saying “I reject the proposition (by Dr. Paulse) that\nthe letter was a ‘hoax’. I therefore accept the psychiatric testimony of Dr.\nLadha”. Without further comment or explanation, he summarily discarded all the\ntestimony of Dr. Paulse. The trial judge then proceeded to review in some\ndetail Dr. Ladha’s evidence and does not again mention Dr. Paulse’s name or\nviews. That the trial judge was entitled -empowered - to reject the testimony\nof Dr. Paulse, an expert witness, in whole or in part, is not in question.\nWhether the trial judge’s unqualified repudiation of all Dr. Paulse’s evidence\nwas ill-founded and not a discretion judicially exercised, is another matter.\nMore will be said on this point shortly.[76]This application is made pursuant to para, (b)\nof s. 688 quoted above and it is expedient at this point to repeat the three\nconditions to be established for a dangerous offender application to exceed:(1) That the\npredicate offence be a “serious personal injury offence”;(2) That the\noffender, by his conduct in any sexual manner including that involved in the\npredicate offence, has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses; and,(3) That the\noffender, by his conduct has shown a likelihood of causing injury, pain or\nother evil to other persons through failure in the future to control his sexual\nimpulses.As already explained, a sexual assault is a\nserious personal injury offence by definition (s. 687(b)).[77]I have already made reference to the word “may”\nappearing twice in the latter part of s. 688 in the context that if the Crown\nestablishes the three conditions just mentioned, “the court may find the\noffender to be a dangerous offender, and may thereupon impose a sentence\nof detention … for an indeterminate period”. Whether the “may” first appearing\nin s. 688(b) gives the trial judge a discretion not to declare an offender to\nbe a dangerous offender upon proof of the conditions or statutory criteria\nunder the section, is still unclear. In Lyons at p. 338 S.C.R., La\nForest, J., for the majority, in explaining ss. 688 and 676 stated:“Finally, the court has the discretion\nnot to designate the offender as dangerous or to impose an indeterminate\nsentence, even in circumstances where all of these criteria are met.”That is a definitive statement and I would have\nthought it ended the matter but I am not so sure that is the case. In R. v.\nJ.Y. (1996), 1996 CanLII 4916 (SK CA), 141 Sask.R. 132; 114 W.A.C. 132; 104 C.C.C.(3d) 512 (C.A.),\nthe Saskatchewan Court of Appeal was primarily concerned with the issue of\ndeterminate versus indeterminate sentence. Sherstobitoff, J.A., writing for the\ncourt, quoted the above statement by La Forest, J., in Lyons and said: “[W]e\nwill proceed on the same assumption”. As the Saskatchewan Appeal Court had only\nto decide the appropriateness of an indeterminate sentence, I cannot consider\ntheir “assumption” unqualified agreement with the statement by Justice La\nForest.[78]In R. v. Boutilier (J.H.), supra, the\nNova Scotia Court of Appeal, in commenting on the suggestion by counsel that\nthe trial judge has a discretion in determining whether the appellant is a\ndangerous offender, made no mention of Lyons but cited R. v.\nCarleton, supra, and R. v. Moore (1985), 7 O.A.C. 33; 1985 CanLII 1971 (ON CA), 16 C.C.C.(3d)\n328; 1985 CanLII 182 (SK CA), 44 C.R.(3d) 1.37; 49 O.R.(2d) 1 (C.A.), as authority for the proposition\nthat “[O]nce the statutory criteria, set out in s. 753(b) of the Code, have\nbeen established, the trial judge has no choice but to declare the appellant a\ndangerous offender”.[79]Ewaschuk, Criminal Pleadings and Practice in\nCanada (2nd Ed.), vol. 1, para. 18:3480, and Ruby, Clayton, Sentencing (4th\nEd. 1994), page 119, footnotes 11, 12 and 13 make no reference to the statement\nof La Forest, J., in Lyons and conclude the position to be that once the\nstatutory criteria have been met, proof beyond a reasonable doubt of the\nconditions - the trial judge does not have the discretion not to declare the\naccused a dangerous offender. Salhany, Roger E., Canadian Criminal Procedure\n(6th Ed. 1994), p. 8-58, para. 8.1710 also makes no reference to the\nstatement of La Forest, J., in Lyons and points out that the\nOntario Court of Appeal has held that once statutory criteria have been met,\nthe judge has no discretion to refuse to make the finding that the accused is a\ndangerous offender. In support of this statement Salhany cites R. v. Crosby (1982),\n1 C.C.C.(3d) 233 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Moore, supra; R. v. Poutsoungas (1989),\n49 C.C.C.(3d) 388 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal refused (1992), 138 N.R. 418; 56\nO.A.C. 159; 70 C.C.C.(3d) vi (S.C.C.).[80]Still on this point, La Forest, J.,’s statement\nthat the court has the discretion not to designate the offender as dangerous,\neven where the criteria have been met, was made in the context of an analysis\nof s. 688 during a discussion of the question of whether Part XXI, now Part\nXXIV, Dangerous Offenders - indeterminate detention - constitutes cruel and\nunusual punishment under s. 12 of the Charter. The statement was not the\nratio decidendi of the case.[81]I am uncertain how far-reaching the point is or\nif it is of any practical significance. If the Crown proves beyond a reasonable\ndoubt the statutory criteria, it is difficult to imagine circumstances that\nnegate a declaration of dangerous offender. If that prospect for some reason\nconcerns the trial judge hearing the application, he has the discretion -\noption - to forego an indeterminate sentence and simply sentence the offender\nfor the offence for which he has been convicted. In this connection, the cases\nhave consistently held that upon a finding of dangerous offender the trial\njudge does have the discretion not to impose an indeterminate sentence: R.\nv. Carleton, supra; R. v. Moore, supra. See also Canadian\nCriminal Procedure (6th Ed. 1994), Roger E. Salhany at para. 8.1710, p.\n8-58.[82]The question of whether an offender will respond\nto treatment and, in time, be cured, is frequently difficult to resolve. The\ncases however, have settled the point that the trial judge in determining\nwhether an accused is a dangerous offender is not entitled to take into account\nthe probability of a cure. Response to treatment and probability of a cure is,\nnevertheless, a relevant consideration in the exercise of a judge’s discretion\nto impose a fixed term or an indeterminate sentence.[83]Counsel for the appellant attacks the trial\njudge’s finding of dangerous offender contending that much of the evidence was\nflawed and improperly admitted. He argues that an indeterminate sentence was\nnot necessary or appropriate.[84]Although the trial judge appears to have\ncomplied with the requirements of the sections of the Criminal Code pertaining\nto a dangerous offender application, there are several areas of concern that\nput in question the validity of his finding of dangerous offender and, more\nparticularly, the imposition of an indeterminate sentence, the subject of this\nappeal.Predicate\nOffence[85]The predicate offence consisted of two\nconvictions for sexual assault and as already mentioned was, by definition, a “serious\npersonal injury offence”, it being the first of the three conditions necessary\nfor a finding of dangerous offender.[86]The sexual assault on A. consisted mainly of the\nappellant touching his penis, smacking his behind and on one occasion putting\nhis finger in his rectum. The sexual assault on L. was the occasion when the\nappellant was lying on her bed and put his hand on her “flower” - vagina. The\ntrial judge dismissed the charge in respect to S. but her testimony was to the\neffect that the appellant touched her on her breasts, outside her clothing, and\ngenerally teased her about the development of her breasts. Without intending to\nbelittle the sexual assaults or underestimate their repercussions for the children,\nit is apparent that in comparison to the horrendous child sexual assaults\nreported today, the offences in this case are minor; they are not comparable to\nthe vast number of very serious child sexual abuse cases now regularly\nprosecuted. It was these two convictions nevertheless, that prompted the\ndangerous offender application resulting in the appellant’s incarceration for\nan indeterminate period.[87]As I have said, it is the predicate offence - “the\ncommission of the offence for which he has been convicted” that provokes the\ndangerous offender application, and it is a legal proceeding with very ominous\nconsequences, one that can lead to an indefinite loss of liberty. In Lyons, La\nForest, J., made the following observation about the predicate offence:“What s. 688 does is to permit a judge to\nimpose a sentence of indeterminate detention on an individual for having\ncommitted an offence, which sentence is ‘in lieu of any other sentence\nthat might be imposed for the offence for which the offender has been convicted’\n(emphasis added). The individual is clearly being sentenced for the ‘serious\npersonal injury offence’ he or she has been found guilty of committing, albeit\nin a different way than would ordinarily be done. It must be remembered that\nthe appellant was not picked up off the street because of his past criminality\n(for which he has already been punished), or because of fears or suspicions\nabout his criminal proclivities, and then subjected to a procedure in order to\ndetermine whether society would be better off it he were incarcerated\nindefinitely. Rather, he was arrested and prosecuted for a very serious violent\ncrime and subjected to procedure aimed at determining the appropriate penalty\nthat should be inflicted upon him in the circumstances.“Thus, the appellant’s contention that he\nis being punished for what he might do rather than for what he has done or, in\nmore traditional terms, that he is being found guilty in the absence of a\nfinding of the requisite actus reus, must be rejected. The punishment, as I\nnoted, flows from the actual commission of a specific crime, the requisite\nelements of which have been proved to exist beyond a reasonable doubt.”[88]In R. v. Newman (1994), 1994 CanLII 9717 (NL CA), 115 Nfld. \u0026\nP.E.I.R. 197; 360 A.P.R. 197 (Nfld. C.A.), at p. 213, Justice Marshall of this\ncourt made reference to the predicate offence in these terms:“It is clear that inclusion of the\npredicate offence of serious personal violence as an integral and essential\ncomponent of the offender’s behavioural pattern is a sine qua non of any\ndangerous offender finding under either of the provisions referenced in this\ncase. Each one requires one last act of serious personal violence to anchor the\noffender’s pattern of pre-existing unrestrained or uninhibited behaviour before\nthat person can be branded as a public threat warranting imposition of a prison\nterm of indefinite duration. The predicate offence represents, so to speak, the\nlast straw in a series of dangerous violence on the part of the perpetrator.”[89]I do not read these two statements concerning\nthe nature of the predicate offence as saying that the “offence for which he\nhas been convicted” must be the most serious offence of all. Section 688(b)\nstates that the offender must have been convicted of a serious personal injury\noffence as described in s. 687(b) and that means of course that the conviction\nfor any sexual assault will suffice, regardless of how serious it may be. I\nbelieve it fair to say however, that usually the predicate offence that\ninstigates a dangerous offender application is one that is very serious.\nOrdinarily the predicate offence is by an individual with a history of violent\nconduct, sexual or otherwise, who commits an offence of such a magnitude that\nthe Crown has a duty to seek a declaration of dangerous offender status and an\nindeterminate sentence. I am perplexed therefore as to why or how the predicate\noffence in this case instigated the dangerous offender application. It was a\nserious personal injury offence by definition only, yet it impelled the Crown\nto launch a dangerous offender application.[90]R. v. Currie (R.O.R.) (1995), 1995 CanLII 1057 (ON CA), 86 O.A.C. 143; 103 C.C.C.(3d) 281, is a decision of the\nOntario Court of Appeal respecting a finding by the Ontario Court (General\nDivision) that the appellant was a dangerous offender. In Currie the\nappellant had a serious criminal record involving sexual assaults. In 1976 he\nhad been convicted of rape and two charges of indecent assault one being\naccompanied by particularly violent acts. In 1979 the appellant indecently\nassaulted a female by grabbing her in her genital area from behind. In 1982 he\nhad been convicted of loitering and of indecently assaulting a female. The\nthree sexual assault offences that were the predicate offences occurred on\nNovember 5th, 1988 and took place in a shopping mall involving young girls\nranging from nine to 13 years of age. The assault was in touching the girls.[91]In Currie, Finlayson, J.A., writing for\nthe court referred to Lyons and quoted the statement of La Forest, J.,\nmentioned above. Having quoted the statement of La Forest, J., in Lyons, Justice\nFinlayson made the following comment:“In Lyons, La Forest, J.,\ndescribed the appellant’s predicate offences leading to the dangerous offender\napplication as constituting ‘very serious violent crime’. In the case on\nappeal, the trial judge failed to consider the gravity of the predicate\noffences in isolation from his previous offences …. Not only does this\nconclusion indicate an improper shifting of the burden of proof, it also\nindicates that the basis for assessing the appellant’s present propensity to\ncommit future violent acts was almost exclusively his past criminality for\nwhich he had already been punished. Such an approach was expressly condemned in\nLyons in the passages previously cited.”The Ontario Court of Appeal allowed the appeal,\nquashed the order for an indeterminate sentence and substituted a sentence of\ntime served. (R. v. Currie: application for leave to appeal to the\nSupreme Court of Canada filed and leave granted May 9, 1996 (1996), 201 N.R.\n240; 93 O.A.C. 160.)[92]As I have already pointed out, the predicate\noffence in this case, weighed against most sexual assaults heard in courtrooms\ntoday, can hardly be considered a “very serious violent crime”. As in Currie,\nthe trial judge here dwelt almost exclusively with the appellant’s criminal\npast and the sexual assaults on the women with whom he was in a relationship.\nThe predicate offence involving the assaults on his children were virtually\nignored. Clearly, the trial judge was greatly influenced by the violence of the\nappellant in his relationships with his ex-wife P.C., H.W., K.S. and W.B. and\nthat in my opinion raises another very serious concern about the trial judge’s\nconclusions.[93]The appellant’s past criminality involved\nphysical and sexual abuse of the four female witnesses mentioned. On reviewing\nthe transcript and reading the factums it immediately became obvious that all\nthe female complainants - victims - had at least one thing in common: at the\ntime of the abuse and assaults they were in a close, at times intimate,\npersonal relationship with the appellant. W.B. was nine years old and the\nappellant, then age 16 years, her babysitter. They were good neighbours and\ntheir mothers were best friends. In that manner the two families were very\nclosely associated. H.W. and the appellant were married very shortly after they\nmet - the marriage that lasted five days. She related that the appellant “thought\nthat sexual intercourse would make things right”; that the appellant sent her\nletters telling her he loved her, and that he wanted her to come home. She\ndescribed the appellant as a “possessive and jealous person”. Although the\nmarriage was a disaster, the point is that they were in an intimate\nrelationship at the time.[94]K.S. and the appellant met through their church\nin Medicine Hat, Alberta. She alleges two sexual assaults: one before she left\non holiday to Bermuda and the second upon her return. She said that the night\nbefore her departure they were drinking wine and the appellant told her that he\nloved her. He tried to kiss her. Upon her return the appellant immediately\ncontacted her and attempted to continue or renew their relationship. K.S.\nrejected the appellant’s overtures and he erupted in anger. Once again the\nappellant attempted, but failed in his search for a permanent close personal\nrelationship.[95]P.C. was the appellant’s ex-wife and she related\na harrowing story of abuse, physical and sexual, when married to the appellant.\nIt is significant however, to note her evidence about the circumstances at the time\nshe permitted her divorced husband, the appellant, to return home in August of\n1987. (It was during that three month visit that the predicate offences\noccurred.) They had been divorced for about five years. P.C. gave the following\nreply to the prosecutor’s request for an explanation of why she permitted her\nex-husband back in her home:“P.C: Well, he came back to visit the\nkids. I asked him to come back because he was writing and phoning me for about\nthree or four months.”[96]P.C. also made the following response to the\nprosector’s question of how the children felt about their father returning\nhome:“P.C: They were happy. They were really\ndelighted, right. You know, I can’t say they weren’t because they really were,\nespecially R.C.“Prosecutor: So they were hoping to get\ntogether and…“P.C: Yes.“Prosecutor: Be a regular family?“P.C: You know, they love their father. I\nknow they do.”I mention this point only to show the appellant’s\ntenacious attempt to embrace or maintain the link he believed he had or still\nwanted with his family, including his former wife.[97]It is against this background that an aspect of\nthe testimony of Dr. Paulse must be viewed. The following are statements\nselected from Dr. Paulse’s testimony that emphasize his opinion that the\nappellant’s violence and excessive sexual energy was directed solely against\nfemales with whom he was absorbed and having a close relationship at the time:“Dr. Paulse: That’s all part of the\npsychopathy.“Per curiam: He has essentially raped his\nwife, he has essentially rapes his second wife, H.W., according to her\ntestimony. According to the testimony of K.S., he raped her, and according to a\nyoung girl, W.B., he raped her when she was nine.“Dr. Paulse: Yes, that I can see..\n. . . .“Dr. Paulse: But when he rapes, he\nrapes within the family.“Per curiam: Rapes his women?.\n. . . .“Dr. Paulse: Yeah, rapes his woman in\nthe family, he keeps, he’s delinquent..\n. . . .“Dr. Paulse: He doesn’t rape people,\nhe rapes his wives.“Per curiam: He rapes women.“Dr. Paulse: Yeah, and he feels that\nhe is not raping them..\n. . . .“Dr. Paulse: He has dedicated himself to\nhelter skelter, on the rampage, in his family..\n. . . .“Dr. Paulse: I don’t want to give you\nthe impression that this man is going to be a threat to society at large. He\nhas proven all along that he’s a threat to the particular people that he’s\ninvolved with are wives and immediate people that are there, like W.B., she was\nnext door, and his kids..\n. . . .“Dr. Paulse: But there has never been\na single occurrence that I am aware of, of having inflicted danger - dangerous\nbehaviour on anyone outside of his family situation. So, there’s no\nhistory of him being a danger at large.“Per curiam: No, he’s only a danger to\npeople he knows.“Dr. Paulse: A danger to the people he\nknow. To his family.“Per curiam: To his family..\n. . . .“Per curiam: She considered herself a\ngirlfriend, a boyfriend of K.S. -“Dr. Paulse: Yes, that is one, you know,\nthese are people that are close to him.“Per curiam: He took a fancy to her.“Dr. Paulse: People in sight -“Per curiam: Yes, yes..\n. . . .“Dr. Paulse: If he gets married, we’ll\nsee the same sort of thing.“Per curiam: No, not if he gets married,\nI suppose, if has any relationships.“Dr. Paulse: Or gets another girlfriend,\nwe will see the same thing..\n. . . .“Dr. Paulse: … as we see it now with him,\nas we have seen it with him, what has been going on with this young man is that\nit occurs in a restricted environment, it doesn’t occur in the public at\nlarge..\n. . . .“Dr. Paulse: . . . . Ah, whatever rape\noccurs, occurs there. Whatever molestation of kids occur there.”[98]I have already said that the trial judge was\nentitled to accept, in whole or in part, the testimony of one psychiatrist to\nthe exclusion of all or part of the testimony of the other psychiatrist. In\nthat respect he had a very broad discretion, one that cannot easily be\ninterfered with by an appellate court. The fact is that Dr. Ladha and Dr.\nPaulse did agree on many points and, in any event, it is very unlikely that the\ntrial judge actually disagreed with every opinion of Dr. Paulse. The question\nmay still be asked, however, if in the exercise of his discretion the trial\njudge failed to take into consideration some relevant factor or took into\nconsideration some factor that was irrelevant. Did he overlook some important\nfact or circumstance that likely affected his conclusions and outcome of the\nmatter?[99]As explained in some detail above, the trial\njudge summarily disregarded Dr. Paulse’s evidence and adopted wholeheartedly\nthe position and testimony of Dr. Ladha, without giving reasons. It will be\nrecalled that earlier in this judgment, upholding the convictions by the trial\njudge of the sexual assault charges (predicate offence), I pointed out that the\nSupreme Court recently restated its position that although it was preferable a\ntrial judge give reasons, and in some cases imperative, by itself the absence\nof reasons by a trial judge is not a fatal error. If the finding by a trial\njudge is supportable by the evidence or obvious from the circumstances, reasons\nare not crucial. The test is the reasonableness of the finding.[100]The decision by the trial judge to give\nunqualified recognition to the views of Dr. Ladha, to the complete exclusion of\nthe opinions of Dr. Paulse, was a decision that sealed the fate of the\nappellant - the designation as a dangerous offender becoming a certainty. Dr.\nLadha’s analysis and opinions labelled the appellant a dangerous offender,\nmeeting the statutory criteria contained in s. 688 of the Code. The\nsignificantly opposed views of Dr. Paulse ceased to be examined. As I see it,\nthe decision by the trial judge repudiating any consideration of Dr. Paulse’s\nopinions, called for reasons or explanation. It was not a ruling immediately\nobvious from the facts or circumstances.[101]In the circumstances of this case it was not\nsufficient for the trial judge to say that he accepted the opinion of Dr. Ladha\nand rejected the views of Dr. Paulse. As this application evolved, it was\nimperative to give reasons why the evidence or testimony of Dr. Paulse was\nrepudiated. The decision to ignore Dr. Paulse’s opinions without explanation\ntakes on the appearance of a discretion not judicially exercised, a ruling\narbitrarily made.[102]In R. v. Towne Cinema Theatres Ltd., 1985 CanLII 75 (SCC), [1985]\n1 S.C.R. 494; 59 N.R. 101; 61 A.R. 35; 45 C.R.(3d) 1; 18 D.L.R.(4th) 1; 18\nC.C.C.(3d) 193, an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from a judgment of the\nAlberta Court of Appeal, the court had to determine the proper test in finding\nan accused guilty of presenting an obscene entertainment (film). The Supreme\nCourt concluded that it is the trier of fact who must formulate an opinion of\nwhat the contemporary Canadian community will tolerate in order to determine “undueness”\nin the context of “undue exploitation of sex”. The facts in Towne Cinema are\nnot germane but in that context Chief Justice Dickson at p. 517 S.C.R. made the\nfollowing statement:“The law is clear that a trier of fact\ndoes not have to accept testimony, whether expert or otherwise. He can reject\nit, in whole or in part. He cannot, however, reject it without good reason. In\nthis case, it was incumbent on the trial judge to consider and assess the\nweight, if any, to be given to the evidence,.\n. . . .“In the present case the trial judge\nshould certainly not have rejected the evidence before him without explanation.”[103]In Towne Cinema the adducing of evidence,\nexpert or otherwise, of the “community standard of tolerance” was optional. On\nthe hearing of the application in the present case, s. 690 of the Code mandated\nthat the trial judge hear evidence of dangerous offender status “of at least\ntwo psychiatrists”. Unlike the situation in Towne Cinema where expert\ntestimony was not compulsory, here the testimony of two experts -psychiatrists\n- was by statute obligatory. Although the trial judge was at liberty to accept\nor reject, in whole or in part testimony of the psychiatrists, the appellant\nhaving been a patient of Dr. Paulse of longer standing, he was obliged to\nexplain why he completely rebuffed the testimony of the psychiatrist nominated\nby the offender. In our case the trial judge totally disregarded Dr. Paulse’s\nopinions without explanation. It is not possible to know or surmise if the\ntrial judge’s ruling was rational, or without grounds and wholly arbitrary. The\noutcome of the application, an indeterminate sentence, was the sequel to that\ncritical ruling and in all fairness it ought to have been explained.[104]One example of the seriousness of the trial\njudge’s failure to give some elucidation for his decision respecting the\nopposing opinions of the two psychiatrists, is that we do not know if he was\naware of the distinctive feature marking all the victims, that is to say, the\nsingularity of the appellant’s focus or target in committing the offences, in\nthat the victims - his children, spouse or female companions - were all of a\nvery small restricted class that generally can be described as “family”.[105]The trial judge was not heedful of the fact that\nthe female complainants and children all belonged to an identifiable group;\nthat the appellant’s physical and sexual abuse was confined to a very small\ncircle having a common affinity. The transcript shows that the trial judge\ndiscussed the point very briefly with Dr. Paulse but its import or consequences\nseems to have escaped his recognition. With all due respect, I am obliged to\nsay that it appears the same must be said of counsel. The factums are silent on\nthe point, not making any observation or argument that the victims were not\nindiscriminately or aimlessly selected from the community at large. What then\nis the significance of this factor on the prosecution of this dangerous\noffender application that ultimately resulted in the appellant receiving an\nindeterminate sentence?[106]I refer again to s. 688(b) of the Code and\ntwo requirements that must be “established to the satisfaction of the court”\n(proof beyond a reasonable doubt):That the offender,\nby his conduct in any sexual manner including that involved in the predicate\noffence, has shown a failure to control his sexual impulses; and,That the offender,\nby his conduct has shown a likelihood of causing injury, pain, or other evil to\nother persons through failure in the future to control his sexual impulses.The prosecution must establish that the offender,\nthe appellant, has failed to control his sexual impulses. A question to be\nasked is whether this pre-requisite has been or can be established if the lack\nof control or failure to control sexual impulses is confined to his family -\nintra familial - within the family. As I have suggested above, in this case, “family”\nis described as the offender’s spouse, children or partner, the partner being\nin an intimate relationship with the offender, or a friend with whom the\noffender seeks a much closer relationship. The question posed is not one that I\ncan answer or pursue, but it should have been considered by the trial judge.\nThe predicate offence involving his children and evidence of the other sexual\nassaults show that all the victims were within the “family”. An issue on this\napplication should have been: whether the narrowly defined group of victims -\nfamily - is a serious factor, or of no relevance whatsoever.[107]The other requirement to be established by the\nprosecution on a dangerous offender application is whether the offender, by his\nconduct, has shown a likelihood of causing injury, pain or evil “to other\npersons” through failure in the future to control his sexual impulses. Dr.\nLadha and Dr. Paulse would probably agree that a spouse or any female in a close\nrelationship with the appellant would encounter risk - a real likelihood - of\nphysical and sexual abuse by the appellant. Dr. Paulse points to the appellant’s\nhistory and says that the appellant’s family, (his spouse or female companion),\nis the only segment of the community at risk, whereas Dr. Ladha feels the\nthreat extends to the whole of the general public. The inquiry that seems to\nhave eluded counsel and the trial judge is simply this: if the risk or threat\nof causing injury, pain or evil reaches only to the offender’s family and not\nto the community at large, to what extent, if any, is an application under s.\n688 affected? Is this a valid point to be emphasized or, is there no\ndistinction to be made at all?[108]In analysing s. 688(b) and in determining if the\nrespondent has demonstrated a failure to control his sexual impulses and\nlikelihood of causing injury, pain or evil to other persons in the future, the\ntrial judge made no mention of the fact that the respondent’s victims were a\nsmall, easily identifiable class, namely, his family. To be perfectly clear,\nhowever, the suggestion is not, by implication or otherwise, that if the “other\npersons” at risk in the future is an individual or a small identifiable group,\nthat the offender is not, ipso facto, a dangerous offender, or one less likely\nto be a dangerous offender. That is not the notion. The point is that where the\nvictims and potential victims are known, very few in number, and belong to an\nidentifiable faction, that circumstance ought to be acknowledged and examined\non a s. 688 application. It is an element to be recognized, its weight or\nimport to be determined by the application’s judge together with all other\nfacts of the case. That scrutiny did not occur here, and I cannot be certain\nthat the outcome of the application would have been the same had the trial\njudge realized the distinctive nature of the “persons” presumably at risk in\nthe future. The gravity or extent of the risk would always be relevant.[109]Nonetheless, I reiterate that this appeal is not\nfrom the finding of the appellant to be a dangerous offender, but is an appeal\nonly in respect to the indeterminate sentence.[110]The trial judge resolved all questions in favour\nof the Crown and declared the appellant a dangerous offender. This appeal\nraises the issue of an appropriate sentence: determinate or indeterminate\ndetention. The circumstance that has been altered is recognition that the risk\nor threat is to a very narrow element: the offender’s family. Does that make a\ndifference? In this case that peculiarity was not considered in the fixing of\nthe sentence. In R. v. Boutilier (J.H.) at p. 14 C.C.C., the trial judge\nmade the following observation respecting treatment of a family abuser:“… Dr. Taylar further testified that he\ngot the impression that the appellant had been making an effort with some\nsuccess in changing his habits. Dr. Taylar agreed that the appellant was a\npaedophile with antisocial personality traits. He testified, however, that the\nprognosis for treatment with ‘intra-familial’ cases is better than with general\npaedophilia. He said there was less recidivism when the victim is a family\nmember than there is in a general paedophile who picks his victims at random.”I refer to this statement in R. v. Boutilier\n(J.H.) not as proof of the accuracy of the comment itself, or of the truth\nof the assertions that may be implicit from it. The sole reason this statement\nis mentioned is to support the view that the prognosis for treatment of\nintra-familial cases is an issue on sentencing - one that was not recognized in\nthis case.[111]Finally, I return to the matter of the letter\nand its interpretation: an accurate reflection of the appellant’s feelings and\nstate of mind, or a hoax and a ploy, and the appellant a schemer. I have little\ndoubt that if Dr. Ladha is correct in his assessment of the appellant and his\nletter, much of what has been said becomes irrelevant. Unfortunately the\nhearing of the dangerous offender application and the decision of the trial\njudge failed to reconcile or resolve the opposing opinions expressed about the\nappellant and his extraordinary letter. As I have implied, the predicate\noffences and the other sexual assaults, limited as they were to the appellant’s\nfamily and close female companions, were hardly the material of a strong\nprosecution case for a dangerous offender declaration. I have no doubt\nwhatsoever that it was the letter, by its ostensibly stark portrayal of a very\ntroubled and frightening individual, that shaped Dr. Ladha’s opinion that the\nappellant suffered from multiple sexual deviations including sadism,\npaedophilia, bi-sexuality, bestiality and possibly hypersexuality, dooming him\nto dangerous offender status. As I see the letter, in the light of the\ntestimony of the two psychiatrists, its significance and implications remain\nmoot - yet to be decided.[112]The appellant wrote another letter, one to his\nex-wife P.C., from Grand Falls, Newfoundland, on his way to departing the\nProvince, following P.C.’s demand that he immediately leave their home. The\nletter was written a couple of days after his three children were interviewed\nby Dr. Doucet on October 20th, 1987. Prior to his return to the Province and to\nthe home of his former wife and children, he had been travelling across Canada\nand the United States on a continuous basis for at least five years. In the\nmeantime he had been divorced. During that period, he had been in trouble with\nthe law in both countries and his attempts to form a stable relationship had\nall ended with calamitous results. His dismissal from the home of his former\nwife in October, 1987, was just the latest setback in a long history of similar\nmisfortune. He may or may not have been aware of the impending criminal\nprosecutions for the sexual assaults on his three children. It seems likely,\ntherefore, that he was conscious he would not see his family again or at least\nnot for a very long time. In these circumstances he wrote P.C. the following\nletter:“Dear P.C.,Goodbye, don’t worry I’ll never bother\nyou again for as long as you live. I love you and I always will be in love with\nyou. I know it could have worked, if we would have both worked at it very hard.\nBut we’ll never know now will we. Say goodbye to the kids for me. I’m sorry for\nany trouble I caused you.I won’t be back ever.Love R.C.”[113]It is more difficult to dismiss this letter as\nyet another stratagem: in the circumstances there could be no devious purpose\nfor at that late stage his involuntary exit from his home had all the omens of\nfinality; it is unlikely this letter was written with some motive he believed\nwould produce benefit or advantage. Whatever its implications or meaning this\nletter probably reflects the appellant’s pathetic but fruitless search for a “family”,\na pursuit his personality disorder or, if Dr. Ladha is correct, his multiple\nsexual deviations precluded, always leaving in its wake his spouse, children or\nfemale companion of the day - in a state of great upheaval.[114]I am not in a position to find, and am not\nsaying that the trial judge was wrong in the order he ultimately made. I am\nsaying, nevertheless, that in reaching the conclusions he did, he gave no\nreasons or explanation when he should have; that he failed to consider the\nevidence that the predicate offences and the appellant’s criminal background\nshow a strong probability that his criminal acts and behaviour are directed\nonly toward his so called family; and thirdly, that the letter to Dr. Ladha and\nthe disagreement between Dr. Ladha and Dr. Paulse over its interpretation\nremains unresolved. Missing from the trial judge’s analysis and decision is the\nunravelling and resolution of these three aspects and their consequence for the\nappellant on the s. 688 application.[115]Section 761(1) of the Criminal Code provides as\nfollows:“Subject to subsection (2), where a\nperson is in custody under a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an\nindeterminate period, the National Parole Board shall, forthwith after the\nexpiration of three years from the day on which that person was taken into\ncustody and not later than every two years thereafter, review the condition,\nhistory and circumstances of that person for the purpose of determining whether\nhe should be granted parole under Part II of the Correction and Conditional\nRelease Act and, if so, on what conditions.”I have no knowledge of or information about any\nreview pursuant to this section. If reviews have been held, I am not aware of\nthe results. The relevance and admissibility of such reviews were not raised by\ncounsel.[116]Section 694(3) of the Code stipulates\nthat on an appeal from a sentence of detention for an indeterminate period, the\nCourt of Appeal may (a) quash the sentence and impose the sentence that might\nhave been imposed in respect of the predicate offence, or order a new hearing\nor (b) dismiss the appeal. For reasons mentioned above, I would quash the\nindeterminate sentence and order a new hearing.New\nHearing[117]In ordering a new hearing pursuant to s. 759(3)\nthis much at least is clear: the new hearing in the Trial Division is in\nrespect to the imposition of an indeterminate sentence, the applications judge\nhaving declared the appellant to be a dangerous offender. As already stated\nabove, the Criminal Code does not explicitly authorize an appeal from\nthe finding by the trial judge that the appellant is a dangerous offender, and\nthe trial judge conducting the new hearing has jurisdiction only to impose\nsentence. He may impose “a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an\nindeterminate period” or, he may “impose any sentence that might have been\nimposed in respect of the offence for which the appellant was convicted”. The\nnew hearing is not a review of or an appeal from the decision of the\napplications judge by another Trial Division judge; it may be characterized as\na de novo hearing, a “fresh” hearing respecting sentence.[118]It will be recalled from what I have said above,\nthat the Court of Appeal hearing an appeal against an indeterminate sentence\nmust inevitably examine the regularity of the finding of dangerous offender;\nthat it is not possible for the Court of Appeal to adequately assess the\nappropriateness of an indeterminate sentence without evaluating and reflecting\non the evidence and conclusions of the trial judge who heard the application at\nfirst instance. Having said that, and being satisfied the new hearing is indeed\na re-hearing with evidence and argument, it follows that at the new hearing the\nTrial Division judge is at liberty to admit all evidence that is relevant to\nthe determination of an appropriate sentence.[119]On this basis it is a certainty that the new hearing\nwill entail the introduction of evidence that also pertains to the question of\nwhether the appellant is a dangerous offender. The applications judge in\nimposing the sentence he did, relied on Crown evidence adduced primarily to\nestablish the criteria for a declaration of the appellant as a dangerous\noffender pursuant to s. 688 (now s. 753). It was that evidence by the\nprosecution that persuaded the trial judge to declare the appellant a dangerous\noffender and impose the indeterminate sentence. The declaration that the\nappellant is a dangerous offender stands, but in ordering a new hearing\npursuant to s. 759(3) the Trial Division judge conducting the new hearing will\nbe obliged to entertain evidence that, in addition to being relevant to the\nformulation of a sentence, may also touch or impinge upon the dangerous\noffender status. This clumsy incongruity is the consequence flowing directly\nfrom s. 759 that only permits an appeal from sentence, when the real issue is\nthe designation of an accused as a dangerous offender.[120]Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in part. The\nappeal against the conviction is dismissed; the indeterminate sentence is set\naside and a new hearing ordered.Appeal allowed in part."}

Dhandhukia was convicted on\nFebruary 15, 2007 of an offence contrary to section 172.1, subsection (2) of\nthe Criminal Code of Canada. Specifically, he was charged that he, on or about\nthe 13th day of October in the year 2005, at the City of London, in the said\nregion did, by means of a computer system within the meaning of section 342.1,\nsubsection (2) of the Criminal Code, communicate with a person, namely Nathan\nStahle, who was or was believed to be under the age of 14 years, for the\npurpose of facilitating the commission of an offence under section 151 or 152\nof the Criminal Code with respect to that person, contrary to section 172.1,\nsubsection (2) of the Criminal Code of Canada.[2]On this sentencing, I have had the benefit of\nsubmissions from Mr. Spangenberg on behalf of the Crown and from Mr. Farrington\non behalf of the offender as well as the benefit of a pre-sentence report,\nwhich has been filed as Exhibit 1.[3]Mr. Farrington seeks a conditional sentence, or,\nin the alternative if a custodial sentence is found appropriate, a sentence of\n90 days to be served intermittently; whereas Mr. Spangenberg seeks a custodial\nsentence in the range of 12 to 24 months.[4]In approaching this matter, I am mindful of the\nguidance provided by the Ontario Court of Appeal to the effect that upon\nconviction for this offence the normal range of sentence is between 12 months and\n2 years and that it will be only in the rarest of cases that a conditional\nsentence will be appropriate. However, each case depends upon its own facts.[5]Therefore, I turn to the specific situation\nbefore me. The offender is almost 39 years old, having been born in India on June 17, 1968. He has a university\neducation and married when he was 28 years old. He and his wife have no\nchildren. At age 32, he migrated to Australia and then returned to India a year later, moving with his wife to\nCanada in December, 2001. He\nwas living in Mississauga at\nthe time of the offence with his wife, his brother, and his sister in law and the\nlatter’s 4 year old son. He is currently employed at Patheon Corporation.[6]As is usually the case, there are both\nmitigating and aggravating factors to consider. I will deal first with the\nmitigating factors, which are as follows:(a)The offender has no prior criminal record or any\nprior contact with the police and there is no evidence that he has abused\nchildren or possessed pornographic material.(b)He has been steadily and productively employed\nin meaningful work.(c)He does not consume alcohol or illicit\nnarcotics, both of which offend his religious beliefs and values.(d)He has been described by his wife and brother as\na responsible husband and family man. Neither has known him to be inappropriate\nwith children.(e)Over a period of 18 months he has been compliant\nwith the terms of his recognizance, which contains a number of very strict\nterms. In this regard, he has obtained his passport for a trip to India and has surrendered it promptly upon\nhis return. He has also obtained his passport for other legitimate activities\nand again has always surrendered it promptly after the occasion for which it\nwas needed.(f)Mr. Farrington submits that the court should\nhave no concern about the likelihood of the offender re-offending in light of\nthe fact that he could have stayed in India and avoided the consequences of the proceedings and could have\nre-offended but has chosen not to do so.(g)A forensic examination of the computer in\nquestion, undertaken by Officer Pamela Burke, revealed no visual images of\nunderage persons or “chats” or online conversations with such persons. The\nexamination also revealed that there had been an unsuccessful attempt to delete\nthe conversation in question.(h)Therefore, it is clear that the offender was\nengaged in only one such conversation on one date.(i)Mr. Farrington submits that at the time of the\noffender’s arrest, he was not in possession either of alcoholic beverages or\ncondoms.(j)The offender did not expose his penis or engage\nin sexual activity or sexual suggestions through photographs or by video camera\nduring the chat session. The only photograph he showed was a normal one of\nhimself.(k)The offender has just been promoted to a\nsupervisory position and a sentence of incarceration, other than one that might\nbe served intermittently, would result in a loss of employment and hardship for\nhis family.(l)Mr. Farrington describes the offender as one of\nthe most naïve persons he has ever represented and is a meek and mild mannered\nman. He submits that a custodial sentence would be extremely difficult for the\noffender to serve and that in fact, given the nature of the offence, he would\nbe in physical danger from other inmates in the institution and would have\ngreat difficulty “taking care of hinmself physically.”(m)Based upon his compliance with the terms of his\nrecognizance and with the requests of the probation officer who prepared the\npre-sentence report, he would be “a suitable candidate for a period of\ncommunity supervision should the court deem this a suitable part of\ndisposition.”[7]In considering the mitigating factors I note\nthat, unlike some of the cases to which counsel referred me, the offender did\nnot plead guilty and, therefore, is not entitled to the discount from penalty\nthat would normally be appropriate in that situation. On the other hand, he had\nevery right to have a trial and must not be penalized in any way for that\nchoice.[8]Also, I note from the pre-sentence report that\nhe “denied responsibility for the offence and further denied any sexual\ninterest in children. Consequently, his suitability for any treatment or\ncounselling programs available is questionable.” Mr. Farrington submits that\nthe offender has some difficulty with the language and maintains that he told\nthe probation officer who prepared the pre-sentence report that he made a\nmistake. This statement is not challenged by the Crown.[9]I turn then to deal with the aggravating\nfactors:(a)The offender believed he was “chatting” on line\nwith a 12 year old girl. There could be no doubt in his mind about her age\nbased upon the photographs Officer Stahle showed him on line and the fact that\nthe Officer represented to the offender clearly that he was a 12 year old\nfemale. In coming to this conclusion, I have recalled and taken into account the\noffender’s testimony that his experience was that people who visit “chat rooms”\noften lie about their personal attributes.(b)There is no doubt in my mind that the offender\nsought to engage in sexual intercourse with her. He drove from Mississauga to London to do so. BecauseLondon is where he believed the 12 year old\ngirl lived, travelling here would remove him from his normal surroundings and\nprovide a setting where it would be very unlikely that he would be recognized\nor identified by anyone other than the person he was going to meet.(c)In some of the decided cases, ithas been considered\na mitigating factor that when the accused was arrested he did not have any\ncondoms or alcohol with him. In this case, the offender indeed was found not to\nhave alcohol or condoms with him. However, I do not find the absence of condoms\nto be a mitigating factor in this case in view of the fact that the transcript\nof his on line “chat” shows that he sought to convince the other party to the\nconversation that unprotected sex was “unbilivable” (sic). In my opinion, the\nfact that he was prepared to have unprotected sexual intercourse with a 12 year\nold girl is an aggravating factor. The fact that he had no alcohol with him is\nconsistent with his religious beliefs and in my opinion is a neutral factor.(d)The offender was very evasive during his\ntestimony and lied to the court repeatedly in an attempt to avoid responsibilty\nfor his actions.[10]In sentencing the offender, I must consider the principles of\nsentencing as set forth in sections 718, and 718.2 of the Criminal Code. In my\nopinion, this is not one of “the rarest of cases” where a conditional sentence\nwould be appropriate. In coming to this conclusion, I recognize that a conditional\nsentence may carry a denunciatory and deterrent effect. However, given the\nnature of this offence and the actions of the offender, I have come to the\nconclusion that these important principles cannot be given sufficient force\nthrough a conditional sentence and that a custodial sentence is required to\nmeet them appropriately. This is not a case where the offender was suffering\nfrom some mental or psychological condition that might excuse to some degree\nthe nature of his conduct or act to ameliorate his sentence. Also, he is a\nmature and educated person and is not in the position of a young offender,\nwhich again might serve to ameliorate his sentence. There certainly was a\nmarked degree of planning to carry out the luring that he engaged in and sought\nto bring to fruition.[11]It is my opinion that the primary sentencing principles I must apply\nare those of denunciation and general deterrence. Also, I must never lose sight\nof the principle of rehabilitation, but my own view, unsupported by any\nevidence, is that specific deterrence is of lesser concern in this case.[12]Can these principles be satisfied by the maximum intermittent\nsentence? The offence was described in R. v. Jepson [2004] O.J. No. 5521\nas one where offenders may prey with ease upon innocent children out of the\nreach of the public eye, with potentially catastrophic consequences. It is an\noffence that must be dealt with seriously by the courts. Children are\nvulnerable to the predatory actions of those who enter chat rooms to lure them\ninto situations where they can be sexually exploited. I have no doubt that had\nOfficer Stahle in fact been a 12 year old girl, the accused would have\nattempted to have sexual contact with her. In my opinion, the transcript of the\nconversation between them admits of no other reasonable interpretation and the\ntestimony of the offender about his intentions was unworthy of belief.[13]In these circumstances, I reject the suitability of an intermittent custodial\nsentence.[14]It is regrettable that the conduct in which the offender engaged\nwill result in a loss of employment. Although the offender may be a meek and\nmild mannered person, given the nature of the offence and his nature, I must rely\nupon the correctional authorities to confine him in such a way as to ensure his\nprotection from the harm that other inmates might be inclined to inflict upon\nhim.[15]In my opinion, the proper sentence lies at the lower end of the\nrange identified by the Court of Appeal. Accordingly, you are sentenced to 12\nmonths in the reformatory. In addition, you will be placed on probation for a\nperiod of three years following your release on the following terms and\nconditions:[16]The statutory terms, which I direct be explained to you. In\naddition, you shall:(a)Report to a probation officer within 48 hours\nafter your release and thereafter as directed by the probation officer.(b)Comply with the terms of the s. 161 order that I\nshall impose.(c)Refrain from involvement directly or indirectly\nin any form in computer chat room or other realtime internet communications.(d)Refrain from possessing or using any computer\nsoftware designed to eliminate evidence of internet activity and refrain from\ndeleting any records of internet activity, including recently accessed\ndocuments, internet history files, temporary internet folders and cookie files.(e)Refrain from using a computer that you do not\nown or lease except for a computer system regularly monitored by your employer,\nand refrain from attending any place where internet services can be obtained\nfor a fee.(f)Permit the police to have access to your\ncomputer at your residence as they may reasonably request in order to monitor\nyour compliance with the terms of this probation order.(g)Attend, comply with, and complete all\ncounselling and treatment recommended by your probation officer in consultation\nwith your medical advisors, and sign all releases necessary to allow your\nprobation officer to monitor your compliance with this condition.[17]Moreover, an order will issue pursuant to s. 161 (1) (a), (b) and\n(c) of the Criminal Code for a period of 10 years.[18]An order will also issue under s. 490.012(a) for a period of 10\nyears, as mandated by s. 490.013(2)(a) of the Criminal Code.[19]The victim fine surcharge is waived due to hardship.“Justice D.

Some details may have been edited to ensure that the victim may\nnot be identified.INTRODUCTION:[1]I convicted J.W. on\nNovember 1, 2017 of the offence of sexual assault, and I endorsed a joint\nsubmission for a sentence of imprisonment for two years less one day, minus the\ncredit for any time spent in pre-trial custody, to be followed by a period of\nprobation of three years, with reasons to follow. Here are my reasons for\naccepting the joint submission.THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND:[2]An Agreed Statement of\nFacts was tendered and made into Exhibit 1. Essentially, the accused went,\nuninvited and without permission, into the victim’s house, where she was alone\nand asleep. He pulled down her pants, and he pulled down his. She awoke and\nattempted to resist. He pinned her down with one hand while using his other\nhand to insert his penis inside her vagina.[3]The victim fought him\nas she felt his penis and hand touching her vagina. She was able to free\nherself by kicking him. She called the police from her house. J.W. stayed in\nthe house for several minutes, then he left.[4]When the police\narrived, they found the victim crying and extremely emotional. The accused was\narrested later that evening and he was intoxicated. He is related to the victim\nand they are both adults.SENTENCING PRINCIPLES:1.THE DUTY TO\nCONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE SANCTIONS OTHER THAN IMPRISONMENT, WITH PARTICULAR\nATTENTION TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF ABORIGINAL OFFENDERS:[5]In R. v. Gladue,[1] the\nSupreme Court of Canada wrote:2.Section\n718.2(e) mandatorily requires3.Section 718.2(e) is not simply a codification of existing jurisprudence.\nIt is remedial in nature.Its purpose is to ameliorate the serious\nproblem of overrepresentation of aboriginal people in prisons, and to encourage\nsentencing judges to have recourse to a restorative approach to\nsentencing.There is a judicial duty to give the provision’s remedial\npurpose real force.4.Section 718.2(e) must be read and considered in the context of the\nrest of the factors referred to in that section and in light of all of\nPart XXIII.All principles and factors set out in Part XXIII\nmust be taken into consideration in determining the fit sentence.Attention should be paid to the fact that Part XXIII, through ss. 718, 718.2(e),\nand 742.1, among other provisions, has placed a new emphasis upon decreasing\nthe use of incarceration.[6]Thirteen years later, in\nR. v. Ipeelee,[2]\nthe Supreme Court of Canada referred to its earlier decision in R. v. Gladue\nand added that:Section 718.2(e)\ndirects sentencing judges to pay particular attention to the circumstances of\nAboriginal offenders because those circumstances are unique and different from\nthose of non-Aboriginal offenders (Gladue, at para. 37). When sentencing\nan Aboriginal offender, a judge must consider: (a) the unique systemic or\nbackground factors which may have played a part in bringing the particular\nAboriginal offender before the courts; and (b) the types of sentencing\nprocedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the\noffender because of his or her particular Aboriginal heritage or connection (Gladue,\nat para. 66). Judges may take judicial notice of the broad systemic and\nbackground factors affecting Aboriginal people generally, but additional\ncase-specific information will have to come from counsel and from the\npre-sentence report.[3][7]Lebel, J., writing for\nthe majority, adds at paragraph 60:To be clear,\ncourts must take judicial notice of such matters as the history of colonialism,\ndisplacement, and residential schools and how that history continues to\ntranslate into lower educational attainment, lower incomes, higher\nunemployment, higher rates of substance abuse and suicide, and of course higher\nlevels of incarceration for Aboriginal peoples. These matters, on their own, do\nnot necessarily justify a different sentence for Aboriginal offenders. Rather,\nthey provide the necessary context for understanding and evaluating the\ncase-specific information presented by counsel.[8]J.W. is a resident of\nBehchoko, in the Northwest Territories, he is 56 years old and he is of Tli Cho\nancestry. He speaks the Tli Cho language and his knowledge of English was said\nto be rudimentary. As the Accused is an aboriginal offender, pursuant to\nsection 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code I am bound to consider all available\nsanctions other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances and\nconsistent with the harm done to the victim, with particular attention to his\ncircumstances.[9]Accordingly, a\npre-sentence report was prepared in which case specific information pertaining\nto the Accused as an aboriginal offender was included. This report was marked\nas Exhibit 2.2.PROPORTIONALITY:[10]Proportionality is the fundamental principle\nof sentencing.[4]\nA sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and\nthe degree of responsibility of the offender.[5][11]The\nsentence was imposed as a result of my acceptation of a joint submission by\ncounsel.Joint\nsubmissions on sentence— that is, when Crown and\ndefense counsel agree to recommend a particular sentence to the judge, in\nexchange for the accused entering a plea of guilty — are a subset of resolution\ndiscussions. They are both an accepted and acceptable means of plea\nresolution.They occur every day in courtrooms across this country and\nthey are vital to the efficient operation of the criminal justice system.As this Court said in R. v. Nixon, 2011 SCC 34 (CanLII),\n[2011] 2 S.C.R. 566, not only do joint submissions “help to resolve the vast\nmajority of criminal cases in Canada”, but “in doing so, [they] contribute to a\nfair and efficient criminal justice system” (para. 47).[6][12]For the reasons below, I found that the\nrecommendation by counsel respected the principle of proportionality, it\nproperly addressed the objectives of sentencing and I was satisfied that no\nother sanction but a term of imprisonment was available for this aboriginal\noffender.OBJECTIVES OF SENTENCING:1.NEED\nFOR DETERRENCE AND DENUNCIATIONCharacterization of the offence[13]In the matter of R. v. Vernon Lepine,[7] a binding\ndecision of the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories involving digital\npenetration on a sleeping victim, Shaner, J. was of the view that digital\npenetration and penile penetration “are equally serious and (…) equally harmful\nviolations of a victim’s sexual integrity. The fact that there was no penile\npenetration does not remove this act from the category of a major sexual assault.”[14]The Alberta Court of Appeal’s\nclassification of what constitutes a major sexual assault in R. v. Arcand included,\nbut was not limited to non-consensual vaginal intercourse, anal\nintercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus.[8]\nAccordingly, I find that digital vaginal penetration of a sleeping victim is a\nmajor sexual assault.Impact on the Victim[15]The victim is the niece of the accused. She\nwas assaulted in her home, where she expects to feel safe, by a person who she\nexpected would respect the sanctity of her home and the inviolability of her\nperson. She was asleep, and she was vulnerable. She was asked to participate in\nthe preparation of the Pre-Sentence Report, but she did not come to any\nappointment that had been set for that purpose.[9]\nShe was informed of the possibility of completing a Victim Impact Statement,\nand although I am told that she agreed to provide one, none was filed. She was\ndescribed in the Agreed Statement of Facts as extremely emotional on the night\nof the sexual assault.[10][16]I take notice of the\nfact that victims of a sexual assault experience feelings of shame, loss of\nself-esteem, loss of confidence and lack of safety.[11] I find\nthat the victim’s lack of willingness to participate in the proceedings is\nconsistent with such feelings.Prevalence of sexual assaults in the Northwest\nTerritories[17]I reviewed recent crime\nstatistics in the matter of R. v. Richardson, and I found that the rate\nof sexual assaults in the Northwest Territories in relation to its population is\nfive times the national rate.[12][18]Sexual assaults on\nsleeping victims continues to be a serious problem in this jurisdiction.[13] Our courts\nhave consistently stated that “for the crime of sexual assault, in all but the\nmost exceptional cases, the principles of sentencing to be primarily considered\nare deterrence and denunciation”.[14]Aggravating factors speaking to the need\nfor specific deterrence[19]The accused has a\ncriminal record, which includes a prior conviction in 2011 for a sexual\nassault.[20]At the time of the\noffence, he was bound by a common law Peace Bond to keep the peace and be of\ngood behavior.[21]The victim was sleeping\nand she was vulnerable.[22]He breached the trust\nof his relative, he invaded her home and he used force against her as she was\nresisting him.2.REHABILITATION\nAND ACKNOWLEDGING THE HARM DONE TO VICTIMSMitigating factors[23]The guilty plea is highly mitigating. As\nCharbonneau, J. wrote in the matter of R. v. Mannilaq, a guilty plea isa concrete expression\nof an offender’s remorse. It avoids the time and expense of a trial. And,\nmostly, it spares the victim and other witnesses from having to testify. That\nis especially important in a sexual assault case.It also provides\ncertainty of outcome to the victim.[15][24]The accused is\nremorseful. He indicated very early in the proceedings that he intended to\nplead guilty, notwithstanding that he could not recall the specific details of\nthe assault, due to his state of intoxication.[16]Personal circumstances of the accused[25]He is 56 years old. His\nparents are deceased, and so are the people who had a positive influence on\nhim. He is currently homeless. He has a son from a brief relationship, but he\nis not part of his life. The surviving members of his immediate family are his\nthree older brothers, who abused him physically when he was a child. Although\nthe information is limited with respect to the abuse that he suffered at the\nhands of his brothers, the Pre-Sentence Report reveals a pattern of neglect and\npossibly of childhood trauma. Research is only beginning in the area of\nchildhood trauma, and clearly, the court does not have the benefit of social\nscience studies or of specific testing with respect to Mr. J.W.. However, I am\nable to see a connection between the early trauma that was not addressed and\nthe abuse of alcohol.[26]Mr. J.W. began drinking\nalcohol at the age of 8 and he dropped out of school not long after that as a\nresult of stress and lack of routine in his home.[17] As a\nchild, he lived off the land with his uncles. He is not employed at this time.\nHe relies on income assistance, and he performs odd jobs in his home community.\nIt seems that he gets paid in alcohol.[18]\nHe admits to being an alcoholic, and his peer group seems to struggle equally\nwith an addiction to alcohol.[27]His first language is\nTli Cho. Not much emphasis was placed on this in the Pre-Sentence Report, but\nits author notes that Mr. J.W. has been unsuccessful on probation in the past,\nand that he breached his conditions many times. Whether there was a language\nbarrier remains a live issue.[28]I note that the\napparent lack of insight into his conduct may be due to a number of factors,\nincluding low literacy and limited ability with the English language. It is not\nclear whether or not an interpreter was involved in the interviews with the\nauthor of the Pre-Sentence Report. The language barrier is a significant issue,\nsince the Official Languages Act[19]\nprovides for the right to receive government services in his language.[20][29]He was born in the\ncommunity of Behchoko, which has a population of about 2,100. There is a\nprobation office in the community, and counselling services are available. Mr.\nJ.W. has expressed an interest in participating in an alcohol treatment\nprogram. Again, I note that language and literacy may be an issue, making it\ndifficult for him to strive in a program that must take place outside of the\nNorthwest Territories, due to the fact that there is currently no facility that\noffers residential treatment for substance abuse.[30]There is a Justice\nCommittee in the Community, but this committee typically will not deal with\ncrimes of violence against the person. He has not identified any sober support\nperson in the community who might help him towards rehabilitation.[31]With respect to\nrehabilitation, it is difficult to identify the root causes of the offence,\nexcept to point to alcohol addiction, likely the result of an inability to cope\nwith childhood trauma. Low literacy level and language barriers may account for\nthe lack of success of prior attempts at addressing his offending behavior. I\ncan only stress the importance of giving Mr. J.W. the opportunity to access, if\nnot services in his language, at least to access the services of an\ninterpreter. There may be a need for further assessment of Mr. J.W.’s needs\nperhaps through integrated case management.CONCLUSION[32]Because of the number of aggravating\nfactors, as well as the need for specific and general deterrence due to the\nprevalence of sexual assaults on sleeping victims in our jurisdiction, only a\nsentence of imprisonment would be appropriate.[33]The highly mitigating aspect of the guilty\nplea and the remorse of the accused, and his personal circumstances including\nthe lack of literacy and his disadvantaged background, balance the aggravating\nfactors and justify that restraint be shown in determining the appropriate\nlength of the jail sentence.[34]For these reasons, I find that the joint\nrecommendation is a fit sentence for this accused.DATED THIS 10th DAY OF NOVEMBER, 2017 AT\nYELLOWKNIFE, NORTHWEST TERRITORIES.____________________________CHRISTINE\nGAGNON, T.C.J.R. v.

Boudreau, 2007 NSSC 264Date: 20070830Docket: CRS 274919Registry: SydneyBetween:Her Majesty the Queenv.Brian Vincent BoudreauJudge:The Honourable Justice\nWalter R.E. GoodfellowHeard:August 30, 2007, in\nSydney, Nova ScotiaWritten Decision:September 7 , 2007 (oral decision August\n30, 2007)Counsel:Andre Arseneau, for the CrownDavid R. Campbell, Q.C., for the DefenceBy the Court:[1]This hearing\ndeals with the allegation that Brian Vincent Boudreau did breach the\nconditional sentence order I sentenced him to on Tuesday, August 21, 2007.I\nstart my decision by commending Mr. Campbell, Mr. Boudreau’s Counsel, for the\nyeoman effort he advanced on behalf of his client.[2]The onus on the\nCrown was confirmed by our Court of Appeal in a decision dated December 6, 2005\nin R. v. LeBorgne 2005 NSCA 156 (CanLII), [2005] N.S.J. 493; 2005 NSCA156, as proof on a balance\nof probabilities.I would only add that if it were proof beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, even applying R. v. W.(D). there would be no doubt, and in fact, in the\ncircumstances before me, a certainty that Mr. Boudreau breached the conditional\nsentence provision which is set out in the order: “(b) You shall confine\nyourself at all times to your place of residence, except when absence is\nemployment related.”The conditions of the conditional order were\nacknowledged by Mr. Boudreau.[3]The Law: I refer to the Nova Scotia Court of\nAppeal decision R. v. LeBorgne, and in that decision, Cromwell J.A. at\nparagraph 11 set out the general principles:“The purpose of conditional\nsentences is to keep people out of jail who do not need to be there. But to\nensure that offenders abide by the conditions on which they are allowed to\nremain in the community, Parliament has established a \"relatively simple\nand expeditious procedure\" for dealing with alleged breaches of those\nconditions .... As Rosenberg, J.A. pointed out in that case:... Parliament intended that\ncommittal to prison be a real threat both to indicate to the offender the\nseriousness of violation ... and to reassure the community. ...[4]Our Court of\nAppeal also dealt with the issue in R. v. Starratt [2007] N.S.J. No. 59;\n2007 NSCA 21 (CanLII), per Hamilton J.A. paragraph 24:“The starting point for any\ncourt called upon to consider an application for termination of a conditional\nsentence is R. v. Proulx, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449,\nand particularly the following at para. 39:‘More\nimportantly, where an offender breaches a condition without reasonable excuse,\nthere should be a presumption that the offender serve the remainder of his or\nher sentence in jail. This constant threat of incarceration will help to ensure\nthat the offender complies with the conditions imposed: see R. v. Brady (1998),\n1998 ABCA 7 (CanLII), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 504 (Alta. C.A.); J. v. Roberts, ‘Conditional\nSentencing: Sword of Damocles or Pandora's Box?’ (1997), 2 Can. Crim. L.\nRev. 183. It also assists in distinguishing the conditional sentence from\nprobation by making the consequences of a breach of condition more severe.’”[5]Now that decision\nwas February 14 of this year.[6]I dealt with this\nissue in R. v. Nimchuk [2002] N.S.J. No. 545; 2002 NSSC 285 (CanLII), in\nparagraph 5 I refer to the sentencing options on breach of conditional\nsentence.“The sentencing options\navailable to the court are set out in s. 742.6 (9) of the Criminal Code, above,\nand the Crown seeks an Order terminating the conditional sentence and directing\nthat Mr. Nimchuk be committed to custody until the expiration of the balance of\nhis conditional sentence.”[7]The Supreme Court\nof Canada gave direction in R. v. Proulx, and I cite it from (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140\nC.C.C. (3d) 449, Lamer, C.J.C. states at p. 472‑473, paras. 38 and 39:“[38] The punitive nature of\nthe conditional sentence should also inform the treatment of breaches of\nconditions. As I have already discussed, the maximum penalty for breach of\nprobation is potentially more severe than that for breach of a conditional\nsentence. In practice, however, breaches of conditional sentences may be\npunished more severely than breaches of probation. Without commenting on the\nconstitutionality of these provisions, I note that breaches of conditional\nsentence need only be proved on a balance of probabilities, pursuant to s.\n742.6(9), whereas breaches of probation must be proved beyond a reasonable\ndoubt.[39] More importantly, where\nan offender breaches a condition without reasonable excuse, there should be a\npresumption that the offender serve the remainder of his or her sentence in\njail. This constant threat of incarceration will help ensure that the offender\ncomplies with the conditions imposed: see R. v. Brady (1998), 1998 ABCA 7 (CanLII), 121 C.C.C. (3d)\n504 (Alta. C.A.); J.V. Roberts, Conditional Sentencing: Sword of Damocles or\nPandora's Box? (1997), 2 Can. Crim. L. Rev. 183. It also assists in”\ndistinguishing the conditional sentence from probation by making the\nconsequences of a breach of condition more severe.[8]At paragraph 11\nin Nimchuk (supra) I said this:“... the principle is vital;\nnamely, that the presumption that one who breaches a conditional sentence\nshould serve the entire balance of the conditional sentence is important to\nmaintain the credibility necessary for conditional sentences. A conditional sentence\nis, by its very nature, an opportunity for the offender to avoid incarceration\nand all the consequences of incarceration by agreeing to abide strictly to a\nnumber of terms, including the statutory condition to keep the peace and be of\ngood behaviour. Breaches can take many forms, including those that provide\nreasonable excuse, an obvious one where an individual has to be hospitalized in\nan emergency, and others on a scale would be minor; i.e., a late reporting in,\ncompared to in this case, a commission first of a break and enter and now on\nthe balance of probabilities, a robbery. I readily recognize that the Criminal\nCode does not direct paramountcy to any one option available to the court on\nbreach of a conditional sentence. A conditional sentence is expressly\nconditional upon the offender living up to his undertaking to abide by the\nstatutory conditions and any other conditions imposed, the totality of which\npresents the offender with an opportunity to avoid incarceration. The court\nmust view every breach of a conditional sentence as being serious and depending\non the totality of the circumstances, the options contained in s. 742.6(9) are\navailable with the presumption being in favour of s. 742.6(9)(d) to terminate\nthe conditional sentence order and direct that the offender be committed to\ncustody until the expiration of the sentence.[9]This case is\nabout the enforcement of the conditions that apply to a conditional sentence.No one can fail to understand the clear straightforward meaning of the word\n“conditional” - it is based upon compliance with conditions.[10]In my earlier\ndecision, which I have just cited, Nimchuk (supra), I just wanted to repeat the\nfirst part of paragraph 11.\"... the principle is\nvital; namely, that the presumption that one who breaches a conditional\nsentence should serve the entire balance of the conditional sentence is\nimportant to maintain the credibility necessary for conditional sentences.”[11]Mr. Boudreau,\nbefore I finalize the sentence, you have an opportunity to address the court,\ndo you wish to say anything sir?Mr. Boudreau: Yes My Lord I done ... I know I did wrong and\nthought the safety of my daughter was at risk and that’s why I think my actions\nwere as the result of being concerned about her safety and the safety of others.That’s all I can say, My Lord.[12]Thank you, Mr.\nBoudreau.The defence mounted by Mr. Boudreau is one of justification of\nreasonableness, of being absent without any intent to break his undertaking to\nthe Court.I agree with his Counsel that any onus upon him is on the balance\nof probabilities.He outlined his difficult situation and the disastrous\nconsequences if he were called upon to serve any period of incarceration let\nalone the 355 days remaining on his conditional sentence.[13]His evidence\nraised the issue of his credibility and even applying the test in R. v. W(D)\nthat if his evidence was reasonably capable of belief would amount to\nreasonable doubt and further on the totality of the evidence if his evidence\nraises any doubt, it would be in his favour.I have no doubt whatsoever that\nMr. Boudreau knew the conditions of his conditional sentence and the crown has\nestablished a breach of the residence requirement to a standard of certainty.[14]This matter is a\ntragedy for Mr. Boudreau and his family.It was to avoid the consequences of\nincarceration that he was given a conditional sentence in the first place.His\nexcuse for breaching the house confinement provision is totally without\ncredibility.Wherever in his evidence it is conflict with Valery Dolhanty, the\nconditional order supervisor, I accept and prefer without reservation her\nevidence.[15]One would have to\nbe naive in the extreme to buy Mr. Boudreau’s evidence that “it was not until\nhe saw the police car outside the residence that it when it hit me, I shouldn’t\nhave been here”.His going upstairs, which he first indicated he wasn’t sure,\nthat explanation is pure nonsense.It was clearly and utterly to avoid\ndetection because he knew he shouldn’t be outside of his residence.His\nfailure to use a taxi as transportation of Ms. MacDonald cannot be believed as\nhis explanation “I wasn’t thinking straight”.Mr. Boudreau’s apology to the\nCourt saying his breach was not deliberate rang hollow.My conclusion is total\nsatisfaction that Mr. Boudreau clearly understood that he could not, and I\nrefer again to the Order itself, paragraph (b) where he was confined to his\nresidence except in relation to employment.[16]In my view, he\nknew he was in breach of the Order.He gambled and lost.Mr. Boudreau, in my\nview, had complete disregard for the courts and the benefit of the conditional\nsentence by a willful, deliberate, calculated breach literally 72 hours after\nbeing given a conditional sentence.As I said before, the message must be\ngiven that a breach of a conditional sentence unjustifiably is a serious matter\nand will likely result in the imposition of Section 742.6(9)(d).Accordingly,\nyour address for the balance of the year, namely 355 days, shall be the Cape\nBreton Correctional Centre or such institution as the authorities deem\nappropriate.I terminate the conditional order under 742.6(9)(d) and sentence\nyou to imprison for the balance of your conditional sentence, namely 355 days.J."}

Wiegers and Sandra Folkinsfor\nthe CrownReginald A. Watson and Bob P. Hrycanfor\n[L.C.W.]JUDGMENTBARCLAY J.June 29, 2000[1]This\nis an application by the Crown to have the accused, [L.C.W.] (“[L.C.W.]”),\ndeclared to be a dangerous offender and to be sentenced to detention in a\npenitentiary for an indeterminate period. The predicate offence giving rise to\nthis application is that [L.C.W.], on or about July 8, 1998, at Fort\nQu’Appelle, Saskatchewan, did break and enter a dwelling house at 315 Pasqua\nAvenue and did commit therein the indictable offence of sexual assault causing\nbodily harm contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.[2]On\nNovember 2, 1999, I found [L.C.W.] guilty of the predicate offence.[3]The\nCrown places particular reliance on four offences which include the predicate\none. Proceeding in chronological order, starting with the oldest, I will review\nthe facts in each case.Offence\nof Rape—November 11, 1982[4]On\nNovember 11, 1982, the complainant, [M.T.R.] (“[M.T.R.]”) was living in Brandon\nand was married with four children. [M.T.R.] was the proprietor of a beauty\nsalon in Brandon and was 35 years of age.[5]On\nNovember 11 she was attending a party at her brother-in-law’s house and at\nabout 10:00 p.m. she decided to walk home. As [M.T.R.] was walking adjacent to\na park she was attacked from behind by [L.C.W.] and was subsequently raped by\nhim. She did not resist as she was frightened. During the incident, [M.T.R.]\ntold [L.C.W.] not to hurt her as she had four children. Her crying and pleas\nwere repeated throughout the attack. Yet, despite her appeals she was raped.\nAfter the incident [L.C.W.] forced her to go with him to a house in the\nvicinity and he introduced her to those present as his girlfriend. One of the\nwomen present assisted her by taking her to the bathroom and allowing her to\nescape out the back door. [L.C.W.]’s actions and lack of response to [M.T.R.]’s\ncries and pleas exemplify extreme insensitivity and self-centeredness. On\nJune 27, 1983, [L.C.W.] entered a guilty plea to a charge of rape and was\nsentenced to a term of imprisonment of three and one-half years.Offence\nof Physical Assault of [D.C.]—May 30, 1986[6][D.C.]\n(“[D.C.]”) is the mother of [S.C.] who\nhad been living common-law with [L.C.W.]. Prior to May 30, [L.C.W.] and [S.C.]\nhad been living together for approximately one and one-half years. At that time\n[D.C.], her daughter [S.C.] and\n[L.C.W.] were all residing on the Waywayseecappo Reserve near Brandon,\nManitoba. In fact, [D.C.] lived across the road from her\ndaughter and [L.C.W.]. [D.C.] did not approve of their relationship.[7]On\nthe evening of May 30, [D.C.] was babysitting her grandchildren. While she was\nsleeping on the couch with the baby, [L.C.W.] entered her home. After he drank\na glass of water [L.C.W.] began to choke [D.C.]. [D.C.] fell on the baby and\n[L.C.W.] again came after her. On this occasion he used both hands to choke\nher. [D.C.] again fell on her baby and after the baby started to cry her\nchildren came to her rescue and pulled [L.C.W.] away from her. Prior to the\nassault, [L.C.W.] threatened to kill [D.C.]. [L.C.W.] in his testimony denied that\nhe assaulted [D.C.]. I do not believe him nor does his testimony raise a\nreasonable doubt. [D.C.] was an honest and forthright witness and I believe\nher. I am satisfied that the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that\nthe assault occurred in the manner described by [D.C.]. Furthermore, [L.C.W.]\nentered a guilty plea to this offence. One of the aggravating circumstances\nsurrounding the offence is the fact that [D.C.] was not only his elder but his defacto\nmother-in-law.Offence\nof Aggravated Sexual Assault—June 5, 1986[8]The\ncircumstances surrounding the offence are as follows. On June 5, [D.C.] had\nbeen visiting her daughter [M.] on the Waywayseecappo Reserve. They then\nvisited other friends and then [D.C.] returned to her home with [M.] and her\nfriend [S.]. Around midnight, [D.C.] went to her brother’s residence. [D.C.]\nsubsequently decided to return home which is only a short distance away. As she\nleft her residence [L.C.W.] grabbed her from behind and attempted to choke her.\nWhile this was occurring he threatened to kill her. [L.C.W.] then pushed her\ninto a ditch and savagely assaulted her by striking both sides of her face with\nhis fist. This occurred approximately fifteen times. He sat on her chest and placed\nhis knees on her arms. After he assaulted her he forced her to have\nintercourse. After the attack [D.C.] crawled to the road where she was then\nobserved by her daughter [M.] and her friend [S.]. They took her home.[9][D.C.]\ndescribed her injuries as follows. Her mouth was cut and her nose was bleeding.\nThe right side of her face was bruised and swollen and her right eye was shut.\nImmediately after the assault [D.C.] suffered from a sore throat and she\ncouldn’t talk or swallow.She also had difficulty in focussing her eyes. After\nthe incident [D.C.] said she had low self-esteem and that she contemplated\ncommitting suicide.[10][L.C.W.]\nentered a guilty plea to a charge of aggravated sexual assault of [D.C.] and\nwas sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten years in a Federal penitentiary.Offence\nof Sexual Assault Causing Bodily Harm—July 8, 1998[11]I\nconvicted the accused of the offence of breaking and entering a dwelling house\nand committing the indictable offence of sexual assault causing bodily harm.\nThis is the predicate offence. The testimony at the trial may be summarized as\nfollows.[12]The\ncomplainant, [N.G.] (“[N.G.]”) is a 75 year-old great-grandmother. At the time\nthe offence was committed [N.G.] was living alone in her residence in Fort\nQu’Appelle as her husband passed away earlier that year. The main bedroom in\nher small bungalow has a double bed with night tables on either side. On the\nleft night table a ventilator is located as [N.G.] suffers from emphysema. A\nlifeline monitoring system with an emergency button was on the other table as\n[N.G.] also suffers from a heart condition. She has had two previous heart\nattacks. If she needed assistance [N.G.] would press the button and her voice\nwould be activated in the hospital. Each morning and evening she reports\ndirectly to the hospital.[13]Since\nher ear surgery, [N.G.] wears a hearing aid. On July 8, [N.G.] weighed only 72\npounds and was five feet two inches.As July 8 was a very hot day, [N.G.] was\nwearing a light T-shirt, white light-weight pants and panties.[14]As\nto the circumstances surrounding the offence I held as follows:At approximately 3:45 p.m. a man\ncame to her front door and inquired as to the location of Glen Stonechild.\n[N.G.], after telling him he lived across the street, became suspicious as he\nhad a furtive look. She sent him away and set the dead bolt on all the locks.She then lay down on her bed and\nused her ventilator. This involved placing a mask on her face. She then\nobserved [L.C.W.] standing in the doorway. He closed the door and sat on her\nbed and exclaimed he was going to fuck her. He smashed her mask, and then\ncontinued to strike her in the face with his fist. [N.G.] said after he pinned\nher down, he pulled off her pants and panties and threw them in a corner. He\nstruck her on her face, head, shoulders, arms and head. [L.C.W.] then pulled\ndown his zipper and exposed his penis. He started to masturbate as he was\nhaving difficulty maintaining an erection. [N.G.] then thought of her red\nbutton, and as soon as [L.C.W.] reached for his belt buckle with both hands,\nshe saw her chance, hit the red button, and screamed. The phone on the life\nmonitoring system rang, and a voice said “what is wrong”, and, “do not panic”.\nWhen [L.C.W.] heard the voice on the phone, he panicked. After he swept\neverything off the night tables, he ran from the house. Shortly thereafter,\nseveral police cars arrived at her residence. [N.G.] gave the officer a good\ndescription of the assailant. During the incident [L.C.W.] smashed her hearing\naid. During her testimony, she said he changed the shape of her ear with the\nbrutal force that he used, and that he drove the hearing aid further into her\near.During the incident, [L.C.W.]\ngrabbed her legs to force them apart. [N.G.] said [L.C.W.] was a very strong\nindividual and she resisted him with all her might.[N.G.] said the bruises, which\nwere all the colours of the rainbow, were on her neck, chest, shoulders, arms,\nhands, face, head, ear and leg.After the incident, because of\nthe damage to her inner ear, for a period of time she lived in a silent world.[N.G.] also suffered damages to\nher mouth, and couldn’t eat or drink for several days.She described [L.C.W.] as being\naboriginal, of muscular build, and that he weighed 140 to 150 pounds.[N.G.]\nsaid her assailant had the coldest eyes she had ever seen. She said the person\nwho assaulted her was the same person who came to her dwelling earlier in the\nafternoon.[N.G.] said [L.C.W.]’s only\ndemands were sexual as there was no property missing and her purse was on the\nliving room chair.[15][L.C.W.]\ntestified and although he admitted that he unlawfully entered [N.G.]’s\nresidence and that he struck her, he denied that he sexually assaulted her and\nthat his motive in unlawfully entering her dwelling was to steal. I rejected [L.C.W.]’s\nexplanation and as to his credibility, I stated as follows:On the other hand, the\nexplanation of [L.C.W.] that he only intended to steal from [N.G.], that he did\nnot intend to sexually assault her and that he was defending himself when he\nhit her, a 75 year-old great-grandmother weighing 72 pounds, is preposterous\nand absurd. [L.C.W.] is not telling the truth, and his testimony on this\ncritical issue is beyond all reason; and may be characterized as being false\nand beyond belief.[L.C.W.] stated that he only hit\n[N.G.] once. The corroborating testimony from Constable Dornstauder and the\npictures prove otherwise. If [N.G.] was only struck once, how does one explain\nthe bruises on her head, face, lips, arms, wrists and thigh together with the\ntraumatic ear injury? If [N.G.] fell backward as a result of being stuck by\n[L.C.W.] you would expect that she would have had injuries on the back of her\nhead, buttocks, legs and elbow. The evidence proves otherwise.Furthermore, when Stonechild\ntestified he never mentioned a plan to steal or rob [N.G.], all he said was\nthat she was a good neighbour. Stonechild did state however, that [L.C.W.]\ngrabbed his crotch and exclaimed that he needed a woman.[L.C.W.]’s explanation is false.\nHe is deliberately misleading the Court.Victim\nImpact Statement[16]After\nthe trial, [N.G.] gave the following impact statement:I still feel the same sense of\noutrage I experienced on July 8, 1998 when my life was changed forever, when a\ncomplete stranger forced himself into my home and assaulted me in the most\ndespicable way—simply to satisfy his need—his brutal beating of me had no real\nmeaning to him—with his cold black stone eyes, no emotion of any kind.The last two years have been\nterrible, the result of the beating—my hearing aid was pounded into my ear so\nforcibly, the results became devastating for me, I couldn’t hear and it took\nmonths and months before I could hear again[17][N.G.]\nsaid that as a result of [L.C.W.] driving her hearing aid deep into her ear\ncanal, her life was changed forever. She said she is deaf and therefore cannot\nmix socially and most of the time she lives in a silent world. [N.G.] statedthat at a time in her life when she most needed comfort she was unable to\ncommunicate with her family and friends.[18]The\napplication is grounded in s. 753 of the Criminal Code. The Code\nwas amended in 1997. The new provisions significantly changed the procedure\nthat is to be followed when a sentencing judge presides over a dangerous\noffender application. More specifically, the legislation removes discretion\nfrom the sentencing judge if the accused is found to be a dangerous offender.\nUnder the old legislation the judge could either impose a determinate or an\nindeterminate period of incarceration. However, under the new legislation an\nindeterminate sentence must be imposed if the accused is found to be a\ndangerous offender.[19]Another\nsignificant change was that the new legislation made provision for a “long-term\noffender”. This new provision permits a sentencing judge to impose up to ten\nyears of community supervision to an offender who commits an offence that meets\nthe requirements of s. 753.1. The long-term offender provisions allow a court\nto impose community supervision if certain requirements are met.[20]Some\nof the procedural changes in the amendments are also of importance. Although\nconsent of the Attorney General is generally required to invoke the long-term\noffender proceedings, the long-term offender provisions can be invoked without\nthe consent of the Attorney General if the court is dealing with a dangerous\noffender application.[21]As\nthe predicate offence was committed after the amendments came into force, the\nnew provisions apply. Therefore the relevant sections of the Criminal Code\nare:752.1 (1) Where an offender is convicted\nof a serious personal injury offence or an offence referred to in paragraph\n753.1(2)(a) and, before sentence is imposed on the offender, on\napplication by the prosecution, the court is of the opinion that there are\nreasonable grounds to believe that the offender might be found to be a\ndangerous offender under section 753 or a long-term offender under section\n753.1, the court may, by order in writing, remand the offender, for a period\nnot exceeding sixty days, to the custody of the person that the court directs\nand who can perform an assessment, or can have an assessment performed by\nexperts. The assessment is to be used as evidence in an application under\nsection 753 or 753.1....753. (1) The court may, on application made under\nthis Part following the filing of an assessment report under subsection\n752.1(2), find the offender to be a dangerous offender if it is satisfied(a)that the offence for which the offender\nhas been convicted is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph\n(a) of the definition of that expression in section 752 and the offender\nconstitutes a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of\nother persons on the basis of evidence establishing(i)a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the\noffender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a\npart, showing a failure to restrain his or her behaviour and a likelihood of\ncausing death or injury to other persons, or inflicting severe psychological\ndamage on other persons, through failure in the future to restrain his or her\nbehaviour,(ii)a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour\nby the offender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted\nforms a part, showing a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the\noffender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of\nhis or her behaviour, or(iii)any behaviour by the offender, associated\nwith the offence for which he or she has been convicted, that is of such a\nbrutal nature as to compel the conclusion that the offender's behaviour in the\nfuture is unlikely to be inhibited by normal standards of behavioural\nrestraint; or(b)that the offence for which the offender\nhas been convicted is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph\n(b) of the definition of that expression in section 752 and the\noffender, by his or her conduct in any sexual matter including that involved in\nthe commission of the offence for which he or she has been convicted, has shown\na failure to control his or her sexual impulses and a likelihood of causing\ninjury, pain or other evil to other persons through failure in the future to\ncontrol his or her sexual impulses.(2)An application under subsection (1) must be made\nbefore sentence is imposed on the offender unless(a)before the imposition of sentence, the\nprosecution gives notice to the offender of a possible intention to make an\napplication under section 752.1 and an application under subsection (1) not\nlater than six months after that imposition; and(b)at the time of the application under\nsubsection (1) that is not later than six months after the imposition of\nsentence, it is shown that relevant evidence that was not reasonably available\nto the prosecution at the time of the imposition of sentence became available\nin the interim.(3)Notwithstanding subsection 752.1(1), an application\nunder that subsection may be made after the imposition of sentence or after an\noffender begins to serve the sentence in a case to which paragraphs (2)(a)\nand (b) apply.(4)If the court finds an offender to be a dangerous\noffender, it shall impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an\nindeterminate period.(4.1)If the application was made after the offender\nbegins to serve the sentence in a case to which paragraphs (2)(a) and (b)\napply, the sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period\nreferred to in subsection (4) replaces the sentence that was imposed for the\noffence for which the offender was convicted.(5)If the court does not find an offender to be a\ndangerous offender,(a)the court may treat the application as an\napplication to find the offender to be a long-term offender, section 753.1\napplies to the application and the court may either find that the offender is a\nlong-term offender or hold another hearing for that purpose; or(b)the court may impose sentence for the\noffence for which the offender has been convicted.(6)Any evidence given during the hearing of an\napplication made under subsection (1) by a victim of an offence for which the\noffender was convicted is deemed also to have been given during any hearing\nunder paragraph (5)(a) held with respect to the offender.753.1(1)The court may, on\napplication made under this Part following the filing of an assessment report\nunder subsection 752.1(2), find an offender to be a long-term offender if it is\nsatisfied that(a)it would be appropriate to impose a\nsentence of imprisonment of two years or more for the offence for which the\noffender has been convicted;(b)there is a substantial risk that the\noffender will reoffend; and(c)there is a reasonable possibility of\neventual control of the risk in the community.(2)The court shall be satisfied that there is a\nsubstantial risk that the offender will reoffend if(a)the offender has been convicted of an\noffence under section 151 (sexual interference), 152 (invitation to sexual\ntouching) or 153 (sexual exploitation), subsection 173(2) (exposure) or section\n271 (sexual assault), 272 (sexual assault with a weapon) or 273 (aggravated\nsexual assault), or has engaged in serious conduct of a sexual nature in the\ncommission of another offence of which the offender has been convicted; and(b) the offender(i)has shown a pattern of repetitive behaviour,\nof which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, that\nshows a likelihood of the offender’s causing death or injury to other persons\nor inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons, or(ii)by conduct in any sexual matter including\nthat involved in the commission of the offence for which the offender has been\nconvicted, has shown a likelihood of causing injury, pain or other evil to\nother persons in the future through similar offences.(3)Subject to subsections (3.1), (4) and (5), if the\ncourt finds an offender to be a long-term offender, it shall(a)impose a sentence for the offence for\nwhich the offender has been convicted, which sentence must be a minimum\npunishment of imprisonment for a term of two years; and(b)order the offender to be supervised in\nthe community, for a period not exceeding ten years, in accordance with section\n753.2 and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.[L.C.W.][22][L.C.W.]’s\nhistory is obtained from his own testimony, and that of Dr. Semrau, the psychiatrist\nwho examined him, and correction officials. He has had a very tragic life.[23][L.C.W.] is\n34 years of age and is of Aboriginal ancestry. He was born on August 20, 1966\non the Waywayseecappo Reserve which is located near Brandon, Manitoba where he\nresided during his formative years. His father, [L.] and his mother [K.] were\nchronic alcoholics and they both abused him physically. This abuse continued\nand it affected his school performance. He failed grade 2 twice. On occasion to\navoid the physical abuse he did, from time to time, live with his aunt and\nuncle.[24]When\nhe was four he was sexually assaulted by his cousin [A.]. When he was growing\nup, his uncle killed his aunt and then committed suicide. This had a profound\naffect on him.[25][L.C.W.]\nwas only six when he began to drink alcohol and sniff glue. When [L.C.W.] was\n12 his parents separated. At that time he was still living on the reserve.\nAfter his parents separated, [L.C.W.] lived with his mother for about two\nyears. He then met [E.B.] who was his first girlfriend. He moved to her\nfather’s farm which was on a neighbouring reserve. (Elphinstone). He lived with\n[E.B.] and her family for approximately nine months. About this time he began\ncommitting property offences and assaults and as a result of his actions he\nwent to live at the Ross Group Home in Brandon. From time to time he would\nbreak curfew and consume alcohol which caused him to be disciplined in the\ngroup home.[26]It\nwas while he was residing in the group home in Brandon that he raped [M.T.R.].\nThis occurred on November 11, 1982. On that date, [L.C.W.] said he had escaped\nfrom the home and ended up partying and consuming large amounts of alcohol.\n[L.C.W.] testified that he blacked out and has no recollection of sexually\nassaulting [M.T.R.].[27]After\n[L.C.W.] pled guilty to the rape charge he began serving his sentence at Stoney\nMountain. Shortly thereafter he was transferred to the penitentiary in Prince\nAlbert. While he was at Prince Albert he was sexually assaulted by a male\ninmate. After the assault he was hospitalized. He said the sexual assault emotionally\nhad a profound effect on him.[28]After\nthe attack [L.C.W.] was paroled and he returned to reside on the Waywayseecappo\nReserve with [P.] and [M.] [M.]. As a condition of his parole he joined an\nAlcoholics Anonymousprogram. It was at this time that he met [S.C.] Chief,\nthe daughter of one of the complainants. [L.C.W.] began to live common-law with\nher on thereserve. [D.C.] became very critical of their relationship and was\nof the view that [L.C.W.] would be an inadequate husband and father. On\nMarch 26, 1986, [S.C.] became pregnant.[29][L.C.W.]\nwas having difficulty in controlling his consumption of alcohol and he was\ncharged with theft of an automobile and a .08 offence. As a result of these\ncharges and the concern of the parole officer he enrolled in a three week AA\nprogram.[30]After\nhe completed the program [L.C.W.] returned to the Waywayseecappo Reserve and\nresumed cohabitation with [S.C.]. He was having problems with her and [D.C.]\nand was also concerned over whether he was the father of the baby she was\ncarrying. The tension with [D.C.] escalated and on May 30, 1986, he went over\nto her house. [L.C.W.]’s version of what transpired differed from [D.C.]’s\ntestimony at this hearing. [L.C.W.] had been drinking and when he arrived home\nat 4:00 a.m. [S.C.] was not there. He then went over to her mother’s place and\nhe said [D.C.] began berating him about the way in which he was treating [S.C.].\n[L.C.W.] said he was drunk and that [D.C.]’s children assisted [D.C.] in\ncausing him to be removed from the house. He denied choking her or threatening\nto kill her. Earlier in my judgment I stated that I did not believe [L.C.W.]\nnor does his testimony raise a reasonable doubt with respect to the\ncircumstances surrounding the assault.[31]As\nto the sexual assault conviction, [L.C.W.] conceded that he was having violent\nsexual fantasies about [D.C.] and those fantasies included having intercourse\nwith her.[32]On\nthe evening prior to the sexual assault, [D.C.] and [S.C.], after consuming a\nconsiderable amount of alcohol, began to argue. [L.C.W.] heard the conversation\nwhile he was outside their house. [L.C.W.] was also intoxicated. He said he\nplanned to get her alone.[33]After\n[D.C.] left her house he followed her into the bush, physically assaulted her\nand then raped her. When asked why he did such a terrible thing his response\nwas “because of my sexual deviancy”.[34]Although\nthe criminal record does not reflect the May 30 incident, [L.C.W.] conceded\nthat he also entered a guilty plea to the physical assault on [D.C.], the\nuttering of threats and the charge of unlawfully entering her dwelling house.[35]In\n1992, [L.C.W.] was transferred to the Regional Psychiatric Centre (“R.P.C.”) in\nSaskatoon from Prince Albert. The reason for the transfer was that he was\nsuffering from extreme depression and had slashed his wrists. While he was at\nR.P.C. he attended an AA program and also a program for adult children of\nalcoholics. [L.C.W.] was pleased with this program and he stated that “he saw a\nlot of honesty from the other patients and he felt comfortable for the first\ntime.”[36]In\n1993 he enrolled in a six month sex offender treatment program. It was during\nthis program that [L.C.W.] became aware of his crime cycle. When he was at\nR.P.C. through the various programs he became aware of certain negative\nfeelings that he had about himself such as low self-esteem, that he was\nashamed, and that he would never amount to anything.[37][L.C.W.]\nwas subsequently transferred to the Osborne Community Correction Centre in\nWinnipeg where he was released on day parole. This was [L.C.W.]’s first\nexperience in a large city and he was frightened.[38]On\ntwo occasions his parole was suspended. In the first incident he was unlawfully\nconsuming alcohol. [L.C.W.] said the abuse of alcohol was a serious problem for\nhim. On the second occasion [L.C.W.] stole a wallet. After his parole was again\nsuspended he was transferred to Rockwood. While there he worked during the day\nand also attended AA meetings.[39]Prior\nto [L.C.W.]’s warrant expiry date which was December 2, 1997, he was staying at\nthe Osborne Centre which was a half-way house in Winnipeg. While at the Osborne\nCentre [L.C.W.] renewed a relationship with an uncle and aunt, namely, [R.] and\n[R.] [B.].[40]When\nhe was finally released from prison on December 2, 1997, [L.C.W.] moved to\nMorden, which is located 75 miles southwest of Winnipeg. While he was in Morden\nhe was living with his aunt and uncle and was employed at a plant. While\n[L.C.W.] was in Morden he began to abuse alcohol and would drink until he\npassed out.[41]He\neventually moved back again to his reserve and resided with his mother. They\nboth continued to abuse alcohol and [L.C.W.] subsequently severed his\nemployment at the plant in Morden.[42]He\nrealized when he was on the reserve that he had a serious drinking problem and\nhe finally arranged to be admitted to the New Dawn Centre in Fort Qu’Appelle,\nSaskatchewan. He arrived at the Centre on June 20. [L.C.W.] was not pleased\nwith the program and left the Centre on July 8, 1998, the day he sexually\nassaulted [N.G.].[43]John\nFogarty testified. He is now the area director of Correctional Services of\nCanada. Between 1983 and 1986 he was stationed in Brandon and was [L.C.W.]’s\nparole officer. During that period there were no sex programs. Fogarty said\nthat [L.C.W.] never admitted that he raped [M.T.R.]. He also stated that\n[L.C.W.] was very uncommunicative with the prison psychologists.[44]Prior\nto receiving education in the penitentiary, [L.C.W.] had only completed his\nGrade VII.[45]In\nSeptember of 1985, in a written report for corrections, Fogarty made the\nfollowing comments:6.SUPERVISOR’S ASSESSMENT:Although there has been some deterioration in the\nsubject’s attitude and suspicions that he may be violating his special\ncondition, in my opinion, [L.C.W.] is progressing satisfactorily in most areas.\nThe subject is a very quiet, sensitive and unobtrusive individual who often\ncomplains of boredom on the reserve. At the same time, he seems to lack the\nmotivation to follow through on constructive activities such as upgrading his\neducation. He is expressing some long term interest in working for his father\nas a farmer, however, in my opinion, there are very few benefits to be obtained\nby farming on the reserve. In addition, I doubt whether [L.C.W.] has the\nmotivation to follow through on these plans. At any rate, the farming season is\nvirtually over for this year, and the questions [sic] arises what will\nhe do for the remaining months during 1985 and the winter months during 1986.\nThe writer will continue to explore the subject’s intentions with him, and\nattempt to motivate him to follow through on some of his statements.[46]When\n[L.C.W.] was incarcerated as a result of his assault on\n[M.T.R.], he was very concerned with his safety as he believed that his\ncommon-law wife [S.C.]’s former boyfriend, who also was incarcerated, had been\ntelling other inmates that he was serving time for rape. [L.C.W.]\npromised to take the three week alcohol treatment program at Sun Centre if he\nwas released again on parole. Unfortunately, while he was on parole [L.C.W.]\nsexually assaulted and brutally attacked [D.C.] and he was arrested on June 5,\n1986. His parole was then suspended.[47]Karen\nAtkinson is an institutional case worker employed by Corrections Canada and was\nresponsible for his supervision within the Rockwood penitentiary in Manitoba.\nShe said her duties are analogous to a parole officer within the institution.\nHer responsibilities included the assessment of risk and preparing reports for\nthe parole board hearing.[48]Ms.\nAtkinson was responsible for [L.C.W.] after he was\ntransferred from the R.P.C. in Saskatoon. He initially was incarcerated in\nOsborne Centre which is a Federal halfway house in Winnipeg. After [L.C.W.]’s\nparole was revoked he was incarcerated in the Rockwood Institution and this\noccurred in August of 1994. When he arrived at Rockwood, Ms. Atkinson was\nimmediately assigned to him. She was responsible for [L.C.W.]\nuntil July of 1995 when he was again released on day parole. Atkinson said that\nshe was required to have at least one discussion every week. However, she had\ncasual contact with him every second day. She had concerns for [L.C.W.]’s\npropensity to re-offend as a result of his substance abuse and chronic low\nself-esteem which would trigger violence including deviant sexual behaviour.[49]Ms.\nAtkinson said there were times when [L.C.W.] was withdrawn\nand isolated and on other occasions he would be in relatively good spirits.[50]When\n[L.C.W.] had arrived at Rockwood he had successfully\ncompleted the Native Substance Abuse Program. She also said he was a staunch AA\nattender both in the community at Osborne Centre, and the meetings at Stoney\nMountain. At Rockwood he attained the position of chairman.[51]When\nthe National Parole Board in 1994 revoked [L.C.W.]’s\nparole due to concerns with family violence issues, Atkinson caused him to\nparticipate in the Family Violence Program at Rockwood.[52]As\nlate as August of 1995, Atkinson was of the view that [L.C.W.]’s\nemotional stability was not yet manageable and that his release may be\npremature. Her recommendations for [L.C.W.]’s application\nfor day parole reads as follows:In conclusion, [L.C.W.] appears\nto require more time to solidify his emotional stability as it pertains to\ninappropriate expectations in relationships with females, demonstrate a\ncommitment to long term sobriety and that he can work independently on his\npersonal development goals. There appears to be adequate supports in the\ncommunity to assist him in these areas during Day Parole. However his\nInstitutional Performance in terms of addressing his Correctional Plan has\nnoticeably declined as of late. Based upon this and the aforenoted\nobservations, the writer feels release may be premature.[53]Gabrielle\nThiessen was [L.C.W.]’s parole officer from March to August,\n1994 when his parole was revoked. She again supervised him from October, 1995\nuntil June of 1996 and again from October of 1996 to January of 1997. In 1994\nand again in 1996 on two occasions [L.C.W.]’s parole was\nsuspended. His parole was suspended on the ground that he violated the\ncondition to abstain, although consideration was given to allegations of theft\nand sexual assault. The other two suspensions involved allegations of physical\nabuse of his then girlfriend, [C.G.]. There was no police involvement in either\ncase and no further criminal charges resulted.[54]During\nthe period that Thiessen was supervising [L.C.W.] the\nfollowing target areas required addressing in order to reduce [L.C.W.]’s\nlikelihood of recidivism:1)ALCOHOL/DRUG ABUSE:early\nage use, alcoholism in family, unable to remember details of offence due to\nalcohol abuse, alcohol directly related to criminal behaviour. Feelings of low\nself-esteem and negative self-perceptions appear to contribute to chronic\nsubstance abuse.2)EMOTIONAL STABILITY:\nSubject needs to learn constructive ways to deal with problems of\nanger/aggression, low self-esteem and depression thereby eliminating his need\nto abuse intoxicants. Psychiatrist diagnosed Len as exhibiting sociopathic\ntendencies in 1989 (poor impulse control and frustration tolerance, difficulty\nin postponing gratification).3)SEXUAL BEHAVIOUR: When\nintoxicated, exhibits violence and aggression, primarily towards women. Of\nissue is that when sober, Len appears to be passive or even dominated in his\nrelationships with women.4)ACADEMIC/VOCATIONAL SKILLS:\n[L.C.W.] lacks both education and vocational skills and file information\nreports numerous attempts to upgrade with minimal progress achieved. Len passed\n2 out of 5 examinations required for GED certification while at R.P.C. in\n1992/93.[55]Hugo\nFoss, a forensic psychiatrist, was involved in the treatment of sex offenders\nat Rockwood and he therefore came into contact with [L.C.W.]\nfrom November of 1994 to September of 1995. He would see [L.C.W.] at\nleast once a week. He said [L.C.W.] was reluctant\nto discuss family origin issues.[56]Foss\nsaid that as a result of [L.C.W.]’s\nparticipation in the sex offender maintenance program, he was able to further\ndevelop his understanding of his offence cycle and risk factors. Specifically\nhe explored his propensity for formulating inappropriate relationships with\nfemale volunteers. Foss stated that although [L.C.W.] was\ninitially reluctant to explore and discuss his penchant for sexualizing\nrelationships with females in helping roles to his credit he persisted in this\nendeavour which resulted in an enhancement of the breadth and understanding of\nhis unhealthy life and offending cycle.[57]The\nrecommendation of Foss in his July 1995 report was as follows:As mentioned in the previous F.B.M.C. report, Inmate\n[L.C.W.]’s primary task will be to become more adept at implementing his\ninsights on a daily basis while in the community. Inmate [L.C.W.] appears to\nhave progressed to the point of bringing some clarity and understanding to his\ninappropriate sexualization of relationships with female helpers. However,\ngiven that Inmate [L.C.W.] still has a strong desire to have “someone/anyone in\nhis life” as well as a number of family of origin issues to address, it is\nsuggested that he will still remain predisposed to inappropriate attachments to\nfemales. F.B.M.C. is certainly familiar with the struggles that remain for Inmate\n[L.C.W.]. The framework that Inmate [L.C.W.] has been able to establish in\nterms of his unhealthy life and offending cycles, will allow for meaningful\nsupervision of Inmate [L.C.W.]. It will be important for Inmate [L.C.W.]’s\nparole officer to review with Inmate [L.C.W.] his interactions with women and\nthe development of his interpersonal relationships on a regular basis.[58]Dr.\nLawrence Ellerby has a PhD. in psychology. His speciality is assessing and\ntreating men who have been involved in violent sexual offences.[59]He\nwas the Director of the Forensic Behaviorial Management Clinic (F.B.M.C.) in\nWinnipeg. This is a private clinic which has many inmates as clients. It\ntherefore relies on Corrections Canada for many of its patients. In the\nWinnipeg area F.B.M.C. would treat inmates from Stoney Mountain and Rockwood\nInstitution. Ellerby was only responsible for [L.C.W.]\nwhen he was on parole and those periods were as follows: March of 1993 to May\nof 1994, September of 1995 to January of 1996, July of 1996 to March of 1997\nand from April of 1997 to December 1, 1997, which was his warrant expiry date.[60]During\nthe period from March 1993 to his warrant expiry date, [L.C.W.]’s\nparole was suspended on four occasions for parole violations.[61]On\noccasion, [L.C.W.] was able to relate fairly well with\nothers but at other times he was resentful of the process as trust was not one\nof his strong suits.[62]Ellerby\ntestified that [L.C.W.]’s fantasies were a form of\ndestructive coping and they involved emotionally hurting someone, in particular\nhe had sexually aggressive thoughts about his mother-in-law and in particular\nrape fantasies. Ellerby said there was a revenge aspect to this fantasy and\nthat he desired “to hurt her badly” as a result of her lack of support for his\nrelationship with her daughter, [S.C.].[63]Ellerby\nsaid [L.C.W.] planned to sexually assault [D.C.].\nHis comments with respect to the planning and commission of the offence are\nalarming. Ellerby testified as follows:QOkay. and what did he say\nabout the plan to assault [D.C.]?AThe points under planning\nare: Take advantage of other people drinking, going to the home when I know\nmother-in-law is alone, making an excuse to argue with her and become\nphysically aggressive, giving [S.C.] money to take her parents drinking so it\nwill be easier to take advantage, waiting outside the home for the right time,\nthinking about how to get her alone, tell [S.C.] to return to the house, hide\noutside wondering when I can get her, listening to the conversation in the\nhouse, follow mother-in-law realizing that this is the right time, follow her\nuntil she is away from everything. And that is the information under the\nplanning.QOkay. Now, did he talk\nabout the commission of the offence itself?AYes. Under the commission\nof the offence itself the points are: Pushing her, swearing at her, hitting her\nin the face with a closed fist, tell her you came onto me and then you didn’t\nput out, you’re going to fucking put out now, pulling down her pants, ignoring\nher crying and her bleeding, forcibly raping her, telling her not to call the\ncops, calling her a bitch, running away and hiding.[64]Dr.\nSemrau is a psychiatrist practicing in British Columbia and is one of the\nleading experts in Canada with respect to dangerous offenders. Since moving to\nKelowna in 1990, he has been operating the Kelowna Forensic Clinic. In addition\nto those duties he has a substantial private practice in forensic psychiatry\nand has frequently been retained by counsel with respect to violent and sexual offences.\nDr. Semrau has been involved in approximately 80 dangerous offender\napplications and in many of those cases testified as an expert witness.[65]In\nthis case I appointed Dr. Semrau upon being of the opinion that there are\nreasonable grounds to believe that [L.C.W.] might be found\nto be a dangerous offender under s. 753 of the Criminal Code or a\nlong-term offender under s. 753.1, to conduct an assessment of [L.C.W.]\npursuant to s. 752.1 of the Criminal Code.[66]Dr.\nSemrau did not interview [L.C.W.] until April\n20, 2000. Prior to attending on [L.C.W.] he received a\ntranscript of the dangerous offender hearing together with a transcript of the\ntrial of the predicate offence ([N.G.]) together with a copy of my judgment. In\naddition, Dr. Semrau also received a copy of the exhibits that were filed at\nthe hearing including reports from Corrections Canada.[67]Dr.\nSemrau stated that [L.C.W.]’s history presents a consistent\noffending pattern of violent sexual/physical attacks on women. He said that\neach of the offences involves some combination of hostile/aggressive and sexual\ncomponents with these two motivations sometimes fused. He emphasized that the\nattacks all appear to some extent or other to occur at times and in\ncircumstances in [L.C.W.]’s life when he is under the\ninfluence of alcohol and when he is experiencing some degree of stress.[68]It\nis critical to underscore thataccording to Dr. Semrau these attacks have been\nrepeated on several occasions over a variety of different circumstances in [L.C.W.]’s\nlife and over a wide span in terms of ages, from teenage years to his early\n30s. Dr. Semrau stated that these attacks cannot therefore be understood as\njust an aberrant response to some highly unusual life circumstances, but rather\nthey appear to be the expression of intrinsic psychological problems which are\nacted out in such violent attacks under conducive but not unusual life\ncircumstances.[69]Dr.\nSemrau explained that these offences occur under circumstances when [L.C.W.] is\nnot either in prison or intensively supervised in the community. In\nDr. Semrau’s opinion this offending history constitutes a clear\nbehavioural pattern which is likely to continue for the foreseeable future in\nthe absence of major benefits from future supervision and treatment.Sexual\nDeviation[70]As\nto sexual deviation with respect to [L.C.W.], Dr. Semrau\nstates as follows:It does seem reasonably clear that [L.C.W.] exhibits a\npattern of sexual deviation. Specifically, the predominant pattern appears to\nbe a pathological fusion of hostile/aggressive and sexual urges. This type of\nsexual offending dynamic was expressed fairly clearly in the [D.C.] offence,\nwhere [L.C.W.] specifically acknowledged the fusion of aggressive/hostile and\nsexual motivations. In the most recent offence it has not been possible to\ndiscuss motivation and fantasies with [L.C.W.], but the fairly violent nature\nof the attack is strongly suggestive of the same dynamics of fusion of sexual\nand hostile/aggressive feelings. In this case there would have been no\nparticular cause for direct hostile feelings toward the victim, but it is often\nthe case that hostile feelings are displaced onto victims from other\npsychological events, e.g. [L.C.W.]’s frustration and anger at the nature of\nthe New Dawn treatment program and his failure to receive money for a bus\nticket.Substance\nAbuse[71]According\nto Dr. Semrau, [L.C.W.] suffers from a serious and\nchronic alcohol problem. An analysis of his offences demonstrates that\nvirtually all of them have been significantly alcohol related in one way or\nanother. Dr. Semrau is of the view that [L.C.W.]’s\nresort to alcohol abuse is clearly a pathological coping mechanism for him and\nthat alcohol plays a relatively direct role in his offences.[72]This\nis alarming as [L.C.W.] told Dr. Semrau that after his\nwarrant expiry date on December 2, 1997, he was seriously abusing alcohol. This\nbegan in February of 1998.[73]Dr.\nSemrau describes his abuse of alcohol as follows:He notes that his drinking gradually increased over time\nto the point where he was drinking every weekend and at times during the week\nwhen he had no work. He recalls that [R.B.] saw his alcohol intake increase and\ntold him it was excessive. He recalls replying with excuses to the effect that\nshe wouldn’t let him go to the reserve to see his little girl and if she did\nlet him go he probably wouldn’t drink so much, though he also acknowledges that\nshe had wisely advised him that he would get into worse difficulty if he did\nvisit the reserve.He recalls his alcohol intake escalating further and\n[R.B.] repeatedly trying to get him to stop. He recalls one occasion in roughly\nApril 1998 when he argued with her in the car about his drinking, she told him\nthat he shouldn’t let the alcohol destroy his life and she threatened to call\nthe police and report him for impaired driving. He recalls being intoxicated at\nthe time and pushing her out of the car as a result of his anger. He recalls\nbeing arrested for assaulting [R.B.], being given a breathalyser and then being\nlet out on bail with a condition of no contact with [R.B.].... When on the reserve his alcohol use increased to a\ndaily basis and he recalls experiencing terrible hangovers and sometimes\n“waking up in the ditch”. He states he realized he needed help, that he was\ngoing downhill and would die, so he talked to his aunt Myrtle, who told him he\nneeded to get into a treatment centre as soon as possible. As a result he\nchecked himself into the New Dawn Valley Treatment Centre.[74]It\nwas after he left the New Dawn treatment centre that he brutally assaulted\n[N.G.].[75]Notwithstanding\nthe treatment [L.C.W.] received over the years, when heis\nleft to his own resources he cannot control his drinking and this unfortunately\nleads to tragic results.THE\nAPPLICABLE LAW[76]The\npurpose and intent of the legislation was described in this way by\nMr. Justice Gonthier in R. v. Jones, 1994 CanLII 85 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 229 at 290:In the case of dangerous\noffender proceedings, it is all the more important that the court be given\naccess to the widest possible range of information in order to determine\nwhether there is a serious risk to public safety. If there is, the dangerous\noffender sentencing allows the justice system to more precisely tailor the\nactual time served by the offender to the threat that he poses to society. The\noverriding aim is not the punishment of the offender but the prevention of\nfuture violence through the imposition of an indeterminate sentence. An\nindeterminate sentence is not an unlimited sentence. If, in the case at hand,\nthe psychiatrists testifying on behalf of the accused are correct in their\nassessment that Mr. Jones will be fit to be released in ten years, then he will\nbe liberated at that time. The offender faces incarceration only for the period\nof time that he poses a serious risk to the safety of society. In the interim,\nit is hoped that he will receive treatment that will assist him in controlling\nhis conduct. To release a dangerous offender while he remains unable to control\nhis actions serves neither the interests of the offender nor those of society.[77]In\nR. v. Yanoshewski (1996), 1996 CanLII 4916 (SK CA), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 512, the Saskatchewan Court of\nAppeal in upholding a finding made by Gunn J. that the appellant was a\ndangerous offender, the consequent imposition of a sentence of detention in a\npenitentiary for an indeterminate period cited with approval the following\ncomments of the trial judge:Now, the question I must address\nis whether that period would provide sufficient time for treatment to effect\nrehabilitation. The answer in this case is clearly “No”.On the basis of all\nof the evidence, I have concluded Mr. Yanoshewski poses a continuing danger to\nsociety. A fifteen year sentence would certainly be significant but would\nprovide no measure of public security that at the end of it Mr. Yanoshewski\nwould not pose a continuing risk.The evidence gives me no\nconfidence that there is any particular time period when this offender will no\nlonger pose a risk. The court is not entitled to gamble on the safety of the\npublic when that risk has been so clearly identified for it.[78]In\nJones, supra, the Supreme Court states that where there is a serious\nrisk that the offender will re-offend, Parliament has seen fit to provide for\nan indeterminate sentence for offenders who pose a danger to the public.[79]It\nis critical to underscore that at no time in dangerous offender proceedings can\npublic safety concerns be overshadowed. In R. v. Pontello (1977), 38\nC.C.C. (2d) 262 (Ont. C.A.) the court considered an accused who was a seemingly\nproductive young man with a family, employment and no criminal record. The man\nhad committed two rapes at knife point and had been sentenced to life\nimprisonment by the trial judge who had accepted the view of a psychiatrist\nthat the accused was not likely to benefit from treatment. In considering the\nquestions of the fitness of sentence, MacKinnon J.A. wrote atp. 268:The evidence here gives us no\nconfidence that there is any particular time span within which the appellant\nmay be cured and the Court is not entitled to gamble on the safety of women in\nthe community, however much inclined it might be to take a chance.[80]The\nCrown bears the onus to prove that the accused is a dangerous offender and the\nburden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. R. v. Carleton (1981), 1981 ABCA 220 (CanLII), 69\nC.C.C. (2d) 1 at 6 (Alta. C.A.); affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada at\n(1983), 1983 CanLII 157 (SCC), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 480.[81]Section\n753(1)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Code speak of the likelihood of future\nconduct. The onus on the Crown is to prove that “likelihood” only beyond a\nreasonable doubt. It is not required that future conduct be proven with\ncertainty.In R. v. Lyons (1987), 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 47-48 (S.C.C.)\nMr. Justice LaForest states:... It seems to me that a “likelihood” of specified\nfuture conduct occurring is the finding of fact required to be established; it\nis not, at one and the same time, the means of proving that fact. Logically, it\nseems clear to me that an individual can be found to constitute a threat\nto society without insisting that this require the court to assert an ability\nto predict the future. I do not find it illogical for a court to assert that it\nis satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the test of dangerousness has been\nmet, that there exists a certain potential for harm. That this is really\nonly an apparent paradox is aptly captured by Morden J. in R. v. Knight\n(1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 343 at p. 356 (Ont. H.C.):I wish to make it clear that when I refer to the\nrequisite standard of proof respecting likelihood I am not imposing on myself\nan obligation to find it proven beyond a reasonable doubt that certain events\nwill happen in the future—this, in the nature of things would be impossible in\npractically every case—but I do refer to the quality and strength of the\nevidence of past and present facts together with the expert opinion thereon, as\nan existing basis for finding present likelihood of future conduct.[82]The\nAlberta Court of Appeal recently reviewed the dangerous offender provisions of\nthe Criminal Code in the case of R. v. Neve (1999), 1999 ABCA 206 (CanLII), 137 C.C.C.\n(3d) 97. In Neve the accused was convicted of robbery. The accused and\nanother woman believed that the complainant had beaten one of their friends,\ncausing her to miscarry. They drove the complainant to a field. When the\ncomplainant did not comply with a request to take her clothes off, the accused\nand her friend threatened her, struck her in the face, then used a knife to cut\nthe complainant’s clothes off. The complainant acknowledged that the knife was\nused carefully, so as not to hurt her. She received a small cut from the knife,\nbut was not otherwise injured. The accused and her friend then drove away,\nleaving the complainant naked in the field in the early hours of the morning.\nThe complainant sought help from a passing motorist.[83]In\na unanimous judgment the court set aside the dangerous offender designation and\na sentence of three years imprisonment was imposed.[84]Section\n752 of the Criminal Code defines “serious personal injury offence” as\n“(a) an indictable offence, other than ... treason ... or ... murder, involving\n(i) the use or attempted use of violence against another person, or (ii)\nconduct endangering or likely to endanger the life or safety of another person\nor inflicting or likely to inflict severe psychological damage upon another\nperson, and for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for ten\nyears or more ....” The level of violence or endangerment must be objectively\nserious for an offence to qualify as a serious personal injury offence under s.\n752(a)(i) or (ii). The court held that the trial judge erred in holding that\nthe fact that the robbery involved some degree of violence was sufficient to\nmake it a serious personal injury offence under s. 752(a)(i), rather than\nconsidering whether the conduct was objectively serious. It further held that\nthe trial judge also erred in holding that the robbery was a serious personal\ninjury offence under s. 752(a)(ii) because it showed complete indifference\nto the complainant’s well-being, posed a possible danger to her life and tended\nto cause injury. This confused the test of endangerment under s. 752(a)(ii)\nwith the behaviour tests under s. 753(a). It was also an error to consider\npossible danger rather than whether endangerment was likely.[85]The\ncourt emphasized that the dangerous offender provisions are targeted to apply\nto a very small group of offenders whose personal characteristics and\nparticular circumstances militate strenuously in favour of preventive\ndetention.[86]In\nassessing whether a pattern of behaviour had been established sufficient to\nsatisfy the requirements of either s. 753(a)(i) or s. 753(a)(ii), the Alberta\nCourt of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in considering offences which\ndid not form a pattern, in considering inadmissible or irrelevant evidence,\nincluding thoughts which were unconnected to any criminal activities, and in\ntreating the pattern and the threat assessment as one.[87]The\nAlberta Court of Appeal in R v. Neve, supra, recently underwent a\nlengthy discussion on the approach a trial court should follow when it is\nconfronted with a dangerous offender proceeding. Although the case sets out a\nvery helpful framework to follow, the recommendations must be re-evaluated in\nlight of the recent amendments to the Criminal Code. In order to make\nthis evaluation, however, the Neve approach must be reviewed. I will\ntherefore summarize the issues that the Alberta Court of Appeal suggests should\nbe addressed.[88]The\nCourt in Neve suggests a dangerous offender proceeding involves four\ndifferent steps that must be addressed by the court to prevent a reversible\nerror. These include:(a)The\nCrown must prove that the predicate offence was a serious personal injury\noffence pursuant to s. 752 of the Code;(b)The\ncourt must be satisfied that the offender is a threat of the kind contemplated\nin the Code and thus dangerous to society;(c)The\ncourt must consider whether it is appropriate in all the circumstances to\ndesignate the offender as a dangerous offender, even if all the statutory\nrequirements are met;(d)If\nsuch designation is made, the court must determine if a determinate or\nindeterminate sentence should be imposed.[89]This\napproach, however, must immediately be distinguished from the approach the\ncourt in this case would utilize. Whereas the court in Neve, supra, had\nthe discretion to impose either a determinate or indeterminate sentence, a court\ntoday does not have this luxury. Instead, s. 753(4) requires the court to\nimpose a penitentiary sentence for an indeterminate period of time once a\ndangerous offender finding is made. More specifically, s. 753(4) states:753(4)If the court finds an offender to be a\ndangerous offender, it shall impose a sentence of detention in a\npenitentiary for an indeterminate period. [Emphasis added]Notwithstanding\nthat change, the other three steps provide helpful guidance on the analysis to\nbe undertaken in a dangerous offender proceeding. As a result, I will review\neach of these in more detail. Here this analysis is required because the\napplication was made under s. 753.[90]Before\na dangerous offender proceeding can take place, the Criminal Code\nrequires the Crown toestablish a foundation for the dangerous offender\napplication. In fact, the Criminal Code requires a conviction for a\nspecial kind of predicate offence that is referred to as a “serious personal\ninjury offence.” The definition of “serious personal injury offence” is set out\nin s. 752:752. Definitions—In this Part,...“serious personal injury offence” means(a)an indictable offence, other than high treason,\ntreason, first degree murder or second degree murder, involving(i)the use or attempted use of violence against\nanother person, or(ii)conduct endangering or likely to endanger the\nlife or safety of another person or inflicting or likely to inflict severe\npsychological damage upon another person,and for which the offender may be sentenced to\nimprisonment for ten years or more, or(b)an offence or attempt to commit an offence\nmentioned in section 271 (sexual assault), 272 (sexual assault with a weapon,\nthreats to a third party or causing bodily harm) or 273 (aggravated sexual\nassault).This\ndefinition essentially gives the Crown two separate options to prove that the\npredicate offence is a serious personal injury offence and consequently begin a\ndangerous offender proceeding. First, the Crown can show that the predicate\noffence is one of the enumerated offences in subparagraph (b). A conviction for\none of these offences will immediately allow the Crown to begin a dangerous\noffender application. Thus, a conviction for sexual assault will allow the Crown\nto invoke dangerous offender proceedings.[91]The\nsecond route, described in paragraph (a), is more complex however. This is\nbecause s. 752(a) requires more than a conviction, it requires an assessment of\nthe degree of “violence” or “endangerment”. In Neve, supra, at\npara. 74 the Alberta Court of Appeal found that s. 752(a)(i) requires that\nthe violence be objectively serious in order to be consistent with the\nlegislation. Similarly, the Court in Neve found that the level of\nendangerment in s. 752(a)(ii) also must meet an objective standard of\nseriousness.[92]The\nobjective requirement of serious violence in s. 752(a)(i), however, does not\nrequire actual injury. Therefore if serious injury does not result the Crown is\nnot precluded from proving that the violence is objectively serious.\nConversely, simply because an offence involves some injury, does not\nautomatically make the offence an objectively serious violence offence. (Neve\nat para. 87)[93]It\nshould be emphasized, however, that unlike s. 752(a) the requirement for the\noffence to be objectively serious does not apply to the enumerated offences\nunder s. 752(b). One of the reasons for this differential treatment is due to\nthe decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R v. Currie, 1997 CanLII 347 (SCC), [1997] 2\nS.C.R. 260. The court in Currie established that a sexual offence is a\ncertain type of offence that Parliament has found to be inherently serious in\nand of itself.[94]The\nCourt in Neve set out several reasons why the “violence” or\n“endangerment” under s. 752(a) must be objectively serious. One of the reasons\nfor this requirement is to prevent the legislation from becoming arbitrary and\nthereby making it unconstitutional.[95]In\norder for the court to declare an offender to be a dangerous offender, the\ncourt must be convinced that the statutory requirements have been met.[96]This\nallows the court to find an offender to be a dangerous offender in one of two\nways. First, the Crown can prove the elements that are provided for in\ns. 753(1)(a). Alternatively, the Crown can prove the elements of s.\n753(1)(b)—either option will suffice.[97]Section\n753(1)(a) of the Criminal Code requires that in order for the court to\nfind an offender to be a dangerous offender the offender must constitute a\nthreat to the life, safety, or physical or mental well-being of other persons.\nThis finding is made by a court on the basis of evidence establishing one of\nthe three things set out in s. 753(1)(a)(i), (ii), or (iii). Neve,\nsupra, establishes that a “court cannot make a determination that an\noffender constitutes a threat in the manner specified in s. 753(a) except on\nthe basis of evidence that meets at least one of the specified behaviour\nthresholds.” (Neve at para. 103) Thus, the court must first establish\nthat one of the three thresholds are met before it can analyse whether the\noffender will be a threat.[98]Under\ns. 753(1)(a)(i) there are four elements that must be satisfied before the court\ncan determine whether the offender is a threat pursuant to s. 753(1)(a). A\nsummary of the elements that must be shown followed by a quick description of\nhow the Court should determine whether the element has been satisfied. The\nelements as well as the descriptions are taken from Neve. The four\nelements are:(a)A\npattern of repetitive behaviour—This can be established in one of two different\nways:(i)Where there are similarities in terms of the kind of\noffences;(ii)Where the offences themselves are not similar in kind, but\nin result, in terms of the degree of violence inflicted on the victims.Because\nthe pattern of behaviour must be “repetitive”, one episode of violence will not\nbe enough under this subsection.(b)The\npredicate offence must form part of that pattern—Quite simply, this element\nrequires the Crown to show that the predicate offence that the accused has been\nconvicted with is consistent with the pattern of behaviour that they are trying\nto establish.(c)The\npattern must show a failure by the offender to have restrained his or her behaviour\nin the past—To qualify as part of the pattern, the Alberta Court of Appeal\nsuggests that “the impugned conduct must show that the offender has failed to\nrestrain his or her behaviour in the past and that there exists a likelihood of\ncausing death, injury or severe psychological damage through a failure to\nrestrain that behaviour in the future.” The Alberta Court of Appeal suggests\n“likelihood” means more than a possibility and at the very least means more\nprobable than not.(d)The\npattern must demonstrate a likelihood of death, injury, or severe psychological\ndamage to other persons through failure to restrain his or her behaviour in the\nfuture—The court must be satisfied that the pattern of conduct is substantially\nor pathologically intractable. (Per LaForest in R. v. Lyons, 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1987] 2\nS.C.R. 309 at 338)[99]Under\ns. 753(1)(a)(ii) there are three elements that must be met before the Crown can\nsatisfy the requirements of this part of the dangerous offender analysis. They\nare as follows:(a)A\npattern of persistent aggressive behaviour—This element can also be established\nin one of two ways:(i)Where there are similarities in terms of the kind of\noffences;(ii)Where the offences themselves are not similar in kind, but\nin result, in terms of the degree of aggression inflicted on the victims.It\nshould be noted that the word persistent has been equated with repetitive in R\nv. Yanoshewski, supra.(b)The\npredicate offence must form part of that pattern—Quite simply, this element\nrequires the Crown to show that the predicate offence is consistent with the\npattern of behaviour that they are trying to establish.(c)That\npattern must show a substantial degree of indifference by the offender\nrespecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences of his or her behaviour—The\nCourt in Neve, supra, found that this provision should be read as\nincluding a requirement that the Crown prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the\nevidence discloses a likelihood that the type of aggressive behaviour described\nwill continue in the future.[100]A\nhelpful summary of these two thresholds is provided in Neve, supra, at\npara. 119. The court found:[119] In essence, the import of these requirements is that\nthe evidence must show a pattern of repetitive violent behaviour or persistent\naggressive behaviour by the offender, including the predicate offence, and from\nthat behaviour, it must be possible to conclude that the offender represents a\nserious risk to others. As noted, the dangerous offender provisions are not\ndesigned to remove all recidivists from society. That is one of the reasons why\nParliament has prescribed that before someone can be found to be a threat, the\ncourt must first find a pattern of conduct based on past behaviour which leads\nto the conclusion that serious harm will result to the public from the release\nof the offender into the community.[101]In\nthe event that a pattern cannot be established, the court has another option to\nfind that the offender is a dangerous offender. Under s. 753(1)(a)(iii),\nif the behaviour associated with the predicate offence is of such a brutal\nnature that it compels the conclusion that the offender’s behaviour in the\nfuture is unlikely to be inhibited by normal standards of behavioural restraint\nthen the court can still find the offender to be a dangerous offender. Unlike\nthe other two possibilities, this option does not require previous offences\nwhich compose a pattern of behaviour.[102]Under\ns. 753(1)(b), this subsection specifically addresses an offender who has\ncommitted a serious personal injury offence defined in subparagraph (b). These\noffences include a situation where a sexual offence has been committed. This\nsubsection does not engage the more detailed requirements of s. 753(1)(a).\nInstead, after making the requisite findings, the Crown must simply demonstrate\nthat the offender has shown a failure to control his or her sexual impulses and\nthat there is a likelihood of the accused causing injury, pain, or other evil\nto other persons through failure in the future to control his or her sexual\nimpulses. Thus, if the Crown can show that the offender committed a sexual\nassault and that the offender has failed to control his sexual impulses and\nalso that there is a likelihood of causing injury, the statutory requirements\nwill be satisfied absent any reference to subsection (a). Here the charge\ninvolves a sexual assault, therefore s. 753(1)(b) is the most probable\nroute.[103]If\nan offender is found to be a dangerous offender an indeterminate sentence is\nmandatory. If the Court does not find an offender to be a dangerous offender\nthe Court may designate the offender to be a long-term offender. This can\ninclude up to 10 years’ supervision following release from custody after being\nsentenced on the predicate offence.[104]In\nsummary, in order for the Court to find the offender to be a dangerous\noffender, the Crown must prove the following:(a)The\npredicate offence is a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of s.\n752(a) of the Criminal Code;(b)A\npattern of repetitive behaviour that includes the predicate offence;(c)The\nestablished pattern must be indicative of a failure to restrain behaviour; and(d)A\nlikelihood that the offender;(i)will not restrain his behaviour in the future and,(ii)failure to restrain his behaviour would result in death, injury\nor the infliction of severe psychological damage.[105]The\npredicate offence of break, enter and commit sexual assault causing bodily harm\nis a serious personal injury offence within the meaning of either subparagraph\nof paragraph 752(a) of the Criminal Code.[106]In\nR. v. Langevin (1984), 1984 CanLII 1914 (ON CA), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 336, the Ontario Court of Appeal\nconsidered the question of what type of evidence is sufficient to establish a\npattern of repetitive behaviour within the meaning of s. 688(a)(i) which\ncorresponds to the present day 753(1)(a)(i). At p. 348 Lacourcière J.A. stated:In my opinion, this element is\nnot based solely on the number of offences but also on the elements of\nsimilarity of the offender’s behaviour. The offences committed were remarkably\nsimilar. Two young girls were grabbed from behind by the appellant, a stranger,\nand both were taken to a secluded place and ordered to undress. Both were\nforced into anal as well as vaginal intercourse. The younger girl was forced to\nfellate the appellant. Both were threatened to assure their co-operation and\nwere released only after assurances not to tell anyone were extracted from\nthem. In the circumstances, these two offences were properly found to establish\na pattern of repetitive behaviour.Therefore,\nas few as two incidents can form a pattern of repetitive behaviour provided\nthere is a high degree of similarity between the offences.[107]In\nNeve, supra, the court considered the nature of similarity necessary to\nestablish a pattern under either s. 753(1)(a)(i) or 753(1)(a)(ii). The court\nheld that a pattern can be established on “two different bases”. At para. 111,\nthe court stated:[111] ... The first is where there are similarities in\nterms of the kind of offences; the second where the offences themselves are not\nsimilar in kind, but in result, in terms of the degree of violence or\naggression inflicted on the victims. Either will do. Thus, the mere fact that\nan offender commits a variety of crimes does not mean that no pattern exists.\nThere is no requirement that the past criminal actions all be of the same or\nsimilar form, order or arrangement; though if this has occurred, it may well\nsuffice.[108]In\nmy view the pattern of repetitive behaviour has been established including the\nfollowing four incidents:➢The rape of [M.T.R.] on November 11, 1982;➢The physical assault of [D.C.]\ndated May 30, 1986;➢The aggravated sexual assault of [D.C.]\ndated June 5, 1986; and➢The predicate offence committed on [N.G.] on July 8,\n1998.[109]I\nam satisfied all four offences are sufficiently similar in their commission to\nestablish a pattern of repetitive behaviour. In each case there are the\nfollowing similarities:➢[L.C.W.] was under the influence of alcohol;➢The victims were all female;➢In each offence the victim was at least twice the age of\nthe offender;➢The victims were attacked at a time when they appeared\nto be alone.➢The attacks were completely unprovoked;➢The attacks were violent.[110]In\naddition to these similarities these offences are similar in terms of violence\nand aggression which satisfies the second test set out in Neve, supra.\nIn his report, Dr. Semrau noted that “each of the offences involves some\ncombination of hostile/aggressive and sexual components, with these two\nmotivations sometimes fused”. He opined “the offending history constitutes a clear\nbehavioural pattern”.[111][L.C.W.]\nalso acknowledged a failure on his part to restrain his behaviour. In\ndescribing the June 5, 1986 aggravated sexual assault of [D.C.] he\nlikened himself to an animal that had lost all control.[112]The\nhigh degree of similarity between the June 5, 1986 aggravated sexual assault\nand the other three offences suggests they too were committed by an offender\nwho had lost control.[113]Underscoring\n[L.C.W.]’s inability to control his behaviour is his\ninability to control behaviour that bears on his offending behaviour. An\nexample being [L.C.W.]’s chronic alcoholism.[114]If\n[L.C.W.] were to re-offend there is no question his behaviour would likely\nresult in death, injury or severe psychological damage to a future victim. The\ndamage he has inflicted on his past victims makes this conclusion clear.[115]With\nrespect to psychological harm the rape of [M.T.R.] left the victim with\ndepression, insecurity, lost confidence and panic attacks. To this date she\nfears going places alone and entertains an irrational fear of native persons. [D.C.]\nbecame suicidally depressed, a condition that appears to have persisted to the\npresent day. [N.G.] suffered the isolation associated with deafness and\nnightmares so violent she awoke to panic attacks in her sweat soaked pyjamas.\nFor [N.G.] these panic attacks must be exceptionally disturbing as she has\npreviously suffered two heart attacks.[116]In\naddition to the noted emotional traumas, both [N.G.] and [D.C.] (June 5, 1986)\nsuffered serious physical injuries. As [D.C.] was being choked she came close\nto blacking out, her mouth and nose bled, while one side of her face was so\nbadly swollen her eye remained shut for about three weeks. She could not talk\nor swallow properly for about one week. [D.C.] suffered from headaches and\nstill has occasional difficulty focusing her eyes. [N.G.] suffered bruising to\nher thigh, arms, face, neck, shoulders and wrists. The bruising and small cuts\ninside her mouth and on her lips prevented her from eating or drinking properly\nfor four or five days. [N.G.] was already deaf in one ear and relied on a\nhearing aid to assist the other ear. During the offence the hearing aid was\nsmashed and driven deeper into her ear. The ear was bruised and the result was\n[N.G.] had to reside in a silent world until the bruising subsided and a new\nhearing aid could be fitted.[117]The\noffender’s victims have always been at least double his age. If [L.C.W.] were\nto re-offend his disturbing tendency toward sexual violence coupled with the\nage of his victim could prove deadly. In the predicate offence the victim,\n[N.G.], was 74 years old and had previously suffered two heart attacks. As\nwell, she suffered from emphysema. Immediately prior to his sexual assault of\n[N.G.] he observed her 72 pound body reclined on a bed with her face masked\nwith a ventilator. The image of this feeble, elderly woman served only to\nexcite [L.C.W.]. Clearly he lacks the ability to restrain himself during his\nattacks.[118]The\nfinal consideration under s. 753(1)(a)(i) is whether there is a likelihood the\noffender will re-offend. In R. v. Morin (1999), 1998 CanLII 13883 (SK QB), 173 Sask. R. 101 (Q.B.),\nGerein J. surveyed existing authorities and stated “likelihood” requires\nthe Crown prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a likelihood of\nre-offence, not that the Crown must prove future conduct with certainty. As\nwell in determining whether a “likelihood” exists the court will have guidance\nfrom the past conduct of the accused, his present situation and expert\nopinions.[119]Dr.\nSemrau acknowledged that re-offence risk prediction is very difficult but after\napplying the best tests available to him and lending his considerable clinical\njudgment to these tools he opined that [L.C.W.] would be more likely than not\nto re-offend in a manner similar to the predicate offence if released to the\ncommunity unsupervised. When asked if he could be more specific Dr. Semrau set\nhis re-offence risk estimate at “60 to 70%” over the next ten years.[120]Of\ngreat importance is Dr. Semrau’s view of [L.C.W.]’s treatability. After\nconsidering two variables that might have a bearing on treatability, that will\nbe discussed later, Dr. Semrau wrote at p. 28:... [I]t is the writer’s opinion\nthat [L.C.W.] has probably already received the substantial majority of any\nbenefits which he could be realistically expected to gain from treatment.[121][L.C.W.]\nsubmits that he should be declared a long-term offender rather than a dangerous\noffender. [L.C.W.] relies on the statement by Dr. Semrau that his re-offence\nrisk could be reduced to less than 50% if he were under intensive supervision\nin the community.[122]In\norder for the Court to find [L.C.W.] to be a long-term offender I must be\nsatisfied that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the\nrisk in the community. The evidence is to the contrary.[123]Dr.\nSemrau states that [L.C.W.] has probably received the substantive majority of\nany benefits which he could be realistically expected to gain from treatment.[124]Here\n[L.C.W.] has already had extensive treatment from the sex offender programs in\nvarious Federal penitentiaries together with treatment for chronic alcoholism.\nIn a five year span, he received four and one-half years of sex offender\ntreatment and counselling. Since 1986 he attended numerous detoxification\nprograms as well as anger management counselling. Yet, within two months of\nrelease from prison, he was again abusing alcohol which resulted in the brutal,\nsenseless sexual assault on [N.G.].[125]Although\nDr. Semrau is of the opinion that [L.C.W.]’s re-offence risk could be reduced\nto less than 50% if he were under intensive supervision in the community, in my\nview [L.C.W.]’s failure to learn from past determinate periods of incarceration\nand his history of re-offending ([D.C.] incidents)\nwhile free under various degrees of court supervision, I find that declaring\n[L.C.W.] a long-term offender is not a reasonable alternative.[126]Even\nduring the period that [L.C.W.] would be under supervision in the community, I\nam concerned with the safety of the public. I agree with the submissions of the\nCrown that Dr. Semrau’s view is founded on the ability of treatment providers\nand parole officers to detect any approaching crisis. One concern is that these\nofficials may not be so perceptive. A second concern is that [L.C.W.] may not\nco-operate with those charged with the responsibility of supervising him if he\nhas already engaged in behaviour that may lead to a suspension of parole. By\nway of example, [L.C.W.] may attempt to conceal his abuse of alcohol, as\nreporting it may cause his return to the penitentiary. When this occurs and he\nisolates himself, the evidence shows that he is capable, if not likely, to\ncommit horrific crimes.[127][L.C.W.]’s\nrefusal to implement the techniques he has learned in sex offender treatment\nproves he has maintained a substantial degree of indifference to the reasonably\nforeseeable consequences of his behaviour.[128]In\nthe alternative, even if [L.C.W.]’s re-offence risk can be reduced to tolerable\nlevels under intensive community supervision the long-term offender designation\nis not appropriate.It is critical to underscore that I must find “a\nreasonable possibility of eventual control in the community”. The difficulty\nwith any determinate sentence lies in the impossibility of forecasting with any\nsemblance of accuracy when the danger which the offender presents will abate to\nallow his safe integration in society. Here, Dr. Semrau states that [L.C.W.]\nwould be more likely than not to re-offend in a manner specified in the\npredicate offence if released into the community unsupervised. He set his\nre-offence risk at 60 to 70 percent.[129]It\nis my interpretation of the amendments to the Criminal Code and in\nparticular the long-term offender provisions, that the term reasonable\npossibility of eventual control in the community, must refer to a set of\ncircumstances where, during the term of the supervision order, the offender is\nlikely to be rehabilitated such that when the supervision order expires the\naccused is not a substantial risk to re-offend. It is my view that Parliament\nnever intended in enacting these amendments that an offender could be\ndesignated a long-term offender because he can be controlled while under a\nsupervision order notwithstanding that he would be a substantial risk after\nsupervision is terminated.CONCLUSION[130]The\nevidence establishes there is a danger of future failure to restrain [L.C.W.]’s\nbehaviour. Accordingly there is no realistic alternative but to impose\nindeterminate incarceration to prevent resumption of his trail of violence and\nfuture violations and injuries or possibly even deaths.[131]The\nstark and chilling horror surrounding the [N.G.] incident has shaken the\nsecurity of the Saskatchewan public as the nature of this offence is so foreign\nto small town Saskatchewan where we take for granted the peace, safety and\ntranquillity of our communities. What [L.C.W.] did was so callous, brutal and\nsenseless it showed a complete lack of appreciation of the value of human life.[132]Public\nsafety dictates that [L.C.W.]’s freedom awaits the day which will hopefully\narrive when there can be some assurance that he will not resume his pattern of\nviolence.[133]I\nam also cognizant of the fact that there is a right of review after seven years\nif the accused is designated as a dangerous offender and each and every two\nyears thereafter. I agree with the Crown that this right of review after the\naccused is declared to be a dangerous offender is the only procedure that meets\nthe requirement of public safety while providing [L.C.W.] with the possibility\nof supervised access to the community.[134]The\nprovision of the Criminal Code which requires this automatic review\nprovides protection to [L.C.W.] and an incentive to him to avail himself of all\nthe programs and treatment which may assist him in eliminating or reducing the\nrisk he poses to society and securing his release. Those sections also provide\na measure of security for the public which cannot be accommodated by a\ndeterminate sentence. Gunn J. in R. v. Yanoshewski, supra.[135]In\nthe alternative I would follow the principles articulated in the case of R.\nv. Rindero, [1999] B.C.J. No. 3076 (QL), 1999 BCSC 2074 which held that\nunder the new s. 753(5), the court can treat the Crown’s dangerous offender\napplication as a long-term offender application under s. 753.1 only if it does\nnot find the accused to be a dangerous offender. At paras. 42-44, Shabbits J. states:¶42It was submitted on behalf\nof Mr. Rindero that before imposing the dangerous offender designation on an\noffender, a court must find that the long‑term offender legislation\ncannot be used in properly sentencing the offender.I do not accept that\nsubmission.In R. v. M.A.G.,[1998] B.C.J. No. 3210, Mr. Justice Low\nconsidered a submission by an offender that he be found to be a long‑term\noffender in lieu of an indeterminate sentence. The application in front of Mr.\nJustice Low dealt with predicate offences committed in 1992 and 1993, and,\naccordingly, he too, was considering the dangerous offender provisions as they\nwere before the amendments that came into law on August 1, 1997.¶43Mr. Justice Low said this\nat paragraph 14:I might be attracted to the defence argument if I were\nto find that the accused is not a dangerous offender. However, the evidence is\noverwhelming that he is a dangerous offender.Under the new s. 753(5),\nthe court can treat the Crown’s dangerous offender application as a long‑term\noffender application under section 753.1, only if it does not find the accused\nto be a dangerous offender.Since I find the accused to be a dangerous\noffender, the option of finding him a long‑term offender does not arise.¶44I agree with Mr. Justice\nLow’s conclusion.In my opinion, that conclusion accords with a clear reading\nof the new section 753(5).[136]I\nam therefore satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that [L.C.W.] is a dangerous\noffender and should be subject to a sentence in a penitentiary for an\nindeterminate period and I so sentence him.CANADIAN\nCHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, PART I OFTHE CONSTITUTION\nACT, 1982, BEING SCHEDULE B TO THECANADA\nACT 1982 (U.K.), 1982, C. 11 (THE “CHARTER”)1.Does\ns. 753 of the Criminal Code contravene s. 11(h) of the Charter by\ntrying to punish [L.C.W.] twice for the same offence?2.Will\nthe imposition of a sentence of indeterminate detention constitute cruel and\nunusual punishment for [L.C.W.] contrary to s. 12 of the Charter?3.Are\nthe dangerous offender provisions of the Criminal Code in violation of\nthe Charter because if a court finds an offender to be a dangerous\noffender pursuant to s. 753, the court must impose a sentence of indeterminate\ndetention and the maximum period of review for parole eligibility has been\nraised from three to seven years.4.[L.C.W.]\nalso submits that dangerous offenders are an analogous ground under s. 15 of\nthe Charter.Re:1.Does\ns. 753 of the Criminal Code contravene s. 11(h) of the Charter by\ntrying to punish [L.C.W.] twice for the same offence?[137]Section\n11(h) states:11.Any person charged with\nan offence has the right...(h)if finally acquitted of the offence, not to be\ntried for it again and, if finally found guilty and punished for the offence,\nnot to be tried and punished for it again.[138]The\nSupreme Court of Canada has consistently held that for the purposes of an\napplication under XXIV of the Criminal Code, the offender is not\nbeing charged with an offence, but is being sentenced for the conviction of an\noffence. (Wilband v. R., 1966 CanLII 3 (SCC), [1967] S.C.R. 14; R. v. Lyons, 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1987] 2\nS.C.R. 309; R. v. Jones, 1994 CanLII 85 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 229).[139]In\nLyons, La Forest J. at p. 328 described the nature of s. 688 (now\ns. 753), as follows:... What section 688 does is to\npermit a judge to impose a sentence of indeterminate detention on an individual\nfor having committed an offence, which sentence is “in lieu of any other\nsentence that might be imposed for the offence for which the offender has\nbeen convicted”. (Emphasis added.) The individual is clearly being\nsentenced for the “serious personal injury offence” he or she has been found\nguilty of committing, albeit in a different way than would ordinarily be done. [Emphasis in\noriginal][140]In\nLyons, supra, the leading case with respect to the constitutionality of\nthe dangerous offender provisions of the Criminal Code, the Supreme\nCourt of Canada considered whether s. 688 violates s. 11(f) of the Charter\n(right to a jury trial for offences which carry at least a five year sentence).\nLa Forest J., for the majority, described the issue with respect to s.11 of the\nCharter as “whether the Crown application to declare the offender a\ndangerous offender is equivalent to “charging” the offender with “an offence”\n(p. 350).[141]The\ncourt held that, consistent with past jurisprudence on this issue, the\nsentencing portion of the criminal process does not fall within the ambit of\nthe words “any person charged with an offence” in the opening of s. 11. La\nForest J. concluded at p. 353:... It seems clear to me that\nfor the purposes of s. 11 it would be quite inappropriate to conclude that a\nconvicted person is charged with an offence when confronted with a Part XXI\n[now XXIV] application.Consequently,\ns. 11(f) could have no application.[142]In\nmy opinion [L.C.W.] does not now stand before the Court as a person charged\nwith an offence. He is there as a person subject, as part of the sentencing\nprocess, to having his status as an alleged offender determined. If he is so\ndeclared, he will receive an indeterminate sentence. It is clear that a court\nhas no authority to pass an additional sentence for a previous offence and the\ndangerous offender proceeding does not purport to give it that authority. (R.\nv. Latham (1987), 47 Man. R. (2d) 81 (Q.B.)).[143]I\ntherefore find that s. 11(h) of the Charter has no relevance to this\nproceeding.[144][L.C.W.]\nargues in the alternative that the removal of the words “in lieu of any other\nsentence that might be imposed for the offence for which the offender has been\nconvicted” in s. 753 of the Criminal Code means that the court must\nimpose both a sentence of indeterminate detention and a sentence for the\nserious personal injury offence that the offender has been convicted of. This\nhe contends is double jeopardy and therefore in violation of s. 11(h) of the Charter.\nI disagree.[145]The\ntrue characterization of s. 753 remains as pronounced in R. v. Lyons and R.\nv. Jones, supra, that is, an indeterminate sentence can be imposed in place\nof any other sentence which may have been rendered for the predicate offence\nwhich formed the basis of the dangerous offender proceeding. In my view the\namendment does not assist [L.C.W.] in this argument. It is clear from the\nsection as amended that it was the intention of Parliament that the imposition\nof an indeterminate sentence would be in lieu of any other sentence that may\nhave been imposed for the predicate offence.Re:2.Will\nthe imposition of a sentence of indeterminate detention constitute cruel and\nunusual punishment for [L.C.W.] contrary to s. 12 of the Charter?[146][L.C.W.]\nconcedes that s. 753 is constitutionally valid and that it does not violate s.\n12 of the Charter. He therefore does not ask that section to be declared\nof no force and effect pursuant to s. 52 of the Charter. [L.C.W.] does\nsubmit that its application here would amount to cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe foundation for this argument is said to be the physical and sexual abuse\nsuffered at the hands of his inmates during his incarceration previous to the\npredicate offence. [L.C.W.] argues that the dangerous offender designation will\nresult in the indeterminate incarceration of [L.C.W.] and will expose him to\nphysical jeopardy for an indeterminate term, a punishment not condoned or\nprovided for in the Criminal Code. [L.C.W.] contends that the\nappropriate and just remedy is a constitutional exemption from Part XXIV of the\nCriminal Code.[147]There\nare two reasons why this application should be dismissed. Firstly, [L.C.W.] was\nonly sexually assaulted once while he was in prison and that was in 1983,\napproximately 17 years ago. However, there is no other evidence which would\nindicate that [L.C.W.] had been attacked in prison since that time. Therefore,\nin my view, there is no factual basis for this argument. If I am in error in\nthis finding I am, in any event, satisfied that the majority decision of the\nSaskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Latimer, 1995 CanLII 3993 (SK CA), [1995] 8 W.W.R. 609 is\ndeterminative of this issue.[148][L.C.W.]\ncites the dissenting judgment of Bayda C.J.S. in R. v. Latimer as\nauthority for the proposition that the right not to be subjected to cruel and\nunusual punishment is an individual right belonging to each person alone, and\nthat, in accordance with the doctrine of constitutional exemption, certain laws\ncan be declared inapplicable to specific individuals.[149]A\nmajority of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal rejected the approach of Bayda\nC.J.S. in the 1995 Latimer decision. This position was affirmed by the\nSaskatchewan Court of Appeal in the 1999 Latimer decision. Leave to\nappeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted on this issue, [1999] S.C.C.A\nNo. 40 (QL).[150]While\nthe majority in the 1995 Latimer decision did not expressly consider the\nissue of whether constitutional exemptions are available to suspend the\noperation of an otherwise constitutionally valid statute, it is implied from\ntheir reasoning. Tallis J.A., speaking for the majority, stated at p. 650:In the circumstances\nof this case we reject the appellant’s request for a constitutional exemption\nfrom the prescribed sentences for second degree murder. It is open to\nParliament to modify the existing law by appropriate legislation that\nestablishes sentencing criteria for “mercy” killing. In the meantime, it is not\nfor the court to pass on the wisdom of Parliament with respect to the range of\npenalties to be imposed on those found guilty of murder.[151]This\napplication is therefore dismissed.Re:3.Are\nthe dangerous offender provisions of the Criminal Code in violation of\nthe Charter because if a court finds an offender to be a dangerous\noffender pursuant to s. 753, the court must impose a sentence of indeterminate\ndetention and the maximum period of review for parole eligibility has been\nraised from three to seven years.Removal of Discretion[152]Bill\nC-55 amended Part XXIV of the Criminal Code to remove the discretion of\nthe Court when sentencing a dangerous offender. Once the Court determines the\noffender is dangerous, he or she must be given an indeterminate sentence. [L.C.W.]\ncontends that this amendment renders s. 753 unconstitutional.[153]In\nR. v. Lyons, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada assessed the dangerous\noffender provisions of the Criminal Code against the requirements of s.\n12 of the Charter. La Forest J. cited a number of features which\nsupported the constitutionality of then s. 688 of the Criminal Code.\nAmong these features was the discretion reposed in the court to impose a\ndeterminate sentence on an offender who was designated asdangerous. Does the\nremoval of this discretion render s. 753 unconstitutional?[154]In\nLyons, La Forest J. at p. 334, summarized the issue raised by the\nappellant in that case as follows:The appellant\ncontends that Part XXI [now Part XXIV] violates s. 12 of the Charter in\nthat it imposes a punishment that is unusually severe and serves no valid\npenological purpose more effectively than a less severe punishment (e.g. a\ndeterminate sentence).Thus,\nwhile the court reviewed the dangerous offender provisions as a package, the\nreal focus of the analysis was whether an indeterminate sentence violates s.\n12.[155]La\nForest J. carefully assessed the legislation under consideration by looking at\nthe manner in which the Criminal Code attempts to balance the interests\nof society and the interests of the offender in a dangerous offender\nproceeding. He noted the following at pp. 337-38:➢The legislation applies only to persons convicted of a\n“serious personal injury offence” which means conduct tending to cause severe\nphysical danger or severe psychological injury to other persons. The maximum\npenalty for all of these offences must be at least ten years imprisonment;➢The offence for which the offender has been convicted\nmust be part of a pattern of violence or a failure to control sexual impulses;➢It must be shown that the pattern of conduct is likely\nto continue and will result in the suffering of others;➢The court has the discretion not to designate the\noffender as dangerous or to impose an indeterminate sentence.[156]With\nrespect to the imposition of an indeterminate sentence, La Forest J. opined at\np. 339:... There can be no doubt that\ndetention per se, and preventive detention in particular, is not cruel\nand unusual in the case of dangerous offenders, for the group to whom the\nlegislation applies has been functionally defined so as to ensure that persons\nwithin the group evince the very characteristics that render such detention\nnecessary.[157]Thus,\nthere is no doubt that indeterminate detention as a concept is not in and of\nitself cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. However, the court did\nobserve that without something more, an indeterminate sentence could, at least\non some occasions, be grossly disproportionate to what the circumstances of the\nindividual offender requires. This aspect of the legislative scheme is saved by\nthe mandatory parole review provisions now contained in s. 761(1) of the Criminal\nCode.[158]That\nsection of the Criminal Code requires the National Parole Board to\nreview the “condition, history and circumstances of [the dangerous offender]”.\nThe tests to be applied to a dangerous offender, as mandated by the Corrections\nand Conditional Release Act, S.S. 1992, c. 20., supply the necessary\nindividualized criteria to ensure that the legislation does not result in a\ngrossly disproportionate sentence and therefore does not violate s. 12 of the Charter.[159]Thus,\nlimiting the discretion of the court to impose a determinate sentence where an\noffender has been designated as a dangerous offender, does not, violate s. 12.\nThe essential elements which the court pointed to in Lyons, supra, set\nout above as arguing for the constitutionality of the scheme, have not been\naltered. The criteria which must be established to find an offender to be\ndangerous remains the same. In addition, each offender must be treated as an\nindividual in the parole review process mandated under s. 761 of the Criminal\nCode.[160]Indeed,\nthe discretion to impose a determinate sentence on a person found to be a\ndangerous offender was exercised very rarely. It was only where there was a\nprobability of ameliorating the condition of the offender or curing the\noffender within a determinate period of time that a court would consider\nimposing a determinate, rather than an indeterminate sentence on the accused.\nHowever, where a court was uncertain or lacked the confidence that there was\nany particular time within which the dangerous offender could be “cured”,\nindeterminate detention was deemed appropriate. (R. v. Morin, supra).Increase of Mandatory Parole Review from Three to Seven\nYears[161]The\nsubmissions of [L.C.W.] appear to suggest that the three year minimum parole\neligibility had the status of a constitutional requirement. This is in error.[162]It\nmust be remembered that to be found in contravention of s. 12 of the Charter,\nthe sentence must be grossly disproportionate to the offence committed. In the\nleading case of R. v. Smith (Edward Dewey), 1987 CanLII 64 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045 at\n1072, Lamer J. stated:... The test for review under s.\n12 of the Charter is one of gross disproportionality, because it is\naimed at punishments that are more than merely excessive. We should be careful\nnot to stigmatize every disproportionate or excessive sentence as being a\nconstitutional violation, and should leave to the usual sentencing appeal process\nthe task of reviewing the fitness of a sentence. Section 12 will only be\ninfringed where the sentence is so unfit having regard to the offence and the\noffender as to be grossly disproportionate.[163]If\none looks at the dangerous offender provisions, the following factors are\nrelevant:➢The offender must have been convicted of a serious\npersonal injury offence, which carries a penalty of at least tenyears;➢The offender will have been found to constitute a threat\nto the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons based on\na pattern of repetitive behaviour;➢If the serious personal injury offence is of a sexual\nnature as described in s. 752(b), the offender will have shown a failure\nto control sexual impulses and there is a likelihood of causing injury, pain or\nother evil to other persons.(Criminal\nCode ss. 752 and 753).[164]Therefore,\na person who is designated as a dangerous offender has been found by a court to\nconstitute a risk to the public which requires his or her preventative\ndetention. Because these offenders are such a risk, and have committed serious\npersonal injury offences, a seven year period of incarceration without parole\nreview is not grossly disproportionate in the circumstances.[165]In\nthe case of [L.C.W.], he was convicted of breaking and entering a dwelling\nhouse and committing the indictable offence of sexual assault causing bodily\nharm, contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. Pursuant to s.\n348(1)(d), [L.C.W.] is liable to imprisonment for life.[166]Given\nthat this is [L.C.W.]’s third conviction for a sexual offence, ordinary\nprinciples of sentencing would indicate that he be given a fairly lengthy\nsentence.[167]Taking\nthe example of a 15 year sentence, in the ordinary course, [L.C.W.] would be\neligible for parole in five years. However, the court also has the ability to\norder that an offender serve at least half of his or her sentence before being\neligible for parole. If he were ordered by this Court to serve half of his\nsentence prior to being paroled, this would amount to a term of seven and\none-half years before he is paroled. This is ultimately the same time period as\nthe first mandatory parole review if he were given an indeterminate sentence. (Criminal\nCode, s. 743.6).[168]It\nis my opinion that given the serious offences committed by dangerous offenders\nand the threat they pose to society, it is not grossly disproportionate to\nrequire that all such offenders be reviewed for parole after seven years\nincarceration.Re:4.[L.C.W.]\nalso submits that dangerous offenders are an analogous ground under s. 15 of\nthe Charter.[169][L.C.W.]\nappears to argue that dangerous offenders are being discriminated against\nbecause “stereotypical ideas are imputed to an individual parole applicant by\nmembers of the National Parole Board reviewing each case based on the fact that\nhe has been labelled as a member of this group” as dangerous offenders are not\na listed group protected under s. 15.[170]In\nCorbiere v. Canada (Minister of Indian \u0026 Northern Affairs), 1999 CanLII 687 (SCC), [1999] 2\nS.C.R. 203, the Supreme Court of Canada set out the criteria by which analogous\ngrounds are identified: analogous grounds must serve as the basis for\nstereotypical decisions made not on the basis of merit, but on the basis of a\npersonal characteristic that is immutable or changeable only at an unacceptable\ncost to personal identity.[171]Analogous\ngrounds that have been found to be protected under s. 15 include, sexual\norientation, marital status, citizenship and aboriginality residence. (Egan\nv. Canada, 1995 CanLII 98 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R. 513; Miron v. Trudel, 1995 CanLII 97 (SCC), [1995] 2 S.C.R.\n418, Andrews v. The Law Society of British Columbia, 1989 CanLII 2 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143\nand Corbiere v. Canada, supra).[172]People\nare designated as dangerous offenders based on their behaviour and the threat\nthey pose to society. It is only by the commission of a serious personal injury\noffence, that one can be considered for dangerous offender status. The\ncommission of a crime is a matter of personal choice for the offender. It is\nnot an immutable personal characteristic. Nor should it be considered a\npersonal characteristic that is changeable only at an unacceptable cost to\npersonal identity.[173]In\nmy view, there is no Charter violation under s. 15.[174][L.C.W.]\nhas not satisfied the Court beyond a balance of probabilities that there are\nany Charter violations under ss. 11, 12 and 15.[175]I\nam deeply indebted to counsel in this matter for their assistance throughout\nincluding the filing of exhaustive briefs of law and I acknowledge that certain\nof their submissions have been incorporated into the judgment.J."}

Murray Brown, for the respondent[1]Tallis,\nJ.A.: As a result of a serious automobile collision near Regina, Saskatchewan,\non October 7, 1989, the appellant was charged under s. 255(3) of the Criminal\nCode. Following his committal for trial in Queen's Bench, he pleaded guilty\nin that court to the following indictment:\"That he, the said Ronald J. Paul on or about the 7th day\nof October, A.D. 1989, at or near Regina District, Saskatchewan did operate a\nmotor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol\nor a drug and did thereby cause the death of Shawn Blechinger contrary to s.\n255(3) of the Criminal Code.\"[2]After\nconducting a presentence hearing with extensive oral submissions, the presiding\nQueen's Bench judge sentenced the appellant to five years' imprisonment. As\nwell he was prohibited from driving for a period of five years with the\nprohibition to commence upon his release from prison.[3]The\nappellant now appeals on the general grounds that the sentence is too severe\nand cannot be reconciled with other sentences imposed in this jurisdiction for\nsimilar offences. As well he complains that the sentencing judge took a number\nof irrelevant matters into account.[4]This\nappeal presents one of the profound social problems of our time - the\nculpability of the impaired or drunk driver. Counsel appearing in this court\nhave filed extensive materials and submissions which we need not repeat. As a\nstarting point we accept the skeletal facts summarized in Mr. Brown's factum\nfor the Crown;\"At approximately 8:00 to 8:30 p.m. on the 7th of\nOctober, 1989, the appellant while driving a motor vehicle had a collision with\na motor vehicle carrying Shawn Blechinger. As a result of the injuries received\nin that collision, Shawn Blechinger died. At the time of the collision the\nappellant was severely intoxicated. At 9:52 p.m. on that date a blood sample\ntaken from the appellant showed a blood-alcohol reading of .32.\"Prior to the accident the appellant had been doing\nconsiderable drinking both in and out of his vehicle. He apparently was on his\nway home and had stopped at White City to get gas for his car. When he left\nWhite City, he turned the wrong way and ended up heading towards Regina. When\nhe turned east towards Regina, the appellant turned into the wrong set of lanes\non the divided highway and ended up travelling towards Regina into the oncoming\ntraffic. The appellant apparently drove the entire distance between the White\nCity Esso access road and the collision cite at the CKCK tower without noticing\nhe was in the wrong lane.\"In addition to the above, the appellant apparently also\ndid not notice he had been involved in two other accidents prior to the one at\nthe CKCK tower. Approximately 6.4 km. east of the tower, the appellant\nsideswiped a vehicle driven by a Mr. Christian Schaeffer. The appellant made no\neffort to stop and it appears from the evidence he was so drunk he did not\nrealize he had had an accident or that he was driving against the traffic and\nthe wrong way down the divided highway.\"A short time later he was involved in his second\naccident hitting the back end of a van. Again the appellant did not stop or\neven appear to slow down. A witness who observed the appellant's course of\ndriving indicated that from White City to the television tower the appellant\nswerved badly across the traffic lanes, encountered several other vehicles\nforcing them to take evasive action to avoid him and maintained a speed of\napproximately 100 k.p.h. At no time was there any indication that he was aware\nof the danger he was creating or that he had hit two cars.\"At the scene of the accident at the television tower,\nthe appellant first caused one vehicle to swerve out of his way. Next he struck\nthe following vehicle as it too attempted to get out of the appellant's path.\nHe essentially knocked that vehicle out of the way as it tried to avoid him and\nthen plowed head-on into the vehicle carrying Shawn Blechinger. The deceased,\nShawn Blechinger suffered severe head injuries and died from these some five\ndays later. He was 15 years old at the time.\"[5]The\nappellant who is 44 years of age operates a farm in the Davin District near\nRegina. He is married with three children. Given current farm conditions the\nfamily is under financial stress. However, his wife is employed in Regina and\nthe two oldest children are now gainfully employed in that City. The youngest\nchild who is 14 years of age attends the same school that the victim attended.[6]The\nappellant has a previous record which is as follows:1966-06-02Theft under $50$15 I-D 10 daysRegina Sasks. 280(b) C.C.1984-06-26 Indian Head Sask.Driving with more than 80 mgs ofalcohol in blood s. 236 C.C.$400 I-D 40 days[7]The\nmaterial before us indicates that the appellant is a work-oriented individual\nwho has struggled to maintain his livelihood and raise a family. However, his\nfamily life has been disrupted by a major problem - alcohol abuse. His previous\nconviction in June of 1984 arose out of an accident where people were injured\nbut without the tragic consequences we have in this case. Although in previous\nyears the appellant has attempted to deal with this problem of alcohol abuse,\nhe did not follow through with the necessary steps. He now faces a serious\nsituation which is one of his own making.[8]We\nhave no doubt that he is sincere in his expressions of remorse. The\nconsequences of his driving were devastating for the family of the victim. As\nwell, we have no doubt that his own family has suffered greatly. One can only\nhope that he will now recognize the imperative need for a change in his habits.\nThe material before us indicates that he is making a genuine effort to address\nhis problem.[9]We\nobserve that s. 255(3) of the Criminal Code carries a maximum term of 14\nyears' imprisonment. Parliament has said that the courts must not only consider\nthe driving but also the consequences of that driving - in this case, the death\nof a 15 year old boy. We observe that the appellant is fortunate that his\ndriving did not result in the death or serious injury to other innocent\nvictims.[10]Although the appellant was seriously injured in this collision we cannot\nplace any emphasis on that fact. He is the cause of his own injuries as well as\nthe death of an innocent person.[11]This offence required a lengthy term of imprisonment to answer society's\nconcerns. We appreciate the hardship that the appellant has inflicted on his\nown family - but that is far less than the hardship and trauma inflicted on the\nvictim's family. In the circumstances the sentence must emphasize the\nprotection of the public as well as deterrence in its widest sense. We must\nalso rationalize the sentence for this offence with the sentences imposed in\nthis jurisdiction for similar offences. After considering the previous\ndecisions of this court we cannot give effect to the appellant's contention\nthat the sentence should be reduced to a term between two and three years. We\nare all of the opinion that the sentence should be varied to four years'\nimprisonment. Such a term is consistent with the sentences approved by this\ncourt for driving offences of this nature. In other words after considering the\ncircumstances of this offence and this offender, we have concluded that a fit\nsentence is four years' imprisonment.[12]We affirm the driving prohibition order for five years with a direction\nthat it commence from the date the sentence was imposed. In the circumstances\nof this case we do not find it necessary to address the issue whether the court\nhas jurisdiction to fix the commencement date of such prohibition to run from\nthe date of his release from custody: See R. v. Laycock (1989), 51\nC.C.C.(3d) 65, and R. v. Atkinson (1989), 16 M.V.R.(2d) 4.[13]In the result the sentence imposed is varied to a term of four years'\nimprisonment. The prohibition order under s. 259(2) of the Criminal Code\nfor a period of five years is affirmed with a direction that it commences on\nthe date of imposition of sentence in Queen's Bench.Appeal allowed."}

The judge, however, refused to order the forfeiture of $24,000 seized\nat the respondent’s, or to impose a fine instead of forfeiture.[2]The appellant appeals and argues that the\nsentences and fine surcharges were too lenient. The judge did not properly\nconsider the objectives of denunciation and deterrence given the nature of the\nfraud and the respondent’s degree of responsibility. In addition, the judge\nerred in refusing to order the forfeiture and the compensatory fine.[3]The respondent, having drug and gambling debts,\nfraudulently resold cars with rolled back odometers. Assisted by his spouse and\nencouraged by his lenders, he bought used cars from individuals and rolled back\ntheir odometers to fraudulently increase their value. He spruced up the\nvehicles so their appearance matched their new mileage, then resold them to\nindividuals at a price higher than their purchase price. The defrauders also\nfalsified the proxies to transfer the registration so that the altered mileage\nappeared in the Société d’assurance automobile du Québec databanks. In\ntotal, 49 vehicles were purchased, tampered with, and resold between April of\n2006 and November of 2007.[4]On July 23, 2008, the police arrested the\nrespondent and his spouse. During a search of their home they found a safe\ncontaining $24,000 in cash, divided into several envelopes, two of which\ncontained $10,000. The money was seized.***[5]Did the trial judge err in law by imposing an\neight month prison sentence on the respondent, accompanied by a three-year\nprobation and victim fine surcharges totalling $7,350?[6]From the outset, it is noteworthy that case law\nhas consistently held that the Court must show deference to sentences decided\nby trial judges. The Court may only intervene where the sentence “is\n’demonstrably unfit’ or if it reflected an error in principle, the failure to\nconsider a relevant factor, or the over-emphasis of a relevant factor”.[1][7]In this case, the sentence imposed by the judge\non the respondent is certainly not harsh, but it cannot be characterized as\nunreasonable. It falls within the range of sentences imposed in other cases of\nodometer rollback fraud.[2]\nThe judge correctly weighed the different objectives to determine a sentence\nand arrived at a sentence that took the objectives of denunciation, deterrence\nand rehabilitation into account. He also adequately balanced the aggravating\nand mitigating circumstances.[8]The appellant alleges that the judge erred when\nhe wrote that [translation] “section 380.1 Cr C\nonly applies very minimally in this case, and does so due to the number of\nvictims, no more” (para [39]). According to the appellant, this passage attests\nto an erroneous interpretation of section 380.1 Cr C, which clearly\nspecifies that the number of victims of the fraud is an independent aggravating\nfactor.[9]Contrary to what the appellant maintains, a\nreading of all of the judge's reasons indicates that he correctly considered\nthe number of victims as an independent aggravating factor. The judge wrote, in\nparticular [translation]: “…, what constitutes an aggravating factor, or indicates the\nextent of the accused’s fraud, is the number of victims, forty-nine” (para\n[32]). Further on in his reasons, he adds [translation] “… [t]he aggravating factors that we accept are the duration of\nthe fraud, the number of transactions and victims, the premeditation, the\ncriminal record including possession of stolen vehicles” (para [39]). The\nappellant is thus mistaken: the judge did not commit an error in interpreting\nsection 381.1 that would justify the Court's intervention.[10]The appellant also criticizes the judge for\nfailing to respect the principle of gradation of sentences. It notes that the\nrespondent was sentenced in 2003 to a twelve months’ imprisonment for fraud and\npossession of stolen property, which would have warranted a harsher sentence in\nthis case due to the recividism. The principle of gradation of sentences should\nnot be applied in a mechanical and abstract manner.[3] The judge considered the\nrespondent's criminal record and did not feel it necessary to impose the same\nor a longer sentence than that imposed in 2003 due to the mitigating\ncircumstances in the present case. Here again, the appellant is unable to\ndemonstrate that this choice was marked by an error justifying the Court's\nintervention.[11]It is noteworthy that, exercising the\ndiscretionary power conferred upon him under subsection 737(3) Cr C,\nthe judge ordered a fine surcharge of $150 for each of the 49 counts of\nfraud, an amount greater than the fine surcharge of $100 per count\notherwise applicable. This is an additional indication of how seriously the\njudge viewed the sentence.[12]To sum up, it is not necessary to modify the\nprison sentence or the fine surcharges imposed by the judge.***[13]Did the trial judge err in stating that he was\nnot convinced that the sum of $24,000 seized at the respondent's was proceeds\nof crime and therefore not subject to forfeiture under subsection 462.37(1) Cr\nC?[14]Under subsection 462.37(1) Cr C, a judge\nwho imposes the sentence and who “… is satisfied, on a balance of\nprobabilities, that any property is proceeds of crime and that the designated\noffence was committed in relation to that property, ... shall order that the\nproperty be forfeited to Her Majesty.” The term “proceeds of crime” is defined\nin subsection 462.3(1): “any property, benefit or advantage, within or outside\nCanada, obtained or derived directly or indirectly as a result of: a) the\ncommission in Canada of a designated offence….”[15]The judge found, on a balance of probabilities,\nthat the $24,000 was for the most part a gift from the respondent's\ngrandfather, sent to him and his sister shortly before his death. It was,\ntherefore, not proceeds of crime within the meaning of subsection 462.3(1) Cr\nC and could not then be subject to forfeiture.[16]The judge's conclusion is supported by the\nevidence. We refer in particular to the strong bond between the respondent and\nhis grandfather, the time between the commission of the frauds and the seizure\nof the $24,000, the respondent's debts that would have already swallowed up the\nfraudulently acquired income, and the allocation of sums into the envelopes\nfound in the safe.[17]The appellant has not shown that the judge\ncommitted an error justifying the Court's intervention in this regard.***[18]Did the trial judge err in not imposing on the\nrespondent a fine instead of forfeiture under subsection 462.37(3) Cr C?[19]To impose a fine under 462.37(3) Cr C,\nthe judge must: 1) be convinced that an order of forfeiture should be rendered\nregarding property, and 2) be convinced that the property cannot be subject to\nsuch an order, in particular for one of the reasons listed in the section. The\namount of the fine must equal the value of the property for which the order of\nforfeiture should have been rendered.[4][20]The appellant alleges that the amount of\nproceeds of crime on which the fine instead of forfeiture should be based is\nthe total value of the sums paid by the respondent's fraud victims. According\nto the appellant, all the money the respondent obtained from his victims, not\nonly the profit he derived, constitutes proceeds of crime subject to the fine\nunder subsection 467.32(3).[21]This argument must fail. As the judge explained,\nit cannot be said that all the money given by the victim – in exchange for\nwhich he or she nonetheless obtained a car with a resale value – is related to\nthe fraud. Moreover, the respondent concluded sixty-eight other perfectly\nlegitimate transactions, so the judge was unable to distinguish what became of\nthe sums obtained fraudulently as opposed to those obtained legitimately. In\naddition, the respondent's sale of cars cannot be likened to the sale of drugs,\nfor which the entire consideration constitutes proceeds of crime. Given the\nnature of the transactions involved, the judge was correct to consider only the\nportion of the resale profits associated with the fraud.[22]In this case, the judge refused to impose a fine\non the respondent because he could not establish the value of the property\nsubject to forfeiture with certainty. On this point, he wrote:[translation][91]This\nis clearly not an enterprise crime offence. While the profits from the sale of\nvehicles was established at $51,000, the victims' actual loss was not. The\naccused committed these frauds with the objective of reimbursing drug debts to\nhis menacing lender-usurers. As previously stated, nor is the Court convinced\nthat an order of forfeiture of property valued at $51,000 should be imposed. The\nevidence established that the sale of the vehicles in question brought in\n$51,000, but this same evidence does not allow us to establish which portion of\nthe profits is due to the fraud and which one is due to the simple act of\nbuying and reselling used cars. However, in order to impose a compensatory\nor substitute fine, this evidence must be made, as opposed to property,\nproceeds of crime, otherwise unavailable.[Emphasis\nadded][23]The appellant maintains that the judge erred in\nfailing to consider that the respondent's involvement in the frauds enabled him\nto reimburse $30,000 in debt. Indeed, the judge noted that the respondent used\nthe income from the resale of cars to pay his debt (paras [71] and [78]). The\nrespondent affirmed in his testimony that his lenders erased his debt due to\nhis participation in the frauds.[24]Is this sum of $30,000 considered proceeds of\ncrime within the meaning of subsection 462.37(1) Cr C?[25]We know the judge considered that he could not\nidentify the amount from the resale that constituted proceeds of crime because\nit was impossible to distinguish the legitimate profits from the illegitimate\nprofits resulting from the sale of used vehicles. This same factual\nimpossibility remains an obstacle to imposing a compensatory fine regarding the\n$30,000, despite the fact he admitted to personally making this sum from the\nventure. We cannot state with the requisite certainty that this sum constitutes\nproceeds of crime because the evidence does not reveal which part of the\nprofits used to reimburse these $30,000 were associated with the fraud. Yet\nidentifying the proceeds of crime is a sine qua non condition to\napplying subsection 462.37(3) Cr C.[26]Lastly, the appellant argues that the respondent,\nwho was receiving social assistance at the time he committed the offences,\ndefrauded the Ministère de l'Emploi et de la Solidarité sociale of\n$11,525.73 by failing to declare the income from his used car business. The\namount in question, therefore, also represents proceeds of crime according to\nsubsection 462.37(2) Cr C that may be subject to a fine instead of\nforfeiture.[27]This allegation is destined to fail because\nproceeds of crime subject to forfeiture under 462.37 Cr C must\nnonetheless be connected to the offences of which the accused is found guilty,[5] which is not the case here.[28]Overall, the appellant has failed to convince\nthe Court that it should intervene in the sentence, the forfeiture of the\n$24,000 or the confiscatory fine.[29]FOR THESE REASONS,\nTHE COURT, from the bench, allows the motion for leave to appeal and\ndismisses the appeal.ANDRÉBROSSARD, J.A.FRANÇOIS DOYON, J.A.NICHOLAS KASIRER, J.A.Mtre Maxime ChevalierCRIMINAL AND PENAL PROSECUTORFor the appellantMtre Serge MiletteFor the respondentDate of hearing:September 7, 2011[1]R. v.Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2010] 1 SCR 206 at para [46].[2]See, for ex, R. v.

Rondeaufor\nthe respondentJUDGMENTZARZECZNY J.August 27, 2003THE\nAPPLICATION[1]This is an application\nby Krystal Anderson on behalf of the Saskatchewan Department of Corrections and\nPublic Safety made pursuant to s. 742.4 of the Criminal Code seeking to\nchange the optional conditions of a sentence imposed upon Arnold Boan by this\nCourt December 9, 2002. Mr. Boan had been earlier convicted of four counts of\nindecent assault by a judge sitting with a jury. The assaults as charged\noccurred between January 1, 1966 and May 31, 1971.THE\nBACKGROUND FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES[2]After ordering,\nreceiving and considering a Pre-sentence Report the Court imposed a conditional\nsentence of 21 months to be served in the community subject to a number of\nmandatory and optional conditions including severe restrictions upon Mr. Boan’s\nliberty. The Pre-sentence Report (“PSR”) was prepared by Lesa Douglas, a\nprobation officer with Saskatchewan Corrections and Public Safety. That report\nwas thorough and comprehensive and it included a detailed risk assessment. The\nreport concluded in part as follows at p. 17:The offences are sexual in nature, however due to the\nage of the offender and the length of time since the offences, Your Honour may\nwish to consider a term of Supervised Probation for this offender. It is this\nwriter’s opinion that due to the above noted factors, as well as the offender’s\ncurrent involvement in a healthy marital relationship, and the deterrence\naspect of his involvement with the justice system alone, that sex offender\ntreatment is not necessary for the protection of the public. Should treatment\nbe a factor in sentencing however, it is readily available within the community\nsetting.[3]Subsequent to the\nsentencing Mr. Boan was assigned to Ms. Douglas as his probation officer. After\napproximately three months, on April 1, 2003, responsibility for the provision\nof probation services to Mr. Boan was assigned to the applicant, Ms. Anderson.\nAs a result of her interviews and work with Mr. Boan she became concerned about\nMr. Boan’s attitudes, perceptions and beliefs respecting the sexual offences\nupon which he was convicted and the consequences of his actions upon the\nvictims. These concerns caused Ms. Anderson to conclude that Mr. Boan presented\na higher risk to re-offend than was assessed in the PSR. She recommended that\nhe attend for an assessment to enter a sex offender program offered at the\nRegina Mental Health Clinic. He agreed to do so.[4]He was assessed at the\nclinic by Ms. Kim Pelletier. She determined that he was an appropriate\ncandidate for the program. When Mr. Boan became acquainted with the level of\ncommitment required by the program he took his voluntary participation under\nadvisement and ultimately decided not to participate. This prompted Ms.\nAnderson to make the current application to the Court seeking to impose that\nattendance as an additional condition of his sentence. In the result, a hearing\nwas held before the Court on August 26, 2003 at which time evidence with\nrespect to the matter was received all as provided for by s. 742.4 of the Criminal\nCode.ISSUE[5]The issue upon this\napplication is whether or not the requirements of s. 742.4(1) have been met and\nwhether or not the Court should approve or refuse to approve the proposed\nchange to Arnold Boan’s conditional sentence adding a condition that Mr. Boan\nundergo assessment, counselling and treatment for sexual offending behaviours\nand attend a program for sexual offenders delivered by the Regina Mental Health\nClinic.ANALYSIS[6]Prior to its sentencing\nthe Court ordered and subsequently received the PSR prepared by Ms. Douglas.\nMs. Douglas testified at the hearing of this application providing the Court\nwith her professional qualifications, education and work history. She had spent\nthree to four hours with Mr. Boan and additional time with other persons interviewed\nin the course of preparing the PSR. She administered a number of sexual\noffender risk assessments including the “Static 99” test and the “Stable 2000”\ntest to assess static and dynamic factors applicable to Mr. Boan’s\ncircumstances. It was her opinion that the Boan case represented exceptional\ncircumstances. She reviewed the case with her supervisor at Corrections Canada\n(where she also continued to be employed in addition to her term employment\nwith Saskatchewan Corrections and Public Safety) and he agreed with her\nconclusions that the case presented exceptional circumstances and warranted a\n“Clinical Override” to the medium-low risk assessment derived from the Static\n99 testing. This resulted in a low risk to re-offend assessment in her opinion\nand it was this conclusion which she presented in the PSR delivered to this\nCourt.[7]In coming to these\nconclusions weight was given to numerous changes in the dynamic factors present\nin Mr. Boan’s circumstances. These included his age (Mr. Boan will shortly be\n66) and the in excess of 32 years having passed since the commission of the\noffences without any charges that Mr. Boan committed any further or other\noffences at all, including sexual offences. Much weight was given to his\ncurrent stable marital relationship with his wife Adeline with whom Mr. Boan\nwas found to have a communicative, stable and supportive relationship. The\nCourt also noted, at the time of Mr. Boan’s sentencing, that his wife and other\nfamily members had strongly supported him and been in attendance during his\njury trial, his subsequent sentencing and now this hearing of the application\nto vary conditions.[8]In the result, Ms.\nDouglas concluded, in her recommendations to the Court at p. 17 of her report:... It is this writer’s opinion that due to the above\nnoted factors, as well as the offender’s current involvement in a healthy\nmarital relationship, and the deterrence aspect of his involvement with the\njustice system alone, that sex offender treatment is not necessary for the\nprotection of the public....[9]As noted on and after\nApril 1, 2003 the applicant, Ms. Anderson became Mr. Boan’s supervising\nprobation officer. In her testimony she testified that she and Mr. Boan\nappeared to get off on the wrong foot and did not appear to have the positive\nand cooperative relationship that existed between Mr. Boan and Ms. Douglas. In\npart she attributed this to the position which she felt she was compelled to\ntake regarding his requests for relief from some of the restrictive conditions\nwhich had been imposed as part of his sentence which she had no authority to\nvary. She understood Mr. Boan was under the impression that Ms. Douglas would have\ngranted these requests however, Ms. Douglas was not asked about this when she\ntestified at the hearing.[10]Ms. Anderson testified\nthat Mr. Boan disclosed to her that in addition to the four complainants on the\ncharges upon which he was convicted he had engaged in similar conduct in\nsimilar circumstances with others. She had not pursued any details with respect\nto this disclosure nor did she have any further details to testify to at the\nhearing. She indicates that this disclosure together with Mr. Boan’s attitudes,\nperceptions, beliefs and lack of empathy with his victims, all led her to\nconclude that he was at a higher risk to re-offend than had originally been\nassessed by Ms. Douglas. She arranged for Mr. Boan to attend at the Regina\nMental Health Clinic to be ultimately seen by Ms. Pelletier one of a group of\nworkers in the Alternative to Sexual Offenders and Alternatives to Violence\nprograms for further assessment and for a “second opinion”. Ms. Pelletier\ntestified that she saw Mr. Boan and after an hour’s meeting with him concurred\nin the assessment of Ms. Anderson that he would be an appropriate candidate for\nenrollment in and attendance at the Alternative to Sexual Offenders Program.\nShe recommended this to Mr. Boan. Upon learning that the program would require\nat least two hours of weekly group therapy sessions continuing for an estimated\none year period Mr. Boan, after seeking the advice of his legal counsel,\ndeclined to participate with the result that this application was brought and a\nhearing held.[11]Section 742.4(1) and (3)\nof the Criminal Code provide as follows:742.4(1)Where the offender’s supervisor is of the opinion\nthat a change in circumstances makes a change to the optional conditions\ndesirable, the supervisor shall give written notification of the proposed\nchange, and the reasons for it, to the offender, to the prosecutor and to the\ncourt....(3)At a hearing held pursuant to subsection (2),\nthe court(a)shall approve or refuse to approve the\nproposed change; and(b)may make any other change to the\noptional conditions that the court deems appropriate.[12]Both counsel for the\napplicant and Mr. Boan have advised the Court that they have not discovered any\nreported authority with respect to the interpretation and application of these\nsections, particularly in the circumstances now presented to the Court. Counsel\nfor Mr. Boan argues that the applicant has not demonstrated a change in\ncircumstance to support the imposition of the additional condition requested\nnor is the additional condition “desirable” within the meaning of subsection\n(1) of s. 742.4.[13]Counsel for the applicant\nargues that the admission by Mr. Boan that he had engaged in other sexual\nconduct or behaviours similar to those with which he was charged and convicted\ndoes constitute a change in circumstance and that the evidence of Ms. Anderson\nsupported by the assessment of Ms. Pelletier and her recommendations support\nthe desirability of this additional condition as contemplated by the Criminal\nCode. Therefore the proposed change ought to be ordered.[14]In view of the results\nwhich the Court has reached respecting the merits of the application it is\nunnecessary for the Court to consider the more general and legally important\nquestion as to whether or not subsection 742.3(2)(e) of the Criminal Code\nis constitutionally valid and enforceable having regard to ss. 2 and/or 7 of\nthe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution\nAct, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.),\n1982, c. 11 (the “Charter”). Neither counsel argued this question nor\nwas the required notice given to the Crown that a constitutional question would\nbe raised or argued. The Court observes that s. 742.3(2)(e) deals with the same\nsubject matter as does s. 732.1(3)(g)—Optional conditions of probation order.\nThe former departs significantly from the qualifications introduced into the\nlatter section requiring the accused’s consent before any compulsory\nprogramming can be imposed as an optional condition in a probation order.\nSection 732.1(3) was amended after the decision of the British Columbia Court of\nAppeal in the case of R. v. Rogers (1990), 1990 CanLII 432 (BC CA), 2 C.R. (4th) 192\nholding that the provision as previously worded and not providing for the\nconsent of the accused (similar to the present wording of s. 742.3(2)(e))\nviolates the Charter and such violations, depending on the specific\nprogram and order, will not likely be saved by s. 1 of the Charter. (See\nalso R. v. Kieling (1991), 1991 CanLII 8023 (SK CA), 92 Sask. R. 281 (C.A.) and R. v.\nSookochoff (1999), 1999 CanLII 12568 (SK QB), 176 Sask. R. 106 (Q.B.)). This legal issue will survive\nto be considered and determined another day upon proper notice.[15]There is no suggestion\nthat Ms. Douglas in the first instance in preparing the PSR for the Court,\nMs. Anderson in her work with Mr. Boan ultimately leading to this application\nand request for this additional condition or Ms. Pelletier also working with\nMr. Boan and making her assessment of him were acting otherwise than in the\nhighest and best interests of Mr. Boan and the practises and procedures of\ntheir professions as social workers and probation officers. As Ms. Douglas\ntestified, there is a sincere and legitimate difference of professional opinion\nas between these three social workers respecting how Mr. Boan’s case should be\nmanaged in the primary interest of the public’s protection. Ms. Douglas\ntestified to the factors which she emphasized in reaching the conclusions and\nrecommendations which she did in her PSR and Ms. Anderson and Ms. Pelletier\nsimilarly testified to the factors which they emphasized in their assessments\nand conclusions which they now proffer for the Court’s consideration.[16]It is perhaps trite to\nobserve that the very fact that these differences of professional opinions\nexist illustrates that this process is not simply a scientific one but is\nsubjective to the individual being assessed and the qualifications, experience\nand judgment of the assessors. It is a credit to all involved that they have\ngiven Mr. Boan’s case and circumstances the attention that they have notwithstanding\ntheir heavy caseloads.[17]This Court was much\nassisted by the information and detailed analysis and assessment which it\nreceived from the PSR in determining the original sentence it considered\nappropriately imposed upon Mr. Boan. Many of the factors which were considered\nand the assessments made in the PSR were commented upon by the Court during its\nsentencing hearing and ultimate decision. Although not every recommendation in\nevery PSR is agreed with by the Court in the process of sentencing it can be\nsaid, without fear of contradiction, that the courts very much respect and are\nassisted by the recommendations contained in the Pre-sentence Reports and they\nare given the most serious and thorough consideration.[18]This Court, as did Ms.\nDouglas in her PSR, gave, during its sentencing judgment, some considerable\nweight to the fact that these offences occurred in excess of 30 years ago and\nthat in the intervening time Mr. Boan was not charged with nor convicted of any\nother offences at all, most importantly, no further or other sexual offences.\nHis circumstances, referred to in the evidence of the social workers at this\nhearing, as dynamic factors, have virtually all changed and all changes were\nfor the better. Perhaps of greatest influence upon the circumstances of Mr.\nBoan is the relationship and marriage he has successfully had with his wife\nAdeline who Ms. Douglas reported and this Court has observed remains\nsteadfastly supportive of Mr. Boan in these difficult circumstances. While it\nmay be that Mr. Boan continues to demonstrate attitudes and holds opinions\nincreasing his risk to re-offend in the assessment of Ms. Douglas and Ms.\nPelletier and leading them to conclude that he would benefit from participation\nin the Sexual Offender Program, nevertheless Mr. Boan has demonstrated that he\nhas been able to control any deviant tendencies or behaviours successfully, in\nhis present circumstances, without such programming for in excess of 30 years.[19]This Court has not been\nsatisfied that the circumstances relied upon by the applicant in support of\nthis application constitute a change in circumstances nor that a change to the\noptional conditions imposed upon Mr. Boan would be desirable at this time.\nHaving reached this conclusion however it is not to say that Mr. Boan would\nnot, upon reconsidering the whole of the evidence presented in this\napplication, conclude that he would benefit from the recommended program if he\nchose to participate voluntarily. This remains for him to decide in\nconsultation with his family. Having reached the conclusions which this Court\nhas, the application for a change in the conditions of Mr. Boan’s sentence is\ndismissed.J."}

A. Charbonneau, at Hay River in the NorthwestTerritories, on May 5th A.D., 2009._________________________________________________________APPEARANCES:Mr. M. Himmelman:Counsel for the CrownMr. T. Boyd:Counsel for the Accused----------------------------------------Charge under s. 271 Criminal Code of CanadaAn Order has been made banning publication of theComplainant/Witness Pursuant to Section 486.4 of theCriminal Code of CanadaOfficial Court Reporters1THE COURT:Good afternoon, everyone.2Before I begin, I just want to remind3everyone that yesterday I confirmed that there4was a publication ban in this matter which means5that any information that could disclose the6identity of the complainant is not to be7published or broadcast in any way.8Noel Junior Avadluk has pleaded guilty to a9charge of sexual assault, and today it is my task10to impose a fit sentence for that crime.There11are many things that must be taken into12consideration when sentencing a person.I must13say that I found the submissions that I heard14yesterday from both counsel very thorough and15very well presented.It was clear to me that16both of them have put a great deal of thought and17effort into this case and I did find their18submissions very helpful in arriving at what is19not an easy decision.20Mr. Avadluk also spoke yesterday morning and21he spoke for quite some time about some of the22struggles that he has faced in his life, some of23the things that he has come to realize and24understand about himself over the past months,25and how he wants to move forward from here.I26listened to him carefully and I have also given a27lot of thought to the things that he has told theOfficial Court Reporters11Court.2The circumstances of the offence committed3by Mr. Avadluk are set out in an agreed statement4of facts that was made an exhibit.It was marked5as Exhibit 1.Those facts were read into the6record when Mr. Avadluk entered his guilty plea7in Yellowknife on May 1st, and they were read8again into the record yesterday.I am not going9to read the whole document in its entirety but to10put my sentencing decision in context, I must11refer, to some extent, to what happened that day12because it is why we are all here.13In June of 2007 when this offence was14committed, the victim of this crime was 63 years15old.She came upon Mr. Avadluk when she was on16her way to a radio studio situated on the third17floor of the highrise building here in Hay River.18She went up the stairs, and Mr. Avadluk followed19her.She let him go by.He asked her what floor20she was going to and she told him.He said that21he was going to another floor.Before this day,22she did not know who he was.23When she arrived at the door of the unit24where she was going and unlocked the door, she25realized that Mr. Avadluk was right beside her.26She went into the unit and tried to close the27door but he prevented her from doing so.She didOfficial Court Reporters21everything that she could to try to keep him out.2But it did not work and he was eventually able to3force his way in.She screamed for help but he4put his hand over her mouth and pushed her to the5floor.She tried to struggle but eventually she6stopped because she was having difficulty7breathing.They then got up off the floor.He8asked her for some money and she gave him what9she had which was just small change.She asked10him what he wanted.He pushed her back to the11floor and then started sexually assaulting her by12putting his hands down her pants.He put his13fingers in her vagina and she thinks he stayed14that way for half an hour.He then got her to go15to the main area of the unit and held her with16her back over a chair.She said that hurt her17back so he put her back onto the floor.Her18estimate is that she was kept on the floor for19over two hours, and that he was touching her for20most of this time.At times she was able to get21his finger out of her but then he put it back in.22She was afraid he would have forced intercourse23with her.She was afraid that he would kill her.24At times he pulled her pants down and she pulled25them back up.At times he would lift her blouse26and touch her breasts and she would pull it back27down.She tried to resist at one point but heOfficial Court Reporters31pulled her hair so she stopped fighting.2Mr. Avadluk eventually told her that he was3going to leave.He sat down and she sat with4him.They talked.They later walked down the5hallway and he got on his knees and asked her to6forgive him.After he left, she returned to the7studio and called her husband who immediately8called the police.9It was about 1 o'clock in the afternoon when10she first arrived at the highrise that day.It11was about a quarter to four when she returned to12the studio and called her husband.So this13ordeal lasted well over two hours, almost three14hours.15The victim was treated at the outpatient16services at the local hospital.She had bruising17to various parts of her body.And I have no18doubt that those two to three hours of her life19left an impact less visible than bruises but far20more significant because this had to have been a21very very traumatic event for her.22Mr. Avadluk was on process when this23happened.On April 11th, he had been released on24an undertaking for various charges and he has25been in custody since his arrest the day26following this event.I was told that a few27months later he was sentenced on unrelatedOfficial Court Reporters41matters and that the time that he spent on remand2from the point of arrest to the point of that3sentencing was taken into account at that4sentencing.So for this charge he has been in5pre-trial custody for 18 months.6Sentencing is not an exact science.Quite7the opposite.It requires weighing a lot of8different factors and it requires the exercise of9a considerable amount of discretion.It is a10complicated exercise, one that is often said to11be among the most difficult things that a Judge12has to do.And this case is no exception.13In any sentencing, the Court has to take14into account sentencing principles that are set15out in the Criminal Code.Those principles16provide the framework for every sentencing17decision that is ever made.I am not going to18read all of the sections in the Criminal Code but19I will read some excerpts because I think it is20important, again to put my decision in context.21One of the very important sections in the22Criminal Code on sentencing is Section 718 and it23reads,24The fundamental purpose of25sentencing is to contribute, along26with crime prevention initiatives,27to respect for the law and theOfficial Court Reporters51maintenance of a just, peaceful and2safe society by imposing just3sanctions that have one or more of4the following objectives:5(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;6(b) to deter the offender and other persons7from committing offences;8(c) to separate offenders from society where9necessary;10(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;11(e) to provide reparations for harm done to12victims or to the community; and13(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in14offenders, and acknowledgment of the15harm done to victims and to the community.16Another fundamental principle referred to in17Section 718.1 is that a sentence must be18proportionate to the gravity of the offence and19the degree of responsibility of the offender.20There are other sentencing principles and21some of the most relevant ones in this case, I22find, and those are principles that are listed in23Section 718.2, and I will not read them all, but24the most relevant ones, in my view, in this case25are that a sentence should be similar to26sentences imposed on similar offenders for27similar offences committed in similarOfficial Court Reporters61circumstances, and that all available sanctions2other than imprisonment that are reasonable in3the circumstances should be considered for all4offenders with particular attention to the5circumstances of aboriginal offenders.6I have heard a lot yesterday about7Mr. Avadluk's personal circumstances.8He is 36 years old, and his lawyer explained9the circumstances of his upbringing.I have no10doubt that those circumstances played an11important part in the many difficulties that he12has had with the law and those circumstances,13sadly, are similar to those that many aboriginal14people from the north have faced.15I was told that Mr. Avadluk's father was16largely absent from the home because he was a17heavy equipment operator and worked at various18job sites.The family was primarily in the care19of Mr. Avadluk's mother who, unfortunately,20abused alcohol significantly, which made life in21the household very chaotic.22Mr. Avadluk first came into contact with the23law when he was 12 years old for a relatively24minor offence for which he received a relatively25minor sentence.But he was then apprehended by26Social Services and, as a result of that27incident, placed in foster care far from his homeOfficial Court Reporters71community of Kugluktuk.He was placed in the2care of a man and that man sexually abused him.3When Mr. Avadluk's lawyer talked about this4event during his submissions, I was able to5observe, and this is very understandable, that6this is a subject that brings out a lot of7emotion for Mr. Avadluk.Those emotions were8also apparent when he himself talked about that9aspect of his life.10Mr. Avadluk disclosed this abuse and was11placed in the care of other people who,12fortunately, appeared to have taken good care of13him.14When he was 15 years old, he returned to15Kugluktuk.By then he had lost some of his16Inuinnaqtun language and that made his17reintegration into that community more difficult.18A short time after, his mother decided to move to19Cambridge Bay and Mr. Avadluk moved there with20her.He was not treated well by his mother's21then spouse.The year that he spent in Cambridge22Bay was chaotic and described as \"a year of23hell\".24He eventually called his father so that25arrangements could be made for him to return to26Kugluktuk.At that point he was 16 years old. I27was told that an older sister was then more orOfficial Court Reporters81less in charge of the family at that point but2she abused alcohol too and things remained3chaotic.4So life continued to be difficult for5Mr. Avadluk and by then he himself, based on what6I heard, had started consuming and abusing7alcohol.8When Mr. Avadluk turned 18, he moved to9Edmonton.One of his sisters was living there,10having moved there many years before because she11needed special care because of a serious hearing12impairment that she had.By all accounts she has13done very well and now lives in Yellowknife.14Counsel described her as Mr. Avadluk's \"anchor\".15He hopes to be able to live with her after his16release, at least for a short time until he can17find a place of his own and get his life going18again.19Mr. Avadluk ran into some trouble when he20was in Edmonton and that is apparent from his21criminal record which includes a number of22convictions from that community.And again, this23appears to have occurred in circumstances where24he was abusing alcohol and other substances.25Mr. Avadluk eventually returned to the NWT26and lived in Yellowknife.He was able to secure27employment.He has worked at various jobs and IOfficial Court Reporters91am told that he is a skilled carver.But, as had2been the case in his years in Edmonton and before3that in Kugluktuk, his abuse of alcohol and, as4his counsel put it, his lack of certain basic5life skills, continued to lead him into all kinds6of trouble with the law.7Indeed, since he was first before the Court8in 1985, Mr. Avadluk has accumulated a9significant criminal record which includes over1040 convictions.Many are for property crimes,11many others are for breaches of court orders, and12some are for crimes of violence.13In 1995 there are convictions for assault14with weapon and assault causing bodily harm, each15brought about jail terms of five months.In 199616there is a conviction for assault that led to a17jail term of four months, and another that led to18a jail term of six months.In 1999 there is19another conviction for assault, which appears to20have been of a spousal nature, for which he21received a sentence of eight months in jail.In22the year 2000, there is a conviction for assault23causing bodily harm and for that offence he24received a jail term of one year.And in 2007,25in his last series of convictions, one of the26charges was a charge for uttering death threats.27And as I have already said, for those series ofOfficial Court Reporters101offences, the time that Mr. Avadluk has spent on2remand was taken into account on sentencing.He3essentially got time served.4While in custody Mr. Avadluk has been able5to access certain programs that are offered at6the North Slave Correctional Centre including AA7and a program called the Healing Drum which is8available both to inmates in the facility and to9people who are at large in the community.10Having talked about the circumstances of11this offence and the sentencing principles that12apply and Mr. Avadluk's circumstances, I now turn13to the analysis of what is a fit sentence for14this crime.15The Crown argues that a fit sentence is16three years and that from this I should deduct17whatever credit I find should be given to18Mr. Avadluk for the time that he has spent on19remand.Defence counsel argues that in all the20circumstances, including the time spent on21remand, the time that Mr. Avadluk has already22spent in custody should be sufficient and that my23sentence today should simply be one of time24served.25I spoke at length earlier about the personal26circumstances of Mr. Avadluk as they have been27explained to me yesterday.Because one of theOfficial Court Reporters111sentencing principles that I have to apply,2because Mr. Avadluk is an aboriginal man, is the3principle referred to at Section 718.2(e) of the4Criminal Code and I have read it before, I will5simply refer to it again.6All available sanctions other than7imprisonment that are reasonable in8the circumstances should be9considered for all offenders, with10particular attention to the11circumstances of aboriginal12offenders.13That last segment, the \"particular attention14that must be paid to the circumstances of15aboriginal offenders\", has been interpreted by16many courts, including the Supreme Court of17Canada, on a number of occasions.It has been18interpreted to mean that when sentencing an19aboriginal person, Courts must approach the case20differently than how they might approach it if21they were sentencing a non-aboriginal offender22and; specifically, the Court should take into23account the systemic and background factors that24have played a part in bringing the person before25the Courts as well as the type of sentencing26processes or sanctions that might be most27appropriate to an aboriginal offender because ofOfficial Court Reporters121his or her particular heritage.2In this case the first aspect is the most3relevant.4The circumstances that Mr. Avadluk faced as5he was growing up no doubt contributed to his6coming into conflict with the law starting from a7very young age and, tragically, that first time8that he came into conflict with the law, to the9extent that it may have contributed to his10apprehension by Social Services and placement in11foster care, triggered other events that were12devastating to him.The abuse that he suffered13at the hands of his first foster parent obviously14had very negative impacts on him and we know that15that is often the case.Those who are abused16unfortunately sometimes repeat that pattern and17become abusers.It is also very common to see18that children who grow up in households where19alcohol is abused end up abusing alcohol20themselves.Dysfunction leads to dysfunction,21and the cycle continues.Mr. Avadluk's example22is an all too familiar example.23I recognize that Mr. Avadluk grew up in an24environment as a young aboriginal man where he25faced systemic difficulties, difficulties and26circumstances that are unfortunately shared by27many aboriginal people.I also recognize thatOfficial Court Reporters131these things contributed to his difficulties2later in life including his steady pattern of3conflict with the law.The question is what4impact can this have on the sentence that I5impose today.6There is no suggestion that any specific7type of sanction other than imprisonment would be8better suited for Mr. Avadluk because of his9aboriginal heritage.But even if there were, the10crime that he has committed is so serious that I11don't think there is a reasonable alternative to12imprisonment in a case like this one.13As for whether his circumstances should14cause the Court to reduce the jail term that15would otherwise be imposed, the Supreme Court of16Canada has said, and Mr. Avadluk's lawyer17acknowledged this, that the more serious the18offence the less likely it is that the sentence19imposed on an aboriginal offender will be20different than the sentence imposed for the same21crime for a non-aboriginal offender.22So Mr. Avadluk's circumstances and personal23history are important to note, they must be taken24into account and I have taken them into account.25They go some distance in explaining some of the26difficulties that he has in his life.At the27same time, those circumstances do not eliminateOfficial Court Reporters141the need for other sentencing principles to also2be taken into account in the face of such a3serious crime.4Sexual assault is always a serious crime but5it can include a wide range of behaviours.This6sexual assault that Mr. Avadluk committed in June7of 2007 was a very serious one.It did not8involve sexual intercourse but that does not mean9that it was not serious.There was prolonged10digital penetration which is extremely intrusive.11It occurred in circumstances that could only be12completely terrifying for the victim.She was13afraid this would progress to an even more14intrusive assault.She was afraid she might get15killed.Mr. Avadluk said things to her during16the assault suggesting that she was letting it17happen, letting him do it, implying even that she18might be finding it enjoyable.This was19degrading behaviour and behaviour that showed20complete and contemptuous disregard for this21woman's personal and sexual integrity and22dignity.23Apart from the apparent seriousness of the24assault, there are significant aggravating25factors stemming from the facts of this offence.26The first is that Mr. Avadluk's actions27appear to have been somewhat planned.This mayOfficial Court Reporters151have been a crime of opportunity in the sense2that he ran into her at the building and may not3have known in advance that she would be there,4but I can only conclude on the facts before me5that there was an element of short-term planning.6He asked her which floor she was going to.He7appears to have lied about where he was going.8And even if he was originally going to the fourth9floor, at some point he obviously made the10decision to follow her to the third floor, and I11infer that this was with the intention of taking12advantage of the situation.13It has been said on his behalf that he was14under the influence of drugs and alcohol when15this happened.And that may well be.But the16facts suggest that whatever he may have been17under the influence of, once he decided what he18was doing, he carried out those intentions with19some deliberateness and some persistence.The20fact that he made the comment that the victim21would probably call the police and the fact that22he later asked for her forgiveness also suggests23to me that whatever state he was in, he was aware24that he was doing something that was a serious25crime and something that was very wrong.26The second aggravating factor is the element27of confinement in this.As I have alreadyOfficial Court Reporters161referred to, this incident lasted several hours2and during those hours the victim was prevented3from leaving the unit and her movements were4restrained.Mr. Avadluk asserted total control5over her, getting her to the floor, then against6a chair, then back to the floor.He used force7to control her and confine her.She was at his8mercy for those few hours and I am sure that she9knew it.10The third aggravating factor is that the11force used was not simply incidental to the12sexual act.She tried screaming, she tried13struggling, she tried fighting back.He put his14hand over her mouth, he forced her to the floor,15she had to stop struggling at points because she16was having trouble breathing and at one point her17hair was pulled.She was bruised in various18parts of her body and in her struggle, she19scratched him to the point of drawing blood.So20I find from all of this that she struggled hard21so there was definitely more force used here than22what was inherent in an unwanted sexual touching.23There are also other aggravating factors24stemming from the circumstances of this case.25The fact that Mr. Avadluk was already facing26other charges when this occurred and that he was27bound by an undertaking to keep the peace and beOfficial Court Reporters171of good behaviour.And finally, of course,2Mr. Avadluk's criminal record is an aggravating3factor.There are no prior convictions for4sexual offences, and I take it that into account,5but a fair number of offences on the record are6for crimes of violence, as I have referred to7earlier, and some brought on jail terms of some8significance.I remind myself it is very9important not to overemphasize the criminal10record because Mr. Avadluk should not be punished11over and over again for the crimes that he has12already been sentenced for.But from the13perspective of determining what is required for14the protection of the public, the record cannot15be disregarded.16There are also mitigating factors in this17case.The most significant one from the point of18view of things Mr. Avadluk had control over is19that he pleaded guilty.That plea is anything20but an early guilty plea.It came at the 11th21hour on Friday, May 1st, the last working day22before the trial was scheduled to commence on23Monday, May 4th.The victim did have to testify24at a preliminary hearing and the matter was set25for trial once before in late October/early26November of 2008 and was adjourned at the last27minute because there was a change of defenceOfficial Court Reporters181counsel.2Despite the fact that the guilty plea came3so late in the proceedings, Crown counsel takes4the position that it should still, nonetheless,5have a significant mitigating effect.He said6that the Crown's case was strong in that there7was forensic evidence (DNA) that would have8assisted the Crown in proving its case, more9specifically, identity.But he also said that10there were frailties with some aspects of the11case and recognized that there is always12uncertainty in a trial and that reliance on13highly technical evidence comes with its14challenges and potential problems.Crown counsel15said that in the circumstances of this case,16there was great value in the certainty of outcome17that was brought about by his guilty plea.18Counsel are aware of all sorts of things19that the Court may not know.They obviously know20their case.So I accept what the prosecutor, who21is an experienced counsel, has said about the22significant value of the guilty plea in this case23and the significant mitigating impact it should24have even though it came late in the proceedings.25Apart from all of that, I have taken into26account something that is always true27irrespective of the strengths or frailties of theOfficial Court Reporters191Crown's case.2A guilty plea spares the victim from having3to testify and relive the events in question.I4do not doubt for a second, having seen many5witnesses testify in these types of cases, that6it was a great relief and much better for this7particular person not to have to testify about8the minute details of what happened to her during9those terrifying hours.10In addition, the guilty plea has saved11significant costs.This trial would have taken12at least a week, possibly more.I am told13witnesses would have had to have been brought14here from all corners of Canada - from Nova15Scotia, from British Columbia, from Manitoba,16some from elsewhere in to this jurisdiction, like17Inuvik, which is in the Northwest Territories but18is far away and a very costly place to travel to19and from.So there would have been significant20costs associated with this trial and all of this21was avoided.22Finally, and this is very important in my23view, a guilty plea, even one at the 11th hour,24represents an acknowledgment of responsibility on25the part of the offender.26Mr. Avadluk, when he spoke, alluded to this27a little bit.He talked about the importance ofOfficial Court Reporters201not hiding anymore, and of the truth, and of not2lying to himself anymore.Sometimes it takes3people a long time to be able to admit their4wrongdoings, even to themselves.So I think this5guilty plea is important for that reason because6of what it says about where Mr. Avadluk is at.7The next factor that mitigates the sentence8is the time that Mr. Avadluk has already spent in9pre-trial custody - a period of some 18 months.10How much credit he should receive for that is the11matter for the Court's discretion.There is no12fixed or rigid formula and that is what the13Supreme Court of Canada said in the case of14R. v. Wust which was referred to by defence15counsel.16A number of factors have an impact on how17this discretion should be exercised.The18rationale for giving credit for remand time on a19ratio higher than one-for-one is that remand time20is sometimes considered \"harder time\" because of21the detention conditions.22In some jurisdictions prisoners, who are in23pre-trial custody, are held in separate centres24where little or no programs are offered.Some of25those centres are overcrowded and the detention26conditions are much harsher than the detention27conditions of those who are serving prisoners.Official Court Reporters211And sometimes even when remand prisoners are2housed in the same facilities as serving3prisoners, they are held in a separate part of4the facility where access to certain things5available to serving prisoners is limited.6There was no evidence called about the7conditions at the North Slave Correctional Centre8where Mr. Avadluk was held on remand but both9counsel provided the Court with information10during their submissions, and neither counsel11contested what the other one has said.There is12general agreement that remand prisoners at this13particular facility are able to apply for14programs available to regular inmates except15those that involve leaving the facility.16I accept that serving prisoners may have17priority of access to some of the programs but18there definitely are some programs available to19prisoners on remand.The best evidence of that20is that Mr. Avadluk himself (this is to his21credit) has availed himself of some of the22programs that were available, including AA and23the Healing Drum program that I have already24talked about.25There is no evidence or suggestion of26overcrowding of that particular facility either.27Mr. Avadluk had to share a room with variousOfficial Court Reporters221people while on remand, one person at a time,2that is, but different people throughout the time3that he spent on remand, but that cannot be4characterized as \"overcrowding\" or harsh5detention conditions.6I also take into account the circumstances7that led to Mr. Avadluk being in remand.He has8a significant criminal record which includes a9large number of convictions for failure to abide10by Court orders.He was at large on process when11this offence was committed.Although he was12never released on this particular charge, he had13been released on other charges and had failed to14comply with his promises to the Court.That is15part of the reason why he remained detained all16of this time awaiting trial.17The last factor to consider is the fact that18remand time corresponds to a longer period of19time imposed as part of a sentence because people20do not earn remission for the time they spend on21remand.The reasoning, basically, is that if a22person were to be sentenced to 18 months in jail,23they could be expected to earn remission and not24serve the full 18 months.So if a person spends2518 months on remand, that amounts to the time26they would probably spend in jail if they27received a two year sentence taking into accountOfficial Court Reporters231the remission that they would earn.2It is important to know that Judges are not3permitted to take remission into account when4they impose a sentence in the sense that it is5not permitted to make a sentence longer knowing6that part of it will not be served.So I am sure7at times it may be difficult for some members of8the public to understand why Courts are not9allowed to take remission into account when they10impose a sentence but are expected to take it11into account when they decide how much credit to12give to time spent on remand.But that is what13Courts have done everywhere in the country on a14regular basis and the Supreme Court of Canada has15confirmed in clear terms it is an appropriate16factor to consider, and so I have considered it.17Based on all of this, I am not satisfied18that Mr. Avadluk should receive credit for the19time he has spent on remand on a ratio as high as20two-for-one.Many of the factors that are21ordinarily present to justify this, or an even22higher ratio, are simply not present here.But23recognizing that remission is not earned on24remand time, I do accept that he should be given25credit on something more than a one-for-one26ratio.27I want to address the question of delayOfficial Court Reporters241briefly since both counsel have referred to it.2In my view it is simply a neutral factor in this3case.4The preliminary hearing was adjourned at the5request of the Crown because of an unrelated6tragic event that took place in this community7and impacted on the police's resources and8impacted personally several officers involved in9this case.The delay that came from this was two10months because the preliminary hearing had been11scheduled for October 12th and was rescheduled to12proceed, and did proceed, on December 13th.13Another part of the delay arose as a result14of the breakdown that occurred in the15relationship between Mr. Avadluk and his former16counsel.This breakdown occurred very shortly17before the date that had been originally set for18this trial in late October 2008.After19Mr. Avadluk got new counsel, the trial was20rescheduled for this week so the delay arising21from a change in counsel was about five months.22But again, just like with the adjournment of the23preliminary hearing, these things do happen from24time to time, and I do not think that the delay,25any of the delay that arose in this case, is a26significant factor except of course from the27point of view that Mr. Avadluk has spent thisOfficial Court Reporters251time on remand and that will be taken into2account as I have already explained.3The Crown has brought a number of cases to4my attention, and I have reviewed them.When it5comes to sentencing, case law is of assistance in6setting out principles and sometimes ranges of7sentences, but there is always distinctions on8the facts and no two cases are ever the same, and9this is true for the cases that were filed in10this case.11All five were convictions that took place12after trial.There are distinctions on the facts13of each of these cases.Some involve full14intercourse, others not.But generally these15cases do support the proposition that a jail term16of some significance is required to address the17principles and purposes of sentencing in cases18like this one where there is serious interference19with the victim's sexual integrity, some force20used, and an element of confinement.21Sexual assault is a crime that is22unfortunately very prevalent in our jurisdiction.23It is a serious problem in our communities and24for that reason our Courts have stressed over and25over again the importance of denunciation and26deterrence as the paramount sentencing principles27in cases like this.Many of the cases that comeOfficial Court Reporters261before the Courts involve offenders who know2their victims.Cases like this one, where the3offender preys on someone unknown to them, are4more rare but either way there is a strong need5to denounce and deter this type of conduct.6While rehabilitation is also a factor, in7this case it cannot take precedence over other8factors nor can the fact that Mr. Avadluk is an9aboriginal offender reduce the sentence that10should be imposed for this serious crime.11Even giving Mr. Avadluk the maximum credit12possible for his guilty plea, a sentence in the13range of three years is, in my view, at the low14end of what can be imposed in the circumstances.15This is because of the persistence and prolonged16nature of the sexual assault, its level of17intrusiveness, the element of confinement, and18also taking into account that Mr. Avadluk has19been before the Courts consistently over the last20last two decades and on a number of times for21crimes of violence.But because I will give Mr.22Avadluk credit for the time that he has spent in23custody, the sentence that I impose today will be24of less than two years, and this raises a25question of whether I should also place him on26probation when he is released.27I had given this issue a lot of thought.AtOfficial Court Reporters271first blush, I would have been reluctant to do so2because of the many many breaches of convictions3on his criminal record.But I listened carefully4when Mr. Avadluk spoke yesterday.He said that5he has started to change his attitude and his6outlook on things, that he has taken some steps7to get help and deal with his issues, and he8wants to continue in that process.He wants his9life to change.He says that he does not want to10clash with people anymore, he is willing to11listen, and he wants to do the work he needs to12do to live a productive life.13I also consider that because of his14background, the struggles and some of the15systemic problems that he has faced, it is16appropriate to include a rehabilitative component17to his sentence despite his past record and18despite the fact that in the past these types of19court orders have not necessarily been complied20with very well.21So I am prepared to take a calculated risk22that this time will be the right one and that23Mr. Avadluk will take advantage of the24supervision and support he can get from a25probation officer once he is released from26custody.Because by then he will have been in27jail for longer than he had ever been before andOfficial Court Reporters281it would not be surprising if he needed some help2and some guidance to continue on the path that he3says he now wants to follow.So I am trusting4what Mr. Avadluk said yesterday to me, and he5said it directly to me, that his lawyer did not6need to be worried about him clashing with people7because he is tired of that, he is tired of the8negative attitude, he is tired of repeating the9same mistakes over and over again and he wants to10help himself.11Ultimately if Mr. Avadluk is successful in12rehabilitating himself, that will be the best way13to protect the public for good.He seems to have14realized that he needs to come to terms with what15has happened to him as a youth, and he can have16more positive outcomes in the rest of his life.17He seems to recognize that some of those issues18about his past are at the root of his being in19and out of court and in and out of jail over the20last 20 years, and he wants to change that.21It seems that some of the people that he has22been talking to about these things have helped23him to get some insight into his behaviour.24Hopefully he will persevere and hopefully he will25continue to have the support of some of those who26have tried to help him already.27He has a son, a daughter, and a grandchildOfficial Court Reporters291now.He is able to work at many jobs.He has2talents and he has skills.Substance abuse seems3to have been a major obstacle in his life and he4is the only one that can change that.No matter5what the Court does today, he is the one who6holds the keys to his future and who can decide7whether this will be one more conviction on his8record to be followed by more, or whether this is9going to truly be a turning point for him.And10it is this Court's sincere wish that he will11persevere and that in fact this will have been a12turning point.13Stand up please, Mr. Avadluk.14Mr. Avadluk, I have given you as much credit15as I can for your guilty plea.I listened16carefully to everything that was said but I feel17strongly that I must impose a further jail term18because of the seriousness of this particular19offence.So for the charge of sexual assault20there be a further term of imprisonment of 1221months.That term will be followed by a period22of probation for two years.I am not making this23probation order to punish you.I am making this24probation order because I hope that it will help25you do the things that you want to do when you26get out of jail.27The conditions of the probation order willOfficial Court Reporters301be very simple.You will have to keep the peace2and be of good behaviour, you know what that3means.You will have to appear before the Court4when you are required to do so.And you may5never be required to do so but if you are, you6have to appear.You will have to notify the7Court or the probation officer in advance of any8change of name or address, and promptly advise9your probation officer if you change employment10or occupation.You will take counselling as11directed by your probation officer.I am sure12that if you keep an open mind and if your13probation officer keeps an open mind, you will14not be directed to take counselling to harm you15or to cause you problems.You will be directed16to take counselling that is meant to assist you,17and I trust that you will be able to work with18someone who is trained to try to help people get19back on their feet after they have had lots of20problems.That's why that condition is there -21it is not to punish you, it is to help you. And22finally you will have absolutely no contact,23direct or indirect, with Jerrilyn Forsythe.I24don't need to explain that further to you, I am25sure that you understand why I am making that26condition as well as part of your order.27You can sit down.Official Court Reporters311There will also be ancillary orders as2requested by the Crown.3First, pursuant to Section 109 of the4Criminal Code, Mr. Avadluk will be prohibited5from possessing firearms or any of the other6items that are listed in Section 109 for a period7commencing today and expiring ten years from when8he is released from custody, and any such items9shall be surrendered forthwith.10There will also be a DNA order pursuant to11Section 487.051 of the Criminal Code.12And finally there will be an order pursuant13to Section 490.013 and that is an order that14Mr. Avadluk comply with the Sex Offender15Information Registration Act for a period of 2016years.17The written orders will be prepared setting18out all of this and they will be explained to19you, Mr. Avadluk.20Under the circumstances, I will not make an21order for a victim of crime surcharge.Given the22time that Mr. Avadluk has already spent in23custody and the fact that there will be further24custody, I am satisfied that there would be25hardship if such an order was made.26Do you require an order with respect to27exhibits, counsel?Official Court Reporters321MR. HIMMELMAN:That they be released, Your2Honour, into the custody of the RCMP pending the3appeal period.4THE COURT:And destroyed after the appeal5period?6MR. HIMMELMAN:Yes, with the exception of a7personal item belonging to the complainant, a8pair of shoes.9THE COURT:There will be an order for the10RCMP to retain the exhibits until the expiration11of the appeal period.After the expiration of12the appeal period, the exhibits are either to be13destroyed or returned to their lawful owners if14it is appropriate to do so.And I will leave15that with the authorities, Mr. Himmelman.16MR. HIMMELMAN:Thank you.17THE COURT:Anything further required by18the Crown?19MR. HIMMELMAN:Not from the Crown, Your20Honour, thank you.21THE COURT:Anything further from the22defence?23MR. BOYD:No, Your Honour, thank you.24THE COURT:I want to extend again my25thanks to both of you for your work and conduct26of this difficult case.Your submissions were27very helpful.Mr. Avadluk, good luck to you forOfficial Court Reporters331the future.23456789101112131415161718192021222324252627Official Court Reporters34123Certified to be a true andaccurate transcript pursuant to4Rules723 and 724 of the SupremeCourt Rules,5678____________________________9LoisHewitt, CSR(A), RPR, CRRCourt Reporter101112131415161718192021222324252627Official Court Reporters35"}

S.5.He had never been registered by the Ontario Securities Commission totrade in securities and repeatedly breached a cease trade order. He wasfound guilty of contempt of court when he failed to attend forexaminations by OSC staff and was sentenced to four months'incarceration (subsequently reduced when he complied with the order toattend the examinations). He had no criminal record. Counsel for theprosecution took the position that in light of the duration of thedefendant's behaviour, his refusal to co-operate with the Commissionuntil he was incarcerated for contempt, the vulnerability of hisvictims, the amount of money stolen from the victims by the defendantand his associates (over $1.5 million), a sentence of 90 days'incarceration would be appropriate.Held, the defendant should be sentenced to 30 days' incarceration followed by two years' probation.The dominant sentencing principles were denunciation and deterrence.The position taken by the prosecution was reasonable. However, theimposition of a substantial community service requirement would make itunnecessary to impose the full custodial sentence proposed by theprosecution. While on probation, the accused was ordered to perform 240hours of community service. [page121]SENTENCING for trading in securities while prohibited.\nCases referred toR. v.

Adler, for defendant.COLE J.: --Issue[1] What is the appropriate sentence to be imposed on anoffender who knowingly and repeatedly breaches an order from[page122] the Ontario Securities Commission to stop sellingsecurities to the public while prohibited from doing so?Facts[2] This matter proceeded by way of a guilty plea to a chargethatbetween and including July 1, 2009 and August 31, 2009, inthe City of Toronto, in the Toronto Region, Peter Robinsondid contravene Ontario securities law by trading insecurities at a time when he was prohibited from trading insecurities by order of the Ontario Securities Commissiondated February 20, 2009, and extended on March 6, July 10,and November 30, 2009 and did thereby commit an offencecontrary to s. 122(1)(c) of the Securities Act.[3] The following Agreed Statement of Facts (Exhibit 1) werefiled with the court consequent upon the defendant's plea ofguilty:BackgroundIn 2008, Staff of the Ontario Securities Commission (\"OSCStaff\") commenced an investigation pursuant to the provisionsof the Securities Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S. 5, as amended (the\"Act\") relating to Uranium308 Resources Inc. andaffiliated persons and companies (collectively the\"Uranium308 Investigation\"), which pertains to a suspectedboiler room operation in the Toronto area.Staff analyzed bank records held in the name of Uranium308Resources Inc. (\"Uranium308\") from the Canadian Imperial Bankof Commerce (\"CIBC\"), the Royal Bank of Canada (\"RBC\") and TDCanada Trust (\"TD\"), and identified $61,500 paid to PlatinumInternational Investments Inc. (\"Platinum\") from theUranium308 Bank Accounts.Platinum was incorporated on June 12, 2007 and Peter Robinsonis the sole Director. Platinum's registered address is 4325Steeles Avenue West, Suite 215, Toronto, Ontario.Robinson opened a bank account at RBC for Platinum (the\"Platinum RBC Account\") on June 13, 2007. Robinson hasalways been the sole signatory on the Platinum RBC Account.During the course of the Uranium308 Investigation, severalwitnesses indicated that Robinson was selling shares ofUranium308 from premises in the greater Toronto area.Robinson has never been registered to trade in securitieswith the Commission in any capacity.On February 20, 2009, the Commission issued a temporary ceasetrade order (hereinafter the \"TCTO\"), pursuant to subsections127(1) and 127(5) of the Act, ordering, among other things,that Robinson cease trading in all securities. The TCTO wasextended on March 6, July 10, and November 30, 2009 and on[date 2010] and remains in effect until the conclusion ofthe hearing on the merits before the Commission into theallegations that Uranium308 Resources Inc., Robinson andothers breached Ontario securities laws, including committingsecurities fraud. The hearing on the merits has not beenscheduled. [page123]The Uranium308 Investigation was delayed because ofRobinson's refusal to attend and answer questions in anexamination, in July and August 2009, as required by asummons served on him pursuant to section 13 of the Act. OnAugust 12, 2009, Staff initiated a contempt of courtapplication in the Superior Court with respect to Robinson'srefusals and, on October 27, 2009, Robinson was found to bein contempt of Court by Mr. Justice Newbould of the SuperiorCourt of Justice.Mr. Justice Newbould ordered Robinson to attend forexaminations on November 12, 13, and 16, 2009 by Staff withrespect to the Uranium308 Investigation and two other Staffinvestigations. Robinson did not attend on any of thosedates.As a result, on January 14, 2010, Robinson was sentenced, byMr. Justice Cameron of the Superior Court of Justice, to fourmonths incarceration for his contempt of Court. Robinson wasordered to attend for examinations on January 19, 20 and 21,2010. Robinson attended for these examinations, while incustody, and subsequently Robinson's sentence for contempt ofcourt was reduced by Mr. Justice Cameron.Robinson's Breach of the OrderOn August 6, 2009 at 4:39 p.m., RBC forwarded an e-mail toStaff from Peter Munday (\"Munday\") that was received by RBCon August 3, 2009 (the \"Munday RBC E-mail\").The Munday RBC E-mail stated: \"[Munday] was contacted byWilliam Morris / Ali Booth of Platinum InternationalInvestments Inc regarding various US company shares. Theyagreed to sell some shares on [Munday's] behalf and requestedthat [Munday] send a performance bond, value [pound]14023, asthis was a guarantee that [Munday] would assign over the saidshares . . . .\"The Munday RBC E-mail also indicated that on July 28, 2009,Munday sent the performance bond \"by urgent transfer\" to anRBC account in Toronto, Ontario. The beneficiary name on thataccount is Platinum International Investments Inc., IBANNumber: 003103824906722, Beneficiary Account Number: 1038249.On August 14, 2009, Staff was advised that RBC wasterminating its relationship with Robinson and Platinum. RBChad requested a meeting with Robinson and asked for anexplanation of the business activity in the Platinum RBCAccount, and he was unable to offer a satisfactoryexplanation for the activity in the Platinum RBC Account. RBCfurther advised that all of Robinson's RBC accounts were tobe closed.Munday advised Staff of the following and provided supportingdocumentation where indicated:a. Munday is a senior citizen and a resident of HighWycombe, Buckinghamshire, in the United Kingdom;b. Sometime in the middle of July 2009, Munday receivedan unsolicited call from William Morris (\"Morris\").Munday did not know Morris;c. Morris had an \"American-sounding\" accent, but Morristhought he was calling from the Bahamas. [page124]d. Morris told Munday that he was aware that Mundayheld investments in several shares that were \"de-registered\". Morris told Munday that he could\"re-register\" these shares and sell them onMunday's behalf. The shares in question were: GreenMachine Development Co., Santeon Corporation and ElDorado Explorations (collectively the \"ThreeCompanies\"). Munday had purchased shares in each ofthe Three Companies over the telephone a few yearsprior. His total investment in the Three Companieswas approximately [pound]38,141;e. Morris told Munday that he could sell Munday'sholdings in the Three Companies for [pound]280,000.Munday agreed;f. A few days later, Morris called Munday to say thathe required a 5% performance bond to ensure thatneither side dropped out of the deal. Munday askedMorris to deduct this amount from the proceeds fromthe sale of the shares of the Three Companies.Morris told Munday that this was not possible;g. On July 24, 2009, Munday received an e-mail with anagreement attached from Platinum International (the\"Platinum International Agreement\"). The e-mailwas sent by \"ali booth\". Among other things, thePlatinum International Agreement indicated that: \"Atotal of 280,461 GBP has been wire transferred tous by the purchaser under escrow conditions\". Thee-mail indicated that Munday was to sign and datethe agreement to acknowledge his acceptance. A copyof the Agreement along with a completed banktransfer was to be faxed to: 416-276-0934. Attachedto the Platinum International Agreement was aConfirmation Note indicating that 14,023 GBP weredue ASAP and payable to an RBC account in Toronto,Ontario. The beneficiary name on the account isPlatinum International Investments Inc., IBANNumber: 003103824906722, Beneficiary AccountNumber: 1038249;h. On July 28, 2009, Munday sent [pound]14,023 via wiretransfer to an RBC account in the name of PlatinumInternational;i. Morris told Munday that within 7 days of sending theperformance bond, Munday would receive his money.These terms are also set out in the PlatinumInternational Agreement. Munday has never receivedany of the promised funds;j. Munday tried to telephone Morris at 561-261-1886,the telephone number that appears on the PlatinumInternational Agreement. No one answered this lineand a message indicated that the voice mail was notyet set up;k. Munday then called 561-216-1886, a phone number thatMorris had previously given him. This was a genericvoice mail saying the person is unavailable. Mundayleft a message on the unidentified voicemail:l. Morris called Munday back about a week later. Morristold Munday that he could not release the moneybecause Munday had to pay a 12% non-resident taxequal to [pound]33,655. Munday refused. [page125]m. The next time Munday heard from Morris was on August24, 2009. Morris called Munday to advise that the12% non-resident tax was still owed. Morris toldMunday that he owed [pound]33,655 less theperformance bond of [pound]14,023 less another[pound]5,000 because Munday was over 65 years old.Of the balance, [pound]14,632, Morris was willing topay 49%, which meant that Munday only had to pay theremaining 51%, which equalled [pound]7,463. Mundayrefused. Morris told Munday that he would have to gobefore a \"district judge\" on September 15th to tryand get Munday's performance bond returned;n. Munday has never had his funds reimbursed and neverreceived the promised funds for the sale of theshares.On August 24, 2009, Staff called 561-261-1886, the telephonenumber that appeared on the Platinum International Agreement.An automated voice indicated that the voice mail for thisaccount had not yet been set up. A reverse search of thistelephone number indicates that it relates to a cell phone inBelle Glade, Florida. On August 24, 2009, Staff called561-216-1886, the telephone number that Morris had providedto Munday. The call went to an unidentified voice mail. Areverse search of this telephone number indicates that itrelates to a cell phone in Belle Glade, Florida.On August 28, 2009, Staff obtained and executed a searchwarrant for the RBC bank records (the \"RBC Bank Records\")relating to the Platinum RBC Account.The RBC Bank Records revealed the following:-- The Platinum International Bank Account was opened onJune 13, 2007 with Robinson as the only signatory; -- Between July 9, 2009 and August 25, 2009 four victimssent funds to the account, as follows:[QL:GRAPHIC NAME=\"105OR3d120-1.jpg\"/][page126]All of the funds from the victims were removed from theaccount shortly after they were deposited into the account,as follows:[QL:GRAPHIC NAME=\"105OR3d120-2.jpg\"/]-- Photographs taken at RBC automated teller machines showRobinson as the individual at the ATM who is withdrawingmoney from the Platinum RBC Account.Sheila Rosher (\"Rosher\") paid $69,218.45 to PlatinumInternational and she advised Staff of the following:-- Rosher is 77 years old and lives in Surrey, England; -- Rosher received an unsolicited call from William Morris (\"Morris\") of Platinum International who said thathe could help her sell some of her \"Americaninvestments\". Rosher had never spoken to Morris before; -- Morris told Rosher that he could sell her shares for[pound]504,250, but she would have to pay a performancebond of [pound]12,587. When another one of her securitieswas added to the agreement with Platinum International,she had to pay an additional performance bond of[pound]11,147. All of these amounts were paid by Rosherto the Platinum International Bank Account; -- Over and above the performance bonds, Morris told Roshershe would also have to pay a non-resident tax equal to[pound]14,870. This amount was also paid to the PlatinumInternational Bank Account; and -- Toward the end of August 2009, Morris called Rosher againand said she would have to pay an additional[pound]17,000 to complete her contract. Rosher refused.She has not heard from Morris since this time.Rosher provided a copy of her contract with Platinum, whichis very similar to the Platinum International Agreementprovided to Staff by Munday.Rosher only corresponded with Morris over the telephone andvia mail. The letters she received from Platinum had anaddress of 6021 Yonge Street, North York, Ontario. The phonenumber for Platinum was shown to be 416-512-8746. Thisaddress and phone number are actually the address and phonenumber for a UPS Store.Alethea Balderstone is 67 years old and resides inNorthamptonshire, United Kingdom she is the sister ofGeoffrey Branfield and she sent the funds to PlatinumInternational Bank Account on behalf of her brother.[page127] Geoffrey Branfield is also 67 and resides inNorthampton, U.K. Branfield was contacted in early August,2009 by Andrew Murray from Platinum. Murray told Branfieldthat he could sell certain shares owned by Branfield but thatBranfield would have to first pay a performance bond equal to10% of the amount of money that Murray claimed he wouldreceive from the sale of the shares. The performance bond wasreduced, according to Murray, because Branfield received asenior's discount. Balderstone wired the funds to thePlatinum International Bank Account. Branfield wassubsequently contacted by Murray and told that he also had topay a certain Canadian tax before the sale of the sharescould close. Murray did not send further funds to Platinum.Branfield never received a refund of the monies he sent toPlatinum and he also never received the promised funds forthe promised sale of his shares.Anthony Ford is another elderly resident of the UnitedKingdom. He also transferred funds to Platinum InternationalBank Account in advance of Platinum selling certain sharesowned by Ford.An internet search revealed that Platinum was operating from3545 Lakeshore Boulevard West, Unit 301. Staff executed asearch warrant on these premises on December 17, 2009.Robinson attended at the premises while the search was beingexecuted and admitted to Staff that Platinum was his privatecompany. The premises at 3545 Lakeshore Boulevard West, Unit301 were leased by a provincially incorporated numberedcompany of which Robinson was the sole director.Robinson admits that his activities in relation to Platinumconstituted acts in furtherance of a trade and, as such, hewas breaching the terms of the cease trade order made by theCommission.Robinson also states that David O'Brien (\"O'Brien\") was oneof the persons communicating with the victims in the UnitedKingdom and O'Brien used an alias when he did so. Robinsonwas aware of O'Brien's actions.[4] It was also agreed between counsel that a few weeks priorto this guilty plea, the defendant (and others) settled threeother allegations of violations of Ontario securities law,relating to his involvement in the activities of Uranium308Resources Inc., York Rio Resources Inc. and Global Energy GroupLtd. Settlement agreements entered into between OSC staff andthe defendant were filed with the court, as were the formalorders approving the settlements by the Commission. (A draftsettlement agreement and Commission order respecting PlatinumInternational Investments Inc. have been prepared, and I wastold the order will be executed by a Securities Actcommissioner once the proceedings before me have beencompleted.)[5] Both counsel agreed that these other allegations largelyor completely pre-dated the offence dates in question here;consequently, they both agreed that the offender should receivesome \"acknowledgement of credit\" for these settlements. Notsurprisingly, counsel differed on how much credit the offendershould receive. [page128][6] In addition to various clauses directing (a) that thecorporate entities and the defendant desist from trading insecurities, (b) that the corporate entities and the defendantbe prohibited from acting as a registrant to sell securities,as an investment fund manager or as a promoter, and (c) thatthe corporate entities and the defendant be reprimanded, thecompanies and the defendant are directed (d) to \"disgorge\"moneys obtained by their breaches of Ontario securities law,(e) to pay administrative penalties and (f) to makecontributions for the costs of investigations of these matters.However, the prosecution accepts that the defendant iscurrently impecunious and supports himself through occasionalmanual labour, so the various orders requiring the defendant tomake these payments are likely illusory -- meaning that neitherthe duped elderly investors nor the Ontario public has any realchance of being reimbursed by the defendant for his fraudulentactivities. For this reason, both parties agree that though Icould impose a fine (either in lieu of or in addition to anyother penalty I may impose), it is highly unlikely that theoffender will ever be in a position to pay.The Statutory Framework Respecting Penalty[7] Section 122(1)(c) of the Securities Act (R.S.O. 1990, c.S.5 as amended) provides that any person who \"contravenesOntario securities law is guilty of an offence and onconviction is liable to a fine of not more than $5 million orto imprisonment for a term of not more than five years less aday\".[8] The Securities Act also falls under the general aegis ofthe Provincial Offences Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33 (\"POA\"), whichadditionally authorizes me to impose a period of probation of upto two years. One of the optional conditions of probation that Iam authorized to impose is a period of community service of upto 240 hours to be performed over a period of up to two years.[See Note 1 below] I mention this at this stage because one ofdefence counsel's submissions was that I should make an orderfor community service, either in lieu of or to reduce a periodof imprisonment that I [page129] may decide to impose. Thus, thestatutory preconditions established by s. 72(3)(b) of the POAhave been met, in that (a) the defendant consents to such anorder being made and (b) that the offence of which he has beenconvicted is punishable by imprisonment.The Positions of the Parties[9] Counsel for the prosecution took the position that inlight of the duration of the offender's behaviour, his refusalto co-operate with the Commission until he was incarcerated forcontempt, the vulnerability of the victims, the amount of moneystolen from the victims by this offender and his confederates(over CDN$1.5 million), a sentence of 90 days' custody wouldappropriately recognize his guilty plea and his lack ofprevious involvement with OSC disciplinary proceedings (otherthan those outlined in para. 4, supra).[10] Commission counsel indicated that he had no oppositionto me making an order that this sentence be served on anintermittent basis, upon the court receiving appropriateevidence that the offender requires such a sentence to maintainemployment or to continue with mental health counselling ormedical treatment. Defence counsel fairly conceded that hecould make no showing that his client should receive anintermittent sentence, should I come to the conclusion that Mr.Robinson should be incarcerated.[11] Beyond arguing that a probation order containing anorder that the offender perform community service could not bean adequate substitute for a prison sentence, Commissioncounsel took no position regarding the imposition of an orderof probation for any other purpose, no doubt because thevarious settlement orders already contain adequate andenforceable prohibition and desistance orders, and thattherefore there is no need to make optional probationconditions under s. 72(2) and (3) of the POA.[12] Defence counsel first argued against the imposition ofany prison sentence, having regard to what he submitted wasthis offender's level of involvement in the various unlawfulactivities. He further submitted that I should keep in mindthat while the Agreed Statement of Facts detailed involvementin numerous breaches of various provisions of Ontario'ssecurities legislation over a period of many months, theprosecution was bound by the fact that the information beforethe court restricted the allegations against this defendant toa period of two months (July 1-August 31, 2009). Mr. Adlerargued in the alternative that the period of custody proposedby Commission counsel was too high. [page130]The Background and Present Circumstances of the Offender[13] Neither counsel requested (and defence counsel -- nodoubt for strategic reasons -- resisted) an order that a pre-sentence report be prepared. Thus, while I of course acceptthat Mr. Adler has accurately reflected what his client hasinstructed him about his background and has produced someconsiderable documentation in support of his client's personalhistory and present circumstances, I have little independentverification of many of the offender's \"facts in mitigation\".Given that the offence itself is based on a pattern of ongoingfraudulent deception and outright lies, I must say that I havefound it necessary to approach the mitigating factors presentedby the offender with some caution, except to the extent thatany such factors are confirmed by independent evidence.[14] It is agreed by counsel that the offender is now 54years old and that he has no previous criminal record. Hismother and one of his sisters have been present in court forseveral of his appearances. He now lives with his mother andsupports himself through occasional manual labour.[15] Various letters were filed with the court by his motherand sisters (one older and one younger). They describe that,from a relatively early age, the offender did not perform wellat school (either academically or socially), to the point whereit was recommended that he be assessed \"by a psychiatrist\".That assessment concluded that \"in no way was Peter retarded,but in fact had an extremely high IQ and was probably smarterthan . . . the Dr.\". However, as one sister aptly put it in herletter, \"[this finding] did not answer the question as to whyPeter was different and having so much trouble in school\". Ithink it would be fair to say that in light of a psychiatricdiagnosis made in March 2010 that the offender manifests\"Autistic Spectrum Disorder, associated with impairment insocial interactions and communication\", these lettersreinterpret his past to suggest that family members nowconsider that he manifested autistic symptoms from an earlyage. Nevertheless, according to [his] mother's information,despite his various personal difficulties the offender hasobtained (a) a certificate or a degree from Cambrian College(Sudbury) in mining engineering technology, (b) a politicalscience degree from Laurentian University (Sudbury) and (c) anMBA from Webster University (Geneva, Switzerland).[16] This pattern of maladjustive social behaviours noted byhis family appears to have continued into his adult life. Thesame sister reported that over approximately a 25-year period:\"After leaving home, Peter's life became very sketchy. Could[page131] never seem to get an accurate picture of what hislife consisted of outside of work. As far as that goes, was noteven sure what his work was. Asked many times, but the answerswere always very vague . . . . He would be in Europe one day. . . and the next would be in the Philippines. Sounded like hewas earning a living and having a good life, but when we wouldsee him, he would look like he had been living in a cave.Things just didn't add up. He would be flying around the world,rides in the Concorde, but never had a dime in his pocket.\"[17] Defence counsel reports that his client instructs himthat by June 2009, his financial circumstances had deterioratedsuch that he was forced to live in his business premises as hecould not afford to maintain an apartment. As I have no directindependent verification of this assertion, [See Note 2 below] Iwould be reluctant to assume this to be a mitigating factorsolely on the basis of the offender's representation of hisliving conditions. However, qua R. v. Poorman, 1991 CanLII 2759 (SK CA), [1991] S.J. No.274, 6 C.R. (4th) 364 (C.A.), I am satisfied that there is anair of reality to his assertion that he was not coping or doingwell, derived from the family's observations some months afterJune 2009. At some point in early 2010, \"we [the family] learnedabout Peter's life. It was a shock hearing he really had nofixed home. Lived in 6 different locations around Toronto.Carrying around two and three year old newspapers in greengarbage bags with his clothes. We had no idea. Don't know how 17has survived.\"[18] The family's observations about the offender'sapparently deteriorating situation over a number of months wascompounded by two events that occurred within a few weeks ofone another in the fall of 2009. (There is independentverification of both of these incidents, so I am content torely on what was filed.) First, hospital and medical recordsfiled at the sentencing hearing establish that the offenderfractured his right clavicle as a result of having been struckby a car on October 8, 2009.[19] The second, and perhaps more profound, medical event wasthat the offender self-referred to the Emergency Department atthe Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (\"CAMH\") on November23, 2009, complaining \"that sometimes he was having difficultysleeping, his appetite has decreased and he had [page132] lostweight. He found no pleasure in anything. His energy haddecreased. His concentration had decreased. He was unsure if hewas experiencing psychomotor retardation. He described himselfas someone who worries and said that he experienced panicattacks that were precipitated by worrisome thoughts. He saidthat he had periods where he felt of top of the world where hespent a lot of money, mainly when he was feeling successful . ..\". He was immediately prescribed antidepressants and anxietymedication, and was admitted to hospital. He told staff that hedid not wish his family to be notified that he had beenadmitted to hospital.[20] I have carefully read and re-read the Discharge Summaryprepared by a staff psychiatrist at CAMH on December 4, 2009.The contents of what the offender reported to medical staff Ifind quite troubling. First, while on admission the offender\"described having some legal issues but would notelaborate\", later in his hospital stay the offender reported tostaff that he had been in contact with the SecuritiesCommission to advise them of his whereabouts, but that he hadtold those officials \"that he was in hospital and seriouslyill. He would not be able to attend any meetings for one or twomonths\". Second, at no time during his hospital stay did themedical staff conclude that he showed any evidence ofdelusional thinking -- \"his thought process was coherent andlogical . . . he had full insight and judgment\". In myjudgment, though there may well have been good reasons for thedefendant to be admitted to hospital, he clearly and obviouslytried to take advantage of his hospitalization to delayproceedings before the Commission, which demonstrates to methat the offender continued to attempt to be manipulative-- consistent with the fraudulent activities and lifestyle hehad embarked on over several years.[21] After listening to the offender's presenting symptoms,observing the offender's response to medication and hisbehaviour during his stay at CAMH, and after conducting severalinterviews with Mr. Robinson, the psychiatrist ultimatelyadvised him on December 3 or 4, 2009 \"that the diagnosis wouldnot be of a Serious Depression but probably of an AdjustmentDisorder with Depressed and Anxious Mood\", and that he hadsufficiently recovered that he could be discharged.[22] The reason I have included the portions of the DischargeSummary in the preceding paragraph is because of what appearsto have happened next in relation to his mental health status.On March 2, 2010, apparently at the behest of his mother andsister, Mr. Robinson was assessed by a psychiatrist in privatepractice in order to confirm or disprove the diagnosis of[page133] Asperger's disorder. The psychiatrist concludedthat while he did not \"meet the strict criteria of Asperger'sDisorder, he meets the criteria for Autistic Spectrum Disorders(ASD)\". What I find quite astonishing about this diagnosisis that it makes absolutely no reference to the offender'srecent stay at CAMH and only briefly to \"the legal difficultieshe has found himself to be involved with\". Even more concerningis that the psychiatrist concedes that \"Mr. Robinson has neverhad a recent psychological assessment done\", and that herdiagnosis appears to be entirely based on what the offender andfamily members told her: \"from my interaction with him and hisexplanation on how he learns and understands the world aroundhim, I think that he has [ASD]\".[23] In light of this lack of specific references to theoffender's adult background, illegal activities and recentmental health history, Commission counsel refused to accept themain conclusion of the psychiatrist's report, which reads: \"heis too trusting and may easily believe false and erroneousinformation or promise (sic). He continues to have difficultieswith social interactions, tends to be naïve and believes peoplewhen he needs to be cautious, does not have the ability to readpeople's nonverbal reactions and facial and body language, getsvery easily frustrated with changes in the environment and whenstressed looks at magical solutions\" (highlighted in original).Commission counsel urged me instead to accept the facts foundby Cameron J. in sentencing Mr. Robinson for contempt forfailing to attend and answer questions pursuant to summonsesissued by the Securities Commission (Ontario SecuritiesCommission v. Robinson (2010), 2010 ONSC 225 (CanLII), 100 O.R. (3d) 451, [2010] O.J.No. 144 (S.C.J.)). He particularly suggested that I examineparas. 6-7, 12-14, where Cameron J. found that the respondentwas personally continuing to manipulate the process throughattempting to invoke various delay mechanisms. This I find tobe entirely consistent with his behaviour while at CAMH,described in para. 20, supra.[24] The reason this is important is that defence counselattempted to mitigate his client's fraudulent activities bysuggesting that his ASD condition led him to be under theinfluence of one of his co-conspirators (regardless of legallabelling, that is exactly what they were), which, if accepted,could lessen his overall \"moral blameworthiness\". While I donot mean to sound critical of defence counsel -- he has had adifficult brief -- I entirely agree with Commission counselthat the manipulative behaviours the defendant displayed atCAMH, combined with the entirely incomplete psychiatric report,demonstrate conclusively that the defence has not been able toshow that the [page134] offender was under the domineeringinfluence of a co-conspirator; thus, the defence has not beenable to discharge \"the burden of proving . . . a relevant fact. . . on a balance of probabilities\" within the meaning of s.724(3)(b) and (d) of the Code.[25] Following oral argument, the offender wrote me (onnotice to Commission counsel) what his counsel describes as a\"Letter of Remorse\", in which the offender purports toapologize for \"the hurt I have cause (sic) to many people, notthe least of which (sic) is my mother, my sisters and theirrespective families\". He says that he is \"truly sorry for myactions\" and that \"I do pledge to (sic) in the future thinkbefore I undertake an action that cannot easily be reversed\".Even accepting that this letter can be characterized assomething more than yet another attempt to manipulate theprocess, the content is hardly evidence that the offender was amere follower, as Mr. Adler would like to characterize him.[26] In sum, despite taking what I hope is a relativelygenerous view of the offender's historical personaldifficulties, I am entirely unable to conclude that he is asgullible as his counsel would like me to infer. The offender'svarious and ongoing attempts to delay his day of reckoning withthe Securities Commission in whatever way he could persuade methat his \"moral blameworthiness\" was significantly elevated.While I am sorry for him (and his family) that his life seemsto have come crashing down on him during the last 18 months,there can be no doubt that he was an active and engagedparticipant in defrauding numerous investors in flagrant andknowing breach of Ontario's security legislation. Frankly,about the only things going for him are (a) he was by no meansthe leader of this cadre of scam artists, (b) he has settledwith the Commission, (c) he has no previous criminal record orrecord of settlements with regulatory agencies and (d) he hasentered a plea of guilty (however belatedly).[27] Counsel cited various Ontario and other case law insupport of their positions (attached as an Appendix to thisjudgment is a list of the cases). I have carefully reviewedthese cases and have come to the conclusion that little purposewould be served in reviewing them in detail; instead, I havedecided that it will suffice to highlight some of the coreprinciples disclosed by the case law and to apply theseprinciples to the facts of this case.[28] Both counsel agreed that the statutory structure and thecase law interpreting it (in Ontario and elsewhere) indicatesthat while rehabilitation is always to be considered, thedominant principles of sentencing in cases of this nature aredeterrence and denunciation. [page135][29] Both counsel also agreed that specific and generaldeterrence are both to be considered. Mr. Adler made the pointthat, having been sentenced by Cameron J., described supra, toa term of four months for contempt, the 26 days the offenderactually served in custody until he purged his contempt byappearing before the Securities Commission to answer questions,specific deterrence has already been addressed, and that mysentence should not therefore be based on considerations ofspecific deterrence. He further proposed that the offender'soverall settlement with the Commission, his acceptance of hismental health difficulties, his reconciliation with his family,his plea of guilty to this charge and his \"Letter of Remorse\"all indicate that the offender has recognized that hisfraudulent lifestyle must come to an end, and that a jailsentence on that basis is not necessary to deter him fromreoffending.[30] I did not understand Commission counsel to disagree withthis aspect of the matter; he rather focused on generaldeterrence and denunciation as indicating that incarcerationwas called for. Thus, I am prepared to accede to Mr. Adler'sargument about specific deterrence.[31] Despite the ever-growing body of criminological research[See Note 3 below] and judicial commentary questioning thevalidity of the assumption that harsh sentences act to deterothers who might otherwise be minded to engage in illegalactivities, defence counsel did not seek to challenge theparadigm that fraud is one of [at para. 32] \"few crimes wherethe aspect of deterrence is more significant. It is not a crimeof impulse and is of a type that is normally committed by aperson who is knowledgeable and should be aware of theconsequences. That awareness comes from the sentences given toothers\" (R. v. Gray, 1995 CanLII 18 (ON CA), [1995] O.J. No. 92, 1995, CanLII 18 (C.A.),per Carthy J.A.; emphasis added). While I have some considerabledoubt that the sentence handed out in that and other fraudsentencing cases would be based on the same unfoundedassumptions as to the validity of general deterrence as asentencing theory were it to be decided today (see, for example,the concerns very recently expressed by the Ontario Court ofAppeal in the recent child pornography case of R. v. F. (D.G.)(2010), 2010 ONCA 27 (CanLII), 98 O.R. (3d) 241, [2010] O.J. No. 127 (C.A.), at paras.21-22), in the absence of any such challenge the principle ofstare decisis requires that I act on the basis that [page136]general deterrence theory continues to have some contemporaryvalidity. How much role it should play is, frankly, difficultfor me to ascertain. Insofar as I am aware there is no publicinterest in this case; apart from the immediate participants, nomembers of the public or the media seem to have paid anyattention to these court proceedings. Assuming this to be thecase, I have no idea how other \"potentially like-mindedfraudsters\" would become aware of any sentence I impose,regardless of how harsh or lenient it might be.[32] I have much less difficulty imposing a sentence ofincarceration primarily based on the principle of denunciationand its \"legitimate sibling . . . retribution\". As explained byLamer C.J.C. in the important sentencing case of R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, [1996] S.C.J. No. 28, 46 C.R.(4th) 269 [at para. 81]:Retribution requires that a judicial sentence properlyreflect the moral blameworthiness of that particularoffender. The objective of denunciation mandates that asentence should also communicate society's condemnation ofthat particular offender's conduct. In short, a sentence witha denunciatory element represents a symbolic, collectivestatement that the offender's conduct should be punished forencroaching on our society's basic code of values asenshrined within our substantive criminal law. As LordJustice Lawton stated in R. v. Sargeant (1974), 60 Cr. App.Rep. 74, at p. 77: \"society, through the courts, must showits abhorrence of particular types of crime, and the only wayin which the courts can show this is by the sentences theypass.\" The relevance of both retribution and denunciation asgoals of sentencing underscores that our criminal justicesystem is not simply a vast system of negative penaltiesdesigned to prevent objectively harmful conduct by increasingthe cost of the offender must bear in committing anenumerated offence. Our criminal law is also a system ofvalues. A sentence which expresses denunciation is simply themeans by which these values are communicated. In short, inaddition to attaching negative consequences to undesirablebehaviour, judicial sentences should also be imposed in amanner which positively instils the basic set of communalvalues shared by all Canadians as expressed in the CriminalCode.(Emphasis added)[33] After giving due consideration to the concepts ofgeneral deterrence, denunciation and retribution as discussedin the case law cited by counsel, I have easily arrived at theconclusion that the position taken by Commission counseladvocating a 90-day sentence of incarceration is extremelyreasonable on the facts of this case. In fact, though heprobably does not see it now, Mr. Robinson should be aware thatsome judges might well consider that the Commission's views ofsentence are too restrained, representing a positiondisproportionately favourable to the offender, having regard tohis overall culpability, as expressed in the notion of his\"moral blameworthiness\". I do not agree that this is thecase, but it is certainly an argument that might be madeagainst the backdrop of other case law. [page137][34] In the paragraph immediately following on from what Ihave just cited in M. (C.A.), Chief Justice Lamer usefullyreminded sentencing judges that [at para. 82]:As a closing note to this discussion, it is important tostress that neither retribution nor denunciation aloneprovides an exhaustive justification for the imposition ofcriminal sanctions. Rather, in our system of justice,normative and utilitarian considerations operate inconjunction with one another to provide a coherentjustification for criminal punishment. As Gonthier J.emphasized in Goltz, supra, at p. 502, the goals of the penalsanction are both \"broad and varied.\" Accordingly, themeaning of retribution must be considered in conjunction withthe other legitimate objectives of sentencing, which include (but are not limited to) deterrence, denunciation,rehabilitation and the protection of society. Indeed, it isdifficult to perfectly separate these inter-relatedprinciples. And as La Forest J. emphasized in Lyons, therelative weight and importance of these multiple factors willfrequently vary depending on the nature of the crime and thecircumstances of the offender. In the final analysis, theoverarching duty of a sentencing judge is to draw upon allthe legitimate principles of sentencing to determine a \"justand appropriate\" sentence which reflects the gravity of theoffence committed and the moral blameworthiness of theoffender.[35] M. (C.A.) was decided before the 1996 revisions toCanada's adult sentencing legislation for Criminal Codeoffences came into effect. The \"Purpose and Principles ofSentencing\" contained in s. 718 of the Code now provide that,in addition to specific and general deterrence, denunciationand rehabilitation, a court should consider \"reparations forharm done to victims or to the community\" and \"promot[ion] of asense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of theharm done to victims and to the community\". Thus, as I listenedto counsel's arguments, I was initially attracted to the ideaof imposing a period of community service as an optionalcondition of probation, to commence after the 90-day period ofcustody proposed by Commission counsel had been served.However, in its first two decisions interpreting the newsentencing provisions of the Code, in language very reminiscentof the previously italicized comment of Lamer C.J.C. in M.(C.A.) to the effect that \"our criminal justice system isnot simply a vast system of negative penalties designed toprevent objectively harmful conduct by increasing the cost ofthe offender must bear in committing an enumerated offence\",the Supreme Court of Canada stressed that, wherever feasibleand reasonable, judges should try to promote \"restorative\"alternatives to incarceration. Though the factual andlegislative contexts of R. v. Gladue [1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688,[1999] S.C.J. No. 19] and R. v. Proulx [2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61,[2000] S.C.J. No. 6] are obviously different from the caseat bar, in the absence of some general \"purpose and principlesof sentencing\" for provincial offences or under Ontario'sSecurities Act specifically, I am of [page138] the view that itwould be consistent with the views expressed in those SupremeCourt of Canada decisions for me to consider reducing theotherwise merited period of incarceration proposed byCommission counsel and to partially replace it by an order thatthe offender perform a significant period of community service.[36] Put another way, while I have come to the broadconclusion that the position taken by the Commission is mostlycorrect, I find Mr. Adler's most capable submissions on behalfof his client are helpful to the extent that I do not see thatit is necessary to incarcerate the offender for the full periodproposed by Mr. Boswell.[37] Arriving at a principled rationale for determining theextent of the reduction of the custodial term has caused mesome considerable concern. Though the Ontario Court of Appealhas on numerous occasions substituted one penalty or anotherfor incarceration -- say, for example, where the court hasreplaced a custodial sentence with a conditional sentence (orthe converse) -- I am not aware of any case where the court hasoffered substantial guidance to trial judges as to theappropriate methodology for so doing where community service isimposed to replace custody.[38] The English Court of Appeal has generally respondedfavourably to this concept of using community service as analternative to incarceration. For example, in R. v. Clarke,[1982] 1 W.L.R. 1090, [1982] 3 All E.R. 232 (C.A.), a caseof credit card fraud, Lord Lane C.J. held that when a court hasdecided that [at p. 1095 W.L.R.]. . . a custodial sentence is really necessary . . . then thecourt should ask itself secondly this: can we make acommunity service order as an equivalent to imprisonment, orcan we suspend the whole sentence?The court went further to consider a non-exhaustive list of thetypes of cases in which the combination of a short custodialsentence and a community service order (or other communitydisposition) might be appropriate. Though the list is lengthy,I cite it in its entirety because I have found it to be ofconsiderable assistance in formulating my general approach tothe issue of \"equivalents\" [at pp. 1095-1096 W.L.R.]:In general the type of case that we have in mind is where thegravity of the offence is such that at least six months'imprisonment is merited, but when there are mitigatingcircumstances which point towards a measure of leniency notsufficient to warrant total suspension. Examples are alwaysdangerous, but we venture very tentatively to suggest a few:first of all, some serious \"one off\" acts of violence whichare usually met with immediate terms of imprisonment; somecases of burglary which at present warrant [page139] 18months' or two years' imprisonment, where the offender issuitably qualified in terms of his record; some cases offraud on public departments or some credit card frauds, wherea short immediate sentence would be insufficient; some casesof handling involving medium-range sums of money; some theftsinvolving breach of trust; some cases of stealing fromemployers. All these are examples of cases where it may bepossible to suspend part of the sentence without harm to thepublic and with benefit to the prisoner.We would like to echo the words of the Advisory Council onthe Penal System in their Sentences of Imprisonment; A reviewof Maximum Penalties (1978). para. 282:\". . . we view the partially suspended sentence as alegitimate means of exploiting one of the few reliablepieces of criminological knowledge -- that many offenderssent to prison for the first time do not subsequently re-offend. We see it not as a means of administering a'short, sharp shock,' nor as a substitute for a whollysuspended sentence, but as especially applicable to seriousfirst offenders or first-time prisoners who are bound tohave to serve some time in prison, but who may well beeffectively deterred by eventually serving only a smallpart of even the minimum sentence appropriate to theoffence. This, in our view, must be its principal role.(Emphasis added)[39] The reasoning in Clarke and related cases led almostinevitably to consideration of the relationship between monthsof imprisonment and hours of community service. In R. v.Lawrence (1982), 4 Cr. App. R. (S) 69 (C.A.), the accused hadbeen sentenced following his plea of guilty to concurrent termsof 18 months for his part in stealing a car, driving to anelectrical shop, breaking into that commercial establishmentand stealing several televisions and VCRs. The accused werechased by the police for several miles before they werearrested. This accused had a number of previous adult and youthconvictions for offences involving dishonesty. Speaking for theCourt of Appeal, Lord Lane C.J. considered that, althoughwithin the appropriate range, \"it is possible that the lengthof the custodial sentence was a little high. It may be thatnine to 12 months would have been sufficient\". Of moresignificance was the fact that the court was prepared to go onto substitute a period of community service in lieu of thecustodial period. In a passage which has apparently beenfrequently quoted as support for a penal \"equivalent\", LordLane C.J. said [at pp. 70-71 Cr. App. R. (S)]:In the present case, had he not already spent a little timein prison before he was released on bail, we would probablyhave ordered a length of community service of about 190hours. As it is, we think that 150 hours will suffice[.][40] Attempting to apply this methodology to the Canadiancontext, I have on several occasions reduced otherwiseappropriate custodial terms and substituted an order ofprobation requiring the offender to perform community servicehours. In [page140] R. v. Suhr (March 12, 2002, Cole J. (Ont.C.J.), unreported), a case involving defrauding an employer, Ifound that the appropriate range of sentence would normallyhave been about 9-12 months custody, but I elected to reducethe \"denunciatory\" term to six months and to replace theremainder of the custodial term with an order that the offenderperform a significant number of hours of community service.That decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal (R. v. Suhr,2002 CanLII 13476 (ON CA), [2002] O.J. No. 4315, 166 O.A.C. 97 (C.A.)). While the panelhearing the appeal expressly refrained from offering anygeneral comment on the methodology I had employed, the courtnoted that it was open to me to do what I had done, approved ofwhat I had done in the circumstances of the case and upheld mysentence. I interpret this case as authorizing a sentencingjudge to replace a portion of an otherwise appropriatecustodial sentence with some period of community service. Forthis reason, my disposition of this case is to impose what Iconsider to be the minimum \"denunciatory term\" of custody,followed by a lengthy period of probation, the major purpose ofwhich is to require the offender to perform community servicein lieu of additional custody.Disposition[41] The offender is sentenced to a term of 30 days incustody.[42] Upon release from custody, the offender is placed on aperiod of probation for two years. In addition to the statutoryconditions common to any order of probation, the followingoptional conditions of probation are imposed:-- The offender shall report in person to his probationofficer within two days of his release from custody, andthereafter as directed.-- The offender shall perform 240 hours of community servicework. The work is to commence within 30 days of thecommencement of this order and shall be completed at a rateof not less than 12 hours per month in consecutive monthsand shall be completed to the satisfaction of the probationofficer or designate within 21 months of the commencementof this order.Order accordingly.

MorrisonAt:Fredericton,\nNew BrunswickAppearances:Claude Haché for the CrownJoseph W. J. FitzPatrick for the AccusedD E C I S I O NMorrison, J. (Orally)I.Overview[1]Marc-Andre Doucet pleaded\nguilty to the charge of impaired driving causing the death of JenniferDawn\nBrewer contrary to section 255(3) of the Criminal Code.[2]The Crown requests that a\nconditional judicial stay of proceedings be entered with respect to thecharges\nunder sections 255(3.1) and 249(4) set out in Counts #2 and #3 of the\nIndictment.Accordingly, I enter a conditional judicial stay ofproceedings with\nrespect to those two charges.II.FactsCircumstances of the offence[3]On the evening of June 9,\n2016 Mr. Doucet, Jennifer Dawn Brewer and two other individuals were atDooly’s\non Prospect Street.The group left Dooly’s at 2:53 a.m. with Mr.Doucet\ndriving and Ms. Brewer in the passenger seat.The car stopped atthe Irving\nConvenience Store on Prospect and Regent Street where all four occupantsof the\nvehicle entered the gas station.A few minutes later camerafootage showed Mr.\nDoucet exiting the Irving and getting into the driver’s seat and movingthe car\nforward.Ms. Brewer attempted to get into the passenger seat butthe vehicle\nkept moving, causing Ms. Brewer to be thrown from the vehicle into theIrving\nparking lot.Mr. Doucet then backed the vehicle up and Ms. Brewergot into the\npassenger side door.The vehicle then drove down Regent Streetwhere it\ndropped the two other individuals off.At approximately 3:30 a.m.police\nresponded to a report of a single vehicle accident near the lighthouseon St.\nAnne’s Point Drive, which is at the foot of Regent Street.Policesaw a\nheavily damaged vehicle resting on its side and a tow truck that wasalready on\nthe scene.They also observed a male walking on the grass who wasconfused,\nslurring his words and had a strong odour of alcohol on hisbreath.The male\nwas later identified as Mr. Doucet.Ms. Brewer was not in the carand Mr.\nDoucet’s clothes were wet as he was trying to find Ms. Brewer.Heinitially\ntold officers that he was the passenger in the vehicle and that Ms.Brewer was\nthe driver.The investigation also revealed that Mr. Doucet hadcalled a\ntowing company to remove the vehicle but the attendant refused to do soas it\nwas apparent there had been a serious accident.[4]Mr. Doucet was placed\nunder arrest, taken to the hospital and a blood sample was taken.Asubsequent\ntoxicology analysis determined the blood alcohol concentration of Mr.Doucet at\nthe time of the accident to be between 178 and 220 milligramspercent.A\ncollision analyst’s report prepared by the Fredericton Police Forcerevealed\nthat the car was heading northbound on St. Anne’s Point Drive fromRegent\nStreet, failed to navigate the curve near the lighthouse and travelledon the\ngrassy knoll located nearby.The vehicle struck a large bouldercausing it to\nbecome airborne.While airborne the vehicle struck a lamp pole,touched down,\nrolled over and came to rest facing eastward, parallel to theriverbank.Ms.\nBrewer was thrown from the vehicle.The collision analyst’s reportdetermined\nthat the vehicle was travelling between 82 and 110 kilometres per hourat the\ntime it left the roadway.[5]Subsequent to the\ncollision the police relentlessly attempted to locate Ms. Brewer.The\nunderwater recovery team made several dives in the area of the riveradjacent\nto the accident in an attempt to locate her.Eventually, on June12, 2016, Ms.\nBrewer’s body was located near the shoreline of the river near WaterlooRow.An autopsy revealed that the cause of her death was blunt force trauma.B.Circumstances of the offender[6]I have been provided with\na Pre-Sentence Report with respect to Mr. Doucet dated March 13, 2017prepared\nby Jerry Clarke, probation officer.Mr. Doucet is 27 years old andabandoned\nhis education at age 16 in grade 10 and entered the workforce.Hehas been\nemployed in various jobs as a general labourer, in lawn maintenance,snow\nplowing, heavy equipment operation and in the salvage business.[7]Mr. Doucet’s parents\ndivorced when he was a child and he remained in his mother’s care untilhe was\napproximately 15 years old.Mr. Doucet reports that his mother wasabusive and\nthe Department of Social Development was required to intervene.Mr. Doucet\nthen went to live with his father, who he described as analcoholic.Mr.\nDoucet has been living on his own since the age of 17.Mr. Doucethas been in\nan on and off relationship with a 33 year old woman with whom he has onechild\naged 17 months.Mr. Doucet reports that he is currently working onthis\nrelationship which, according to his partner, will require significanteffort\nif it is to be successful.[8]Mr. Doucet’s partner\nreports that consumption of alcohol and illicit drugs have been areas of\nconcern in their relationship.Mr. Doucet reports that he hassuffered from\ndepression in the past and had issues with anger management.Mr.Doucet was\nconvicted in 2011 of impaired driving and has a conviction for drivingwhile\ndisqualified.C.Impact on the victims[9]I have been provided with\nand reviewed victim impact statements prepared by the following:(1)Lisa Brewer, mother of Jennifer Brewer;(2)Gaylon Brewer, Jennifer’s father;(3)Ashley Brewer, Jennifer’s sister;(4)Hannah Brewer, Jennifer’s 6 year old\nsister;(5)Tammy Brewer, Jennifer’s aunt;(6)Melissa McIntyre, Jennifer’s aunt;(7)Tiffany Brewer-Lawrence, Jennifer’s\ncousin;(8)Megan McIntyre, Jennifer’s cousin;(9)Carly Jean Crouse, Jennifer’s friend;(10)Jennifer Keetch, Jennifer’s friend;(11)Leisa Blanchard, Jennifer’s friend;(12)Sabrina Yerxa, Jennifer’s friend; and(13)Kelsey Brewer, Jennifer’s friend.[10]I will not review in detail\nall the victim impact statements. All are a testament to the loss andpain\ninflicted upon loved ones by this crime. Three of these were presentedin court\non March 22nd: Ashley Brewer (sister), Carly Jean Crouse (friend) andMelissa\nMcIntyre (aunt). Ashley Brewer described the anguish her sister’s deathhas\ninflicted and the personal challenges it has created for her and theefforts\nshe has made to overcome them to honour her sister. Jennifer’s parentsdescribe\nthe devastating void, aching loss and heartache that only a parent whohas lost\na child can fully comprehend.Hannah, Jennifer’s 6 year oldsister, also\nprovided a victim impact statement which was composed by hermother.It sets\nout Hannah’s own fears and how she misses her sister and it also records\nobservations of the impact this tragedy has had upon the littlegirl.III.Legal\nParameters[11]The maximum penalty under section\n255(3) is imprisonment for life. A conditional sentence is not available by\noperation of section 742.1 as this is an offence involving serious personal\ninjury.IV.Position\nof the Crown and DefenceA.Position of the Crown[12]The Crown submits that general\ndeterrence and denunciation should be the prominent guiding objectivesin\nsentencing Mr. Doucet.The Crown argues that the appropriatesentence is four years\nimprisonment with a driving prohibition in the range of 4 – 10 years.[13]Counsel for the Crown has\nreferred me to several cases in support of its sentencerecommendation.In R.\nv. Howe [2007] NBCA 84, the offender was impaired from a day of heavy\ndrinking, drove his vehicle over the center line onto the paved shoulder of the\nroadway, striking and killing a bicycle rider.He left the scene of the\naccident to seek an alibi from his girlfriend, which was refused.Mr. Howe\npled guilty to impaired driving causing death and leaving the scene of the\naccident and was sentenced by the trial judge to concurrent sentences of two\nyears less one day to be served in the community.Mr. Howe had a blood alcohol\nlevel of 140mg.The Court of Appeal varied the sentences imposed to 3 years\nfor the impaired driving causing death and six months consecutive for leaving\nthe scene of the accident.In allowing the appeal Mr. Justice Richard stated\nat paragraph 47:This\ncase offers this Court its first opportunity since the 2001 amendments to the Criminal\nCode to offer some guidance to New Brunswick sentencing Judges.[14]And at paragraph 55,\nJustice Richard states:Considering all of the above, we are of the view that\nimprisonment for a period of three years for the offence of impaired driving\ncausing death is the least restrictive sanction that can meet the applicable\nsentencing objectives and principles.[15]In\nR. v. Atkinson, 2015 NBCA 48 (CanLII) the Court of Appeal refused to overturn a\nsentence of ten years for impaired driving causing death.In that case the\naccused was driving at a high rate of speed while suspended and overtook\nvehicles on a solid double line, crossed two lanes of traffic and collided with\nthe victim’s vehicle.The accused had a blood alcohol concentration of between\n275 and 295 milligrams percent and had five previous related convictions.[16]In R. v. Ruizfuentes,\n2010 MBCA 90 (CanLII), the offender drove through a red light and hit another vehicle\nkilling the driver.He pled guilty to impaired driving causing death.The\nblood alcohol concentration at the time of driving was determined to be 131 to\n183 mg.The trial judge sentenced the offender to 6 years in prison and a 15\nyear driving prohibition.The Court of Appeal overturned the trial judge and\nsubstituted a sentence of 4.5 years and a driving prohibition of 7.5 years.The Manitoba Court of Appeal extensively reviewed the jurisprudence with\nrespect to sentencing for the offence of impaired driving causing death and\nconcluded that the range of sentence for a first time offender is two to five\nyears.[17]In R. v. Junkert, [2010]\nONCA 549, the accused, while impaired by alcohol, drove through a residential\nneighbourhood at high speed in a dangerous manner.He left the roadway and\nstruck a woman jogging on the sidewalk.The accused’s blood alcohol reading at\nthe time of driving was 130 mg.The Court of Appeal upheld a five year\nsentence for the first time offender.The Court recognized a trend toward\nhigher sentences for impaired driving causing death and stated:That said, I do not think that a sentence of 5 years\nfor this offence is unfit.Nor is it a significant departure from sentences\npreviously imposed so as to warrant interference by this court.[18]In R. v. Ramage\n[2010] ONCA 488, a driver who had a blood alcohol level of between 229 and 274\ncrossed four lanes of traffic on a busy four-lane highway and struck two\noncoming vehicles.The passenger in one of the vehicles was killed.The\naccused was a first time offender, an outstanding member of the community, and\na dedicated father and husband.The accused showed remorse and the victim’s\nfamily had forgiven him and asked the trial judge not to incarcerate him.The\nCourt of Appeal upheld a four year custodial sentence.[19]In R. v. Cartwright,\n2014 NBQB 180 a sentence of five years’ incarceration was imposed for causing\nthe death of two people and injuring a third.The accused was found guilty\nafter a jury trial and had a blood alcohol concentration in the range of 94 to\n109 milligrams percent.[20]In R. v. Bartels,\n2016 NBPC (unreported) the accused was sentenced to four years for the death of\nhis long-time girlfriend.He had driven a four wheel off-road vehicle into a\nquarry, causing the vehicle to flip and the victim to be ejected from the\nvehicle.The blood alcohol reading was between 165 to 235 milligrams percent.B.Position of the Defence[21]The defence position is\nthat the appropriate range of sentence is 2 years with a drivingprohibition in\nthe two year range to commence upon release from incarceration.[22]Defence counsel also refers\nto R. v. Atkinson and submits that the circumstances of that case are\nmuch more egregious.Further, defence points out that the accused in that case\nhad five previous related convictions.Similarly, the defence also argues that\nthe circumstances in R. v. Howe are more serious than those in the\npresent case.In Howe the accused struck and killed a cyclist, left the\nscene and then attempted to concoct an alibi.[23]Defence refers to R. v.\nAnderson, 2012 NBQB 32 (CanLII).In that case a wife was convicted after trial for\nthe impaired driving death of her passenger husband when she had a blood\nalcohol level of between 203 and 270 milligrams percent.She was sentenced to\nthree years.[24]In R. v. Maxwell-Smith,\n2013 YKCA 12 (CanLII) a sentence of 24 months was upheld for a 27 year old, with no\nprior record, found guilty after trial, who drove with a blood alcohol level of\nbetween 134 and 158 milligrams percent.He was driving at excessive speed\nwhich resulted in the ejection of a passenger who died.[25]In R. v. Cluney,\n2013 NLCA 46 (CanLII) the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal substituted a 24\nmonth sentence where the accused had a blood alcohol level of between 191 and\n222 milligrams percent and had veered into oncoming traffic killing one person.[26]In R. v. Smith, 2013\nBCCA 173 (CanLII) the Court of Appeal substituted a sentence of two years for a driver\nwho had a blood alcohol level of between 123 and 206 milligrams percent and had\nalso consumed crack cocaine before driving in a highly reckless manner, striking\nand killing a motorcyclist.The Court noted that the accused had diminished\nmental capacity, no criminal record of any kind and had a difficult life and\nwas a good prospect for rehabilitation.V.Aggravating and mitigating factors[27]Section 718.2 of the Criminal\nCode provides that, “A sentence should be increased or reduced to account\nfor any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the\noffence or the offender”.I will address what I consider to be the aggravating\nand mitigating circumstances in this case.AggravatingFactors[28]I have relied on the\nfollowing as aggravating factors:(1)Mr. Doucet’s blood alcohol concentration was\nbetween 178 and 220 milligrams percent at the time of the accident;(2)Mr. Doucet’s call to the tow truck operator and\nhis initial statement to police that he was a passenger was an obvious attempt\nto avoid responsibility;(3)The profound impact on the family and friends of\nMs. Brewer as evidenced by the victim impact statements;(4)The speed of the vehicle at the time it left the\nroadway was in excess of 82km/hr; and(5)The accused has prior convictions for impaired\ndriving and driving while disqualified.Mitigating factors[29]I have considered the\nfollowing as mitigating factors:(1)Mr. Doucet entered a guilty plea which, in my\nview, is a significant mitigating factor as it spares the victim’s family the\nanguish of a trial;(2)Mr. Doucet made what I consider to be a genuine\nexpression of remorse, both by his oral statement in court and by the letter of\napology which is marked as Exhibit DS-1; and(3)Although not youthful, the accused is only 27\nyears old and thus there is a reasonable prospect of successful rehabilitation.[30]The Crown submits that this\nis an appropriate case for a DNA order under section 487.051.Theoffence of\nwhich Mr. Doucet has been convicted is a secondary designated offenceand thus\nthe DNA order is discretionary.In exercising that discretion Imust consider\nMr. Doucet’s criminal record, the nature of the offence and thecircumstances\nof its commission and the invasiveness of the order.In this case,Mr. Doucet\nhas been convicted of an offence which carries a maximum penalty of lifein\nprison and is one which is designated as an offence involving seriouspersonal\ninjury.In short, this is a serious offence.In the courseof committing the\noffence Mr. Doucet’s blood alcohol reading was high, he was travellingat a\nhigh rate of speed and attempted to avoid liability by calling a towtruck\noperator and initially telling police that he was the passenger and notthe\ndriver.Mr. Doucet has prior convictions for impaired driving anddriving\nwhile disqualified. Weighing these factors I consider this to be anappropriate\ncase to issue a DNA order.VI.Principles of sentencing[31]The objectives to be\nconsidered and the principles to be applied in imposing a sentence areset out\nin sections 718, 718.1 and 718.2.These principles were succinctly summarized\nby Justice Ferguson in R. v. Howe, 2015 NBQB 75 (CanLII), 2015 NBQB 075 at paragraphs 41 and\n42:The\nprincipal purpose of sentencing is to protect the public by denouncing unlawful\nconduct, deterring offenders and other persons who might be inclined to commit\ncrime, separating offenders where necessary from society, and assisting in\nrehabilitation of the offender through the promotion of a sense of\nresponsibility in the offender.Sentences\nmust be proportional to the gravity of the offence given the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender, and must be similar to sentences imposed on\nsimilar offenders who have committed similar offences in similar circumstances.VII.Analysis[32]I acknowledge the\nsubmission of defence counsel that each sentence must be crafted to fitthe individual\ncircumstances of each case and each offender and that the court cannever lose\nsight of the goal of rehabilitation in imposing a fit sentence.However, the\nprimary objectives of the court in sentencing an offender in these typesof\ncases are denunciation and general deterrence.In R. v. Rhyason (2007),\n2007 ABCA 119 (CanLII), 404 A.R. 191, the Alberta Court of Appeal stated at paragraph 31:Denunciation is especially needed to combat two still\ncommon views: that a death like this is a mere accident, and that the victim\nwas as much to blame…drinking and driving must be seen as a true crime, and no\nlonger be brushed off as a mere non-deliberate regulatory offence.[33]In\nR. v. Biancofiore (1997), 1997 CanLII 3420 (ON CA), 35 O.R. (3d) 782, the Ontario Court of\nAppeal stated at paragraph 27:…it is too easy for otherwise law-abiding people to\nview what happened in this case as an “accident”, an unfortunate consequence of\nan error in judgment, rather than the commission of a criminal offence.Sentencing courts should be careful to ensure that they do not bolster that\nview of serious drinking and driving offences.[34]And\nin R. v. Cromwell (2005) 2005 NSCA 137 (CanLII), 238 N.S.R. (2d) 17, the court stated at\nparagraph 29:The sentence must provide a clear message to the\npublic that drinking and driving is a crime, not simply an error in judgment.Those who would maim or kill by driving their vehicle while impaired are as\nharmful to public safety as are other violent offenders.The proliferation of\nthis crime and the risk that it will be seen by society as less socially\nabhorrent than other crimes heightens the need for a sentencein which both\ngeneral deterrence and denunciation are prominent features.[35]In R. v. Howe, supra,\nour Court of Appeal observed at paragraph 50:[C]ourts have an obligation to denounce impaired\ndriving offences.The condemnation of these types of offences must be clear\nand, where the offence has devastating consequences, it must be loud.Courts\nhave an obligation to impose sentences that will serve to deter those who,\nalthough law-abiding citizens in other respects, might be inclined to view such\noffences merely as “accidents” as opposed to true crimes.[36]As mentioned earlier, the\nseriousness of drinking and driving offences resulting in death isreflected in\nthe position of the Court of Appeal in R. v. Howe, to which I referred\nearlier, that a minimum sentence of three years for an offence of impaired\ndriving causing death is the starting point in New Brunswick.The Crown has\nasked that I impose a sentence of four years imprisonment. I questioned Crown\ncounsel whether a longer period of incarceration might be more appropriate\ngiven Mr. Doucet’s prior convictions for impaired driving and driving while\ndisqualified. Crown counsel advised the Court that in assessing the relative\nstrengths and weaknesses of the Crown’s case certain frailties in the evidence\nagainst Mr. Doucet were identified.As a result, Crown and defence counsel\nreached an agreement that the Crown would not argue for a sentence longer than\nfour years in return for a guilty plea.While not a typical joint recommendation\non sentence the arrangement is, in effect, a joint recommendation as to the\nmaximum sentence.[37]It is clear that joint\nrecommendations on sentence, although not binding, are to be accorded\nsignificant weight and deference. They are not to be disregarded unlessthey\nare clearly unreasonable (R. v. Guignard, 2005 NBCA 35 (CanLII), [2005] N.B.J. No. 132).In Steeves v. R., 2010 NBCA 57 (CanLII), Chief Justice\nDrapeau reinforced the view that where a recommendation on sentence is the\nproduct of resolution discussions between the Crown and defence counsel (as is\nthe case here) there is an exacting standard for its rejection.Unless the\nrecommendation is clearly unreasonable, unfit or will bring the administration\nof justice into disrepute it should be followed.[38]I\nreject the submission of defence counsel that a prison term of two years is a\nfit sentence in this case.First, it is not in accord with the sentence\nguidance set out in R. v. Howe.Second, in my view such a sentence\nwould fall short of meeting the goals of denunciation and deterrence. The maximum\nsentence of 4 years jointly agreed to by counsel is\nwell within the range of sentences for these types of crimes. It may be\nconsidered somewhat lower than would otherwise be justified given the previous\nconvictions.However, it is not appropriate for me to second guess Crown\ncounsel with respect to resolution agreements involving cases with evidentiary\nvulnerabilities when the sentence proposed is within an acceptable range.VIII.Sentence[39]Mr.\nDoucet, please stand.What happened in the early morning hours ofJune 10,\n2016 was not an accident.It was a crime.It was a crimethat cost the life\nof a young woman – Jennifer Dawn Brewer – and inflicted immeasurablepain on\nher family and loved ones. You, like any person who gets behind thewheel of a\ncar when they have been drinking, must bear responsibility for the\nconsequences.Society demands that an example be made of thosewhose\nirresponsible conduct places lives in harm’s way so as to discourageothers from\ndoing the same.(1)Mr. Doucet:(a)With respect to Count 1 – impaired\ndriving causing the death of Jennifer Dawn Brewer, I sentence you to a term of\nimprisonment of four years;(b)You will be prohibited from driving for a\nperiod of seven years following your release from custody;(c)You will pay a victim fine surcharge of $200.00;(d)Pursuant to the direction provided in R. v. Summers, 2014 SCC 26 (CanLII) you\nwill receive 1.5 days’ credit for every day spent in pre-sentence custody; and(e)A sample of your DNA will be provided to the DNA databank pursuant to\nthe provisions of section 487.051 of the Criminal Code of Canada.____________________________________Terrence\nJ.

King, Judge of the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan,\nMoose Jaw, Saskatchewan, on the 22nd day of January, A.D. 1981, at the City of\nMoose Jaw, wilfully failed to comply with such order to wit: failed to keep the\npeace and be of good behaviour contrary to Section 666(1) of the Criminal Code;(4) On the 17th day of January, A.D.\n1982, at the City of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, did steal from Union Bus Depot\nmonies while armed with an offensive weapon to wit: a knife contrary to Section\n303 of the Criminal Code;(5) On the 17th day of January, A.D.\n1982, at the City of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, did while being at large on a\nrecognizance entered into before Judge G. King of the Provincial Court of\nSaskatchewan, Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, on the 29th day of December, A.D. 1981,\nand being bound to comply with a condition of the said recognizance, namely,\nfailed to keep the peace and be of good behaviour contrary to Section 133(3) of\nthe Criminal Code.[2]On these charges the appellant was sentenced as follows:(1) three months in the penitentiary;(2) four months consecutive in the\npenitentiary;(3) two months consecutive in the\npenitentiary;(4) three years concurrent with charges\n1, 2 and 3 in the penitentiary;(5) two months concurrent with charges\n1, 2, 3 and 4.[3]There are two factors in this case which give us concern. The first\nconsists of the appellant’s personal circumstances and his personality. He was\nborn on August 6th, 1964, and therefore was only seventeen years of age at the\ntime he was sentenced on January 26th, 1982. He has a grade eight education and\ncomes from a broken home. His parents had severe alcoholic problems. During his\nformative years he was moved back and forth between his natural parents, his\nnatural grandparents, as well as his relatives. He has been a temporary ward\nunder the Family Services Act for one year commencing January 8, 1980.\nHe has been in such residential institutions as Dales House and Ranch Erhlo.[4]His criminal record is as follows:1981-01-22Theft under $200.Sec. 294(b)Suspend. Sent. \u0026 Prob.for 1 yr.1981-04-06(1) Poss of WeaponSec. 85(1) 6 months(2) Breach of ProbationSec. 666(1)(2) 3 mos. consec.1981-04-27Theft Sec. 283 \u0026 2946 mos. consec. to sentence serving.[5]He also has previous convictions under the Juvenile Delinquents Act.[6]At the time of the last theft charge a pre-sentence report was ordered\nby judge R.J. Kucey and at that time the supervisor of the Moose Jaw Probation\nUnit commented:Robert is an adolescent who is encountering great difficulty\nin accepting responsibility for his behavior. Instead of being accountable for\nhis actions, Robert initially employs tactics such as lying and manipulating in\norder to avoid responsibility or as a means to minimize his activity in\nwrongdoings. With these behaviors failing to work for Robert, he also uses\nanother tactic in avoiding responsibility--he opts out with a profound ‘I don’t\ncare’ attitude.Robert will not accept any type of counselling. He will not\ntake a step forward to help himself when the opportunity has been offered to\nhim.[7]There is also on file a report from Dr. George Pantazopoulos, Senior\nPsychiatrist at the Union Hospital, Moose Jaw, dated February 23, 1981, which\nsays in part:Psychomedically, he showed himself to be an immature,\nintellectually limited, belligerent and aggressive young man, exemplifying the\nstereo-type of socially, emotionally, environmentally and genetically\nhandicapped individual.[8]The other factor which has given us some concern is that three of the\nco-accused on the robbery charge, Darren Boneau, Colin Woolsey and Manfred\nRenlund, entered pleas of guilty on April 26th, 1982, and each received a\nsentence of six months incarceration. At the time of the hearing of this appeal\nwe expressed our concern about the apparent discrepancy between these sentences\nand those imposed on the appellant. At that time we were told that the Crown\nwould be appealing the sentences imposed on the co-accused but we now find that\nthose appeals have been abandoned.[9]We find it difficult to rationalize the sentence of three years imposed\nupon the appellant on the robbery charge with the sentences of six months given\nto the co-accused. In our opinion the appellant should now be removed from the\npenitentiary and the balance of his sentence should be served in a Provincial\nCorrectional Centre. We feel that his total sentence for all the charges should\nnot exceed two years less one day. The sentences on charges (3) and (5) are\nsummary conviction matters with which we cannot deal on this appeal. The\nsentences imposed on charges (1), (2) and (4) are set aside and the following\nsentences are substituted:On Charge (1) the sentence is three months in a Provincial\nCorrectional Centre.On Charge (2) the sentence is three months concurrent\nin a Provincial Correctional Centre.On Charge (4) the sentence is nineteen months less one day\nconsecutive to the sentences imposed on charges (1), (2), (3) and (5) for a\ntotal of two years less one day.Appeal allowed in part."}

DerrickHeard:July 24, 2007, Sydney\nProvincial CourtOraldecision:August 1, 2007, Sydney Provincial\nCourtCharges:Controlled Drugs and\nSubstances Act, section 5(1)Counsel:David Iannetti - Crown\nAttorneyPatricia Fricker - Defence CounselBy the Court:[1]On June 6, 2007, Shawna\nMatheson pleaded guilty to a single count of trafficking in cannabis marijuana\ncontrary to section 5 (1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.A\nPre-Sentence Report was ordered and Ms. Matheson’s sentencing hearing was\nconducted on July 24, 2007. I reserved my decision on sentencing until today,\nAugust 1, 2007.[2]Ms. Matheson had been\narrested and charged on June 8, 2006, for selling a gram of cannabis to an\nundercover police officer. According to the facts recited at sentencing, police\ntargeted individuals including Ms. Matheson as part of a drug sting operation\nentitled “Summer Solstice”. On June 4, 2006, an undercover officer went to Ms.\nMatheson’s home and asked to purchase marijuana. The officer was told to “come\nback on Thursday” (June 8), which she did, and at that time, Ms. Matheson sold\nher a single gram of cannabis marijuana for $10.[3]Ms. Matheson was 33 years old\nat the time of the offence and enrolled in a Practical Nursing Program at the\nNova Scotia Community College Marconi Campus. She finished that program on\nNovember 29, 2006.On January 10, 2007, Ms. Matheson wrote her Canadian\nPractical Nursing Registration Examinations and passed them successfully. She\nis now eligible for registrationas a Licensed Practical Nurse in Nova Scotia.\nThe application process requires her to produce a recent criminal record check\nwithin the four week period prior to being licensed. Evidence was provided at\nMs. Matheson’s sentencing in the form of a letter from Carolyn Toomey, Academic\nChair at the Nova Scotia Community College School of Health and Human Sciences\nadvising that Ms. Matheson will not be able to obtain a Practical Nursing\nlicense while having a criminal record. Ms. Toomey states: “Should Ms. Matheson\nreceive a conditional discharge the probability is that she would be denied\nregistration until the time of absolute discharge.”[4]The Crown’s position on\nsentencing in Ms. Matheson’s case is relatively simple. In the Crown’s\nsubmission, the nature of the offence requires that she receive a custodial\nsentence, although given her status as a first offender, a short conditional\nsentence of three months would be appropriate.The Defence position is that\nthis is a rare case where, notwithstanding that the offence is trafficking, a\nconditional discharge would be appropriate. The Defence argues that the case\nsatisfies the requirements of section 730 of the Criminal Code that it\nwould be in Ms. Matheson’s best interests and not contrary to the public\ninterest to order a discharge. The Crown asserts that the paramount\nconsideration in drug trafficking cases is general deterrence and states that a\nconditional discharge for Ms. Matheson would be contrary to the public interest\nbecause it would not send the right message. The Crown argues the right message\nfor drug trafficking cases must be that a custodial sentence will be the\npenalty and that this message is particularly important in a region where drugs\nare a problem. The Crown notes the drug sale was made from Ms. Matheson’s\nresidence and that “someone was able to come to the door and purchase\nmarijuana.” The Crown concedes that specific deterrence of Ms. Matheson is not\nan issue here and that the emphasis in the Crown’s submissions is on the deterrence\nof others.[5]Section 10 of the Controlled\nDrugs and Substances Act sets out the purpose of sentencing under that Act.\nIt states as follows in section 10(1):Without restricting the generality of the Criminal\nCode, the fundamental purpose of any sentence for an offence under this\nPart is to contribute to the respect for the law and the maintenance of a just,\npeaceful and safe society while encouraging rehabilitation, and treatment in\nappropriate circumstances, of offenders and acknowledging the harm done to\nvictims and to the community.[6]Section 10(2) of the Controlled\nDrugs and Substances Act identifies a series of aggravating factors the\nsentencing judge is mandated to take into account. The Crown concedes that none\nof the aggravating factors are present in this case. No weapons were involved,\nthe drug sale did not take place at or near a school or public place frequented\nby persons under 18, nor was the sale to a person under 18, no one under 18 was\ninvolved to facilitate the sale and Ms. Matheson has no previous record for a\ndrug offence. The fact of the sale having been effected from a residence is not\nlisted as an aggravating factor.[7]Under the Controlled Drugs\nand Substances Act, the maximum sentence for Ms. Matheson’s offence,\ntrafficking in cannabis marijuana less than 3 kilograms, is five years less a\nday. There is nothing in the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act or Criminal\nCode to preclude the granting of a conditional discharge for the offence of\ntrafficking one gram of cannabis marijuana.[8]The purpose and principles of\nsentencing in the Criminal Code also apply to this sentencing.\nParliament has articulated the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing\nin sections 718 and 718.1 of the Criminal Code.718. [Purpose] The fundamentalpurpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime preventioninitiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peacefuland safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of thefollowing objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and otherpersons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders fromsociety, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitatingoffenders;(e)to provide reparations for harmdone to victims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense ofresponsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victimsand to the community.[9]Section718.2 recites the other sentencing principles that the sentencing court ismandated to take into consideration, which for the purposes of this case are:(a)a sentence should be increased orreduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstancesrelating to the offence or the offender...(b)a sentence should be similar tosentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed insimilar circumstances;...(d)an offender should not be deprivedof liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in thecircumstances; and(e)all available sanctions otherthan imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should beconsidered for all offenders...[10]Sentencing has been explicitly\nrecognized as an individualized process. (R. v. C.A.M. (1996), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), 105 C.C.C.\n(3d) 327 (S.C.C.)It is a process requiring an examination of the facts of\nthe offence and the circumstances of the offender and an assessment and\nweighing of the relevant sentencing principles to arrive at a fit and proper\ndisposition. The courts have long rejected a “cookie-cutter” approach to\nsentencing. This was reinforced in the 1996 amendments to the Criminal Code which\nare reflected in the provisions I have recited above.[11]In addition to information made\navailable to me concerning Ms. Matheson’s nursing studies, a Pre-Sentence\nReport was prepared.The consensus of Crown and Defence is that it is a\npositive report. It discloses that Ms. Matheson’s life has not been easy.She\nhas had to overcome the disadvantages of a difficult family life with an\nalcoholic father and having to witness physical, verbal and emotional abuse. At\nage 16 her trust and physical integrity were violated by a trusted friend and\nprominent member of the community. She moved away as a result of harassment by\nfriends of the perpetrator and abandoned her plan to pursue a career in the\nmilitary.She married early at 20 and has two teenage sons from that\nrelationship. She was able to regain custody of her older son, now 15, after he\nwas placed in foster care in Ontario while living with his father.Ms.\nMatheson’s younger son, aged 13, continues to live with Ms. Matheson’s\nex-husband.[12]She has emerged from her\nexperiences without a dependency on drugs or alcohol and has managed to\nre-direct her aspirations in a positive direction. She enjoys a close and\nsupportive relationship with her mother who describes Ms. Matheson as a\n“loving, caring person.”Both Ms. Matheson’s husband and a friend spoke of Ms.\nMatheson’s kind and decent nature.[13]Ms. Matheson has been in a\nrelationship with her husband, Robert Matheson, for six years. They married\nthree years ago and now have a four month old daughter.They plan to have more\nchildren.Mr. Matheson is on Social Assistance Disability due to a fused disc\nand money has to be managed carefully in their household. Mr. Matheson has a\ncriminal record.[14]Kim Somerton, who attended\ncommunity college with Ms. Matheson, described Ms. Matheson for the\nPre-Sentence Report in glowing terms.She commented on how determined Ms.\nMatheson was to complete the nursing program and noted that she had been very\nsupportive of her classmates, attending their graduation even though she was\nnot able to finish with them because of personal difficulties that held her\nback until the following year. Ms. Somerton reported that Ms. Matheson was a\nhard worker who learned very quickly and was “really good with patients”,\nparticularly the elderly.[15]Neither Ms. Matheson’s mother\nnor Ms. Somerton could explain Ms. Matheson’s involvement in the offence. Ms.\nSomerton observed that Ms. Matheson appeared to be “ a gullible person” which,\nin her view, perhaps contributed to her involvement.Ms. Matheson herself said\nshe can be too trusting. Mr. Matheson, who reportedly “feels sick” over the\nwhole incident, told the author of the Pre-Sentence Report that his wife had\nbelieved the arresting officer was a friend of his.[16]Ms. Matheson has said in the\nPre-Sentence Report that she takes full responsibility for the offence andacknowledges her lack of judgement. She emphasized that she will not become\ninvolved in such an offence again and plans to “stick to nursing.”[17]Ms. Matheson has shown a\ndetermined effort to better her circumstances. Having left school at 16, she\ntook upgrading courses and completed her Grade 12 eight years later whileliving in Ontario. Given the ages of her older boys, she must have done this\nwhile they were small, requiring additional effort and initiative. She aspires\nto continue her education towards qualifying as a Registered Nurse.[18]Section 730(1) of the Criminal\nCode requires me to determine, in considering whether a conditional\ndischarge is an appropriate disposition, whether the discharge would be in the\noffender’s best interests and not contrary to the public interest. On the first\nbranch of the analysis, the evidence before me establishes that a criminal\nrecord will stop Ms. Matheson’s career ambitions dead in their tracks. She\nsimply cannot get a license as a Practical Nurse with a criminal record.Her\nhard won achievements would have to be re-cast in another mold other than\nnursing.Furthermore, there would seem to be no issue with Ms. Matheson’s\npersonal suitability for a conditional discharge. She is of good character,\nwith no prior criminal record. She has not been in further conflict with the\nlaw since being charged and fully complied with the conditions of her release\nundertaking. She demonstrates qualities of hard work and determination and\ncontributes positively to her family. She is poised to work in a career that\ndemands service and commitment to others. However, even such positive factors\nwould be unlikely to outweigh, in a sentencing assessment, a serious\ninvolvement as a drug trafficker such that a custodial sentence could be\navoided.[19]It remains important in\nsentencing for drug offences to accurately characterize the nature of the\noffence.This was recently noted by our Court of Appeal in R. v. Jones,\n2003 NSCA 48 (CanLII), [2003] N.S.J. No. 146 with reference to R. v. Fifield (1978), 25 N.S.R.\n(2d) 407 of the same court.In Jones at paragraph 8, the Court\nobserved that sentencing for possession for the purpose of trafficking has been\ninfluenced in Nova Scotia Court of Appeal decisions over the past 25 years by\n“the quantity of drugs involved and the function or position of the offender in\nthe drug operation.” Underscoring that Fifield continues to represent\ngood law on the issue, the classic statement in Fifield was reiterated:The quantity [of the drug] is important in helping to\nshow the quality of the act or the probable category of trafficker - the\nisolated accomodator of a friend, the petty retailer, the large retailer or\nsmall wholesaler, or the big-time operator. The categories respectively have\nbroad or overlapping ranges of sentence into which the individual offender must\nbe appropriately placed, depending on his age, background, criminal record, and\nall surrounding circumstances.[20]I note that in one of the\ncases relied on here by the Crown, R. v. Collette, [1999] N.S.J. No. 190,\nthe Court of Appeal referred to Fifield and categorized Mr. Collette,\nfound in possession of 10 kilograms of cannabis resin, as “clearly in the\ncategory of wholesaler or large retailer.” (paragraph 17) Mr. Collette, whoreceived a conditional sentence of two years less a day following his guilty\nplea to possession for the purpose of trafficking, had his sentence raised on\nappeal to three years in jail. The Crown appeal succeeded on the basis that the\nsentencing judge had failed to consider in any depth “the need for deterrence,\nboth general and specific, as well as the need for protection of the public\nwhen dealing with a drug offence involving such a large quantity of drugs.”\n(paragraph 16)[21]In Ms. Matheson’s case, the\namount of cannabis marijuana involved was one gram. No proof was made of Ms.\nMatheson’s sale being part of a larger drug operation. She was not approached\nfor a petty sale and then asked if she could procure a significantly larger\namount. (See for example, R. v. Ferguson (1988), 1988 CanLII 156 (NS CA), 84 N.S.R. (2d) 255\n(N.S.S.C., App. Div.) Nor was she asked if she could continue to supply\nsmaller amounts as in R. v. Hartnett, [1991] N.S.J. No. 399 (N.S.S.C., App.\nDiv.) She sold one gram of cannabis marijuana for ten dollars. The\ntrafficking charge laid against her was solely with respect to this single\ntransaction. I do not place any weight on the untested statement in the\nPre-Sentence Report from a constable with the Cape Breton Regional Police\nService that Ms. Matheson and her husband are both very well known to the Drug\nSection of the Service: in oral submissions the Crown said it was unaware of\nMs. Matheson being investigated for any other drug matters andthe Defence\nproperly pointed out that there are no other matters pending before the courts\nand objected to the police officer’s statement in the Pre-sentence Report. It\nwould be inappropriate for me, in categorizing the type of offence, and sentencing\nfor it, to consider anything other than the trafficking charge to which Ms.\nMatheson has pleaded guilty. I note that “illegal but uncharged conduct” cannot\noperate as an aggravating factor in sentencing. (R. v. Dawe, [2002] N.S.J.\nNo. 504 (N.S.C.A.)) The Crown has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable\ndoubt, the existence of any aggravating fact that is disputed. [(Section\n724(3)(e), Criminal Code][22]Using the Fifield\nanalysis and on the facts before me, Ms. Matheson’s actions most closely\nresemble, of all the categories, the “isolated accomodator of a friend.”Mr.\nMatheson’s remark that his wife thought the undercover officer was a friend of\nhis is suggestive of an accommodation by Ms. Matheson. No other reasons has\nbeen advanced for the offence, which has been described by Ms. Matheson and her\ncounsel as an error in judgment.I conclude therefore that there is nothing\nabout the character of the transaction for which Ms. Matheson was charged that\ndisqualifies her from consideration for a conditional discharge.[23]Having satisfied myself that\nMs. Matheson is not disqualified as a candidate for a discharge and has\nestablished that it would be in her best interests to have one imposed, I must\nturn to the question of whether it would be contrary to the public interest to\ngrant a discharge, and examine the issue of general deterrence, the pivot of\nthe Crown’s submissions on sentencing.[24]The Crown bases its\nsentencing submissions on the proposition that a consistent message must be\nsent in trafficking cases that the offence will attract a custodial sentence.The Crown indicates that judges in the Sydney area have been imposing custodial\nsentences for trafficking. I was reminded that drugs are a serious problem in\nCape Breton and I am aware, in this vein, as is mostly everyone who follows the\nnews, of the terrible harm that dangerous and addictive drugs such as OxyContin\nand crack cocaine have caused in the communities in this region.The Crown\nsays that, for trafficking, at the very least, a short conditional sentence is\nrequired to satisfy the primary objective, in drug trafficking cases, of\ngeneral deterrence.[25]I have some difficulties with\nthe Crown’s submission and have taken the opportunity, in reserving my decision\non sentencing, to consider it carefully. While courts have repeatedly stated\nthat deterrence and denunciation need to be emphasized in drug cases,I am not\nsatisfied that this reduces sentencing of all drug trafficking cases to a simplecalculus of how much custodial time is warranted and whether it should be a\nconditional sentence or not.I believe more is required of the sentencing\ncourt and the Crown’s submissions raise the following issues for me in this\ncase:\u003eThe\neffectiveness of general deterrence particularly in a case such as this;\u003eThe\nunderlying proposition that drug trafficking cases necessarily attract a\ncustodial sentence even though Parliament has not established a mandatory\nminimum sentence;\u003eThe\nimplication that the public interest is only concerned with deterrence and no\nother social values.The Effectiveness of General\nDeterrence[26]The Crown’s submission that\nthe right message needs to be sent by the sentence in this case essentially\nencapsulates what is intended by the concept of general deterrence. General\ndeterrence supposes that others,with similiar inclinations to the offender\nwill be deterred, once they learn about the sentence, from committing acomparable offence. A sentence emphasizing general deterrence is intended to\n“deter those of like-mind who may be lured into the [drug] business with the\nhope of easy gain.” (R.v. Butler, [1987] N.S.J. No. 237 (N.S.S.C., App.\nDiv.)The purpose of general deterrence is to “discourage potential\noffenders from becoming actual offenders.”It has been referred to as the\n“punishment of the offender for what others might do.”(R . v. McGinn (1989),\n1989 CanLII 4784 (SK CA), 49 C.C.C. (3d) 137 (Sask. C.A.)) Judges, such as Vancise, J.A. in dissent\nin McGinn, have expressed serious reservations about the effectiveness\nof general deterrence. Vancise, J.A. did so with the following comments at page\n157:Contending that longer sentences, for example, six\nmonths, would have a greater deterrent effect than a shorter sentence, for\nexample one month, is to contend that: (1) the public will know of the sentence\n(a dubious proposition); (2) the potential offender will perceive the likelihood\nof apprehension (a more dubious proposition); and (3) the potential offender\nknowing he will likely be apprehended would commit the offence for the lower\npenalty of one month but not for the higher penalty of six months. Viewed in\nthis way it is small wonder that an upward variation in sentences appears to\nhave no effect on the crime rate.[27]The degree of publicity a\ncase receiveshas also been remarked upon as relevant to the deterrent value\nof the sentence. Nunn, J. in R. v. Clarke, [1990] N.S.J. No. 427 (N.S.S.C.) observed\nabout Mr. Clarke’s case: “If it receives no publicity then there is no general\ndeterrence, other than the several people who may be in court at the time the\nsentence is given.”[28]Let me make it clear that it\nis not my intention, in this case, to attempt a comprehensive examination of\nthe effectiveness of general deterrence.However it is appropriate I think to\nconsider what general deterrence represents in the context of a particular case\nand whether it deserves the centrality it is accorded in cases where the facts\nand circumstances are different. As I previously noted, Ms. Matheson is on the\nbottom rung of the Fifield categorization and it is material for me to\nthoughtfully examine the message that should be sent by the sentence I impose\nhere. Furthermore, I should note that Parliament has not decreed that a\nconditional discharge is incompatible with the objective of general deterrence:\nit is only offences with a mandatory minimum sentence or punishable by\nimprisonment for fourteen years or life that are statutorily excluded from the\ndischarge provisions.[29]Returning for a moment to the\nissue of publicity and general deterrence, I will note that in Ms. Matheson’s\ncase there has been a single Cape Breton Post story about her first court\nappearance, publishing her name and address.There was no coverage of her\nguilty plea on June 6, 2007 or her appearance for sentencing on July 24, 2007.To the extent that there is some publicity, generated by this decision, or even\nof Ms. Matheson’s first appearance, and awareness of that by the general\npublic, this in itself can have a deterrent aspect. (R. v. Meneses (1976),\n25 C.C.C.(2d) 115 (Ont. C.A.))Is a Custodial Sentence Mandated for\nDrug Trafficking Cases?[30]My earlier comments in this\ndecision about the nature of this offence and Ms. Matheson’s involvement\nillustrate my view that each case must be judged on its own merits and, where\nParliament has established no mandatory minimum sentence, all available\nsentences should be considered. This is particularly necessary in light of\nsections 718. 2 (d) and (e) of the Criminal Code that mandate offenders\nshall not be deprived of liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be\nappropriate in the circumstances and oblige courts to consider all available\nsanctions other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances.It is therefore not obligatory that a custodial sentence, evenin the nature\nof a conditional sentence, be imposed in drug trafficking cases and I reject\nthe suggestion that drug trafficking can never qualify for a non-custodial\ndisposition.A review of the case law suggests that such sentences are rare\nbut even conditional discharges are not unheard of.(R. v. Hogan, [2003]\nB.C.J. No 3196 (B.C. Prov. Ct.)In addition, as precedents, cases decided\nbefore the Criminal Code sentencing amendments in 1996 must be “read\nwith great care and awareness of the sentencing principles which now apply,\nparticularly those applying to incarceration as a last resort and the focus\nupon individualized sentencing.” (R. v. Nicoll, [2005] N.S.J. No. 194 at\nparagraph 26 (N.S. Prov.Ct.)) Such pre-1996 cases include the Nova Scotia\nSupreme Court, Appeal Division decisions in R. v. Butler, [1987] N.S.J. No.\n237;R. v. O’Toole, [1992] N.S.J. No. 164; and R. v. Ferguson, [1988] N.S.J.\nNo. 194,all mentioned by the Crown and all dealing with offenders and\ncircumstances much different from this case.[31]Comments in Fifield continue\nto have resonance on this issue of crafting appropriate sentences in drug\ntrafficking cases, and I refer to the Appeal Court’s admonition to judges to:“... constantly remind ourselves that sentencing to be an effective social\ninstrument must be flexible and imaginative.” (Page 3, QL version) The Fifield\ncourt went on to refer approvingly to the comments of MacDonald, J.A. in R.\nv. Stuart, [1975] N.S.J. No. 351: “...The sensitive and difficult task of\nsentencing requires individual appraisal of the rehabilitative and deterrent\naspects of each case without any slavish following of precedents.”[32]The Crown’s recommendation\nthat Ms. Matheson receive a custodial sentence because, as the Crown has said,\nthis is what the Crown always seeks in drug trafficking cases and this is what\nlocal judges impose, risks encouraging “a slavish following of precedent” or at\nleast, a slavish adherence to a norm that applies to a very different character\nof offence and offender.The Public Interest[33]The primary purpose of\nsentencing is the protection of the public and, in drug trafficking cases, it\nis the principles of general and specific deterrence that have been relied upon\nto achieve this purpose.But I have to consider whether the public interest\nthat sentencing must serve and that a conditional discharge must not underminedemands attention be paid only to the principle of general deterrence.Cacchione, J. in R. v. J.F.C., [2006] N.S.J. No. 37 (N.S.S.C.) upholding\na conditional discharge for assault causing bodily harm and knowingly uttering\na threat to cause death construed the public interest more broadly, stating at\nparagraph 33 of his decision:The words “ contrary to the public interest” contained\nin section 730 (1) of the Criminal Code do not equate solely with the\ndeterrence of the offender or of others. The public interest concept is broad\nenough to encompass a factor such as the impact of having a family put on\nsocial assistance as the result of the offender losing his employment because\nof a criminal conviction and the effect of that on the social fabric of that\nfamily.[34]There is a public interest in\nthe offender’s rehabilitation as Cacchione, J. observed in J.F.C. andas Abella, J.A. (as she then was) noted in R. v. Kerr, 2001 CanLII 21142 (ON CA), [2001] O.J. No. 5085\n(Ont. C.A.) Abella, J.A. was also mindful of the message that a sentence\nsends, holding at paragraph 17 of Kerr that:...to under-emphasize rehabilitation in this case,\nwould, on the other hand, send the unwarranted signal that courts will\nsacrifice evidence of considerable rehabilitative progress on the altar of\ngeneral deterrence.[35]Abella,\nJ.A.went on in paragraph 18 to acknowledge the public interest being best\nserved by a sentence “...most conducive\nto eliminating the risk of re-offending. And that, in turn, argues for a\nsentence that both acknowledges and facilitates the ongoing rehabilitation of\nthe [offender.]”[36]In Ms. Matheson’s case,\nrehabilitation is well advanced and has been ongoing since her arrest with her\ncontinuing to pursue her nursing studies in the period after she was charged.\nShe is now a new mother again and is also raising her teenaged son. She has\nexpressed remorse and regret for her offence and a determination to be\nlaw-abiding.[37]Parliament has established\nthat one of the fundamental purposes of sentencing is to contribute to respect\nfor the law by imposing just sanctions. This is reflected in both the Criminal\nCode and Controlled Drugs and Substances Act sentencing provisions.\nUnduly harsh or oppressive sentences that fail to acknowledge the unique\ncircumstances and facts of a case will not be seen as fair or rational. The\nCrown here seeks a three month conditional sentence for the sale of a single\ngram of cannabis marijuana for ten dollars.A three month conditional sentence\nwas deemed fit and proper in R. v. McGrath, [2004] N.J. No. 11 (Nfld. and L.\nProv. Ct.), where a search of Ms. McGrath’s home revealed her to be in\npossession of two pounds of cannabis marijuana and one pound of cannabis resin\nand drug trafficking paraphernalia - glass vials, score sheets and some sets of\nscales.Ms. McGrath was a 32 year old single mother subsisting on social\nassistance with two young children. In R. v. Quilty, [1997] N.J. No. 253,\nthe Newfoundland Court of Appeal upheld three month conditional sentences for a\nmother, father and son who had been engaged for four months in a small scale\ncannabis resin trafficking operation from their home to supplement their\nwelfare income. On the facts established in this sentencing, Ms. Matheson’s\noffence did not involve anything resembling a drug trafficking operation. It is\na principle of sentencing set out in section 718.1 of the Criminal Code that\na sentence “must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree\nof responsibility of the offender.”Only then can the public be satisfied that\nthe offender “deserved” the punishment she received and feel confidence in the\nfairness and rationality of the system. (R.v. C.A.M., supra, at page 348)\nIt is my view that the McGrath and Quilty decisions illustrate\nthat a three month conditional sentence for the single sale of $10 worth of\ncannabis marijuana by Ms. Matheson cannot be regarded as fair or rational.[38]I want to make a final\ncomment about the two cases I have cited from Newfoundland and Labrador. The\nCrown, reacting to reliance by the Defence on some cases from British Columbia,\nstated during oral submissions that British Columbia cases do not provide\nuseful guidance to courts in Cape Breton. Without taking a position on this\nassertion, I will note that there are undeniable parallels between the social\nand economic conditions in Newfoundland/Labrador and this region.[39]On July 30, the Crown\nforwarded by fax the Alberta Provincial Court decision of R. v. Shaheen 2005\nABPC 93 (CanLII). In Shaheen, the Court declined to grant a discharge to Mr.\nShaheen for a Customs Act violation of failing to truthfully disclose\nsix and one-half kilograms of flavoured pipe tobacco that he was bringing into\nCanada from the United States.Mr. Shaheen, a Canadian citizen, submitted that\na criminal conviction for the offence “might” result in United States’\nimmigration authorities denying him entry, although he had been unable to\nobtain confirmation of this from United States’ immigration officials.Fradsham, P.C.J. not only held that Mr. Shaheen’s representations about the\nimpact of a criminal record constituted an insufficient factual foundation for\nthe discharge application, he concluded that United States immigration officers\nhad the right to know Mr. Shaheen had committed an offence under the Customs\nAct as such information could be relevant to border officials determining\nwho should be permitted entry into the U.S. On this basis, Judge Fradsham\ndetermined that a discharge was contrary to the public interest.[40]I find the Shaheen\ndecision to be distinguishable on its facts and its reasoning from Ms.\nMatheson’s case. Ms. Matheson hasestablished through evidence, as I have\nalready discussed, that she will experience a specific prejudicial effect if a\ncriminal conviction is recorded against her.I have further concluded that the\nShaheen case, which engaged entirely different considerations on the\nissue of the public interest, does not influence my analysis of the public\ninterest aspects of Ms. Matheson’s case.[41]I am satisfied, after a careful\nweighing and balancing of the principles of sentencing including sections 718.1\nand 718.2 (d) and (e) of the Criminal Code and section 10(1) of the\nControlled Drugs and Substance Act, and the facts and circumstances in this\ncase, that I am not required to impose a custodial sentence, in the form of a\nconditional sentence, on Ms. Matheson. I do not accept that I must prioritize,\nin the circumstances of this case, general deterrence, narrowly construed, to\nthe exclusion of other considerations. The devastating effect of a criminal\nrecord on Ms. Matheson’s career aspirations, the effect of my declining to\ngrant a conditional discharge, cannot be regarded as in the public interest.Mr. Matheson is disabled and cannot work. Ms. Matheson will be supporting the\nfamily or they will continue to be on social assistance. This was a\nconsideration for Cacchione, J. in J. F.C. where actual physical\nviolence had been involved. I think it would be contrary to the public interest\nin this case to impose a penalty that will thwart Ms. Matheson’s ability to be\ngainfully employed in a profession where she can make a valuable contribution\nto her community and her family.[42]I also do not accept that general\ndeterrence is only achieved through the imposition of a custodial sentence: in\nthe ordering of a conditional discharge in this case, to the extent anyone\nbecomes aware of it, there is a measure of general deterrence commensurate with\nthe nature of the offence. Ms. Matheson cannot obtain her nursing license until\nthe discharge is made absolute so there will continue to be consequences she\nwill have to bear as a result of her poor judgement. I doubt that she thought\nabout it at the time but with that ten dollar transaction she risked losing\nwhat she has worked so hard to achieve. That can serve as a cautionary message\nto others.[43]I am satisfied on the basis\nof what I have said above that it is in Ms. Matheson’s best interests and not contrary\nto the public interest to grant a conditional discharge of one year with the\nfollowing conditions:To keep the peace and be of good\nbehaviour;Attend at court as and when directed to\ndo so;Inform the court of any change to name,\naddress, employment oroccupation;Report to Probation Services in Glace Bay by 4 p.m. on\nAugust 2 and thereafter as directed by them;Not to take, consume or possess drugs except in\naccordance with a physician’s prescription or a medical authorization;Attend for any counselling, programs or treatment as\ndirected by probation services;Perform 50 hours of community service work by the end\nof the probationary term.[44]Provided these conditions are\nsatisfied, the discharge will be made absolute at the end of the 12 month\nperiod.Judge Anne S. DerrickJudge of the Provincial\nCourt"}

Connell, Esquire, appearing\nfor the AppellantP. Lorrie Yerxa, Esquire, appearing for the RespondentTHE COURT: I do not have a copy of the Pre\nSentence Report in my file. Do you have a copy of it, please?MR.\nYERXA: I do,\nMy Lord.THE\nCOURT: I will\nignore any marks on it.This is a hearing of an appeal between\nHer Majesty the Queen and Floyd Murphy. Mr. Connell, for the Crown.MR.\nCONNELL: Yes,\nMy Lord.THE\nCOURT: Mr. Yerxa, for the respondent.MR.\nYERXA: Yes, My\nLord.THE COURT: I have had an opportunity\nto read the written submissions that have been filed and the transcript of[Page 2]the\nproceedings below, as well as the Pre Sentence Report. I would welcome any\nfurther submissions. Mr. Connell?MR. CONNELL: My Lord, if you might forgive me for\nbeing late in the first place, but I picked up the wrong file. If I might go\nget my file?THE\nCOURT: Certainly.MR. CONNELL: I was getting an adjournment\ndownstairs for a matter that was supposed to be done at 10:30 and I never got\nit concluded at all.THE COURT: Okay, I will wait for you.\nTake your time. So on this matter I would invite your submissions, Mr. Connell.MR.\nCONNELL: Yes,\nMy Lord.In regards to the facts on October 17,\n1994 Mr. Murphy, before Judge Cockburn, pleaded guilty to the two offenses of\n266(b) on his wife.THE\nCOURT: Common assault; dragging her around by the hair and slapping her.MR. CONNELL: That is right, My Lord. You\nhave read through the facts and Mr. Yerxa has accepted those as facts so there\nis no need of repeating them.Upon the submissions the learned court\njudge imposed a conditional discharge in regards to those two offenses with\nprobation for one year whereby the respondent be of good behaviour and keep the\npeace, receive family enrichment, substance abuse counselling, and actively\nparticipate in any recommended treatment or program.Now the grounds of appeal from our\nperspective, My Lord, is that the learned judge failed to consider the\nprinciples of sentencing here. We would submit[Page\n3]that this is not on the low\nend of the scale as far as a common assault goes. This was a fairly serious\nassault. The slap by itself, not bad, but the pulling of the hair around the\nhouse and the son getting involved fighting with his father, and then his\nfather going back at the victim was quite serious.We had requested a period\nof incarceration and one of the grounds we felt was serious; because she was a\nvictim here in the circumstances and alcohol seemed to be a major contributor\nand she was also a cancer victim.Now the Supreme Court of\nCanada certainly recognizes domestic violence - there is no need of it. In R.\nv. Lavalee, (1990) 1990 CanLII 95 (SCC), 55 C.C.C. (3d) 97\n(S.C.C.) it\nwas stated by Madam Justice Wilson that:\"The\ngravity, indeed, the tragedy of domestic violence can hardly be overstated.\nGreater media attention to this phenomenon in recent years has revealed\nboth its prevalence and its horrific impact on women from all walks of\nlife.\"And then she goes on to\nmake other statements which are in my factum.But the case stood for the\nfact that this was a development whereby the battered wife syndrome arose as a\ndefence to murder.Now the Supreme Court of\nCanada certainly looks at domestic violence as very serious. In fact, you can\nkill someone for the offence of being battered so from that perspective I would\nsubmit that assault on a spouse is serious.Then there was the R.\nv. Brown (1992) 1992 ABCA 132 (CanLII), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 242 case, and it's in the\nfactum, whereby there[Page 4]are\nthree cases of domestic violence dealt with by the Alberta Court of Appeal. In\nthat case they found that both specific and general deterrence were necessary\nand that it has to be demonstrated. And it was said at page 249 in that judgment:\"But when such cases do result in\nprosecution and conviction, then the courts do have an opportunity, by their\nsentencing policy, to denounce wife beating in clear terms and to attempt to\ndeter its recurrence on the part of the accused man and its occurrence on the\npart of other men.\"They went on to state that an assault\nshould be treated as if I committed an assault and you were a stranger on the\nstreet rather than because it is my wife, that's different; or a husband, vice\nversa. The Court went on to say this is a breach of trust situation whereby the\nweaker spouse may be dependant in certain circumstances. Nevertheless, it is a\ntrust situation because of the relationship between the couple.And the Court went on to say that the\npreservation of the union should not be sacrificed over the principles of\ngeneral deterrence. In other words, general deterrence is important and\nparamount in all -- from that case comes the grounds of general and specific\ndeterrence.Now I quoted a case, R.\nv. Silliker, 134 N.B.R. (2d) 134 where Mr. Justice Riordon\nlooked at the principles in R. v. Brown. Now in that case a man broke his\nwife's nose and I believe he was charged with assault causing bodily harm. Mr.\nJustice Riordon backed up those principles as stated in Brown and handed out a\n90 day intermittent sentence.[Page 5]Now when Judge Cockburn stated, the\nlearned court trial judge, stated \"a jail sentence probably is required\",\nthe Crown would submit that indeed that was the issue when you consider the\nprinciples in the case. So from that perspective, My Lord, it would certainly\nbe the Crown's perspective that whatever the judge handed out as sentence, a\ndischarge was not sufficient. Perhaps the period of probation was, but perhaps\nthere could have been other conditions imposed in the probation. But whatever\nshould have been, the Crown would certainly submit that a discharge, when one\nconsiders specific and general deterrence, certainly didn't meet what is\nrequired in this nature of the assault that was before the Court.So for those grounds the Crown is\nrequesting this Court to reconsider the sentence and impose a sentence which\nwould reflect the severity of the assaults and society's condemnation of those\nassaults in regards to both general and specific deterrence.THE\nCOURT: Thank\nyou. Anything else?MR.\nCONNELL: Nothing\nelse, My Lord.THE\nCOURT: Okay, I\nunderstand you. Mr. Yerxa?YERXA: Yes, My Lord, just a couple of comments.\nFirst of all on the Crown's submission, My Lord, I am just a little bit\nconcerned because at paragraph 7 of their submission they suggest that the\nlearned trial judge had failed to place proper emphasis on general and specific\ndeterrence. In fact, they go on and say that the sentence was inadequate having\nregard to all the circumstances. They don't say one circumstance; they don't\nsay general deterrence; they don't say specific deterrence; they say all the\ncircumstances.[Page\n6]And\nyet when we get to paragraph 21 of their submission they are talking about a\nsingle factor - general deterrence.I am going to suggest to\nyou, and I am going to just take a minute and lead through here that the proper procedure is\nonce there is a conviction is to consider then all the circumstances. In fact,\nin doing that, I am going to take a look at the case that the Crown relies on,\nand I am suggesting that the Crown misinterpreted that case.The pages that I will refer\nto, and there is just a couple, are off my computer so we have all got the same\nthing and refer the same way.In that Brown case the\nfacts are completely different\nthan they are in the Murphy case. In that Brown case they are actually trying\nthree men there all at once. The Court is considering three different men. But\nwhat is consistent in each case is that Mr. Brown had a prior record,\naggravated assaults. In fact, he had assaulted the same victim in the past, and\nin addition to that he had assaulted other common-law victims. This is a\nrepeated and grave assault situation on different women.THE COURT: And I see things\nlike a knife being used here, too.MR. YERXA: That is Mr.\nHighway. That is one of the other men. No, that's Mr. Umpherville. He is the\nthird man. In the beginning of the case they refer to B.H. and U. B is Brown;\nHighway is a native man. But he had been convicted for assaulting the same victim in\nthe past. Again, it was an aggravated assault. There were threats uttered. He\nwas a repeat abuser. There[Page 7]was violent and aggressive\nbehaviour there and the abuse was over a long period of time.Mr. Umpherville was the man\nwith the knife who stabbed and prevented the lady from getting medical treatment\nand she bled for some time. In fact, he was in breach of condition even to stay\naway from that lady. Those are completely different facts than we have in the\nMurphy situation and it is in that context that, that Brown case was decided.Now, in fact, if you look\nat page 19 of that Brown case there is a heading where the Appeal Court sets\nout sentencing principles applicable to these cases. It is the second line down\nfrom the top of that page. So let's take a look at the principles that they\nused in sentencing.Well, to do that I would\nthen ask you to look at page 20. It would be the last paragraph on that same\npage. It says:\"This\ncourt's experience is that the phenomenon of repeated beatings of a wife by a\nhusband is a serious problem in our society. It is not one which may be solved\nsolely by the nature of the sentencing policy applied by the courts where there\nare convictions for such assaults.\"What assaults – repeated\nbeatings, severe situations as the context this case is being decided in.It goes down there a little\nfurther and it says:\"But\nwhen such cases do result in prosecution and conviction, then the courts do\nhave an opportunity, by their sentencing policy, to denounce wife beating in\nclear terms and to attempt to deter its recurrence (two\nsituations) on the part of the accused man (the individual) and its[Page\n8]occurrence\non the part of other men.\"They are not considering\none thing. They are considering two situations; the individual, the accused,\nand then the general public.We go on to the next page,\npage 21. It says:\"In\ncases of assault by a man against his wife, or by a man against a woman with\nwhom he lives even if not married, the parting-point in sentencing should be\nwhat sentence would be fit if the same assault were against a woman who is not\nin such a relationship. For example, what would be the fit sentence if the man had assaulted a woman on\nthe street or in a bar -- and if the aggravating factors... or the mitigating\nfactors...\"You have got to look at all\nthe circumstances, the mitigating and the aggravating. You have got to look at\ngeneral deterrence, specific deterrence.Next paragraph – the Court\nhasn't stopped:\"Then\nthe court should examine the circumstances which are peculiar because of the\nrelationship.\"You have got to look at\nthat, too – another set of circumstances.Furthermore, if you go over\nto page 25 the Court gets now around to starting to sum up the principles. On\npage 25 it says:\"It\nis not possible to draw up an exhaustive list of factual elements which should\nbe taken into account in sentencing in wife assault cases. Because of the violence has occurred in the context of a\nspousal relationship without which the man might never have been violent toward\nthe woman, the court must consider (What?) whether the assault for which the man had been convicted is\nrelatively minor in nature, or is an[Page 9]isolated\nincident, or whether there are other circumstances which make it desirable that\nthe sentence not be such as to be counter-productive to the possibility that\nthe family relationship will be preserved...\"So the Court has got to\nlook at everything. Once the man is convicted, you have got to look at it all.In fact, just under that it\napplies the principles and what does it say in the very first sentence:\"In\nBrown, we think that, after taking the aggravating and mitigating factors into account,\nand emphasizing particularly...\"Now, remember, this is in\nthe Brown case –\"...emphasizing\nparticularly repeated and grave assaults...\"That is what the Court is\nconsidering in this Brown case that are aggravated assaults, not the same as\nMurphy. They are looking at all the circumstances, not just the general\ndeterrence.Therefore, I think that I\nhave to ask what really is the Crown looking for. Well, certainly they ask for\na period of incarceration and the only reason they give for that is that the\njudge didn't look at general deterrence.Well, we certainly weren't\nlooking at a cycle of aggravating assaults, repeated assaults here. In fact, if\nwe look at the circumstances, Mr. Murphy had been married for 31 years. He has\nnot [sic] record. He certainly doesn't have any record of assaults on his wife.\nIn fact, the Pre Sentence Reports suggests [sic] that it had been a harmonious\nrelationship productive in[Page\n10]terms of grown children and\nall that sort of thing.So I think just in keeping\nwith the principles that are enunciated in that Brown case, if we then go to\nthe case which I cited; that is, the LaFrance one, I think the Court pretty\nwell sums up the fundamental principles to be followed there. If we look at\npage 20, I think it is pretty succinctly set out. That would be the last full\nparagraph at the bottom of that page. It says:\"The\nindividualization of sentences remains a fundamental principle in the Canadian\nsystem of sentencing.\"Just a couple of lines down\nit says:\"This\nprinciple remains so important that the imposition of abstract, standardized\nsentences which ignore individual factors, may constitute an error of\nlaw.\"My point here is that if\nthe Crown is asking that we impose a gaol sentence on wife assault as a minimum\nstandard, then to do so, without consideration of all circumstances, may be in\nfact an error or law.I referred to, as well, Mr.\nJustice Hall's comments in a text I won't go on and repeat them, but they\nbasically follow the same application of principles and that is that the\nsentencing must be individualized.So that brings us to the\ncase at bar and the facts that were considered by the trial judge and I would\nsuggest that the only question to be reviewed here today is whether Judge\nCockburn applied the principles that are proper in sentencing. Did he in[Page\n11]fact examine all the\nmitigating and aggravating factors? I would suggest that by comparing the Brown\ncase and the Murphy case, in Brown there were no mitigating factors. Courts\ndidn't find any. But in Murphy, Judge Cockburn did. He found it was a first\noffence, as I have already said, after 31 years of marriage. He found that it\nwas on the low end of the scale of charges, certainly, a summary conviction. I\nwould suggest that it was indeed not much more than a common assault.I am not even suggesting\nthat we should condone that, or whatever. The man has been convicted. But it\nwas certainly on the low scale. There was a mitigating factor, and I don't put\na lot of store in this, but certainly alcohol was involved. I think what is important\nthat on page 12 of the transcript at line 15 Judge Cockburn sort of focuses in\nthere and says:\"I\nnot only have to look at you but Ihave to look at the\nfamily...\"And that certainly is one\nof the principles in that Brown case that says you have got to look at the\ncircumstances that affect the family as well. That was one of the three things,\n\"whether there are other circumstances which make it desirable that the\nsentence not be such as to be counter-productive to the possibility that the\nfamily relationship will be preserved\". Judge Cockburn is looking at the\nfactors. That is one of the factors that he certainly looked at.Now the other thing I think\nis important is that there were some mitigating factors which were[Page\n12]presented on behalf of Mr.\nMurphy which led up actually to the charges and that was the family\ncircumstances prior to the charges having been committed. This man had been in\nthe construction business\nfor some time, most of his life, and had just recently experienced some very\nsevere financial losses. In fact, if you add them up, there was nearly to the\ntune of half a million dollars. That would cause problems in anybody's family.\nOf course, again, not an excuse, but they are factors that have to be\nconsidered. That is bringing on a lot of stress.On top of that his wife\ncomes down all of a sudden with cancer and loses an eye – more stress on top of\nstress. What does he do? Not to excuse the man, but it is a mitigating factor – he starts\ndrinking and it became a problem.I am suggesting that is\nsome of the factors that Judge Cockburn looked at. Now, you have got all this\nstress happening, the drinking happens, and we know what happened – common\nassault. What happens then? The wife leaves the home. She comes back, not\nbecause he asked her to, because he doesn't have any right to have any contact\nwith her. He had been ordered not to. But she does come back. In the meantime\nof his own initiative he had taken up counselling, an extensive\nperiod of counselling. I think the Pre Sentence Report refers to 24\nattendances, gets help with his alcohol. He recognized his problem. The Pre\nSentence Report tells us that he is cooperative; the remorse is there. Judge\nCockburn knows the remorse.My Lord, those are all\nmitigating factors and clearly what Judge Cockburn was doing was saying there[Page\n13]is a chance for\nrehabilitation of this man. I would suggest that if he hadn't taken that into\nconsideration then he may have been in error as well. And so rather than look\nat one circumstance like the Crown would have us do, Judge Cockburn did\nproperly apply the principles. He felt the man had a reasonable chance of\nrehabilitation and after consideration of all the factors, that is what he did.\nHe protected the interests of society by considering addressing -- through\nprobation; he considered the interests of the accused by offering him\nrehabilitation in the interest of the victim. He felt that it would be\ndetrimental, I am suggesting, to separate the partners at that time and he\nupheld the rules of law by imposition of a sentence. He did sentence him. He\ndidn't fail to do that.So I would submit, My Lord,\nin closing that there is no error by the Judge. He did apply all the principles\nproperly.With respect, I thank you.THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Yerxa. Any\nreply, Mr. Connell?MR. CONNELL: Yes, My Lord. If you read\nthe factum by the Crown, My Lord, there is nothing mentioned about gaol. The\nappellant respectfully requests that this Honourable Court set aside the\nsentence of conditional discharges on both counts and impose a sentence which\nwill reflect the principles of general deterrence and denunciation and that is\nwhat we are asking the Court to consider here.Wife beating, according to\nthe Brown case – and I am going back to what I stated originally – those are\nthe general principles that there has to be a[Page\n14]clear and general\ndenunciation especially in the case here, as Mr. Yerxa has said, a woman who is\na cancer victim and she gets a beating because of stress. The Crown would\nsubmit a discharge just is not sufficient.THE COURT: I understand\nyou. Anything else?MR. CONNELL: Nothing else,\nMy Lord.THE COURT: This is an\nappeal against a sentence in the Provincial Court. A Judge in the Provincial\nCourt had to deal with a situation of a man who pleaded guilty to two assaults\non his wife. The nature of the assaults was described as follows in the\nsubmission by Crown counsel:Regarding count one – on the\n26th day of June, 1994 at their family residence at Newmarket, Mr. Murphy got\ninto an argument with his wife. He had been drinking for the day. Mr. Murphy\ngrabbed his wife by the neck. She pulled away, and the argument went on, and he\nslapped her on the fact on the right-hand side.As to count two – on the\n30th of July, 1994 Mrs. Murphy came home with a friend to her house and she\nfound that her husband was drinking. He wanted her to take them to their farm\nin Jemseg and since he had been drinking she was afraid to go with him and refused\nto go. He didn't want no for an answer and she went to Mr. Murphy's mother's\nhouse where he followed her. There he went into the kitchen and he found Mrs.\nMurphy alone. He lunged at her and grabbed her by the hair. Mrs. Murphy tried\nto escape his hold but was unable to do so. He then grabbed Mrs. Murphy by the\nneck and made threats to her. He made her phone the hospital to say that she\nneeded to be put in[Page\n15]the psychiatric section and\nfrom there, there was a call to the R.C.M.P. Mr. Murphy had his wife by the\nhair all this time. He took her outside of the house, still holding her by the\nhair, looking for his mother. He made Mrs. Murphy walk around the house, pulling her\nby the hair. Their son, Michael, who is an adult, came to the house and told\nhis father to let his mother go. He refused and they both fought. Mrs. Murphy\nwas then able to escape and seek refuge in her son's truck. Mr. Murphy went and\ngrabbed her by the hair again. Her son, Michael, made him let her go and she\nmanaged to free herself and run to a neighbour's house for shelter until the\npolice arrived. Mr. Murphy was intoxicated on those two occasions.The\nstatement of facts wasn't disputed by counsel.In October, apparently at\nthe request of Mrs. Murphy, the order that they have no contact was terminated.\nIn November, Mr. Murphy finally got around to pleading guilty, although he had been in and\nout of court several times.At that time, after hearing\nsubmissions of counsel, the Judge, I think, was particularly struck by the fact\nthat Mr. and Mrs. Murphy were sitting together, living together. Since then there was\nevidence that Mr. Murphy had been participating in counselling at the Family\nEnrichment and had completed 15 sessions and that they were coping with their\nhealth situation; Mrs. Murphy's unfortunate tragic situation having cancer and\nMr. Murphy was trying to curb his abuse of alcohol.The Judge was struck, I\nthink, by the fact that[Page\n16]they were together and he\ngave particular attention to the fact that they had been married 31 years,\nraised children who are now adults, and that Mr. Murphy is now 56.Against that background\nthe Judge felt that this was not a circumstance where he should put Mr. Murphy\nin gaol and it seemed that he wanted to try and see Mr. Murphy rehabilitated\nand – I hesitate to use the word 'civilized', but I think that is probably the best\nword to describe it.The Judge went on to put\nhim on probation for a year and give him a conditional discharge.In all the circumstances, I\nam not convinced that the Judge erred in not putting Mr. Murphy in gaol but I\nwould note that if he had put him in gaol, I wouldn't called [sic] that error\neither.But I think there was error\nhere calling this a conditional discharge. I think that sends a message his\nuncivilized behaviour of assaulting a wife and dragging her around by the hair\nand that sort of thing is something that is not taken as seriously as it\nshould. I say that because a conditional discharge ends up not amounting to a\ncriminal record. This is a situation that seems to me that the learned trial Judge\nerred with a conditional discharge and on the facts that were before him. At\nthe very least there should have been a suspended sentence and probation, if\nnot, a short term in gaol.Anything less than a\nsuspended sentence and probation would seem to me to send a message that could\nbe misunderstood of the very serious view that the courts must have about wife\nbeating.[Page\n17]In the result I will allow\nthe appeal and substitute a suspended sentence for two years plus probation for\ntwo years on the conditions dealt with by the Judge of the Provincial Court.Mr. Connell, I would ask\nthat you make arrangements through Mr. Yerxa to have the necessary paperwork\nsigned and to bring home as clearly and forcefully as we can to Mr. Murphy that\nnext time he is not going to be able to talk about not having a record.\nHopefully, this will achieve the aim of the law.Is there anything else to\nbe said on this matter?MR. CONNELL: Nothing else, My Lord.THE COURT: Thank you very much,\ncounsel.ADJOURNED"}

Hamilton and Fichaud, JJ.A. concurring.Counsel:Chandrashakhar Gosine, for\nthe appellantPeter Rosinski, for the respondentPublishers of this case please take note that s. 110(1) and s.\n111(1) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act apply and may require editing\nof this judgment or its heading before publication.Section\n110(1) provides:Subject\nto this section, no person shall publish the name of a young person, or any\nother information related to a young person, if it would identify the young\nperson as a young person dealt with under this Act.Reasons\nfor judgment:[1]S.A.C. seeks leave of the Court\nand, if granted, appeals the sentence imposed by Chisholm, J.P.C. under the Youth\nCriminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1 (the “YCJA”).BACKGROUND[2]On June 1, 2006, the day scheduled\nfor trial, S.A.C., represented by counsel Hoyte, pleaded guilty to each of\nthree offences on an Information dated April 10, 2006 - three separate breaches\n(committed on April 7, 2006) of the same responsible person undertaking\n(contrary to s. 31(1) of the YCJA).Sentencing was adjourned to August22, 2006.[3]On June 22, 2006, S.A.C.,\nrepresented by counsel Gosine, entered guilty pleas to 12 of 14 counts\ncontained on an Information dated January 10, 2005.Sentencing was set over to\nthe same August date.[4]At the August 22, 2006, sentencing\nbefore Chisholm, J.P.C., S.A.C. was represented by the same, separate counsel\non each information.[5]Chronologically, the offences for\nwhich he was sentenced on that date are (all but the three breaches of house\narrest are Criminal Code offences):·May 27, 2005 - 334(b) ‑ stole motor\nvehicle·June 6, 2005 - 334(b) ‑ stole motor\nvehicle·July 11, 2005 - 334(a) ‑ stole motor\nvehicle·July 18, 2005 - 334(b) - stole motor vehicle·August 1, 2005 - 334(b) ‑ stole motor\nvehicle·August 16, 2005 - 334(b) ‑ stole motor\nvehicle·August 19, 2005 - 334(b) ‑ stole motor\nvehicle·August 22, 2005 - 348(1)(b) ‑ break,\nenter, theft - dwelling house·August 30, 2005 - 334(a) ‑ stole motor\nvehicle·August 30, 2005 - 348(1)(b) ‑ break,\nenter, theft ‑ dwelling house·September 20, 2005 - 348(1)(b) ‑\nbreak, enter, theft ‑ dwelling house·October 19, 2005 - 334(b) ‑ stole\nmotor vehicle·April 7, 2006 - 139(1) Y.C.J.A. ‑\nthree breaches of house arrest[6]The defence did not object to the\nfacts of the offences read into the record by the Crown.In many cases, the\nproperty stolen from the residences (primarily jewellery and electronics) was\nnot recovered.Often the stolen vehicles were used as transportation for the\ndwelling house break-ins and the vehicles later found indamaged condition.The Crown sought a total of 12 months custody and supervision to be followed by\n12 months probation for the offences on both Informations.Defence counsel\nHoyte proposed a probation order on the 3 count Information.In relation to\nthe 12 offences on the separate Information counsel Gosine also asked that\nS.A.C. receive probation.[7]The judge sentenced S.A.C. to a\ntotal of 200 days in secure custodyfollowed by 100 days supervision in the\ncommunity (s. 42(2)(n) YCJA), then to be subject to 12 months\nprobation.He ordered that S.A.C. provide a DNA sample.[8]S.A.C. appeals the sentence on the\n12 counts.The sentence for the 3 counts of breach of the responsible person\nundertaking is not under appeal (three concurrent sentences of 30 days custody\nand supervision, running consecutively to the sentences on the twelve counts).ISSUES[9]S.A.C. says the judge erred in\nordering a DNA sample.He further submitsthat a custodial sentence was not\nan available disposition in these circumstances (s. 39(1)(c) YCJA) and\nsays, in any event, the sentence is excessive.ANALYSISThe DNA sample[10]Conceding that the judge erred in\nmaking the DNA order without giving counsel an opportunity to make submissions,\nthe Crown asks that the matter be remitted to the court below.S.A.C. says the\norder should be vacated because thiswas not an appropriate case in which to\norder a DNA sample.[11]These are secondary designated\noffences calling for an exercise of discretion by the sentencing judge on the\nquestion of ordering a DNA sample.Counsel for S.A.C. could not advise us\nwhether, had the matter been properly raised before the sentencing judge,\nS.A.C. would have elected to call evidence.In the absence of an indication\nfrom counsel that evidence would not be called on behalf of S.A.C., it is not\nappropriate for this Court to determine whether the DNA sample should be\ngranted.I would remit this issue to the sentencing judge (see R. v. J.J.R.,\n[2003] O.J. No. 4869 (Q.L.); 2003 CanLII 32169 (ON CA), 181 C.C.C. (3d) 7 (Ont.C.A.) and R. v. J.M.G.,\n2004 ABCA 214 (CanLII), [2004] A.J. No. 747 (Q.L.); 187 C.C.C. (3d) 7 (Alta.C.A.)).The Custodial Sentence[12]The YCJA limits the\ncircumstances in which a young person may be sentenced to custody:39. (1) A youth justice court shall not commit a young person\nto custody under section 42 (youth sentences) unless(a) the young person has committed a\nviolent offence;(b) the young person has failed to\ncomply with non‑custodial sentences;(c) the young person has committed\nan indictable offence for which an adult would be liable to imprisonment for a\nterm of more than two years and has a history that indicates a pattern of\nfindings of guilt under this Act or the Young Offenders Act, chapter Y‑1\nof the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985; or(d) in exceptional cases where the\nyoung person has committed an indictable offence, the aggravating circumstances\nof the offence are such that the imposition of a non‑custodial sentence\nwould be inconsistent with the purpose and principles set out in section 38.(Emphasis\nadded)[13]The judge concluded that the\nconditions of s. 39(1)(b) were not satisfied here but found that custody was\navailable under s. 39(1)(c).The Crown says the judge erred in his application\nof s. 39(1)(b), but has not cross-appealed or filed a notice of contention on\nthat issue.As I am of the view that the judge did not err in ordering custody\nunder s. 39(1)(c), I will express no opinion on the judge’s interpretation of\ns. 39(1)(b).[14]Counsel for S.A.C. says the judge\nerred in his reliance on s. 39(1)(c) because:·the offences for which S.A.C. was then being\nsentenced could not be included in determining a “pattern of findings of\nguilt”;·the precise dates of commission for some of\nthe offences were not before the Court and therefore the judge could not\nconclude there was a “pattern of findings of guilt”;·even if all offences are considered, there\nis no “pattern of findings of guilt”.[15]The term “pattern of findings of\nguilt” is not defined in the YCJA.Bastarache, J. wrote for the Court\nin R. v. C.D.; R. v. C.D.K., 2005 SCC 78 (CanLII); [2005] S.C.J. No. 79 (Q.L.); 3\nS.C.R. 668:27In order to determine the\nmeaning of an undefined term in a statute, it is now well established that a\ncourt is to read the words making up the term \"in their entire context and\nin their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the\nAct, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament\": see Bell\nExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, 2002 SCC 42 (CanLII), at\npara. 26, quoting E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed.\n1983), at p. 87; see also Rizzo \u0026 Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), 1998 CanLII 837 (SCC), [1998] 1\nS.C.R. 27, at para. 21.[16]I agree with the analysis of the\nAlberta Court of Appeal on this issue in R. v. C.D.J., 2005 ABCA 293 (CanLII);\n[2005] A.J. No. 1190 (Q.L.); 205 C.C.C. (3d) 56.On themeaning of “pattern\nof findings of guilt” the court said:23The section [s. 39(1)(c)] refers to the plural,\n\"findings of guilt\", clearly indicating that there must be at least\ntwo, and likely more, findings of guilt before a pattern can be found. This is\nsupported by the phrase used in the French version of the section,\n\"plusieurs déclarations de culpabilité\", which translates as\n\"several findings of guilt\", indicating there must be three or more\nfindings of guilt in order to make out a pattern.24Further, the history referred to is of \"findings\nof guilt\", not sentences or dispositions, leading us to conclude that both\nprior findings of guilt and the current findings of guilt for which the young\nperson is being sentenced may be considered.25What, then, is required to establish a\n\"pattern\" of findings of guilt? The word \"pattern\" is\ndefined in Black's Law Dictionary, 8th ed. (St. Paul, MN: Thomson, 2004)\nas a \"mode of behavior or series of acts that are recognizably\nconsistent\". It has been held that in order to find a pattern of findings\nof guilt there must be evidence of some regularity or repetition: R. v. I.\n(D.A.), 2003 BCPC 317 (CanLII), 58 W.C.B. (2d) 98.In R. v. U. (D.R.), 2004\nBCPC 271 (CanLII), the Court concluded at para. 42 that the history must tend to show\neither a pattern of similar offences or a pattern of crime.26We conclude that there must be some recognizable\nregularity, consistency or similarity to the offences in order to demonstrate a\npattern of findings of guilt. If it were sufficient to show merely that the\nyoung person had a prior history of findings of guilt, there would have been no\nneed to include the word \"pattern\" in s. 39(1)(c).(Emphasis\nadded)(see also R. v. D.R.U.,\n2004 BCPC 271 (CanLII); [2004] B.C.J. No. 1639 (Q.L.)).[17]I do not accept the appellant’s\nsubmission that the s.39(1)(c) requirement that the young person have a\n“history” that indicates a pattern of findings of guilt prevents the sentencing\njudge from considering, as a part of a pattern, the offences before the court.The meaning of “history” was discussed recently by Franklin, P.C.J. in R. v.\nA.E.A., 2007 ABPC 80 (CanLII), [2007] A.J. No. 360 (Q.L.).I would agree with his observation\nthat “history” means the time period prior to the date of sentencing.Therefore, all offences including those currently before the court are to be\nconsidered.Had Parliament intended to exclude from consideration those\noffences for which the young person is currently being sentenced, clear words\nto that effect would have been used.As Franklin, C.P.J. reasoned:¶ 28To interpret this Act as opening the gateway\nto custody when the young person pleads guilty or is found guilty on different\ndays for offences separate in time and event but closing it if the accused\npleads guilty or is found guilty of offences separate in time and event all on\nthe same day is to create a legal fiction that is not in a young person's\ninterest. It does not deal with young people with the same history of findings\nof guilt in the same way. It would promote dissimilar sentence options for\nsimilar conduct. This cannot be a reasonable interpretation of the Act.[18]A “history of a pattern of\nfindings of guilt” alone does not fulfill the requirements of s. 39(1)(c).In\naddition, the young offender must have committed an indictable offence for\nwhich an adult would be liable to imprisonment for a term of more than two\nyears.Even then there remain meaningful restrictions on the imposition of a\ncustodial sanction.As Bastarache, J. wrote in R. v. C.D., supra:39. . .even if one of the gateways to custody in subs.\n(1) does apply, subs. (2) prohibits a youth justice court from imposing a\ncustodial sentence under s. 42 (youth sentences) unless the court has\ndetermined that there is no reasonable alternative, or combination of\nalternatives, to custody that is in accordance with the purpose and principles\nset out in s. 38. Furthermore, subs. (3) sets out a number of factors that a\ncourt must consider in determining whether there is a reasonable alternative to\ncustody, such as the alternatives to custody that are available and that have\nbeen used in respect of young persons for similar offences committed in similar\ncircumstances, and subs.

break \u0026 enter - dwelling·August 22, 2005:s. 348(1)(b) - break \u0026 enter - dwelling·August 30, 2005:s. 334(a) ‑ motor vehicle theft·August 30, 2005:s. 348(1)(b) - break \u0026 enter - dwelling·September 20, 2005:s. 348(1)(b) - break \u0026 enter -\ndwelling[23]Even if the offences that were\nbefore the court for sentencing are excluded, there remains a “pattern of\nfindings of guilt” as can be seen from S.A.C.’s prior criminal record (at para.\n21, above).[24]Looking at the collection of offences\nas a whole, S.A.C. engaged in criminal activity in August and September of\n2004; March, April, May, June, July, August, September and October of 2005; and\nMarch and April of 2006 - in many of those months he committed multiple\noffences.Despite being first sentenced and subject to probation in March 2005\nhis criminal pursuits continued unabated.This activity unquestionably\ndemonstrates the regularity, repetition and similarity sufficient to form a\npattern.Indeed, at the sentencing hearing, counsel for S.A.C. agreed that\nthis was so.When invited by the judge to comment on s. 39(1)(c),Mr. Gosine\nsaid:There is every indication there is a pattern of offences in\nthis matter and the sentences for the break and enters and the thefts over\nwould attract a period of custody of more than two years.Notwithstanding that, I would suggest that given his\ncooperation with the police without which there would have been no detection of\nthese crimes, it would not have been possible to place S.C. in jeopardy.[25]I would conclude that the judge\ndid not err by including for the purposes of s. 39(1)(c) the offences for which\nS.A.C. was then being sentenced. Nor did he err in finding that S.A.C. had a\nhistory that indicates a pattern of findings of guilt.The Pre-sentence Report[26]S.A.C. says the pre-sentence\nreport was deficient.The court was provided with a full pre-sentence report\nand two update letters.The full report had been prepared for the March, 2005,\nsentencing (for offences committed in August and September, 2004).At that\ntime, S.A.C. came before the court as a first time offender.The report\ndetailed the oversight that would be provided should a community based sentence\nbe ordered and suggested the conditions to be included in any supervision order.S.A.C. was sentenced to twelve months probation.[27]The same probation officer updated\nthat report by letter dated January 11, 2006, which was submitted for the\nJanuary, 2006 sentencing (for offences committed on August 8, 2005).At that\ntime S.A.C. was being sentenced for two new break and enters and breach of the\nMarch, 2005 supervision order.In that update the author, who had been\nsupervising S.A.C. since the earlier sentence, noted that he appeared to have\nan improved attitude and a commitment to change.She indicated a willingness\nto continue to supervise him and to facilitate a mental health assessment and\nthe completion of an anger management course.S.A.C. received a global\nsentence of four months deferred custody and twelve months probation at that\nJanuary sentencing.[28]By letter dated August 10, 2006,\nthe same probation officer provided a further update for the sentencing now\nunder appeal.She noted that at the time of the last update S.A.C. had stated\nan intention to obtain work, however, he had not held any steady employment\nsince the last sentencing nor had he resumed his education.The anger\nmanagement issues continued and his mother was concernedthat he may have\nresumed his drug use.After several breaches of his January deferred custody\nsentence on April 28,2006, he had been ordered to serve the balance in secure\ncustody.He was released from custody on May 17, 2006.His current supervisor\nadvised the report writer that S.A.C. presented with no motivation and did not\nfollow through with any of the programs put in place to assist him.That\nsupervisor believed he continued to associate with a negative peer group and\nwas at risk to re-offend.In view of S.A.C.’s inability or unwillingness to\nengage in support services the writer opined that his ability to abide by any\nfurther conditions within the community was questionable.[29]Counsel took no issue with the\nform or contents of these reports at the sentencing.He now says the sentence\nis illegal because the reports do not strictly comply with s. 40 of the YCJA.In particular, he says the reports do not adequately set out the availability\nand appropriateness of community services and facilities for S.A.C. (s.\n40(2)(d)(v)).I disagree.[30]I am satisfied that the reports,\ncollectively, fulfill the requirements of s. 40, the purpose of which is to\nprovide the sentencing judge with sufficient individualized information to\ncraft a sentence appropriate for the offender, in keeping with ss.38 and 39 of\nthe YCJA.The obligation under s. 40(2)(d) is to provide information\n“that is applicable to the case”.The first report fully details the community\nresources available.S.A.C. received the benefit of those services but\ncontinued to re-offend and failed to comply with the terms of his\ncommunity-based sanction.At the January sentencing he again received a\ncommunity based sanction which he breached, causing him to serve the balance in\nsecure custody.In the final report the writer\nindicated that S.A.C., if released into the community, was unlikely to abide by\nconditions or take advantage of programs.It was clear from the information\nprovided in the reports that S.A.C. had exhausted the available community\nresources.[31]At the sentencing, counsel for\nS.A.C. sought a period of probation for the twelve offences.It was his\nposition that a custodial sentence was not available.He did not elaborate on\nhow a further community-based sentence would contribute to S.A.C.’s\nrehabilitation or protect the public.He made no reference to S.A.C.’s past\nbreaches of probation orders.Glaringly absent from his submissions was any\nsuggestion that S.A.C. was likely to comply with a non-custodial sentence (s.\n39(3)(b)).Counsel did not outline any plan under which S.A.C. could continue\nto reside in the community.He did not suggest conditions of probation which\nmight succeed in curbing S.A.C.’s continuing criminal conduct.Nor, on appeal,\ndid counsel advise what additional information should have been included in the\npre-sentence reports or suggest any further information which would have been\nof assistance to the sentencing judge.Unfit Sentence[32]S.A.C. makes general arguments\nthat the judge failed to consider the proper principles of sentencing or\notherwise misdirected himself and that the sentence is “inappropriate”.In my\nview, these submissions are without merit.[33]Although finding that a custodial\nsentence was available in these circumstances the judge expressly considered\nwhether alternatives to custody could effect an appropriate disposition.He\nmentioned several factors as particularly relevant to his determination that\ncustody was warranted: S.A.C. was subject to probation orders throughout the\nperiod of these offences; break and entry into a private home is particularly\nserious; prior community-based sentences had failed to rehabilitate S.A.C.S.A.C. has a history of violating community-based sanctions.In these\ncircumstances, the judge reasoned that further probation would fail to hold\nS.A.C. appropriately accountable nor would it provide meaningful consequences\nfor his repeated and serious criminal behaviour.A period of custody, the judge\nfound, would best promote rehabilitation.He further considered totality.[34]I am not persuaded that the judge\nerred in principle or that the sentence is excessive.[35]As noted above, S.A.C.’s criminal\nrecord was not presented to the judge in an organized way.It appears that the\njudge determined the dates of prior offences from a review of the running\nfile.S.A.C. says the sentencing judge was not entitled to do so.I\ndisagree.Pursuant to s. 40(2)(d)(iii) of the YCJA, the pre-sentence\nreport is to contain full information about the young person’s criminal\nhistory.It is clearly intended that a sentencing judge have access to this\ninformation.The cases cited by S.A.C. on this point prohibit a trial judge\nfrom reviewing an accused young offender’s running file where it discloses past\ncriminal conduct.They are of no relevance here (R. v. R.T.J.T., [1989]\nN.S.J. No. 318 (Q.L.); 93 N.S.R. (2d) 101 (C.A.) and R. v. Melanson\n(1993), 21 W.C.B.

Y-1,as amended is unhelpful as\nwell.DISPOSITION[36]While I would grant leave I would\ndismiss the appeal in all respects save for the granting of the DNA order.If\nissued, the DNA order is set aside and any sample taken is to be destroyed.I\nwould remit the issue of a potential orderpursuant to s. 487.051(1)(b) of the\nCode to the sentencing judge.Bateman,\nJ.A.Concurred in:Hamilton, J.A.Fichaud, J.A."}

(3d) 425Ontario Superior Court of Justice,Lax J.April 14, 2007Contempt of court -- Disobedience of court order-- Sentence -- Defendants commit numerous breaches of six court ordersover lengthy period of time -- Defendants benefitted financially fromtheir contempt and caused extreme prejudice to plaintiffs -- Defendantscontinued their disobedience after being given opportunity to purgetheir contempt -- Defendants showed disrespect for court by lying to itand offering insincere apologies -- Male defendant sentenced to 12months' incarceration -- Female defendant sentenced to eight months'incarceration.In 1999, several orders were imposed on thedefendants requiring them to produce documents relating to theirbusiness and financial affairs. In his initial bankruptcy examination in1999, the male defendant did not disclose the existence of his telecombusiness, which was then generating substantial revenues. By the timeother orders were imposed on the defendants in 2000, including a Marevaorder, millions of dollars had been transferred out of that business tofamily members. In July 2003, the defendants consented to a finding ofcontempt and acknowledged that they were in breach of a total of sixcourt orders. They were given the opportunity to purge their contempt byfulfilling a number of undertakings which, in general, required them todisclose and document the transfers of money. The 2003 order providedthat if the defendants did not fulfil their undertakings within 90 days,they would each be incarcerated for seven days. In May 2005, thedefendants were found not to have complied with the July 2003 order.They were granted an extension of time to purge their contempt, and werewarned that they could not expect leniency if they failed to do so.They did not fulfil those undertakings and did not purge their contempt.The plaintiffs moved successfully for a declaration that the defendantsremained in contempt of the six court orders.Held, custodial sentences should be imposed on the defendants.In sentencing the defendants, the court was not limited to the sevenday sentence contained in the July 2003 order. It did not lie in thedefendants' mouths to rely on an order which had been varied in theirfavour in May 2005, especially in light of the fact that they had beenexplicitly warned that they could not expect further leniency if theycontinued in their contempt. Their acknowledgment of their contempt wasnot a mitigating factor as they were simply acquiescing in theinevitable. Traditionally, courts have been reluctant to imposecustodial sentences in civil contempt of court cases. However, theaggravating factors in this case were numerous and serious. There was adeliberate course of conduct over a lengthy period of time. There werenumerous breaches of six court orders. The defendants were found incontempt of fresh orders made while the contempt motion was pending.They benefitted financially from their contempt and caused extremeprejudice to the defendants. They had shown disrespect to the court bylying to it, offering an insincere apology, and giving only theappearance of compliance with the courts' orders. They had been givennumerous opportunities and a lengthy period of time to demonstrate theirobedience to court orders, but continued to act in breach of thecourts' orders. They had continued with a lifestyle of relative luxuryin spite of and in defiance of orders that restricted the use of theirassets. [page426]The primary sentencing goal in contempt casesis deterrence. Denunciation was also an important consideration in thiscase. The defendants were not deserving of leniency. The prospect of ashort period of incarceration had not deterred them in 2003, and thestrong language of the court and the prospect of a lengthier period ofincarceration had not deterred them in 2005. There was no reason tobelieve that they would abide by the terms of a conditional sentence.While the defendants were first offenders, they had a long record ofdeliberate disobedience of the court. The male defendant was sentencedto 12 months' incarceration. The female defendant had a lesser degree ofresponsibility, as she had no real involvement in the telecom business.She was sentenced to eight months' incarceration. Because thedefendants had children, they were permitted to serve their sentencesserially, the female defendant after the male defendant.SENTENCING for a contempt of court.\nCases referred toMacMillan Bloedel Ltd. v.

[page427]LAX J.: --Introduction[1] On July 16, 2003, Jay Chiang and Christina Chiang, whoare husband and wife, consented to a finding of contempt andacknowledged that they were in breach of six court orders. Theywere given the opportunity to purge their contempt byfulfilling each of a number of undertakings, which in general,required them to disclose and document the transfer ofsignificant amounts of money.[2] In May 2005, Mr. Justice Farley presided over a five-daytrial to determine if Mr. and Mrs. Chiang had fulfilled theundertakings. He concluded and the Chiangs acknowledged thatthe undertakings had not been fulfilled. Although the July 16,2003 order provided for their incarceration if they failed tocomply, they were not incarcerated, but were given a further 90days to comply with the terms of the order and purge theircontempt.[3] On or about August 2005, Mr. and Mrs. Chiang providedadditional information and documents in purported compliancewith the contempt order. The plaintiffs disputed theircompliance and served a motion for a declaration and findingthat Jay Chiang and Christina Chiang have not complied withcertain of the undertakings, have failed to disclose and/orprovide documentation relating to the various transfers ofmoney, that they remain in contempt of the six court orders andof the July 16, 2003 order, and that they each be incarceratedfor a period of one year, beginning with Jay Chiang followed byChristina Chiang.[4] The plaintiffs' motion was adjourned several times and bythe time it came on for hearing, Mr. Justice Farley hadretired. As a result of procedural and scheduling orders, themotion proceeded as a summary trial before me commencingFebruary 12, 2007 and extending over seven days. I determinedthat Mr. and Mrs. Chiang had not fulfilled the undertakingsthat were in issue at the trial and had not purged theircontempt. I found that they had failed to disclose thewhereabouts of significant sums of money, that they continue tohide their assets and that they use nominees to hold theirassets. I granted the declaratory relief requested by theplaintiffs.[5] The facts giving rise to the 2003 contempt hearing, theevidence at the 2005 and 2007 \"purge contempt\" trials and theconduct of the Chiangs that gave rise to my findings areelaborated in written reasons for judgment. [See Note 1 below]This evidence will be referred to as necessary, but will not berepeated. [page428]Sentencing Hearing[6] On May 2, 2007, the parties made submissions on theappropriate sanction to be imposed. It is the position of theplaintiffs that a custodial sentence is required and they askme to impose a penalty of one year's imprisonment each, to beserved consecutively. They also request an order that followingMr. and Mrs. Chiangs' release, the court provide furtherdirections to the parties, upon further evidence andsubmissions.[7] It is the position of the Chiangs that the terms of theorder of July 16, 2003 do not permit the imposition of asentence of greater than one week each, to be servedconsecutively. They submit that this is in any event anappropriate sentence in the circumstances. If I concludeotherwise, they ask me to consider the imposition of a lesserand conditional sentence on Mrs. Chiang. The parties are inagreement that any custodial sentences that may be imposedshould be served at different times so as to minimize theimpact on their two school-age children.Effect of July 16, 2003 Order[8] It is appropriate to first address the Chiangs' primarysubmission, namely that the legal effect of the July 16, 2003order is to limit the sanction that may be imposed. Therelevant provisions read:1. THIS COURT ORDERS, DECLARES AND FINDS that Jay Chiangand Christina Chiang are each in contempt of the ordersof this Court dated September 28, 1999, November 1,1999, September 22, 2000, October 5, 2000, May 7, 2003and June 24, 2003;2. THIS COURT ORDERS THAT Jay Chiang and Christina Chiangshall be given the opportunity to purge their contemptby apologizing to the court and complying with each ofthe undertakings at Schedule \"A\" hereto (the\"undertakings\").3. THIS COURT ORDERS THAT(a) failing the fulfillment of each of the undertakingswithin 90 days hereof, each of Jay Chiang andChristina Chiang shall be incarcerated for a periodof seven days, to be served consecutively,beginning with Jay Chiang, followed by ChristinaChiang.(b) If there is a finding that the undertakings havenot been fulfilled, then after the aboveincarceration, Jay Chiang and Christina Chiang willhave a further period of time in which to purgetheir continuing contempt (the length of suchadditional time to be then determined at a furtherhearing).(c) If this Court then finds that Jay Chiang and/orChristina Chiang have still not purged theircontempt by the conclusion of the additional timereferred to in paragraph 3(b) above, then they maybe incarcerated for a further period of time, ifsame is then warranted, as determined at thatfurther hearing. [page429][9] The Chiangs submit there is no legal basis for imposing alengthier period of incarceration than the one-week periodprovided in para. 3(a) of the order. They say that I am obligedto strictly follow the language of the order, although Mr.Justice Farley did not do this when he granted the Chiangs theindulgence of a lengthier period for compliance thancontemplated by the order. Mr. Curry described this as\"tinkering\" with the order by enlarging the number of daysfor compliance. If this is so, then Mr. Justice Farley also\"tinkered\" with the order by relieving the Chiangs of thepenal provision. If the order is to be given the strictinterpretation advanced, Mr. Justice Farley, having found non-compliance, was required to incarcerate the Chiangs for oneweek each. Not surprisingly, the Chiangs made no complaint atany time that they were not incarcerated for one week each asprovided in para. 3(a) of the order.[10] Importantly to the issue at hand, Mr. Justice Farleysaid this in his reasons for judgment:[The Chiangs] will have the opportunity of fully purgingtheir contempt by having a further 90 days. That is hardlyout of the ordinary with respect to purging of contemptmatters. But I must caution them that they should not takethat extension as being leniency and nor should they expectsimilar treatment if they have not fully complied with theircontempt to purge it within the next 90 days.. . . . .With respect to the sincerity of apologies, I trust that theapology was sincere but the proof of that will be in theeating of the pudding, not in their words. And if I determinelater that there is no effective compliance with purging ofthe contempt or the fulfillment of the undertakings in anyway then I would have to assume that the apologies wereinsincere, hollow, and in fact, making a mockery of thesystem of justice. And therefore would have to be severelydealt with.[11] The underlying premise of the 2003 order, which wascarefully crafted, was: (a) to encourage the Chiangs throughfulfillment of the undertakings to purge their contempt; and,(b) to coerce them through the prospect of incarceration ifthey did not. In submissions, Mr. Blumenfeld characterized whatMr. Justice Farley did in 2005 as a \"carrot and stick\"approach. This is an apt characterization. He extended the timefor the Chiangs to answer the undertakings by a further 90 daysbut he also gave the Chiangs a stern warning in the event ofcontinued non-compliance. In effect, he varied para. 3 of theorder by balancing the 90-day extension with a potentially moreserious period of incarceration than the initial seven days inthe order, thereby reopening the remedy that the court couldgrant in a future hearing. This was quite clearly Mr. JusticeFarley's [page430] intent and is reinforced by the followingpassage from the reasons for judgment:There has been a suggestion by Mr. Di Iorio that if there isto be incarceration that it be dealt with on a conditionalsentence basis. That of course will have to be dealt with atsome future time given my order today. I would certainly haveto exercise my discretion appropriately in the circumstancesprevailing at that particular time. But I think it only fairfor Jay and Christina Chiang to appreciate that if I had notgranted them an extension today to purge their contempt Iwould not be inclined to grant a conditional sentence in thecircumstances prevailing now.[12] In argument, Mr. Curry acknowledged that the power topunish for contempt (or, in the circumstances that existed in2005, not to punish) derives from rule 60.11 [of the Rules ofCivil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194] and the inherentjurisdiction of the court. Rule 60.11(5) provides a range ofpenalties that a judge may impose. It states:60.11(5) In disposing of a motion under subrule (1), thejudge may make such order as is just, and where a finding ofcontempt is made, the judge may order that the person incontempt,(a) be imprisoned for such period and on such terms asare just;(b) be imprisoned if the person fails to comply with aterm of the order;(c) pay a fine;(d) do or refrain from doing an act;(e) pay such costs as are just; and(f) comply with any other order that the judgeconsiders necessary.[13] The only sensible way to view what Mr. Justice Farleydid in 2005 is to view it as an exercise of inherentjurisdiction to control the court's process by imposing anorder that he considered necessary. He hopefully believed thatby granting the Chiangs an extension of time to comply, theywould comply and this would better serve the ends of justicethan to incarcerate them. This is a view shared by many membersof the judiciary when dealing with cases of civil contempt.There is a reluctance to incarcerate contemnors and it isusually unnecessary to do so. The prospect of incarceration andthe coercive power of the court are almost always sufficient tosecure obedience to the court process.[14] The 2003 \"purge contempt\" order was fashioned by theparties and approved by the court. It was the court'sexpectation that Mr. and Mrs. Chiang would comply with itsterms. This was also the court's expectation in 2005 when theorder was varied and a larger stick was held over the Chiangs'head. It is clear [page431] from the transcript of the 2005trial proceedings before Mr. Justice Farley that it was theChiangs who, through counsel, requested more time to fullycomply with the undertakings because on their argument,accepted by Mr. Justice Farley, there had been some compliance.Having in effect requested an amendment to the order in 2005which was granted, having been relieved of the penal provisionfor non-compliance, and it having been found in 2005 and againin 2007 that they had yet to comply with many of theundertakings, it does not lie in the Chiangs' mouths to nowassert that the court is confined to the remedy contemplated in2003 when the order was made.[15] It would be an inefficient use of judicial resources forthe courts to have gone through two trials addressingcompliance with the undertakings, made findings on bothoccasions that many undertakings remain unanswered and for thepenalty to be limited to seven days after which the wholeprocess would begin again. This would not only undermine theauthority of the court to control its process, but would invitethose who choose to disobey the law to continue to do so. Mr.and Mrs. Chiang cannot rely on the court's leniency in 2005 tolimit the court's discretion. The Chiangs have had almost fouryears from the date of the contempt order to demonstrate theirobedience to court orders. Their failure to do this in 2005 didnot deprive the court then of the ability to vary the order inlight of the circumstances that existed at that time. The courtis not deprived now of the ability to impose a sanction that isappropriate to the circumstances that exist today.The Contempt Power[16] The contempt power is used to vindicate the rule of lawand the administration of justice. As others have explained itsrationale with great eloquence, I will simply repeat some ofthese comments.[17] In 1992, Chief Justice McLachlin said:Both civil and criminal contempt of court rest on the powerof the court to uphold its dignity and process. The rule oflaw is at the heart of our society; without it there can beneither peace, nor order nor good government. The rule of lawis directly dependent on the ability of the courts to enforcetheir process and maintain their dignity and respect. Tomaintain their process and respect, courts since the 12thcentury have exercised the power to punish for contempt ofcourt.[See Note 2 below] [page432][18] Also in 1992, Mr. Justice Blair made the followingstatement, which is frequently quoted:No society which believes in a system of even-handed justicecan permit its members to ignore, disobey, or defy its lawsand its courts' orders at their whim because in their ownparticular view it is right to do so. A society whichcountenances such conduct is a society tottering on theprecipice of disorder and injustice. [See Note 3 below][19] More recently, in 2003, Mr. Justice Cumming emphasizedthe importance of obedience to court orders to society as awhole as it relates to commercial disputes. He said:It is integral to a free and democratic society like Canadathat citizens act pursuant to and under the rule of law.Court orders in force must be respected and followed. Thedeliberate failure to obey a court order strikes at the veryheart of the administration of justice. This includes courtorders relating to commercial matters as seen in the case athand. If someone can simply ignore or finesse his way arounda court order it will tend to add uncertainties and risks,with consequential inefficiencies and additional costs, aswell as causing unfairness with consequential inequities andadditional costs, to the commercial marketplace. Just as awhite collar crime is crime, white collar contempt iscontempt.If the remedies a court directs to be put in place throughits orders can be ignored with impunity, the road to civilanarchy is close at hand. The thin veil of civilization thatcloaks our community through the rule of law is fragile, inneed of constant protection, and in need of being seen by allmembers of the community to be constantly protected. [See Note4 below]Contempt Findings[20] On the motion for contempt in 2003, the plaintiffspresented substantial evidence of large sums of moneytransferred by Mr. and Mrs. Chiang to related parties, whichwas not controverted. The parties filed facta, motion recordsand various transcripts. The essential facts and allegations ofcontempt were set out with specificity in the plaintiffs'notice of motion and factum with references to the relevantevidence. By consenting to the finding of contempt, the Chiangsaccepted these facts as having been proven beyond a reasonabledoubt. No submissions to the contrary were advanced on thesentencing hearing. Under s. 724(1) of the Criminal Code,R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, a court may accept as proved anyinformation disclosed at the trial or at the sentencinghearing. [page433][21] Mr. and Mrs. Chiang were found in contempt of six courtorders which are summarized below:September 28, 1999(i) Mr. Justice Ferrier ordered Jay and Christina Chiang toproduce documents as listed in Schedule \"C\" to the orderand to attend for examinations on fixed dates.November 1, 1999(ii) When the documents were not produced and Mr. and Mrs.Chiang did not attend examinations, Mr. Justice Farleygranted a further order that the Chiangs produce documentsand attend for examinations or answer for contempt motions.Mr. Chiang was ordered not to leave Toronto before theseexaminations.September 22, 2000(iii) This order of Mr. Justice Farley contained both an AntonPiller order and a Mareva order. Paragraph 9 of that orderimposed an obligation on the Chiangs, and others, toimmediately hand over to the plaintiffs' solicitors alldocuments in their possession or control which relate tothe business and property of any of the Chiang defendants,the causes of Jay Chiang's bankruptcy and the dispositionof his property.October 5, 2000(iv) The order of Madam Justice Swinton continued the order ofMr. Justice Farley with some amendments which are notgermane, except that the information Mr. and Mrs. Chiangwere to disclose in their affidavit of assets was clarifiedto include accounts over which the Chiangs had a power ofattorney.May 7, 2003(v) This was a disclosure order of Mr. Justice Farley requiringMrs. Chiang to produce various banking records in Taiwanand to answer questions relating to the US$340,507 shewired from Singapore to Taiwan.June 24, 2003(vi) This was a further disclosure order of Mr. Justice Farleyin which Mrs. Chiang consented to provide completeinformation [page434] and documents relating to thewhereabouts of three sums of money totalling overUS$500,000 removed from her accounts, and Jay and ChristinaChiang were ordered to be examined on the pending contemptmotion and to answer all undertakings within five businessdays.[22] Mr. and Mrs. Chiang have not complied with these orders.Sentencing Principles[23] Section 718 of the Criminal Code identifies thefundamental purpose of sentencing and its objectives. In thecontempt context, the prefatory words to s. 718 are pertinent:718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute. . . to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just,peaceful and safe society . . .[24] Under rule 60.11, a judge has broad discretion as to anappropriate sentence once there is a finding of contempt. Thesentencing principles that are to be taken into account overlapto some extent with sentencing principles in the criminalcontext and include: proportionality, denunciation, deterrence(general and specific), rehabilitation, the presence ofmitigating and aggravating factors and the promotion of a senseof responsibility and the acknowledgment of the harm down tovictims and the community. [See Note 5 below][25] The primary purpose of sentencing in contemptproceedings is deterrence. It should serve as a disincentive tothose who might contemplate the breach of court orders. Thecourts do not have an army to enforce their orders. If largenumbers of litigants were to disobey court orders, the courtsystem would soon break down. Courts expect parties tovoluntarily comply with its orders and in the vast majority ofcases, they do. This may explain why contempt cases aresomewhat rare and incarceration for civil contempt is evenrarer. There would appear to be only a handful of reportedcases in the commercial law context where custodial sentenceshave been imposed. I will return to these later in consideringthe appropriate sentence. I turn now to the sentencing factorsto be considered as they apply to the Chiangs' conduct.Gravity of the conduct[26] A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of theoffence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. Manyof the factual issues addressed at the 2007 trial areinterwoven with the acts of contempt admitted to by Mr. andMrs. Chiang at [page435] the 2003 hearing. A major objective ofthe orders that gave rise to the finding of contempt was toprovide disclosure to the plaintiffs of Mr. Chiang's businessactivities. As a bankrupt, Mr. Chiang had, in any event, astatutory obligation under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act,R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 to provide disclosure to his bankruptcytrustee, one of the plaintiffs in this action.[27] The 1999 orders of Ferrier J. and Farley J. required theChiangs to produce documents relating to their business andfinancial affairs. These documents included all books andrecords of corporations in which Jay Chiang had been anemployee, director or officer or shareholder or beneficialowner or one of the controlling or directing minds since 1992.The objective of the orders was frustrated by the misleadingand untruthful evidence of Mr. and Mrs. Chiang, beginning withMr. Chiang's failure to turn over records relating to thetelecom business. His answers during his initial bankruptcyexamination in November 1999 gave no hint of the existence ofthis business and his involvement in it, although it was thengenerating substantial revenues. According to Mr. Chiang'slater evidence, it stopped doing business on September 25,2000, the day the Mareva order was served. By then, millions ofdollars had been transferred out of the business to familymembers and others, the details of which are elaborated in theApril 17, 2007 reasons for judgment.[28] It was clear from the report to the court of HelenDaley, the supervising solicitor for the Anton Piller search,that numerous documents were found at Mr. and Mrs. Chiang'sresidence during the search, including documents relating tothe telecom business that ought to have been produced under theorders of Ferrier J. in September 1999 and Farley J. inNovember 1999. Some 15 boxes of records were found there. Tothis day, Mr. Chiang has failed to disclose what happened tothe business or to produce any documents relating to it.[29] The lack of documentary disclosure of any kind enabledthe Chiangs to get away with causing large sums of money theycontrolled to be moved into other people's names in the yearafter the orders. For example:(a) Mr. Chiang testified following the order of Mr. JusticeFerrier: \"I have no credit card at this point in time,\"explaining why he did not produce any credit card recordswithstanding the order. He also said he did not keep anycredit card records. Similarly, Mrs. Chiang swore that shedid not keep credit card statements: \"No, I don't keepthose statements. The only thing I keep records is mychildren's school reports.\" She undertook to provide anysuch credit card [page436] statements, but again answeredthat she did not retain credit card statements. This wasfalse. Mr. and Mrs. Chiang did have credit cards at thetime of their examinations and numerous credit card recordsin respect of eight credit card accounts were found in theChiangs' house during the Anton Piller search.(b) The Chiangs were to produce the books and records,including financial statements and banking records, ofAamazing Technologies. When examined following the initialorders, Mr. Chiang said that (i) a law firm had some of thedocuments (some of which were made available to theplaintiffs), (ii) others were destroyed, and (iii) helooked for other documents and did not find any. In fact,Ms. Daley located substantial Aamazing Technologies'records at the Chiangs' house, including banking records.(c) Similarly, Mrs. Chiang stated that she would do her best tofind the bank statements for the defendant 1204360 OntarioInc., and in answer to that undertaking stated that she didnot have copies of the bank statements. In fact, accountstatements for two of that company's accounts, includingreturned cheques, were located at the Chiangs' house.(d) Both Jay and Christina Chiang claimed that they did notkeep their phone bills which could evidence their businessactivities. Both gave an undertaking to produce phonerecords. Both responded that they did not have copies ofthe phone records, yet substantial phone records were foundduring the search of the Chiangs' house. The order ofFerrier J. required them to produce bank account records.Mr. and Mrs. Chiang each claimed to recall having accountsat only one bank branch. The search of their home, however,disclosed records from 80 accounts with financialinstitutions.[30] Mr. and Mrs. Chiang did not file contrary evidence toexplain or justify their failure to produce the documents Ihave described. As well, they did not attend the examinationson October 7 and 8, 1999 as ordered by Mr. Justice Ferrier.They claimed that this was due to an injury that Mrs. Chiangsuffered on the way to the examination. However, the injury didnot prevent Mrs. Chiang from placing a mortgage on the familyhome precisely at that time. Soon after, the plaintiffs learnedthat money from the judgment debtor Aamazing Technologies wasused to pay for the Chiangs' residence at 10 Cortina Court inRichmond [page437] Hill and in November 1999, they obtained acertificate of pending litigation. By then, the proceeds of themortgage had been delivered to the safekeeping of a Chiangfamily member. Within days of the non-attendances, namely onOctober 13, 1999, Mrs. Chiang wired approximately $600,000 fromthree accounts to an account in Taiwan ostensibly belonging toMr. Chiang's father, Y.C. Chiang.[31] Mrs. Chiang eventually admitted that she did this toprotect \"her\" assets from the plaintiffs. Had the Chiangscomplied with the order of Mr. Justice Ferrier by producing thedocuments required and attending at the examinations, theplaintiffs could have sought and obtained protective orders toprevent about $1.675 million from being wired to Taiwan.Instead, other than a small amount paid in 2005 for a costsorder, none of this money has been paid to the plaintiffs.Undertaking 11 gave the Chiangs the opportunity to purge theircontempt by disclosing the whereabouts of this money. They didnot do this.[32] The Mareva order of September 22, 2000 had two functions-- disclosure and a prohibition on dealing with assets. TheChiangs' response was to see what they could get away with. Mr.Chiang admitted to emptying his safety deposit box the dayafter the Mareva order was served. Mrs. Chiang admitted toflying to Singapore on the day the Mareva order was served andwiring money from her accounts in Singapore to her mother'saccount in Taiwan. She was initially untruthful under oathclaiming that she could not remember going to Singapore ormeeting with bankers. Mrs. Chiang also had accounts in her namein Taiwan and she removed money from these accounts almostimmediately after the Mareva order.[33] The May 7, 2003 and June 24, 2003 orders required Mrs.Chiang to produce documents and information as to thewhereabouts of sums withdrawn from her accounts. Mrs. Chiangconsented to the June 24, 2003 order and acknowledged in anexamination shortly before the contempt hearing that sheunderstood the scope of the disclosure that she had beenordered to make. Nonetheless, she testified on that examinationthat her mother had withdrawn the money from her account usingher \"chop\". When asked what happened to the money, she gavethese answers:1077 Q. What did she say she did with that money?A. She told me she spent part of money.1078 Q. She said she spent part of it?A. Yeah.1079 Q. And what about the rest of it?A. She didn't tell me where is the rest of it. [page438]1080 Q. And you asked her where the rest of it is?A. No, I didn't. Because that's her own money, I don'task. The more I know the more I get in trouble. If Iknow, I have to tell you, right? So I rather notknowing [sic].[34] She was also asked on her examination on July 3, 2003just weeks before the contempt hearing about the money wired toY.C. Chiang and gave these answers:1098 Q. So coming back to the $1.1 million [being the$600,000 CDN and USD $340,000] that you wired out toY.C. Chiang in October 1999 and February 2000, did youever have any understanding from Y.C. Chiang or fromyour husband or anyone else as to what was done withthat money, what happened with that money?A. No. I don't know.1099 Q. Can you find out?A. No. I don't want to find out. . . . Because that'snot my money anymore.[35] It was immediately after giving this evidence that Mr.and Mrs. Chiang travelled to California with their children andmet with Mr. Chiang's parents and other family members todiscuss how the family would \"come together\" to deal with thepending contempt motion on July 16, 2003. The April 17, 2007reasons for judgment are in error in referring to this meeting[having] taken place on the eve of the 2005 trial.[36] There was substantial evidence on the contempt motionthat the Chiangs received money from their parents and hadexpenses paid after the Mareva order by their parents, who arealso bound by the order. They also used credit cards that theywere prohibited from using under the Mareva order. For example,Mrs. Chiang charged her trip to Singapore to a TD Bank creditcard, listed on a schedule to the Mareva order. She continuedto use this card until May 2001. Mr. Chiang used a Bank ofAmerica Visa card for several trips to Hong Kong and Beijing in2002. Three days before the Chiang family left on a trip toAruba in August 2002, Mrs. Chiang deposed in an affidavit thatcertain of her actions in violation of the Mareva order(including the use of credit cards) were unintentional andthat \"my husband and I have nothing to hide\". Although subjectto an order that limited the use of their assets, Mr. Chiangpaid over $5,000 in cash for the Aruba trip, claiming the moneycame from his father. The balance of $4,500 was charged to aBank of America Visa card on which he was a cardholder with hisparents.[37] In an affidavit sworn November 14, 2000 and filed on amotion to set aside the Mareva order, Mrs. Chiang stated:\"Neither [page439] my husband nor I currently have a sourceof income. We have been relying on my assets to pay for ourliving expenses and our legal expenses. The injunction ordersmake it impossible for us to live normal lives\". When JayChiang was examined in bankruptcy on November 23, 2000, herefused to answer a number of questions about his gamblingactivities. When examined in February 2001, however, heindicated that the last time he had gambled was in Las Vegas inFebruary 2000, or possibly in Macao. Thereafter the plaintiffsobtained documents from Casino Rama. They indicate that JayChiang gambled $181,450 at that casino, including over $20,000during three trips in November 2000, after the date of theMareva order and around the time he was examined and Mrs.Chiang swore the affidavit. When confronted with this, he gaveconflicting and questionable evidence as to the source of thismoney.[38] Mr. and Mrs. Chiang have repeatedly breached andfrustrated the court orders. They have consistently underminedthe objectives of the orders in order to shield their assets.Their contempt is blatant, deliberate, wilful, and as I willcome to, unrepentant. The gravity of their conduct iscompounded by the repeated acts of contempt and the largenumber of orders breached, which have had serious adverse andprejudicial consequences for the plaintiffs and has impairedthe dignity and integrity of the justice system. The gravity oftheir offence is significant.Mitigating factors[39] An apology can be a demonstration of contrition and ofremorse and considered as a mitigating factor in sentencing.The Chiangs made an apology to the court, which is recited inthe order of July 16, 2003. Mr. Justice Farley commented on theapology in his reasons for judgment and I have earlier referredto this. He invited the Chiangs to demonstrate by their conductthat their apology was sincerely given. At the 2007 trial, Mr.and Mrs. Chiang asserted that the order of July 16, 2003 markeda turning point in their conduct and referred to the apology asevidence of this. I found that the contempt order did not marka turning point in the Chiangs' conduct, that theircontemptuous conduct persisted long after this, and that theirapology was a hollow and insincere one. In these circumstances,their apology cannot be considered a mitigating factor.[40] It is submitted that some credit should be given to themfor having given the undertakings and having consented to thefinding of contempt. With respect to the undertakings, it istrue that some of the undertakings were fulfilled by the timeof the [page440] 2005 trial. I found that none of theundertakings that were in issue at the 2007 trial had beenfulfilled and that the Chiangs had selectively complied to givethe appearance of compliance. The giving of the undertakingswithout more is not a mitigating factor as the undertakingswere granted as an indulgence to Mr. and Mrs. Chiang to purgetheir contempt. The order required Mr. and Mrs. Chiang tocomply with each of the undertakings. In view of this, theChiangs' compliance with some of the undertakings is greatlydiminished as a mitigating factor. Their assets remain hiddenand disclosure has not been made.[41] A plea of guilty is a factor that may be taken intoaccount in mitigation of sentence. In appropriatecircumstances, it represents an acknowledgment and acceptanceof responsibility for conduct, an important first step, it issaid, in the process of rehabilitation. However, it has alsobeen said:. . . the mitigating influence of a plea of guilty should beseen as operating upon a continuum. The precise weight to beattributed to it is incapable of exact calibration. It is avariable, not a constant. In general terms, the earlier theplea, the greater the indication of remorse, the saving ofexpense and inconvenience, hence the impact in mitigation.Later pleas of guilty are often but acquiescence to theinevitable, a realization that guilt is or will be plainlyestablished. [See Note 6 below][42] In my view, this is a case where the consent to thefinding of contempt cannot be seen as an act of contrition andmust be seen as one where the Chiangs acquiesced due to theoverwhelming evidence of their dishonesty that demonstrated,among other things, that they had lied during examinations,sworn false affidavits, transferred large sums of money fromtheir accounts, provided no meaningful disclosure, dissipatedassets by gambling, by unauthorized use of credit cards fortravel, and by removal of the contents of safety deposit boxes.They were clearly in contravention of the six court orders. Thefinding of contempt was inevitable and their consent was purelytactical.[43] Mitigating factors are to be proved on a balance ofprobabilities. [See Note 7 below] On the morning of thesentencing hearing, the Chiangs provided signed authorizationsto the plaintiffs to allow them to access directly fromgovernmental authorities in Canada and Taiwan some of thedocuments that they have been seeking. The plaintiffs have beenrequesting this since at least June 2005. The plaintiffs havealso been requesting authorizations from [page441] Mrs. Chiang'smother, Tsai, and her sister, Su Feng. Both are subject to theMareva order and my reasons for judgment describe theircomplicity in the hiding of the Chiangs' assets. To myknowledge, these authorizations have not been provided. In viewof the Chiang's record of selective compliance, much more thanthe last-minute delivery of authorizations is required of them.It remains to be seen whether this is a step towardsrehabilitation or yet another example of selective compliance.The delivery of the authorizations has not been proved as amitigating factor.[44] Finally, the consent to the finding of contempt did notresult in any real saving in expense and inconvenience. Mr.Chiang has acknowledged that this was not seriously in disputeat the contempt hearing. What was in dispute and the subject ofnegotiation were the undertakings, which to this day largelyremain unfulfilled. There have been two trials to determinethis and numerous interlocutory proceedings. These have beenprotracted and costly. In these circumstances, the consent tothe finding of contempt is not a mitigating factor.Aggravating factors[45] I have already discussed some of the aggravating factorsin this case in considering the gravity of the offence. Theyinclude the following:(a) There was a deliberate course of conduct over a lengthyperiod of time.(b) There were numerous breaches of six court orders.(c) The Chiangs were found in contempt of fresh orders madewhile the contempt motion was pending.(d) The Chiangs have benefited financially from their contemptand have caused extreme prejudice to the plaintiffs.(e) The Chiangs have shown disrespect to the court by lying toit, offering an insincere apology, and giving only theappearance of complying with the courts' orders.(f) The Chiangs have been given numerous opportunities and alengthy period of time to demonstrate their obedience tocourt orders, but continue to act in breach of the courts'orders.(g) The Chiangs have continued with a lifestyle of relativeluxury and comfort in spite of and in defiance of ordersthat restrict the use of their assets. [page442]Deterrence and denunciation[46] I earlier said that the primary goal of sentencing isdeterrence and to this, I would add denunciation as they gohand in hand. Jay Chiang has admitted that approximately $4.6million left the telecom business out of the ordinary course ofbusiness. He has admitted that in the range of US $8 millionwas transferred from accounts or entities controlled by him andhis wife and sent to family members. Based on the knownevidence, the amount is closer to US $10 million. One can onlyspeculate as to the actual amounts because despite thedisclosure and production orders and their undertakings to thecourt, Mr. and Mrs. Chiang have never produced complete bankingrecords and other documents that would show the precise amountsinvolved, where it went and where it is today.[47] Canadian courts have tended to show leniency in cases ofcivil contempt. I noted this in the April 17, 2007 reasons forjudgment by citing the following passage from a report of theCanadian Judicial Council:In Canada punishment for contempt has been quite moderate,reflecting the courts' usual view that a conviction forcontempt and a modest fine is usually sufficient to assert thecourts' authority, to protect their dignity or to ensurecompliance. Often these sentences are imposed after thecontemnor has apologized and purged his or her contempt whichsubstantially mitigates any punishment that might otherwise beimposed. The purpose of sentencing in contempt cases is to\"repair the depreciation of the authority of the court\". [SeeNote 8 below][48] This is not a case deserving of leniency. There are nomitigating factors. There has been no genuine apology and nocompliance. The contempt has not been purged. The conduct ofMr. and Mrs. Chiang must have concrete consequences in order to\"repair the depreciation of the authority of the court\" andto send a message to litigants and the public that this kind ofconduct will not be tolerated. Undertakings given to a courtare to be fulfilled; apologies tendered to a court are to begenuinely remorseful; court orders are to be obeyed in everyrespect. Mr. and Mrs. Chiang have made a mockery of the systemof justice. The prospect of a short period of incarceration didnot deter them in 2003. The strong and denouncing language ofthe court and the prospect of a lengthier period ofincarceration did not deter them in 2005. What then is theappropriate sanction for their conduct? [page443]The Appropriate Sentence[49] I am asked to consider a conditional sentence,particularly for Mrs. Chiang whom, it is submitted, has alesser degree of responsibility. Counsel were able to locateonly one decision, where a conditional sentence was imposed forcivil or criminal contempt. In that case, the contemnor was 84years old and the court expressly stated, \"I do however, inconsideration only of his age, order that the service of thatsentence be conditional.\" [See Note 9 below][50] Cumming J. rejected this kind of order in the case ofMr. Sylvester who was 58 years old with health problems becausesuch an order would be ineffectual in view of his continuingcontempt. Mr. and Mrs. Chiang are 43 and 47 years of age andapparently healthy, but like Mr. Sylvester, they have a dismaltrack record in obeying court orders. There is no reason tobelieve that either would abide by the terms of a conditionalsentence order. To the contrary, the record before the courtsuggests that they almost certainly would not. I accept thatMrs. Chiang has a lesser degree of responsibility as she had noreal involvement in the telecom business. However, aconditional sentence is inappropriate for the reasons I havegiven.[51] I am also asked to take account of the fact that theChiangs are first offenders. Although this is the first timethe Chiangs are to be punished for their contempt, they have,as I have said, a long and woeful record of deliberatedisobedience to the court that began with the very first orderof Ferrier J. on September 28, 1999 and continues. Theimposition of a jail sentence on a first offender is notwithout precedent, particularly for white-collar offenders whofrequently have no prior involvement with the administration ofjustice. Also, it cannot be overlooked that Mr. and Mrs. Chiangconsented to a custodial sentence if they did not comply witheach of their undertakings.[52] The decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal inMacMillan Bloedel Ltd. v. Simpson [See Note 10 below] isinstructive on the issue of custodial sentences for firstoffenders who engage in contemptuous conduct. Although the factsthere were quite different, the sentencing principles are ofgeneral application. In that case, the contemnors were sixaccused who were involved in a protest of logging operations inClayoquot Sound and following a lengthy trial involving a largenumber of other protesters, they were [page444] found guilty ofcriminal contempt and sentenced to 45 days imprisonment. Onappeal as to sentence, it was argued that as they were firstoffenders, the judge erred in imposing a custodial sentence. Inupholding the sentence imposed by the trial judge, the courtmade these comments:[I]t would be naïve to consider these sentences, even forfirst offenders, in isolation from the larger picture ofevents at these blockades. These appellants were not guilty ofyouthful exuberance or rash judgment, which are the usualhallmarks of first offenders. . . . [See Note 11 below]. . . . .Everyone who deliberately disobeys the law must accept therisk that courts will not continue to impose lenientsentences if they have proved ineffective in preserving therule of law.There is no question that the sentences were lawful. . . . Inmy view, it would be impossible to say that even longersentences of from three to six months would be unfit, even forfirst offenders who participated in blockades with anexpectation of being arrested and who, with full knowledge ofthe consequences, and after being warned and asked to desist,chose deliberately to break the law by refusing to obey acourt order. [See Note 12 below][53] It can hardly be said that the Chiangs are guilty ofyouthful exuberance or rash judgment. The Chiangs knew thattheir failure to comply with the undertakings would attractconsequences and that they were subject to periods ofincarceration if there was continuing non-compliance. Acustodial sentence is both appropriate and necessary.[54] I was referred to a number of cases where sentencesranging from 6 to 15 months have been imposed for civil contemptin a commercial context. [See Note 13 below] None of these casesprecisely fits the circumstances here. Sussex perhaps comesclosest, although the wrongdoing here is, in my view, fargreater in scope.[55] The Chiangs rely on the decision of Stinson J. in OakleyManufacturing Inc. v. Bowman, [See Note 14 below] where a periodof incarceration [page445] of 10 days and a fine of $10,000 wasimposed for the breach of an injunction arising from a privatecommercial dispute. There is a world of difference between theOakley case and the facts before me.[56] The Chiangs called Dr. James Power to give evidence atthe sentencing hearing. He is the principal of Upper CanadaCollege where the Chiangs' two sons attend school. He describedthe Chiang children as remarkable, all-around boys -- gifted inmany different ways. Dr. Power was apparently called to testifyas to the impact on the Chiang children if their parents wereincarcerated at the same time. However, the plaintiffs havenever sought this, recognizing that on account of the children,any custodial sentences that may be imposed should be servedconsecutively.[57] Mr. and Mrs. Chiang, please stand as I impose sentence.You testified before me at your trial that you have a greatappreciation for, devotion to and love of family. It istherefore incomprehensible to me why you persist in conductthat has the consequence of interrupting your family life insuch a damaging way. Let there may be no doubt that thepunishment I am about to impose for your wilful and deliberatecontempt results from the choices you have made. You havecaused extreme prejudice to the plaintiffs, but the realvictims here are the justice system and your two sons. You haveshown total disrespect and disregard for the justice system.You have abandoned your responsibility as parents to teach yourchildren to cherish and venerate it. This is what we expect ofcitizens in a civilized society governed by the rule of law.This is what we expect of parents who have the importantresponsibility to provide moral leadership and guidance to thenext generation. Your example is exactly the opposite. It showsno respect for the values that are fundamental to a free anddemocratic society and that all citizens must work vigilantlyto protect. Your example is that it is better to protect one'sassets than to obey the law; that it is better to lie to thecourt and to engage in fraud than to pay a just debt. You havebrought shame on yourselves, but more importantly, you havebrought shame on your children who are entirely innocent inthis matter. They are undeserving of this public humiliationand of the deprivation that these sentences bring to theiryoung lives.[58] It has always been within your power to comply with theorders of this court. I wish to make it clear that thesentences I will impose are to punish you for your disobedienceof the six court orders. Serving these sentences does notrelieve you of your obligation to comply with these orders. Youdo not gain immunity from further punishment if yourcontemptuous conduct persists. [page446][59] Mr. Chiang, I sentence you to imprisonment for a periodof 12 months. Mrs. Chiang, I sentence you to imprisonment for aperiod of eight months. Mrs. Chiang's sentence will be servedimmediately following Mr. Chiang's release, subject to this. Idirect that upon Mr. Chiang's release, Mr. and Mrs. Chiang bebrought before me. If I am satisfied that each of theundertakings have been fulfilled, I will at that time givefurther consideration to Mrs. Chiang's sentence and inparticular whether it is appropriate to provide for her earlierrelease. Mr. and Mrs. Chiang are both to be taken into custody,but Mrs. Chiang is to be released and her committal ispostponed to a future hearing on a date to be determined.[60] My order prohibiting Mr. and Mrs. Chiang from leavingthe jurisdiction of Ontario is continued. The Chiangs' traveldocuments are to remain in the custody of Mr. Blumenfeldpending further court order. Costs will be addressed by writtensubmissions.Order accordingly.Notes----------------Note 1: [2007] O.J. No. 1409, 156 A.C.W.S. (3d) 812 (S.C.J.).Note 2: United Nurses of Alberta v.

Wilkie of the Ontario Court of Justice.ENDORSEMENT[1]The appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of\nconspiracy to traffic cocaine arising from an investigation into drug\ntrafficking activities in the Niagara region by a group called the Black\nPistons Motorcycle Club.He was sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment, less 8\nmonths credit for pre-sentence custody.[2]With the assistance of duty counsel, he appeals\nagainst sentence on two grounds.He submits that the sentencing judge erred:1.by imposing a demonstrably unfit sentence that was outside the range\nand failed to take into account the appellant’s prospects for rehabilitation;\nand2.by failing to give credit for the full period of time that the\nappellant spent on an immigration detention.[3]We do not accept these submissions.The First Ground of Appeal[4]The sentence that was imposed was fit and within\nthe range.This court has indicated that the range of sentence for this type\nof offence is from 6 months to 2 years: R. v. Woolcock, [2002] O.J.\nNo. 4927 (C.A.), at para. 15.The quantity involved in this case was 28 grams\nof cocaine, which places the offence at the high end of the range.Furthermore, the appellant had a criminal record that included a prior\nconviction for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and two\nfurther convictions for possession of cocaine.In addition, although the\nappellant was not a member of the Black Pistons Motorcycle Club, he had an\nongoing relationship with it.Thus, as the sentencing judge found, there was a\nlink between this offence and a “larger semi-organised commercial enterprise.”[5]Moreover, the sentencing judge expressly took\ninto consideration the appellant’s prospects for rehabilitation.Although he\nconsidered there to be only a “glimmer of rehabilitative potential”, given the\nappellant’s history, he was aware that the appellant had broken away from his\nco-conspirators and left behind that negative peer group by moving to Calgary\nto live with his father and work in his father’s business.The Second Ground of Appeal[6]After the appellant was granted bail on this\nmatter, he was placed in immigration detention for seven and a half months.The sentencing judge gave the appellant full credit for the time that the\nappellant spent in pre-sentence custody for this offence but only two months’ credit\nfor the seven and a half months of immigration detention.[7]The sentencing judge fully addressed the issue\nof how much credit should be given for the immigration detention.He noted\nthat sentencing had been adjourned on a number of occasions to accommodate the\nappellant’s personal issues, including obtaining information regarding his\nimmigration status.He referred to the information that he had received on the\nmatter and concluded that it was “clear” that the immigration detention was\ntriggered by factors unrelated to the charge for which the appellant was being\nsentenced.He explained that the appellant’s application for permanent\nresidence had been refused on the ground of serious criminality the year before\nthe charges before the court arose.He indicated that it seemed “logical” to\nassume that the appellant’s outstanding bail on this charge would have made it\nharder for the appellant to satisfy his onus in obtaining bail on the\nimmigration detention, but stated that the defence had led no evidence on that\nmatter.Recognizing that the impact was “speculative”, the sentencing judge\nexercised his discretion and gave the appellant two months’ credit for the\nperiod of immigration detention.[8]In the circumstances, we see no basis for\ninterfering with the sentencing judge’s exercise of discretion.Disposition[9]For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.“K.

HaliburtonSUBJECT:Appeal\nfrom SentenceDECISION:The\n2nd day of June, A.D. 1997COUNSEL:Timothy\nD. Landry, Esq., for the AppellantPaul B. Scovil, Esq., for the RespondentDECISION ON APPEALPublishers\nof this case please take note that\ns.38(1) of the Young Offenders Act applies and may require editing of\nthis judgment or its heading before publication. Section 38(1) provides:\"38(1) No person shall publish by any means any\nreport(a) of an offence committed or alleged to have been\ncommitted by a young person, unless an order has been made under section 16\nwith respect thereto, or(b) of a hearing, adjudication, disposition or\nappeal concerning a young person who committed or is alleged to have committed\nan offencein which the name of the young person, a child or a\nyoung person aggrieved by the offence or a child or a young person who appeared\nas a witness in connection with the offence, or in which any information\nserving to identify such young per­son or child, is disclosed.\"HALIBURTON, J.:This\nis an appeal from a sentence imposed on a young offender for the offence that\nhe didwhile being bound by an Order of Disposition made by\nThe Honourable Judge J. Comeau, a Judge of the Youth Court, On December 6,\n1995, wilfully fail to comply with a condition of such order, to wit: \"Pay\na fine in the sum of Two Hundred ($200.00) Dollars to be paid no later than\nJune 6, 1996\", contrary to Section 26 of the Young Offenders Act.Tie\nYouth Court Judge imposed a sentence which was substantially different from\nthat jointly recommended by Crown and Defence Counsel. The Appellant raises the\nfollowing issues:1.Did the learned Trial\nJudge err in law by imposing a sentence that is harsh and excessive having\nregard to the circumstances of the offense and that (sic) character and\ncircumstances of the Appellant?2.Did the learned Trial\nJudge err in law by imposing a sentence that is harsh and excessive having\nregard to the sentences usually imposed in such cases?3.Did the learned Trial\nJudge err in law by rejecting a joint recommendation of Crown and defense\ncounsel without noting legal rationale behind his decision?The\nbackground facts are related in the submissions of Counsel.On\nDecember 6th, 1995, the Appellant had been convicted and sentenced for the\noffence of fishing for lobsters when the season was closed, contrary to Section\n57(1) of the Atlantic Fishery Regulations. (I am advised that he is\npresently 17 years of age.) For that offence, he was fined $200 and given six\nmonths to pay. The fine was due and payable on the 6th of June, 1996.This\nproceeding was initiated on August 30th, 1996, when the Appellant was charged\nwith wilfully failing to comply with that Order; that is, failing to pay the\nfine on the stipulated date.On\nDecember 4th, 1996, he entered a plea of guilty to that charge and a joint\nrecommendation was made to the Court that he be placed on three months\nprobation and ordered to perform 40 hours of community service.The\nJudge imposed the recommended three months of probation but ordered the\nAppellant to perform 100 hours of community service within 12 months.From\nthe transcript, some further information is to be gleaned; specifically, that\nhe was, on that same day before the Court, charged with a separate offence of\nbreaching a condition of a Probation Order in failing to obey school rules and\na date was set for a hearing on that matter.There\nare further facts set forth in the Appellant's brief, which arc not disputed by\nthe Crown, with respect to the background of the joint recommendation. The\nAppellant says:On December 6th, 1995 the offender was sentence(d)\nto a $200 fine for illegal lobstering. He was given 7 months to pay that fine\nand it was to be due and payable by June 6th, 1996. On May 8th, 1996 the\noffender was sentenced on unrelated natters to the Nova Scotia Youth Centre at\nWaterville, Nova Scotia. The fine had not yet been paid and when he was\nreleased from custody has still not yet been paid. The Crown in discussion with\ndefense, took into consideration that this individual with no steady employment\nand the fact that he had been incarcerated for nearly the final month prior to\nthe fine becoming due. While this was clearly not a defense to the charge of\nfailing to obey a Court Order it was certainly a mitigating fact and therefore\nthe Crown recommended that he be given an opportunity to work the fine off. The\naccused would be permitted to work the fine off on Community Service. Individuals\nwho work fine off in the Province of Nova Scotia under the Fine Options Program\ndo so at the minimum wage rate. The fine in this case was $200 and it was\nsuggested by Crown that 40 hours of Community Service at $5.00 per hour would\nequal the $200 owing. By imposing 100 hours of Community Service for failing to\npay a $200 fine the learned trial Judge was simply going to credit the offender\nwith $2.00 per hour for his work.The\nmessage comes through that this young man was no stranger to the Youth Court.\nIt must be observed that the record does not reflect any inquiries by the Youth\nCourt Judge, nor does it reflect any information provided to him with respect\nto the reasons for the offender's failure to pay the fine; that is, either\nimpecuniosity or lack of employment. There is no indication of the Appellant's\nwillingness to perform community service, nor of an opportunity for such work\nto be performed. The young offender was not invited to make any comments before\nthe sentence was imposed. The Judge did not offer any reasons for his refusal\nto accept the joint recommendation, nor any explanation as to the\nconsiderations being taken into account in imposing the sentence which he did.JURISDICTION OF THIS COURTThe\nYoung Offenders Act, Section 27(1. 1) states:27 (1.1)\nAn appeal lies under this Act in respect of an offence punishable on summary\nconviction or an offence that the Attorney General or his agent elects to\nproceed with as an offence punishable on summary conviction in accordance will\npart XXVII of the Criminal Code, which Part applies with such\nmodifications as the circumstances require.Under\nthat part of the Criminal Code in Section 812(c), the Criminal Code provides:812For\nthe purposes of section 813 to 828 \"appeal court\" means(c) in the Provinces of Nova Scotia and British\nColumbia, the Supreme Court;The\npowers of this Court as a Court of Appeal relevant to this application are to\nbe found at Section 822(6) of the Criminal Code which provides:822 (6)\nWhere an appeal is taken under subsection (4) against sentence, the appeal\ncourt shall, unless the sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of\nthe sentence appealed against and may, on such evidence, if any, as it thinks\nfit to require or receive, by order,(a) dismiss the appeal, or(b) vary the sentence within the limits prescribed\nby law for the offence of which the defendant was convicted;and in making any order under paragraph (b) the\nappeal court may take into account any time spent in custody by the defendant\nas a result of the offence.The\nYoung Offenders Act established a regime which is set out under the\nheading \"Declaration of Principle\" and reflected in Section 3 of the\nAct. It expresses the philosophy that young persons must be held accountable,\nbut places a clear emphasis on reformation and rehabilitation, a recognition\nthat young offenders have special needs and require guidance and assistance,\nand mandates the protection of society by imposing the \"least possible\ninterference with freedom that is consistent with\" such protection.Section\n20 of the Act deals specifically with \"dispositions\". The disposition\nprovisions reflect the values enunciated in Section 3 and requires the\nYouth Court to consider any representations made by the parties or their\nCounsel. An Order to perform a community service as one aspect of a disposition\nis authorized by Section 20(1)(g).Two\nother subsections of Section 20 appear to me to be relevant to the disposition\nof this appeal. Section 20(6) provides20 (6)Where\na youth court makes a disposition under this section, it shall state its\nreasons therefor in the record of the case and shall...And\n20(7):20 (7)No\ndisposition shall be made in respect of a young person under this section that\nresults in a punishment that is greater than the maximum punishment that\nwould be applicable to an adult who has committed the same offence.(My emphasis added)The\nYouth Court was obliged to take into consideration the following provisions\nfrom Section 21:21 (1)The\nyouth court shall, in imposing a fine on a young person ...have regard to the\npresent and future means of the young person to pay.21 (2)A\nyoung person against whom a fine is imposed under paragraph 20(1)(b) may\ndischarge the fine in whole or in part by earning credits for work performed...21 (7)No\norder may be made under paragraph 20(1)(f) or (g) unless the youth court(a) is satisfied that the young person against whom\nthe order is made is a suitable candidate for such an order; and(b) is satisfied that the order does not interfere\nwith the normal hours of work or education of the young person.DISPOSITIONThe\nAppellant's Counsel has argued that the sentence imposed by the Family Court\nJudge was harsh and excessive. Crown Counsel, in his response, rejects that\nproposition and argues that the sentence is within a fit and proper range,\ngiven the character and the circumstances of the Accused and having regard to\nsentences normally imposed in such cases. Crown Counsel, on the other hand, is\nsupportive of the third ground of appeal that the Learned Trial Judge committed\nan error in law when he rejected the joint recommendation without expressing\nhis reasons therefor.In\nview of the position taken with respect to the third issue, it is unnecessary,\non this appeal, to explore whether or not the sentence as such was fit and\nproper in the circumstances.\"Did\nthe Learned Trial Judge err in law by rejecting a joint recommendation of Crown\nand Defence Counsel without noting (the) legal rationale behind his\ndecision\" and without giving reasons? I accept the arguments advanced by\nthe Appellant and conclude that the Youth Court Judge, did, in fact, commit an\nerror in law and that the appeal should be allowed and that the Appellant\nshould succeed on this ground. The cases cited by the Appellant set forth the\napplicable law as I understand it. In R. v. Machek (1994), 1994 CanLII 3962 (NS CA), 136 N.S.R.\n(2d) 195 (N.S.C.A.), the Court rejected the appeal while stating at paragraph\n11:\"The power of a trial judge to impose sentence\ncannot be limited by the submission of Crown counsel or a joint submission\nresulting from a plea bargain. If the trial ,judge has not otherwise erred in\napplying the principles of sentencing, this court should not disturb the\ndisposition imposed merely because it does not accord with such submissions\nmade to the judge.\"The\nconsideration to be given to a joint submission was discussed by the Alberta\nCourt of Appeal in R. v. Carder (1995), 174 Alberta Reports 212, ill the\nfollowing terms al paragraph 4:\"Because this case involves a joint submission,\nwe therefore are forced to consider the line of authority that has been argued\non behalf of Mr. Carder to the effect that the court should only refuse to\nadopt a joint submission where the court is satisfied that the submission is\nunfit. Although the crimes here were serious and certainly could attract a\nsentence much in excess of 18 months in other circumstances, having in mind the\njoint submission, we cannot say that the joint submission made by Crown and\ndefense at trial of a sentence of six months was totally unfit.\"In\ngiving effect to a joint submission, the Manitoba Court of Appeal commented in R.\nv. Pashe (1995), 1995 CanLII 6256 (MB CA), 100 Manitoba Reports (2d) 61, paragraph 12:\"The sentencing judge is not bound to accept a\nrecommendation, but it should not be rejected unless there is a good cause for\ndoing so ......Again,\nreferring to a Nova Scotia decision, our Court of Appeal, in R. v. Boudreau (1996),\n1996 CanLII 5573 (NS CA), 148 N.S.R. (2d) 202, the joint recommendation was adopted on the appeal in\nplace of the sentence imposed by the sentencing court. At paragraph 8 of the\nreported case, the Court stated:\"The sentences were in our view inadequate,\nconsidering the nature of the offenses and the extent of the damages and\ngiven the failure of the trial judge to give reasons for not accepting the\njoint recommendation, which in itself would have been a lenient sentence.\"(My emphasis added)The\nlaw cited in these various cases does not relate specifically to young\noffenders but is, nonetheless, applicable. Since this is a young offender's\ncase, in addition to the normal considerations which are reflected in the cases\ncited to the Court, there are the special considerations which are mandated by\nthe Young Offenders Act. The transcript does not reflect any inquiry to\ndetermine whether the Appellant was a suitable candidate for community service,\nwhether there were opportunities available to perform such service, nor was any\ninquiry or representation made with respect to whether performing such service\nwould interfere with either his work or his education. While the Appellant\nentered a plea of guilty to \"wilfully failing to comply\" with\nthe Order to pay his fine within the time prescribed, no discussion was\napparently had with respect to the reasons for his failure to pay, his\nimpecuniosity or otherwise, or, if you will, the degree of his\n\"wilfulness\". It appears that Counsel had agreed and recommended a\nconversion of the monetary fine to equivalent community service based on values\nattributed in adult court. If that position is correct, and if an adult would\nhave faced an Order for 40 hours of community service, then it would seem to be\ncontrary to the spirit of Section 20(7) which provides that punishment for a\nyoung offender will not be greater than that for an adult.Finally,\nto return to my point of departure in this disposition, Section 20(6)\nspecifically requires that: \"Where a youth court makes a disposition...it shall\nstate its reasons therefor in the record of' the case...\". This the\nTrial Judge did not do.In\nfailing to give reasons for his disposition, he failed to comply with the\nstatute and with the general practice established by the cases respecting\nadults.This\nappeal will, therefore, be allowed and the Order for community service reduced\nto 40 hours in accordance with the joint recommendation of Counsel.J.Digby,\nNova ScotiaJune\n2nd, 1997TO:Mrs.\nDiane HamiltonProthonotaryP.O.

Macchia.............................................counsel\nfor the accused Irina ChernyakhovskyVAILLANCOURT\nJ.:[1]The accused entered a guilty plea to the\ncharge that between the 1st day of March in the year 2015 and the 30th\nday of September in the year 2015 at the City of Toronto in the Toronto Region she\ndid, by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, defraud Elliott A.\nSchwartz Dentistry Professional Corporation of monies of a value exceeding five\nthousand dollars, contrary to Section 380, subsection (1), clause (a) of the Criminal\nCode of Canada.[2]The Crown proceeded by way of indictment.THE FACTS[3]Ms. Chernyakhovsky was employed at the\ndental office of Dr. Elliott A. Schwartz from March 1, 2015 to the fall of\n2015.During that time she enriched herself through fraudulent transactions\nand casino cash advances in the amount of $63,000.00.[4]Ms. Chernyakhovsky advised Dr. Gojer that in\nMarch 2015 her dog, who she was very attached to, became ill and that she was\nvery stressed about it.She also advised Dr. Gojer that her father was ill in\nOctober of 2014.She was stressed dealing with his illness. She said that she\nbecame very depressed from March 2015 and when she ran out of money to care for\nher dog and the dog’s chemotherapy, she committed the frauds at Dr. Schwartz’s\noffice.Ms. Chernyakhovsky said that she used her daughter’s bank account for\nthis fraud.She said that she used very poor judgment at the time, which was\nat a time when she was very depressed and all that she was thinking of was to\nfix the things going wrong in her life.[5]The Crown filed a chart (Exhibit #1) that\ndemonstrated the pattern of Ms. Chernyakhovsky’s withdrawals.It is clear that\nMs. Chernyakhovsky embarked upon her fraudulent activities almost from the\nfirst day of her employment and continued her illegal activities regularly\nthereafter escalating the dollar amounts as time went by.CROWN’S POSITION ON SENTENCING[6]Assistant Crown Attorney, Ms. Hebert,\nadvocated for a custodial sentence of four years.[7]Ms. Macchia submitted that the appropriate\nsentence to be imposed was a conditional sentence of eighteen months and three\nyears of probation.VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT[8]Dr. Elliott Schwartz read his victim impact\nstatement into the record.A hard copy of that statement was filed as Exhibit\n2.[9]Dr. Schwartz has been a dentist for\nforty-three years and has been very active in various professional organizations\nthroughout his career and has recently been presented with an Award of Merit by\nthe Ontario Dental Association for his many hours of volunteer service in\nconnection with organized dentistry.[10]Dr. Schwartz is not only a victim of Ms.\nChernyakhovsky’s fraudulent conduct in a financial sense but he has had to deal\nwith a significant amount of collateral damage as a result of Ms.Chernyakhovsky’s actions that she took as a result of her employment termination.[11]At the time of her firing, Ms.\nChernyakhovsky advised Dr. Schwartz that if he did not withdraw the charges\nagainst her he would be very sorry.This was not an idle threat. Ms. Chernyakhovsky\nmounted a deliberate campaign of intimidation, harassment and revenge against\nDr. Schwartz that included:•Convincing two of Dr. Schwartz’s support staff\nthat she had done nothing wrong and that it was Dr. Schwartz who was actually\nstealing from his patients.As a result, these two individuals quit and Dr.\nSchwartz was required to find replacements.•Calling the Ministry of Labour and reporting\nthat Dr. Schwartz’s office had unsafe working conditions.•Notifying the Department of Health and advising\nthem that Dr. Schwartz did not sterilize his instruments and that there was\nmould and mouse droppings in his office.•Contacting the Royal College of Dental Surgeons\nof Ontario and claiming that Dr. Schwartz abused children, made false claims to\ninsurance companies, charged for services that he had not performed,\novercharged his patients, and did not properly sterilize his instruments.[12]The aforementioned actions of Ms. Chernyakhovsky\nresulted in investigations that required Dr. Schwartz to defend and to explain\nhimself to the various investigative bodies and various insurance companies.[13]The onslaught of Ms. Chernyakhovsky’s\nendeavours required a significant amount of time and expense on Dr. Schwartz’s\npart.[14]It should come as no surprise that the\nentire Chernyakhovsky affair caused Dr. Schwartz a great deal of emotional\nstrain and it has impacted negatively on his interactions with his wife,\nchildren and grandchildren.[15]Dr. Schwartz has experienced dismay over the\napparent lack of support from his colleagues and professional organizations that\nhe had worked with throughout his career.[16]Dr. Schwartz has also been the focus of\nnegative social media commentary.Whether this activity was generated by the\naccused directly is of little weight.Such notoriety is but another\ndistraction that Dr. Schwartz has had to deal with as a result of Ms.\nChernyakhovsky’s actions.[17]In addition to the financial and emotional\nstressors, Dr. Schwartz has experienced severe back pain that has required him\nto attend physiotherapy for three months.He also has had difficulty sleeping\nand has suffered from back spasms.AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES[18]The fact that we are dealing with a\nsignificant breach of trust is most concerning to the court.[19]The fact that Ms. Chernyakhovsky began\ndraining money almost from day one of her employment with Dr. Schwartz\ncompounds the seriousness of the breach of trust.[20]Ms. Chernyakhovsky’s criminal record is\ntroubling in the extreme.The record covers a significant timeframe and has\nrelated offences on it including breach of trust counts involving dentist\noffices.The rapidity that Ms. Chernyakhovsky commenced her withdrawal schemes\nmight very well be explained when one considers that this conduct has been perfected\nover the years.[21]The criminal record indicates the following\nentries:1987-03-14Theft Under $1000.00 (2 charges)Suspended sentence \u0026 probation for 1 year on each charge2005-08-22Fraud Under $5000.00Suspended sentence – two years’ probation and 28 days presentencecustody2005-12-05(1) Use of Credit Card (2charges)(2)

recognizance(1) Conditional sentence –2 years less one day(2) Conditional sentence- 2years less one dayconcurrent(3)Fine $100.00[22]The criminal record of the accused suggests\nthat she is a high risk to reoffend.[23]The actions taken by the accused against Dr.\nSchwartz after her dismissal are referenced in the Victim Impact Statement and\ncertainly demonstrate a degree of vindictiveness on the part of Ms.\nChernyakhovsky.[24]Dr. Gojer’s medical report dated September\n9, 2017, at page five indicates that when Ms. Chernyakhovsky applied for a\nposition with Dr. Schwartz she used her maiden name, Fooks, in order to avoid\ndetection as she had a prior criminal record.This deliberate massaging of her\napplication speaks to the criminal intent of the accused.It is interesting to\nobserve that Ms. Chernyakhovsky considered that the fact that she was not asked\nif she had any prior criminal record was somehow noteworthy.I find that this\npoint really is of no moment in the overall scheme of things.MITIGATING FACTORS[25]A number of the mitigating factors brought\nforward in counsel’s submissions are somewhat diminished because of counterbalancing\nissues.[26]A key mitigating factor in the accused’s\nfavour is her plea of guilty.This plea undoubtedly saved considerable court\ntime and resources and has relieved Dr. Schwartz the further inconvenience of\ntestifying.[27]At the time of the registration of the\nconviction, I made a free standing restitution order in the amount of\n$63,000.00.Ms. Macchia advised the court that she was in funds to pay\n$10,000.00.However, when Ms. Macchia attended at the administrative office to\nmake the payment, she was advised that the office was unable to accept the\nmoney until the sentencing process was completed in its entirety.This position\nseems somewhat odd to me but bureaucracy is what it is.In the fullness of\ntime, it will be interesting to see if the $10,000.00 is eventually paid.The\nCrown suggested that the accused was “trying to buy a conditional sentence”.I\nreject this proposition.As of the time of the imposition of the restitution\norder, there was a genuine desire and effort to pay partial restitution.I\nfind that in cases of fraud, payment of part or all of the restitution is a\nmitigating circumstance.In R. v. Stewart, [2014] O.J. No. 5661 and R.\nv. Lord, [2012] O.J. No. 4559, the Ontario Court of Appeal addresses the\nimportance of restitution in the overall scheme of arriving at an appropriate\nsentence.[28]Ms. Chernyakhovsky has been diagnosed with\nMajor Depressive Disorder with psychotic features.She has been examined and\nassessed by Dr. Mary Preisman at Mount Sanai Hospital, Dr. Julian Gojer and\nShawnette Thompson, MSW, RSW at the Manasa Clinic and most recently has been\ncounselled by Dr. Mark Halman. (See Exhibit 6)[29]Dr. Gojer noted under the heading, Mental\nState Examination, that:“Ms.\nChernyakhovsky presented as a very distraught woman who was weepy and agitated\nduring the interviews I had with her.She spoke relevantly and coherently but\nwas long winded, circumstantial and at times tangential.Her mood was\nsignificantly depressed.There were no delusions, bizarre ideas, or thought disorder.She reported auditory hallucinations which seemed to be in keeping with her\ndepressed mood. There were no obvious cognitive deficits other than a poor\nattention span.[30]Under the heading, Diagnosis, Dr. Gojer\nstated that:“Ms. Chernyakhovsky\nis suffering from a Major Depressive Disorder.This is a\ndepressive illness that is of a significant nature and appears to have been\ngoing on for some time.There are indications that her depression is of\npsychotic intensity.She also has problems with her personality which appears\nto be marked by low self-esteem, a need to please others and to seek out approval\nfrom family and people around her.There is\nno indication that she has a substance use disorder, a gambling problem, and\npsychopathic or antisocial traits.Her history as outlined from her mother\ndoes not indicate that she had a conduct disorder in her childhood, nor is\nthere a criminal history prior to 2006.It is likely that the fraud and\ndeceitful behaviours that she has demonstrated since 2006 are a product of her\nlife deteriorating and her suffering from problems of depression.She had not\nlearned to cope with stress and anxiety in a mature and pro-social manner.She\nhas used very poor judgement, albeit influenced by the presence of a depressive\nillness that has fluctuated over the years.Ms.\nChernyakhovsky’s depressive illness does not appear to have negated her\ncriminal responsibility.Her depressive illness and somewhat flawed\npersonality attributes, secondary to an unhappy childhood, appear to have left\nher with limited coping skills and insight in how to deal with stress.Since\nabout a year, for the first time in her life, [she] is receiving formal and appropriate\npsychotherapy.She appears to have a good therapeutic relationship with her\ntreating psychiatrist and is on appropriate medical treatment.Ms.\nChernyakhovsky is taking Cymbalta, an antidepressant drug, and is getting some\nrelief from it.She has found the therapy sessions very helpful.She has been\nable to recognize that she has been a people’s pleaser, that she is not\nassertive, and that she has not had much self-esteem.She sees Dr. Halman once\nevery two or three weeks.Ms.\nChernyakhovsky’s prognosis is guarded in that she is still depressed and has\nmore work to do in psychotherapy.She is, however, focused on doing well, not\nreoffending and is actively engaged in treatment.Her future\ncan be managed by ensuring that she continues in therapy and does not work for\na third party in a capacity where she handles finances.Her progress in the\ncommunity can be supervised by a probation or parole officer. It is unlikely\nthat punishing her with incarceration will alter her depression.It will\nlikely make it worse.The focus will be to ensure that she has intensive\ncounselling and community monitoring.[31]The Crown stressed that Ms. Chernyakhovsky\nmight have not been completely forthright with Dr. Gojer.At page six of his\nreport, Dr. Gojer seems to have a reduced picture of Ms. Chernyakhovsky’s\ncriminal conduct as it relates to her previous fraudulent activity. I find that\nthis situation does not have any impact of the medical opinions expressed but\nthere is a concern regarding Ms. Chernyakhovsky’s veracity.[32]It is interesting that Ms. Chernyakhovsky\nhas been described as not being assertive. Her actions towards Dr. Schwartz\nafter she had her employment terminated do seem to suggest a very assertive\npersonality.[33]Ms. Chernyakhovsky has tearfully expressed\nher remorse to the court regarding her criminality.However, this stated\nremorse is not supported by the actions that she has taken against Dr. Schwartz\nsubsequent to her dismissal and the laying of criminal charges.I find that\nthe expressed remorse is focused on the accused’s personal circumstances as\nopposed to any meaningful regret that her actions have had on the complainant\nor society at large.[34]Ms. Macchia noted in her submissions that\nMs. Chernyakhovsky still has work to do in the realm of remorse.I agree.[35]Ms. Chernyakhovsky has support in the\ncommunity as evidenced by the letters filed in this sentencing hearing.Both\nthe accused’s mother and ex-mother-in-law have stepped forward to provide moral\nsupport for her.[36]Ms. Chernyakhovsky has recently become a\ngrandmother and has expressed a desire to become involved in the child’s life.THE LAW[37]The Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v.\nMcEachern, [1978] O.J. No. 987, sets out the basic principle in breach of\ntrust cases as follows:[8] … It\nhas long been established that the most important principle in sentencing a\nperson who holds a position of trust is that of general deterrence.The\noffences were serious and involved a large sum of money.They were concealed\nby the respondent until they were detected by the bank.[9] In our\nopinion the gravity of the offences called for the imposition of a custodial\nterm, and there are no exceptional circumstances which would justify a lesser\npunishment.The trial judge placed too much emphasis on restitution, and on\ncommunity service as an alternative to imprisonment, and did not attach sufficient\nimportance to general deterrence.The public interest requires that it be made\nvery clear to one and all that in the absence of exceptional circumstances a\nperson holding a position of trust who steals from his employer must expect a\nterm of imprisonment.SENTENCE[38]The circumstances of this case are such that\nthere are no exceptional circumstances that would warrant a non-custodial\nsentence.[39]Ms. Chernyakhovsky has been involved in\nfraudulent criminal activity over the years and has received significant\nperiods of jail for her conduct.In the case at bar, she used her prior\nacquired skills working in dental offices to drain funds from Dr. Schwartz’s\ndental practice.She started her activities early on and continued them until\nshe was terminated from her employment.Thereafter, she made a concerted\neffort to make Dr. Schwartz’s life difficult by making formal and unfounded\ncomplaints to various agencies requiring Dr. Schwartz to expend significant\ntime and resources to regain some degree of equilibrium.[40]The amount of the financial loss herein can\nbe described as significant.[41]I do not find the mitigating circumstances\nas outlined in these reasons to be particularly compelling and in no way can be\ncategorized as exceptional circumstances.[42]I am prepared to give maximum weight to Ms.\nChernyakhovsky’s plea of guilt and her belated efforts to seek out professional\nhelp to deal with her Major Depressive Disorder.I am also taking into account\nthe fact that Ms. Chernyakhovsky’s willing to make partial restitution at the\noutset of the sentencing process.[43]I view any expressions of remorse on the\naccused’s behalf to be self-serving and not particularly sincere.[44]I find that the breach of trust in this case\nrequires a custodial sentence of three years.Dated:January 26, 2018Justice\nCharles H. Vaillancourt"}

Basile.....................................................................................................for\nthe accused A.N.Mr. J. Bloomenfeld[1] ...........................................................................................for\nthe accused K.N.De Filippis, J.:Introduction[1]The four defendants were tried on an\nInformation containing over 100 fraud related counts in a hearing that lasted\n28 days in which I heard from 47 witnesses and received 134 exhibits, including\nsix volumes of documents. The Crown seeks prison sentences for all offenders as\nwell as forfeiture of property and restitution totalling approximately 1.7\nmillion dollars.Two defendants have been in custody for almost three years.The Defence seeks a sentence of time served for those individuals and a conditional\nsentence for the other two.The Defence opposes the other orders sought by the\nCrown.The issues raised include how to account for multiple convictions,\nthe calculation of pre-sentence custody, and the effect of a previously\nobtained pardon.[2]Ramanan Kenegarajah (whose surname once was\nKanagarajah) is the brother of Rajitha Kanagarajah.K.N. is married to A.N..The two men, K.N. and Kenegarajah, were found guilty of most charges they\nfaced.The two women, Kanagarajah and A.N., were found guilty of a few\ncounts.A fifth person, Hariharan Nesarajah, the husband of Kanagarajah, was\nacquitted of all charges.Written reasons explaining this verdict was\ndelivered on October 12, 2012.See: R. v. Kanagarajah et al., 2012 ONCJ\n636 (CanLII)[3]The defendants are to be sentenced for the\nfollowing crimes:Kenegarajah and K.N. (i.e. the two men) were jointly found\nguilty of the following 73 offences:One count of fraud\non the public, over $5000.00, between 2001 and 2010;One count of money\nlaundering between 1997 and 2010;One\ncount of fraud against Citibank between 2001 and 2010Eight\ncounts of fraud against specific financial institutions between 2001 and 2010;One\ncount of being a member of a criminal organization, between 2005 and 2010\n(along with Kanagarajah and A.N.);One\ncount of fraud against MCAP on May 23, 2007;One\ncount of fraud against TD Bank on September 30, 2008One\ncount of fraud against Home Trust on December 3, 2008One\ncount of fraud on Avis Car Rental between 2009 and 2010;One\ncount of possession of a Sears credit card in the name of Decruz, obtained by\nthe commission of an offence, between September 9, 2009 and March 1, 2010;Thirty\nthree counts of possession of specific credit cards, obtained by the commission\nof an offence, on March 3, 2010;Two counts\nof possession of property by crime (money, furniture, electronics, and appliances),\non March 3, 2010;One\ncount of possession of identification information intended to be used in a\nfraudulent manner, on March 3, 2010;One\ncount of fraudulent possession of credit card data that enables the use of\ncredit cards, on March 3, 2010;Nineteen\ncounts of fraudulent possession of credit card data, with specific names and financial\ninstitutions, on March 3, 2010[4]In addition, K.N. was convicted of\nobstructing a peace officer by giving a false name.[5]Kanagarajah and A.N. (i.e. the two women)\nwere both convicted of participating in a criminal organization (alongwith the\ntwo men).Kanagarajah was also found guilty of fraud against HomeTrust on December 3, 2008 (along with the two men).A.N. was alsofound guilty of two counts of\npossession of property by crime (money, furniture, electronics, andappliances)\non March 3, 2010 (along with the two men).[6]I have determined that the appropriate total\nsentence, including pre-sentence custody, for each offender is as follows:Ramanan\nKenegarajah:6 years in jailK.N.: 5.5 years in\njailRajitha\nKanagarajah: 18 month conditional sentence with house arrestA.N.: 18 month\nconditional sentence with house arrest[7]In addition, I have ordered the forfeiture\nof the property identified later in these reasons.Overview of the Crimes[8]In my reasons for judgment I set out the\nevidence in detail.What follows is an overview of my findings of fact to give\ncontext to the sentence.[9]The bulk of the incriminating evidence\nagainst the defendants was obtained by the Durham Regional Police Service in an\ninvestigation that commenced a few months before the defendants were arrested\non March 3, 2010.The immediate cause of that investigation was a complaint by\nDr. Wayne Niou, a resident of British Columbia, that credit card accounts had\nbeen opened in his name without his consent.One of these credit cards had\nbeen used in Durham Region.At this time, Det. Caplan, of the Durham Regional\nPolice had been looking into credit card fraud.He acted on the complaint and\neventually found a connection to K.N. and Kenegarajah.Further inquiries revealed\nthat in 2001 K.N. worked for American Express and was involved in creating 21\nsuspicious accounts and being involved in “bust out frauds”.[10]A “bust out” fraud typically involves the\nfollowing: An account and a credit profile is created with a low credit limit.In the short term, the cardholder makes small purchases and small payments,\nfollowed eventually by large purchases and cash advances. The “cardholder,” who\nis either a fictitious person or a real individual whose personal information\nhas been stolen, or alternatively the financial institution, would be left with\na large unpaid balance and no recourse to collect the debt. Collection efforts are\nrendered pointless because the “cardholder’s” address was invariably a post\noffice box, which itself had been rented in one of the fictitious names.[11]The American Express investigation\ndiscovered a link between K.N. and an address in Ontario. On December21, 2001, a search warrant was executed at 21 Rockport Drive.Thedoor to this\nhome was opened by a woman who identified herself with a valid OntarioDriver’s\nLicence as Rajitha Kanagarajah (the sister of Kenegarajah). A newMercedes Benz\nwas parked at the house.The motor vehicle had been leased by theRajitha Kanagarajah\nwith one of the 21 suspicious accounts that K.N. had created.Among the items\nseized at the home was gold and silver Jewellery,a rolex watch, gift\ncertificates from various retailers totalling $2,641.65, identificationin the\nname of K.N. and A.N., and financial records pertaining to several bank\naccounts that contained over $200,000.00 in cash or Guanteed IncomeCertificates.[12]Several weeks later, a man purporting to be K.N.\nsurrendered to police. It was soon learned that his true identity was Kanagaramanan\nKanagarajah (now known as Ramanan Kenegarajah).As a result, the latter\neventually pled guilty to personation and attempt to obstruct justice.[13]It appears no further attempts were made by\npolice to locate K.N..However, in July 2007, the RCMP in Burnaby,British\nColumbia, looked into reports that two men, known as “K.N.” and“Ramanan, were\ninvolved in financial impropriety at a Hindu temple. It was laterconfirmed\nthat these men were K.N. and Kenegarajah. On April 24, 2008, the latterwas followed to a drive 40 kilometres from his home to a shopping mallin Vancouver.He made two cash withdrawals from a Scotiabank ATMmachine and returned to his\nvehicle and drove in the direction of his home. Kenegarajah was stoppeden\nroute by the RCMP and produced a driver’s licence with the name KanagKanagaraj\nand an address of 11753 Sheppard Avenue. He was found in possession ofsix\ncredit cards in other persons’ names and $1,960 in twenty dollar bills.[14]At about the same time that Det. Caplan\nbecame aware of the aforementioned AMEX and RCMP investigations, he had\nestablished a connection between the defendants, several motor vehicles, and a\nnumber of residential properties.The relevant motor vehicles are an Audi, a\nBuick Enclave, and a Land Rover.The properties in question are located at:\nCondominium Unit 311 at 11753 Sheppard Ave., East, Toronto, 1640 Pennel Drive, Oshawa,\n47 Portelli Cres, 87 Portelli Crescent, and B[…] Drive, all in Ajax. Kanagarajah\nand her husband resided at the Sheppard Ave. condominium unit.K.N. and his\nwife, A.N., lived at B[…] Drive, along with Kenegarajah.The other homes were\noccupied by tenants.[15]The 87 Portelli Crescent property was owned\nby Sri Gnanasundram.It was purchased in 2007 for $355,636.22 with monthly mortgage\npayments in the amount of $1,805.45.The B[…] Drive property was purchased in\n2007 Vivehy Vigneswaran, Thavanesan Rasiah, and Rakjumar Rasiah.These three\nindividuals obtained the property through the assignment the Agreement of Purchase\nand Sale between the builder and the original purchaser, Sri Gnanasundram. The\npurchase price was $599,863.43.The 1640 Pennel Drive was owned by Rajitha\nKanagarajah and purchased in 2008 for $360,076.00 Mortgage with monthly\nmortgage payments in the amount of $1,882.22.[16]The home at 87 Portelli was rented to Avery\nBroderick at $1,795/month. Kenegarajah visited him a few times a year, as the\n“representative” of the home owner and picked up mail addressed to Gnanasundram.[17]The real estate transaction for B[…] Drive\nwas handled by a lawyer named Thangavel Kesevan, who has since beendisbarred\nfor his role making false and misleading misrepresentations to mortgagelenders\nin twelve other real estate transactions. Kesavan confirmed that theproperty\nwas obtained from Sri Gnanasundram (who also owned the nearby home at 87Portelli Cres).Vigneswaran identified this person as the aunt ofK.N..It is clear\nthat Vigneswaran and the two other purchasers of the property are strawmen the\nbeneficial owner, namely, Nesahn.[18]In support of her successful application for\nthe $334,800 mortgage on 1640 Pennel Drive, Rajitha Kanagarajah presented a\nletter confirming she earned $118,000 annually as the operations manager of a\ncompany called World Golden Stone Inc.This letter is a forgery.Kanagarajah\ntendered or knowingly allowed K.N. and Kenegarajah to tender this letter. In\nany event, the home was rented to Bill Aivalis at $1,500/month and on several\noccasions he met Kanagarajah at a restaurant near her home on Sheppard Avenue and paid the rent directly to her.[19]After reviewing the land registry documents\nand files for certain dormant investigations, the Durham Regional Police\nService instituted a surveillance program with respect to thedefendants,\nespecially, Kenegarajah and K.N..This program was aided by GPStracking\ndevices that had been installed on the Land Rover and Audi motorvehicles.Regular\nsurveillance in the two months preceding the arrests on March 3, 2010soon revealed a pattern of activity by the two men. On a number ofweekday mornings, K.N.\nand Kenegarajah, operating the Land Rover or Buick Enclave departed B[…]Drive\nin Ajax and dropped off children at a Montessori school inMarkham.They then\ntravelled to various banks and retail stores in the Greater TorontoArea, stopping\nthroughout the day at the condo building at 11753 Sheppard, at B[…] andother residences.The two men were never observed to go to work and earn income from alegitimate\nplace of employment or business.Instead they visitednumerous post office\nboxes and banks, used of credit cards in other people’s names topurchase items\nand withdraw cash at automated banking machines, and paid small amountson account\nof those credit cards.[20]On March 3, 2010 search warrants were executed at several locations, including the Sheppard Ave . condominium occupied by\nKanagarajah and her husband and B[…] Drive, the residence of K.N., A.N., and\nKenegarajah.[21]The evidence uncovered by the surveillance\nprogram and the execution of the search warrants shows that K.N. and\nKenegarajah were occupied full time in the operation of a large and sophisticated\nbust out fraud scheme.This required daily visits to retail outlets and banks.The sheer scale of this operation is evidenced by the ledgers seized from the\nLand Rover and property seized upon arrest and pursuant to search warrants.Among the material seized was personal data with respect to dozens of\nindividuals and financial institutions, more than 50 credit cards in numerous\ndifferent names, over $110,000.00 cash, about 80 cell phones, as well as\nelectronics and luxury items. One of the BlackBerry smart phones seized\nrevealed that over 1000 calls had been placed to six financial institutions\nthat provide credit cards. It is obvious that this evidence is simply a\nsnap shot of the activity of these two men. It reveals the tip of an iceberg\nthat stretches back in time.It is inconceivable that K.N. and Kenegarajah\ncould have abruptly started the scheme that was discovered.This must have\nentailed years of effort, beginning with minor frauds and building upon their\nexperience, to create an extraordinary enterprise.This can also\nbe seen in the actions of Kenegarajah in 2008 in British Columbia.[22]The total losses sustained by various\nfinancial institutions, from 2001until the arrests, amount to $1,764,126.28, as\nfollows:AMEX Canada: $601,393.00CIBC: $620,855.62Canadian Tire:\n$37,548.43Capital One Canada: $4,881.42JP Morgan Canada:\n$354,559.03MBNA Canada: $144,888.78[23]During this same ten year period, the approximate\ntotal income reported, by the defendants, to the Canada Revenue Agency, is as\nfollows:N.K.: $43, 000.00Ramanan\nKenegarajah $12,500.00A.N.: $210,000.00Rajitha Kanagarajah:\n$17,500.00[24]The properties purchased in Ontario includes 311-11753 Sheppard Ave., B[…] Drive, 47 Portelli, 87 Portelli, and1640\nPennell.The condominium unit was legally owned by K.N. and the others were\nfunctionally owned by K.N. and Kenegarajah, through proxies.It is also\nobvious that K.N. and Kenegarajah intended to acquire additional property.The\nvisits by the K.N. and Kenegarajah to Greenpark Homes, where they were\nultimately arrested, as well as the documents seized from them as incidents of\narrest attest to this fact.[25]Having regard to the total losses sustained\nby financial institutions and the income reported by the defendants over the\ndecade in question, the only reasonable conclusion is that the real estate was\nacquired with the ill-gotten gains and that much of the jewellery, furniture,\nappliances, and other property seized by police on March 3, 2010 is the proceeds\nof crime.In this regard, K.N. and Kenegarajah engaged in a fraud upon the\npublic and money laundering over many years. Moreover, along with Kanagarajah\nand A.N., they formed a criminal organization that had as its criminal purpose\nthe facilitation of credit card fraud and identity theft.[26]Counsel for both women asked me to\nacknowledge that in Sri Lankan culture the role of women is to obey their husbands.The Crown objects that there is no evidence of this.I accept this objection but\nnote that while I found the two women participated in certain crimes (and benefited\nby the activities of the men), the role of the men and women is dramatically\ndifferent.There is no question that the men were the leaders of the\nenterprise and actively involved on a daily basis.By comparison, the role of\nthe women is minor.Victim Impact Statements[27]The Crown filed statements from one\nindividual and two institutional victims.The statements filed by the two\nbanks were objected to by Defence counsel on the basis that they constituted a\n“lecture” rather than a victim impact statement. The statements contain general\nassertions about credit card fraud in Canada as well as statistics documenting\nthe extent of the problem.They also include information about impact of\ncrimes in question on the two banks.I have focussed on the latter and\nappreciate the context provided by the former.[28]Paul Morgan is the Senior Inspector, Fraud\nLoss Prevention and Investigations, for the Canadian Imperial Bank of\nCommerce.He provided an account of the impact of the crimes on the bank.His\nstatement set out the extent of credit card fraud in Canada and the\nconsiderable resources spent by financial institutions to combat this\nincreasing problem.In this particular case, the victim bank suffered a loss\nof $620, 855.62.Rick Neals is the Director for Global Security at Amex Bank\nof Canada.He reported that in this particular case, Amex suffered a loss of\n$461,393.00 due to fraud and spent $140,000.00 in staff and other coststo\ninvestigate and rectify the problems created by that fraud.[29]The individual impact statement was prepared\nby Dr. Niou, the British Columbia resident whose complaint was the immediate cause\nof the investigation in the resent case.The following is an excerpt from his\nstatement:This\nletter is written to attest to the degree and length of the impact of the\ncrimes that has been committed against me. In November of 2009, I was contacted\nby the Capital One credit card company to attempt to validate a credit card\napplication in my name. I was very surprised as I had not applied for any such\ncredit card. After some discussion with their agent, I realized that I had been\na victim of identity theft. According to the credit card company, it was my\nonus to call up the various credit bureaus and credit card companies. This was\nthe beginning of a long frustrating journey to clear my name and good standing.\nIn the months following this initial phone call, I had called around to\nnumerous agencies and credit bureaus. …..In all, there were fraudulent cards\nissued by Canadian Tire, Bank of Montreal, American Express and 3 cards by\nChase Morgan (One of which was the Sears credit card). Detailed information on\nthese credit cards will be provided to you on request. It was discovered that\nthe there were at least $16, 000 owed on the 3 Chase Morgan credit cards. During\nmy interactions with the credit card companies, multiple phone calls, faxes,\naffidavits and emails were made. I must have spent upwards of over 20 hours to\nattempt to clear my name and credit. It was a most frustrating and stressful experience\nas not all the contacts were helpful. I felt violated in the worst way as I was\nthe victim in this.Position of the Parties[30]Counsel for the Crown, Kenegarajah and K.N.\nagree that a penitentiary sentence is warranted for these two men.However,\nthe parties differ on the length of that sentence and the calculation for\npre-sentence custody.The Crown suggests a sentence of 8 years for these\ndefendants, less pre-sentence custody at a credit of 1to 1.Since the two men\nhave been in custody for almost three years, this means an additional five\nyears in jail.Defence counsel argue that the appropriate range is 3 – 5 years\nand that the credit for pre-sentence custody should be 1.5 to 1.On this\nbasis, they submit that K.N. and Kenegarajah should now be released on a sentence\nthat notes the time served.[31]The Crown seeks a sentence of 18 months jail\nwith respect to Kanagarajah and 15 months in the case of A.N..Counsel for\nthese two women suggest that a conditional sentence of 6 – 9 months is\nappropriate.[32]The Crown has applied for forfeiture of much\nof the property seized by police and an order that K.N. and Kenegarajah make\nrestitution of in the amount of $1,764,126.28 to the above mentioned financial\ninstitutions.Principles of Sentencing[33]The overarching principle of sentencing is\nthat of proportionality. In R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII), LeBel J., made\nthe following comments (at paras 39ff):The objectives and principles\nof sentencing were recently codified in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal\nCode to bring greater consistency and clarity to sentencing decisions.\nJudges are now directed in s. 718 to consider the fundamental purpose of\nsentencing as that of contributing, along with crime prevention measures, to\n\"respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe\nsociety\". This purpose is met by the imposition of \"just\nsanctions\" that reflect the usual array of sentencing objectives, as set\nout in the same provision: denunciation, general and specific deterrence,\nseparation of offenders, rehabilitation, reparation, and a recent addition: the\npromotion of a sense of responsibility in the offender and acknowledgement of\nthe harm caused to the victim and to the community.The objectives of sentencing\nare given sharper focus in s. 718.1, which mandates that a sentence be \"proportionate\nto the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the\noffender\". Thus, whatever weight a judge may wish to accord to the\nobjectives listed above, the resulting sentence must respect the\nfundamental principle of proportionality. ....But what does proportionality\nmean in the context of sentencing?For one, it requires that a\nsentence not exceed what is just and appropriate, given the moral\nblameworthiness of the offender and the gravity of the offence. In this sense,\nthe principle serves a limiting or restraining function. However, the\nrights-based, protective angle of proportionality is counter-balanced by its\nalignment with the \"just desserts\" philosophy of sentencing, which\nseeks to ensure that offenders are held responsible for their actions and that\nthe sentence properly reflects and condemns their role in the offence and the\nharm they caused…. The two perspectives on proportionality thus converge in a\nsentence that both speaks out against the offence and punishes the offender no\nmore than is necessary.Sentencing for Multiple Convictions[34]Counsel for Kenegarajah and K.N. assert that\nthe finding of guilt with respect to the global count of fraud on the public (between\n2001 and 2010) encompasses all other offences for which these defendants were\nfound guilty and that the latter should be stayed, except for the criminal organization\ncount, which is statutorily consecutive.In this regard, Mr. Pillay pointed to\nfollowing written submission by the Crown with respect to the verdict (Reply Submissions,\nparagraph 7):From the\nbeginning of this case, the Crown made it clear that it was alleging a single,\ncontinuing, ongoing general scheme of enterprise fraud by (all of) these\ndefendants involving the misappropriation of credit card information to obtain\ncash and to purchase merchandise.The alleged offences spanned the entire\nperiod in the various counts complained of (2001-2010) and occurred in more\nthan one location.One additional critical fact occurred in 2010: the defendants\ngot caught.[35]The Crown takes the position that while\ntotality and proportionality are important sentencing principles K.N. and\nKenegarajah should receive consecutive sentences for the various categories of\noffences of which they have been convicted, such as fraud, money laundering,\npossession of credit cards, participating in the activities of a criminal organization,\nand so on.[36]The issue of what to do with multiple\nconvictions was addressed in R v Harvey-Langton 2012 MBPC 64 (CanLII):1.First\ndetermine whether any or all of the sentences are to be served concurrently or\nconsecutively or a combination of both.2.If treated\nas concurrent, then, although all circumstances of the offender and the offence\nmust be taken into account in arriving at a sentence, the final sentence for\nmultiple concurrent offences should, absent exceptional circumstances, be\nhigher than the sentence that the judge would have awarded that offender for\none count of that offence. This has come to be known as the \"no free ride\nprinciple.\"3.If treated\nas consecutive offences, after assigning a sentence to each offence, the judge\nmust take one last look at the total cumulative length of the sentence with a\nview to determining whether the total sentence is so high as to be a\n\"crushing punishment\" on this offender. This is often referred to as\nthe totality principle. It must be remembered that the totality principle\nconsiderations under s. 718.2(c) of the Criminal Code apply only when\nconsecutive sentences are imposed. When a judge sentences an accused to\nconcurrent sentences, no such considerations arise.4.If the\njudge is of the view that the overall sentence is too high, it is within their\ndiscretion to reduce the sentence by using a variety of techniques. One of\nthose techniques is to make some of the multiple offences concurrent to each\nother. This use of the concurrency principle is for the sole purpose of reducing\nan excessive sentence as a result of that \"last look.\"[37]With respect to the issue of whether a\nsentence should be consecutive or concurrent, the court in R. v. Wozny, 2010\nMBCA 115 (CanLII) (para 46) stated that:While this is often not a\nsimple issue to decide, the general rule is that if the offences are\nsufficiently interrelated to form part of one single, continuous criminal\ntransaction, a concurrent sentence is called for. However, if the offences are\nseparate and distinct, then a consecutive sentence is to be imposed. Many of\nthe aforementioned cases (Grant, Golden, Draper, and Maroti)\nmake this clear. But this is only the general or basic rule.[38]I accept the Crown’s submissions about how\nto deal with the multiple convictions in this case.I do not consider the\nCrown’s written submission referred to by Mr. Pillay to be inconsistent with\nthis approach.The two men were involved in one multi-faceted course of\ncriminal conduct that involved a fraud on the public and money laundering.The\ncriminal organization count is statutorily required to be consecutive (see s.\n467.11(1)).The offences against particular financial institutions and the\nmany credit card and identity theft crimes are\ninterrelated and supported this criminal enterprise.Accordingly, the\nsentences will be imposed in accordance with the categories of offences set out\nlater in these reasons.[39]Kanagarajah and A.N. were both convicted of\nparticipating in a criminal organization.Kanagarajah was also found guilty of\nfraud against Home Trust on December 3, 2008 (along with the two men).The\nsentences for these offences will be consecutive.A.N. was also found guilty\nof two counts of possession of property by crime (money, furniture,\nelectronics, and appliances) on March 3, 2010.Sentences for the latter will\nbe concurrent and consecutive to the criminal organization count.Effect of Pardon[40]As already noted, Kenegarajah convicted on February 1, 2001\nof Personation and Attempt to Obstruct Justice by surrendering to police in the\nname of K.N..On April 24, 2008 he obtained a pardon for these offences.Two\nyears later, he legally changed his name.At about this time he also applied\nfor landed immigrant status on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, citing,\nin part, his love and financial support of his niece, including covering\ntuition at private Montesorri school.I have no doubt that this financial support\ncame from the crimes he has been convicted of.[41]Canadian law provides for several types of pardons.Kenegrarajah obtained an administrative pardon pursuant to the Criminal\nRecords Act.Since Kenegarajah has now been found guilty of numerous\nindictable offences, he immediately and automatically loses the benefit of the\npardon. This arises because section 7.2 of the Criminal Records Act provides\nthat \"A pardon granted to a person ceases to have effect if the person is\nsubsequently convicted of an indictable offence. ...\".See: R. v. Poupart,\n2010 QCCA 1956 (CanLII) and R v Gamble 2011 ONJC 513.Credit for Pre-sentence Custody[42]Kenegarajah and K.N. submit that 1:5 to 1 is\nthe appropriate credit for pre-sentence custody.On this basis the men have\nserved the equivalent of 51 months (i.e. 34 months actually served x 1.5) or\nfour years and three months.Defence counsel submit that the global fraud count\nshould attract a sentence of three years and nine months in jail and six months\nconsecutive for criminal organization count; in other words, time served.[43]Crown counsel in suggesting a total sentence\nof 8 years less pre-sentence custody at a credit of 1 to 1 proposes the\nfollowing sentence: 5 years for the global fraud and two years concurrent on\nall other fraud charges; 6 months consecutive for money laundering; two years\nconsecutive for participating in a criminal organization and six months consecutive\n(concurrent among counts) for all other possession, identity theft and related\ncounts.[44]The background to this debate is an\namendment to the Criminal Code contained in section 719.Subsection (3) states that a court shall limit any credit for\npre-sentence custody to a maximum of one day for each day spent in custody. Subsection\n(3.1) allows for a credit up to 1.5 to 1 “if the circumstances justify it”\n(and the person was not detained before trial because of a prior criminal\nrecord).[45]Defence counsel ground their argument on several factors:They\nrely upon the decision of Justice Green in R v Johnson 2011 ONCJ 77 (CanLII), which dealt with the constitutionality of the aforementioned\namendment to the Code.In this regard, counsel for K.N.\nand Kenegarajah point to the lack of rehabilitation programs and remission\nduring pre-sentence custody. Moreover, they point to the length of the\npre-sentence custody in this case (34 months) and also filed statistics from\nthe correctional facility that reveal the two defendants were confined to their\ncells for a total of 142 days during this time.[46]I do not consider the lack of rehabilitation programs to be a\nfactor in this particular case.In committing the crimes, the defendants did\nnot succumb to temptation because of addiction, mental health concerns or other\nissues that are subject to therapeutic intervention.The motive was greed -\npure and simple.This desire is probably as old as humanity itself.I am not\naware of any treatment program to deal with it.[47]Parliament must be taken to have known about the lack of\nremission in the case of pre-sentence custody.It follows that this factor,\nin itself, cannot be a justification for an enhanced credit.However, it is\nreasonable to conclude that what Parliament had in mind is the normal case.Other considerations may apply in extraordinary circumstances.Thus, for\nexample, an enhanced credit to account for lack of remission may be appropriate\nwhere the pre-sentence custody is exceptionally lengthy.With almost 3 years\nof pre-sentence custody, this is such a case.Crown counsel noted that the 34\nmonth delay is due, in large part, to a late re-election by the accused to have\na trial in the Ontario Court of Justice, rather than having a preliminary\nhearing in this court.This is a valid observation.The extra time required\nfor trial could not readily be accommodated into the schedules of the court and\nsix counsel. This meant the 28 days of trial took 18 months to complete.However,\nthe re-election was a legitimate action taken by the defendants after two of\nthem obtained new counsel.There was no posturing on the part of the Defence;\nthe delay was an inevitable and predictable consequence of the Defence actions\nbut it was not the motive or intention.[48]Lockdowns can occur for several reasons, including searches\nfor weapons and drugs and staff shortages.The former are conducted for the\nsafety of prisoners and staff.It must also be noted the 142 days represents\nthe total period of hours and days in lockdown; it does not mean consecutive\ndays confined to the cell.In cases where the pre-sentence detention is\nshorter, and the total lockdown time shorter, the latter might not be a\nsignificant factor in sentencing. But that is not this case; the equivalent of\n142 days confined to one’s cell is not something I should ignore.[49]The extraordinary pre-sentence custody, the impact on\nremission, and the significant amount of time spent in lockdown justify an\nenhanced credit for pre-sentence custody.In these circumstances it is\nappropriate to grant a credit of 1.5 to 1.Accordingly, I consider K.N. and\nKenegarajah to have served the equivalent of 51 months in pre-sentence custody\n(i.e. 34 months x 1.5).Sentences for Credit Card Fraud\nand Identity Theft[50]Kenegarajah and K.N. rely heavily on the\ndecision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Drabinsky and Gottlieb, 2011 ONCA 582 (CanLII) which they describe\nas the “high water mark for sentencing in fraud”.It is their submission that\nthis case, while serious, pales in comparison to the fraud perpetuated by\nDrabinsky and Gotlieb.The later received sentences of 5 years and 4 years,\nrespectively, for a fraud in the millions of dollars.[51]I accept the importance of the cases relied\nupon by Defence counsel but also note that they were decided under the previous\nfraud provisions with a lower maximum punishment. In any event, in Drabinsky at paras. 160, 173 the court observed:….this court and all other\nprovincial appellate courts have repeatedly held that denunciation and general\ndeterrence must dominate sentencing for large scale commercial frauds.\nDenunciation and general deterrence most often find expression in the length of\nthe jail term imposed....We agree that cases properly characterized\nas \"scams\" will normally call for significantly longer sentences than\nfrauds committed in the course of the operation of a legitimate business.[52]In R v Cunsolo [2012] O.J. 66,\nJustice Hill considered Drabinsky and observed that a sentence of six\nyears is within the correct range of sentences for major frauds and sentences\nin the 3 to 5-year range are common.He identified the\nfollowing mitigating factors in cases of major fraud; substantial recovery of\nthe proceeds of dishonest conduct, pre-sentence restitution, and whether the\nmotive was a medical condition or addiction (rather than greed). None of these\nfactors are present in the case under consideration.On the other hand these\naggravating factors are present; a sophisticated scheme of planning and\ndeception, a large number of dishonest transactions, a lengthy period of\ndishonesty, a significant loss, greed, and substantial benefits from the\ncrimes.[53]Crown and Defence counsel sparred over the issue of remorse.In this regard, the Crown pointed out that this was a “no admissions, prove\nyour case trial” that lasted 28 days.Mr. Bloomenfeld submitted that it was\nunseemly for the Crown to object that “the accused had the temerity to mount a\nvigorous defence” and both he and Mr. Pillay cautioned against punishing them\nfor doing so.I accept this caution:The right to trial is a fundamental principle\nof criminal justice and must not be eroded by sentences that appear to be a\npenalty for the losing side. On the other hand, genuine remorse says something\nrelevant about a defendant’s character and is an important mitigating factor.\nSuch remorse can be established by a guilty plea and/or apology.Neither is\npresent in this case and that mitigating factor is not available to temper the\nsentence that is otherwise appropriate.Conditional Sentences[54]The Crown seeks a reformatory sentence for A.N.\nand Kanagarajah.Defence counsel submit that a conditional sentence is\nappropriate.[55]Section 742.1 of the Code lists four criteria that a court must\nconsider before deciding to impose a conditional\nsentence: (1) the offender must be convicted of an offence that is not punishable\nby a minimum term of imprisonment; (2) the court must impose a term of\nimprisonment of less than two years; (3) the safety of the community would not\nbe endangered by the offender serving the sentence in the community; and (4) a conditional sentence would be\nconsistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in\nss. 718 to 718.2. The first two criteria are not obstacles in this case; the\nonly issue is the third and fourth pre-requisite.[56]It has not been seriously suggested by the\nCrown that A.N. and Kanagarajah would endanger the safety of the community if\ntheir sentences were served under house arrest.In any event, there is little\nevidence of this.Moreover, it is my practice not to impose conditional\nsentences without the electronic supervision program.Thus, I have greater\nconfidence that the provisions of house arrest will be observed and this mitigates\nthe risk of harm to the community.The real issue is whether a conditional\nsentence is in accord with the principles of sentencing; as noted, the most important\nones in this case are denunciation and deterrence. Such considerations require\nthat jail be considered.However, as the Supreme Court of Canada has observed,\na conditional sentence can meet the demands of denunciation and deterrence in\nthe right circumstances (see R v Proulx 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII)).Ramanan Kenegarajah and K.N.[57]Mr. Pillay advised as follows with respect toKenegarajah:He is 38 years old and was born in the northern part of Sri Lanka.He is a member of the Tamil minority and grew up during the conflictsbetween\nthe Tamil Tigers and the Sri Lankan government.He has one sister,the\nco-defendant in this matter, Kanagarajah.His father was acourt clerk in the\ncapital city of Columbo and his mother was a housewife.Atthe age of 14 his\nhand was injured by gunfire during an air strike and he spent two monthsin\nhospital.One year later he was shot in the leg during another airstrike and\nspend one month in hospital.In the 1990’s, at the age of 16, hecame to Canada.He learned to speak English while working atvarious jobs and eventually became a\ntruck driver.However two workplace accidents aggravated theinjury to his\nhand and in 2009 he stopped working.He was unemployed until hisarrest in\nthis matter.While in custody, his father passed away and hismother moved to India.This has made his detention especiallydifficult and he has not slept well.The\nlong period of detention ruined his relationship with a woman, who hassince\nmarried another man.[58]Mr. Bloomenfeld advised as follows with respect to K.N.: He\nis 41 years old, married to the co-defendant, A.N., with two children.He was\nborn in Sri Lanka and came to Canada as a refugee at the age of 16.He learned\nEnglish while working at a variety of jobs, including at American Express, and\neventually became a trucking and shipping broker.K.N. has not seen his children,\nnow aged 11 and 9, for almost three years. Mr. Bloomenfeld asserts that everything\nK.N. owned was seized by police and when released he will only have “the\nclothes he was arrested in”.His wife and children now survive on social assistance.[59]As already noted the mitigating factors identified in Cunsolo\nare not present in this case whereas all the aggravating ones are applicable.The moral culpability of K.N. and Kenegarajah is very high.This is seen in\nsuch things as the $8,000.00 watch seized from Kenegarajah and is, perhaps,\nbest captured in one of the photographs seized from B[…] Drive; it depicts a\nsmiling Kenegarajah holding bundles of twenty dollar bills that were, no doubt,\nfraudulently obtained from ATMs.Even more significant than the amount of the\nfraud is the nature and scope of the enterprise; It was a well planned system\nof identity theft and fraud amounting to, what the Crown described as, “electronic\nbank robbery”.The venture had been in operation for years and would have\ncontinued as such, had the police not intervened.[60]In my opinion the range of sentence proposed by Defence\ncounsel with respect to the two men is closer to the mark than that proposed by\nthe Crown. This is a major fraud and as stated in Cunsolo, sentences for\nsuch offences attract sentences of 3 to 6 years.However, given the aggravating\nfactors that apply to these defendants I find that the upper end of this range\nis appropriate.Moreover, I cannot ignore additional aggravating factors that\napply to Kenegarajah:He has a criminal record.That he obtained a pardon and\napplied for landed immigrant status on humanitarian grounds while committing\nthe offences in question is troubling.These important differences between\noffenders who otherwise played a similar role in the offences means the\nsentences cannot be the same.[61]In determining the appropriate jail\nsentences for K.N. and Kenegarajah, I have grouped the offences in question in\ncategories that reflect the principles discussed in aforementioned section dealing\nwith “Multiple Convictions”.The individual sentences also account for the\nprinciple of totality.The sentences:Category 1\n- Fraud on the public, over $5000.00, between 2001 and 2010: For K.N., 2.5\nyears as follows -30 months pre-sentence custody is noted, plus 1 day; for\nKenegarajah, 3 years as follows - 30 months presentence custody is noted, plus 6\nmonths;Category 2\n- Money laundering between 1997 and 2010: For both men, 6 months pre-sentence\ncustody is noted, plus 1 day.This is consecutive to all other sentences.Category 3-\nBeing a member of a criminal organization, between 2005 and 2010: For both men,\n1 year as follows – 12 months pre-sentence custody is noted, plus 1 day.This\nis consecutive to all other sentences.Category\n4: Fraud against financial institutions - For both men, six months for each of\nthe offences below, as follows – 3 months pre-sentence custody is noted, plus 3\nmonths. This is concurrent within the category but consecutive to all other\nsentences.One\ncount of fraud against Citibank between 2001 and 2010Eight\ncounts of fraud against specific financial institutions between 2001 and 2010One\ncount of fraud against MCAP on May 23, 2007One\ncount of fraud against TD Bank on September 30, 2008One\ncount of fraud against Home Trust on December 3, 2008One\ncount of fraud on Avis Car Rental between 2009 and 2010;One\ncount of possession of a Sears’ credit card in the name of Decruz, obtained by\nthe commission of an offence, between September 9, 2009 and March 1, 2010;Category\n5: Identity theft and credit card fraud- For both men, six months for each of\nthe offences below.This is concurrent within the category but consecutive to\nall other sentences.Thirty\nthree counts of possession of specific credit cards, obtained by the commission\nof an offence, on March 3, 2010;One\ncount of possession of identification information intended to be used in a\nfraudulent manner, on March 3, 2010;One\ncount of fraudulent possession of credit card data that enables the use of credit\ncards, on March 3, 2010;Nineteen\ncounts of fraudulent possession of credit card data, with specific names and\nfinancial institutions, on March 3, 2010Category\n6: Two counts of possession of property by crime (money, furniture,\nelectronics, and appliances), on March 3, 2010 - For both men, six months for\neach offence.This is concurrent within the category but consecutive to all\nother sentences.In\naddition, K.N. is sentenced to 15 days for obstructing a peace officer. This is\nconcurrent.[62]In the result, the combined sentences for\nKenegarajah amount to 6 years and those for K.N. amount to 5.5 years.This\nmeans that in addition to the 51 months both men have been in pre-sentence\ncustody, Kenegarajah will serve another 21 months and K.N. will serve another\n15 months.Rajitha Kanagarajah and A.N.[63]Defence counsel advised that Kanagarajah is\n34 years old and came to Canada 13 years ago.She is married with one child.She served six days in pre-sentence custody and house arrest for six months\nbefore her bail was made less restrictive.[64]Defence counsel advised that A.N. is 36\nyears old and came to Canada in 1999.She is a permanent resident.A.N. is married\nto K.N. with two children. She served 10 days in pre-sentence custody and seven\nmonths of house arrest before her bail was made less restrictive.She now lives\non welfare with her children in a small basement apartment.The children were\ntaken by the Children’s Aid Society for 45 days after her arrest.Counsel\nadvises that A.N. has been traumatized by these proceedings and the impact it\nhas had on her children. Counsel asks that I consider a conditional sentence of\nsix months less one day so that A.N. can avoid the possibility of deportation.[65]In my view, the objectives of deterrence and\ndenunciation can be met by a conditional sentence order.I come to this\nconclusion because of the role played by the two women in contrast to the\nactivities of the two men.Kanagarajah and A.N. participated in the criminal\norganization and benefited from it but the enterprise was instigated, directed,\nand operated by Kenegarajah and K.N..Moreover, the impact of these\nproceedings has been significant, especially with respect to A.N..A\nconditional sentence, with house arrest, effectively denounces the conduct of A.N.\nand Kenegarajah and deters others like them. Accordingly, the conditional\nsentence order is as follows:Kanangarajah:\n1 year for being a member of a criminal organization and 6 months consecutive\nfor fraud over $5,000.00A.N.: 1\nyear for being a member of a criminal organization and 6 months for the two\ncounts of possession of property obtained by crime.The latter are concurrent\nto each other and consecutive to the criminal organization count.[66]I have considered Defence counsel’s\nsubmission, on behalf of A.N., with respect to the potential immigration\nconsequences of my decision. Having regard to the disparity between what I\nconsider to be a proper sentence and what is needed to accommodate A.N.’s\nimmigration issue, I am unable to take the latter into account; it would be\nwrong to significantly reduce an otherwise appropriate sentence to avoid\nincidental consequences.Forfeiture[67]The Crown seeks an\nOrder pursuant to s. 462.37(1) of the Criminal Code for the forfeiture of\nproperty belonging to K.N. and Kenegarajah that was derived directly or\nindirectly as a result of the commission of an enterprise crime offence (being\nmembers of a criminal organization).This includes forfeiture of the property\nat 87 Portelli Crescent, Ajax, which was sold by MCAP Service Corporation, the\nmortgagee.Unlike the other properties in this case, there are surplus proceeds\nof $41,692.02 (plus any accrued interest).[68]Police seized property from K.N. and\nKenegarajah upon their arrest, from the vehicle they were driving at the time,\nseveral safe deposit boxes, and from the two residences that the four defendants\nlived at. The itemized list of this property is too long to include in these\nreasons and is set out in greater detail in my reasons for the verdict.For\npresent purposes, the following summary will suffice:A total of $110,000.00 in various denominations\nand currencies seized from all locations;B[…] Drive, Ajax, the home of K.N., A.N., and\nKenegarajah was essentially emptied of all its contents, including furniture in\nall rooms, appliances, snow and lawn equipment, exercise equipment, computers,\ncameras, camcorders, entertainment systems, about a cozen expensive watches,\nincluding several Rolex watches, jewellery, numerous Blackberry and I-phones\nand a dozen bottles of scotch;Items seized at 311-11735 Sheppard Avenue, Toronto, the home of Kanagarajah (and\nNesarajah) include jewellery, watches, computers, and numerous Blackberry and Iphones;The several homes purchased by the defendant’s\nwere heavily mortgaged but there remains equity in 87 Portelli Cres,Ajax, in the amount of $41,692.02 (plus any accrued interest)[69]As already noted, having regard to the losses\nsustained by financial institutions and the income reported by the defendants\nover the decade in question, the only reasonable conclusion is that the most of\nthe property seized by the police is the proceeds of crime.The defendant’s\nmust not benefit from their crimes and, apart from certain items counsel agree\nshould be returned, I order the that above property be forfeited to the Crown.[2]Restitution[70]The Crown seeks an order requiring\nKenegarajah and K.N. to each compensate their victims in the amount of\n$882,063.00.[71]In R. v. Devgan (1999) 1999 CanLII 2412 (ON CA), 136 C.C.C.\n(3d) 238 (OCA), the court identified the following factors with respect to the\nissue of restitution:1.An order for\ncompensation should be made with restraint and caution;2.The concept of\ncompensation is essential to the sentencing process:(i)it emphasizes the\nsanction imposed upon the offender;(ii)it makes the accused\nresponsible for making restitution to the victim;(iii)it prevents the\naccused from profiting from crime; and(iv)it provides a\nconvenient, rapid and inexpensive means of recovery for the victim;3.A sentencing judge\nshould consider:(i)the purpose of the\naggrieved person in invoking s. 725(1);(ii)whether civil\nproceedings have been initiated and are being pursued; and(iii)the means of the\noffender.4.A compensation order\nshould not be used as a substitute for civil proceedings. Parliament did not intend\nthat compensation orders would displace the civil remedies necessary to ensure\nfull compensation to victims.5.A compensation order\nis not the appropriate mechanism to unravel involved commercial transactions;6.A compensation order\nshould not be granted when it would require the criminal court to interpret written\ndocuments to determine the amount of money sought through the order. The loss\nshould be capable of ready calculation.7.A compensation order\nshould not be granted if the effect of provincial legislation would have to be\nconsidered in order to determine what order should be made;8.Any serious contest on\nlegal or factual issues should signal a denial of recourse to an order;9.Double recovery can be\nprevented by the accounting of all sums recovered; and10.A compensation order\nmay be appropriate where a related civil judgment has been rendered unenforceable\nas a result of bankruptcy.[72]As noted in Cunsolo, a restitution order forms part of the sentence imposed upon an offender\nand therefore whether such an order is an appropriate punishment requires a\nglobal view of the imprisonment to be imposed along with any restitution order.Moreover, a restitution order is not intended to undermine\nthe prospects for rehabilitation of the offender. While no single factor or consideration\nis determinative of whether a restitution order should be made, the defendants\npresent and future ability to pay must be considered.[73]This would otherwise be an appropriate case\nto grant the Crown’s request:The losses are readily identifiable without the\nneed to resolve contentious evidentiary issues.The victims are entitled to\nthe order and the defendants should be made responsible for their actions.However, I am confident neither defendant has the ability to pay and that they\nare not likely to be in a position to do so for the foreseeable future.The\nsubstantial proceeds of crime in this case were accumulated over 10 years and\nspent during that time.Apart from the assets set out in my forfeiture order,\nthere is nothing left.In these circumstances, to order K.N. and Kenegarjah to\npay the restitution in this case would be crushing and leave little hope rehabilitation.DNA Order[74]Section 487.04 states that a DNA order is\nmandatory for those convicted of participating in a criminal organization.Accordingly, the four defendant’s msut provide a sample of their DNA to the\nCrown.Conclusion[75]These crimes have caused substantial losses\nto several financial institutions; a cost that will ultimately be borne by\nsociety at large.I have no doubt that but for the two men, A.N. and\nKanagarajah would not have become involved in this activity.Kenegarajah and K.N.\nleft a country in turmoil to make a new life in Canada.They are intelligent\nand resourceful.As Crown counsel pointed out, “this could have been an\nimmigrant success story but they decided to cheat”.In so doing, they find\nthemselves in jail, their possessions forfeited, and they will leave prison penniless.K.N.’s wife and two young children now live on welfare in a small basement apartment.This is the legacy of their greed.Released:January 18, 2013Signed:\n“Justice J. De Filippis”[1] Mr. Bloomenfeld was not counsel at trial.That role was discharged\nby Mr. Olmstead who passed away before the sentence hearing.[2] A detailed list of the items forfeited will be attached to\nthe Forfeiture Order."}

Ben-Eliezer)for the\nrespondent(Respondent)))Heard:October 18, 2000)On appeal from the sentence of Justice Russell J. Otter\ndated February 15, 2000.McMURTRY C.J.O.:[1]This is a sentence appeal by the Crown from the\nsentence imposed on February 15, 2000 by Mr. Justice Otter of the Ontario Court\nof Justice with respect to pleas of guilty to one count of Impaired Driving in\nrelation to an offence which occurred on April 3, 1999 and one count of\nImpaired Driving Causing Bodily Harm in relation to an offence which occurred\non November 14, 1999.[2]The sentence imposed for the two offences was a\nsix-month conditional sentence, a $1,000 fine, a five year driving prohibition\nand three years probation.The respondent had served 21 days in\npre-sentence custody.THE FACTSThe April\n3, 1999 Offence[3]On April 3, 1999 at approximately 1:40 a.m., the\nrespondent was driving a vehicle alone, in contravention of his Learner’s\nPermit which required him to be accompanied by a licensed driver.As he\napproached the intersection of Lawrence Avenue East and Warden Avenue, he lost\ncontrol of his car, left the roadway and mounted the sidewalk.The car\nstruck a concrete lamp base and split in two.The front half of the car,\nin which the respondent was sitting, continued travelling along the sidewalk\nand demolished a bus shelter.The respondent was seriously injured and\nwas hospitalized for eight days.The breath samples that were taken after\nthe collision indicated a blood alcohol level of between 249 and 264 milligrams\nof alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.The\nNovember 14, 1999 Offence[4]Seven months later, on November 14, 1999, the\nrespondent was involved in another collision at the same intersection at\napproximately the same time as the April 3, 1999 offence.He was driving\na friend’s car, with the friend in the passenger seat.The respondent was\nattempting to make a right-hand turn when, because of his impairment and the\nspeed of the vehicle, the vehicle mounted the centre median, became airborne\nand crashed into two other vehicles that were stopped at the\nintersection.The vehicle driven by the respondent then rolled onto its\nroof and caught fire.The breath samples that were taken after the\ncollision indicated that the respondent’s blood alcohol level was between 190\nand 200 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.An occupant\nof one of the vehicles struck by the respondent’s vehicle at the intersection\nwas injured.The\nSentencing Hearing[5]The pre-sentence report included the following\ncomments:Ramesh Dharamdeo admits that\nhe is a heavy “weekend drinker”.He states that he started consuming\nalcohol at age 12 when he was in Trinidad.He admits he is able to\nrefrain from drinking during the week, but on weekends usually gets “carried\naway”.[6]The pre-sentence report also indicated that sources\ndescribed the respondent as “a good worker”, and generally as a good person\nwhen he is not consuming alcohol.[7]After the second offence, the respondent commenced a\nresidential substance abuse treatment program at the Renascent Centre in\nToronto.However, he did not complete the program as he was discharged\nfor “lack of progress” on February 1, 2000 two weeks before his\nsentencing.The respondent was told that he was discharged because he did\nnot abide by the rules of the rehabilitation program which involved getting up\nin the morning, shaving, showering and making his bed.[8]The respondent’s father testified at the sentencing\nhearing.He was aware of the fact that his son drank every weekend.He was sufficiently concerned about his son’s drinking and driving that he sold\nthe family cars so that the respondent would not have a vehicle to drive.[9]The respondent also testified at the sentencing\nhearing.He confirmed that he habitually got very drunk on weekends with\nhis friends.He stated that he had been drinking heavily since he was 16\nor 17 years old when he used to frequent the bars in Trinidad.His\nparents, aware of his behaviour, used to beat him and lock him in closets to\ntry to control him.The respondent conceded that he did not have his\nalcoholism under control.He had learned at the Renascent Centre that\nalcoholism is a disease that “controls you and from which you are never cured”.[10]The respondent described his drinking problem in the\nfollowing exchange with his counsel in examination-in-chief:Q.How much do you drink?A.Um – a lot, like I’ll spend like almost 200 bucks on – on alcohol on one night.Q.How drunk would you get?A.Pretty stoned.[11]In cross-examination, the respondent conceded that his\ndrinking had been “out of control” and when asked whether he now had his\ndrinking under control he replied:A.Right now?No, not really.[12]In sentencing submissions, defence counsel asked for\nprobation, or in the alternative, a conditional sentence in the range of three\nto four months, in addition to the 21 days time served.Crown counsel\nasked for a further period of six months incarceration, in addition to time\nserved, followed by three years probation.Reasons\nfor Sentence[13]The trial judge made the following comments in his\nreasons for sentence:The facts in both cases are\nquite frightening.The potential for harm was even greater than the\nsubstantial property damage and bodily harm that was incurred as a result of\nthese two.…The readings [breathalyzer] were enormously high.…(Y)ou are a model citizen who\nworks, stays home, is polite, hard working, reliable, with one very significant\nflaw, alcoholism.When you combine that with a motor vehicle and put you\nbehind the wheel, it creates some real danger.Sentence[14]The respondent was sentenced as follows:Impaired (April 3, 1999)1 year driving prohibition plus $1,000.00 fine.Impaired Causing Bodily Harm (November 14, 1999)4 year (consecutive) driving prohibitionPre-trial custody of 21 days6 month conditional sentence, conditions to include:- Not to possess or consume\nalcohol- Curfew between 10:00 p.m.\nand 6:00 a.m. Fridays and Saturday nights- Counselling- 50 hours community service3 years probation, conditions to include:- Not to possess or consume\nalcohol- Curfew between 10:00 p.m.\nand 6:00 a.m. Friday and Saturday nights (first 6 months of probation)- Counselling- 50 hours community service\n(within first year of probation)ISSUES\nAND THE LAW[15]The issue raised by his appeal is whether the\nconditional sentence imposed by the trial judge represents an error in law or\nan error in principle, or is demonstrably unfit.Only in such\ncircumstances is an appellate court entitled to intervene and substitute a fit\nsentence.[R. v. Shropshire (1995) 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.)][16]In addressing this issue the provisions of s. 742.1\nmust, of course, be considered:s.\n742.1Where a person is convicted\nof an offence except an offence that this punishable by a minimum term of\nimprisonment and the court(a)imposes a sentence of imprisonment of\nless than two years and(b)is satisfied that serving the sentence\nin the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be\nconsistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in\nss. 718 to 718.2.the court may, for the purpose\nof supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the\noffender serve the sentence in the community subject to the offender’s\ncomplying with the conditions of a conditional sentence order made under s.\n742.3.[17]In R. v. Proulx (2000) 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449\n(S.C.C.), Lamer C.J. commented at 481 that s. 742.1(b) “ensures that objectives\nsuch as denunciation and deterrence will be dealt with in the decision to\nimpose a conditional sentence”.Lamer C.J. then went on to deal with the\nmanner in which courts should evaluate danger to the community at 482 as\nfollows:In my opinion, to assess the\ndanger to the community posed by the offender while serving his or her sentence\nin the community, two factors must be taken into account:(1) the risk of\nthe offender re-offending and (2) the gravity of the damage that could ensue in\nthe event of re-offence.[18]The appellant submits that the sentencing judge did not\nconduct a proper assessment of dangerousness.[19]The appellant submits that the respondent’s repetition\nof driving while seriously impaired only a few months after his first impaired\noffence (while the first offence was still before the courts) should have\nraised for the sentencing judge a grave concern in relation to danger to the\ncommunity.Furthermore, the respondent’s discharge from the Renascent\nprogram indicated his unwillingness and/or inability to change his behaviour.[20]The appellant further submits that the danger that the\nrespondent posed for the community was not in any way ameliorated by releasing\nhim to the care of his parents who had demonstrated a history of being\ncompletely unable to control him or effect any change in his behaviour.[21]First, it should be noted that the sentencing judge did\nin fact acknowledge dangerousness, stating that when the respondent’s problem\nwith alcohol is combined “with a motor vehicle and put you behind the wheel, it\ncreates some real danger”.The sentencing judge simply concluded that the\ndriving prohibitions, coupled with the requirement of abstaining from alcohol\nand the curfew would satisfactorily address the danger to the community.However, it is my view that a conditional sentence is not proportionate to the\ngravity of the cumulative character of the two offences.It was probably\nmere good fortune that one or more people were not killed given the\ncircumstances of both offences.The facts of this case demanded a\nsentence which both reflected society’s abhorrence of the respondent’s conduct\nand was proportionate to the respondent’s level of blameworthiness.[22]Imprisonment has been recognized by the courts as\nproperly promoting general deterrence and denunciation in the context of\ndrinking and driving related offences.[23]In R. v. McVeigh (1985) 1985 CanLII 115 (ON CA), 22 C.C.C. (3d) 145 (Ont.\nC.A.), MacKinnon A.C.J.O. at 150 recognized the relationship between general\ndeterrence and drinking and driving as follows:It is true that many of those\nconvicted of these crimes have never been convicted of other crimes and have\ngood work and family records.It can be said on behalf of all such people\nthat a light sentence would be in their best interests and be the most\neffective form of rehabilitation.However, it is obvious that such an\napproach has not gone any length towards solving the problem.In my\nopinion these are the very ones who could be deterred by the prospect of a\nsubstantial sentence for drinking and driving if caught.General\ndeterrence in these cases should be the predominate concern, and such\ndeterrence is not realized by over emphasizing that individual deterrence is\nseldom needed once tragedy has resulted from the driving.[24]In R. v. McPhee (1990) 21 M.V.R. (2d) 318 (Ont.\nC.A.), Brooke J.A. held that “ordinarily” the objective of general deterrence\nrequired a custodial sentence for the offence of impaired driving causing\nbodily harm.[25]In R. v. Biancofiore (1997) 1997 CanLII 3420 (ON CA), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 344,\nRosenberg J.A. commented at paras 22-24 that:There is nothing to indicate\nthat the need for harsh measures in the interests of general deterrence has\nabated.Only two years ago, Cory J. again drew attention to the problem\nof drinking and driving in R. v. Bernshaw (1995) 1995 CanLII 150 (SCC), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 193\n(S.C.C.) at 204.Every year drunk driving\nleaves a terrible trail of death, agony, heartbreak and destruction.From\nthe point of view of numbers alone, it has a far greater impact on Canadian\nsociety than any other crime.In terms of the deaths and serious injuries\nresulting in hospitalizations, drunk driving is clearly the crime which causes\nthe most significant social loss to the country.…For the reasons expressed by\nthis court in McVeigh as reinforced by the 1985 statutory initiatives,\nit is my view that incarcerations for crimes like those committed by this\nrespondent can be justified on the basis of general deterrence.…The sentence for these crimes\nmust bring home to other like-minded persons that drinking and driving offences\nwill not be tolerated.[26]In Proulx, supra, Lamer C.J. stated at para 129:Moreover, dangerous driving\nand impaired driving may be offences for which harsh sentences plausibly\nprovide general deterrence.These crimes are often committed by otherwise\nlaw-abiding persons with good employment records and families.Arguably\nsuch persons are the ones most likely to be deterred by the threat of severe\npenalties.See:R. v. McVeigh.And in\nrelation to denunciation Lamer C.J. stated, in Proulx, at para 102:Denunciation is the\ncommunication of society’s condemnation of the offenders conduct.In M.\n(C.A.), supra, at para 81, I wrote:In short,\na sentence with a denunciating element represents a symbolic, collective\nstatement that the offender’s conduct should be punished for encroaching on our\nsociety’s basic code of values as enshrined within our substantive criminal\nlaw.As Lord Justice Lawton stated at R. v. Sargeant (1974) 60 Cr. App.\nR. 74 at 77:“society, through the courts, must show its abhorrence of\nparticular types of crime, and the only way in which the courts can show this\nis by the sentence they pass.CONCLUSION[27]It is my view that the sentencing judge erred in law in\nfailing to give proper consideration to the principle of general deterrence and\nthe need for a denunciatory sentence, as reflected in the case law on drinking\nand driving offences.[28]In my opinion a sentence of six months is appropriate\nbut it should be a period of incarceration and not served in the\ncommunity.However, there should be some consideration given to the fact\nthat the six months conditional sentence has been served.[29]Leave to appeal the sentence is therefore granted and\nthe sentence varied as follows:(a)The six month conditional sentence is set aside and a five month period\nof incarceration substituted therefor to commence as of this date.(b)The conditions of the three years probation are amended to extend the\ncurfew between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. Friday and Saturday evenings to the\nfirst two years of probation._____ “R.

Costain , forthe CrownK. Graham , for the Defendant))HEARD: December 16, 2013Justice B. GlassReasons For Sentence\nFor Second Degree Murder And Attempted Murder[1]On November 17, 2013, the jury returned verdicts\nfollowing a trial that commenced with jury selection on September 25, 2013. The\nverdicts found Sinhem Srun guilty of both counts as charged.[2]A pre-sentence report was ordered following the\npresentation of the verdicts.Victim\nImpact Statement[3]Victim Impact Statements from Chantheary Ly and\nMao Kim were filed as exhibits and read to the court by Mr. Dionne.[4]A Victim Impact Statement from Chantheary Ly, the\nwife of the deceased Vandin Svay, was read to the court by Mr. Dionne at the\nrequest of this victim.[5]Chantheary Ly suffers from loneliness,\npost-traumatic stress disorder, loss of financial well-being. She lost her\nhusband’s business tobankruptcy. People with whom she associated before her\nhusband died do not do so now.[6]The plight of Ms.Ly is a tragedy.[7]A Victim Impact Statement from Mao Kim was\nreceived as well. At his request, the statement was read to the court by Mr.\nDionne.[8]Mao Kim wrote about how the events of October\n16, 2010 and the injuries he sustained have affected his life. He described the\nphysical features of being wounded and needed long-term medical care with such\ndevices as a colostomy. He endured financial hardship in not being able to have\nbroken teeth repaired, not being able to pay for a colostomy for example. The\nwhole experience brought an emotional toll upon Mao Kim living in fear, feeling\nworthless, sad at losing his friend Vandin Svay and even today being scared. He\nfeels hopeless.[9]His experiences demonstrate tragic developments\nin a person’s life.Pre-Sentence\nReport[10]The pre-sentence report is best described as a\npositive one for Mr. Srun. He has no criminal record. He came to Canada from\nCambodia when he was 19 years of age and became a Canadian citizen in 2000. His\nfamily and employers reported that Mr. Srun is not known as a person who loses\nhis self-control. He does not use illicit drugs. He consumes alcohol and\nsometimes drinks too much.[11]Sinhem Srun married a woman in Cambodia. His\nbrother advised the person preparing the pre-sentence report that Mr. Srun’s\nwife was a neighbour in Cambodia. He married her in Cambodia and has sponsored\nher to come to Canada; however, she still resides in Cambodia.[12]Mr. Srun has had a girlfriend in Canada, but Iconclude that friendship has not developed into a permanent relationship.[13]The pre-sentence report noted that when Sinhem\nSrun is released into the community he might benefit from substance abuse\ncounselling. Iinterpret this to be referencing consuming too much alcohol at\ntimes.[14]The report also notes that there is no mental\nhealth issue for Sinhem Srun.Background\nFacts of the Offences[15]On October 16, 2010, there was a social party\nand dance at a restaurant in Markham. Those attending were Cambodian heritage\npersons. An entertainer known to the Cambodian community was performing at the\nparty.[16]An altercation developed between a group with\nwhom Sinhem Srun attended and others who were with the victims. The victims\nwere Vandin Svay and Mao Kim. Mr. Vandin Svay died as a result if knife wound\ninjuries sustained in the fight. Mao Kim was stabbed in the abdomen and\nexperienced a long recovery period.[17]There was no evidence to demonstrate a history\nof friction between the two groups. There did not appear to be a motive for the\noffences being committed.[18]Mr. Graham probably was accurate in his closing\naddress to the jury when he suggested that this fighting was the result of two\ngroups of young men who had been consuming a considerable amount of alcohol. In\nother words, there was too much liquor and too much testosterone.[19]The deceased had four life-threatening wounds\nsustained from a sharp object. Dr. Rose was the pathologist who thought a knife\nrather than a broken beer bottle was the more likely object to cause these\nwounds. She did not rule out the possibility of a broken beer bottle but noted\nthat such an object might not cause the less-ragged wounds sustained by both\nVandin Svay and Mao Kim.[20]There was a severance of the main artery in one\narm of Vandin Svay. From this wound, blood would have been released outside the\nbody of the deceased according to Dr. Rose. There were three puncture wounds to\nthe lower back. All four wounds were life-threatening and could have led to the\ndeath of Vandin Svay.[21]The jury had the opportunity to watch much of\nthe fighting as recorded on security cameras at the mall where the restaurant\nwas located. The jury saw Vandin Svay stagger along a corridor after the\ninitial fight as he went towards an exit door. As the deceased went along the\ncorridor, he appeared to be bleeding as a dark liquid spouted from his arm onto\nthe floor.[22]Had a tourniquet been applied to the arm wound,\nVandin Svay may not have died from blood loss. Dr. Rose reported this opinion.[23]The three wounds to the lower back of Vandin\nSvay resulted ininternal bleeding.[24]Mao Kim was stabbed in the abdomen. He told the\njury that he saw his intestines protruding from his abdomen following the\nfight.[25]Both injured persons were taken to a hospital by\nfriends. They were transported in the back of a pick-up truck owned by Mao Kim.[26]Vandin Svay died the night of the altercation.[27]Mao Kim was hospitalized for many weeks and had\na lengthy period of recovery.[28]No one provided any information that might have\nexplained to the jury why this fighting occurred.Position of\nthe Crown[29]The Crown submits that the second degree murder\nparole ineligibility be for 15 – 17 years.[30]The Crown asks that the sentence for attempted\nmurder of Mao Kim be 10-12 years concurrent.[31]The Crown accepts that both offences are part of\nthe same overall activity so that they are treated together.[32]Mr. Dionne submits that this murder and\nattempted murder involved some deliberate actions leading to the injuries\nsustained by both men. He does not agree that this unfortunate chain of events\nis only a party with too much alcohol consumption gone awry.[33]Sinhem Srun came to the altercation with beer\nbottles in hand and a knife. The video shows his hand behind his back with a\nbeer bottle. The evidence given to the jury is that a beer bottle or beer\nbottles were broken over the head of Mao Kim, and Sinhem Srun stabbed Vandin\nSvay as well as Mao Kim. The Defendant followed Vandin Svay along the hall to\nthe area of an exit vestibule with his knife in hand. One can infer he was\nintending to use the knife when he met Vandin Svay at the end of the corridor.[34]Mr. Dionne points to several cases in which the\nperiod of parole ineligibility was more than a minimum of 10 years. There were\nsuch factors as criminal records, encountering jail infractions while awaiting\ntrial, and egregious facts. R. v. Palarajah[1]\n, R. v. Johnson-Lee[2],\nR. v. Blandon[3],\nand R. v. Krasniqi[4] were referenced by the Crown.[35]In R. v. Palarajah[5], the Ontario Court of\nAppeal left parole ineligibility at 17 years. Baseball bats, an axe and a\nmachete were involved. The victim was not the original target as the\nperpetrators of the assaults were seeking a friend of the victim. It was a\nbrutal murder. The court noted the existence ofhigh moral culpability was\ncited by the trial judge.[36]In R. v. Johnson-Lee[6], two persons were stabbed.\nOne survived after being stabbed following a chase by the Defendant. The subject\nof the attempt murder was stabbed in the carotid artery following a stabbing\nwithout warning. In other words, this victim did not see the Defendant\napproaching. The murdered victim was stabbed in the heart and died soon after\nthe injury was sustained. The Defendant arranged for a woman to provide a false\nalibi, for which she was incarcerated for a year. He had a criminal record. He\nhad prior gang connections with the “Crips” gang. While in jail, he committed\nmisconduct infractions including brewing his own alcohol. Iwas the sentencing\njudge in the Johnson-Lee trial and fixed the parole ineligibility at 15 years.[37]In R. v. Blandon[7],\nthe accused person entered guilty pleas to second degree murder and attempted\nmurder. The sentencing court imposed parole ineligibilityon the second degree\nmurder conviction for a period of 12 years noting that the attack had been on\nunarmed strangers on a public street.[38]In R. v. Krasniqi[8],\nthere had been an ethnic conflict at a bar. Self-defence had been advanced to\nexplain the stabbing, but that was not found to be the case. The Ontario Court\nof Appeal left the parole ineligibility at 14 years.[39]Mr. Dionne submits that the facts for the actions\nof Sinhem Srun are in a more serious category such that he should not be able\nto apply for parole until 15-17 years from the time of his incarceration have\npassed.[40]Further, the Crown submits that the sentence for\nthe attempted murder conviction should be 10-12 years to be served concurrently\nwith the second degree murder life sentence. Both stabbing events were accepted\nas being part of the same global event.Position of\nthe Defendant[41]Mr. Graham submits that the parole ineligibility\nperiod for second degree murder be 10 years and that the attempted murder\nsanction be concurrent. The Defendant is a first time offender and should be\ntreated as such.[42]Sinhem Srun at the end of the case through his\ncounsel accepted that his conduct could result in a finding of manslaughter.[43]The jury for the most part did not recommend the\nrange suggested by Mr. Dionne. There were 8 jurors making no recommendation, 1\nrecommending 10 years and 3 recommending 15 years for parole ineligibility.[44]In a nutshell, counsel for Sinhem Srun states\nthat the court is sentencinga man who has had some very difficult challenges\nin his life, growing up in a war-torn country. It is not easy to move to\nanother country in which the person’s first language is not the most common\nlanguage. He has a good work record. Mr. Graham points out that employers have\ndescribed him as pleasant. Counsel states that this conduct is not common for\nSinhem Srun.[45]Sinhem Srun has been in custody for 3 years. He\nhas not been a problem in the Central East Detention Centre whereas one could\nlook at the Johnson-Lee[9]\ndecision where the accused man had in-custody infractions.Sentencing\nPrinciples[46]The Criminal Code provides guidance for\nsentencesso that there might be consistency in sentencing of persons convicted\nof criminal offences. Section 718 takes into account disapproval of unlawful\nconduct along withthe need to specifically discourage a person from\ncommitting criminal offences as well as to discourage people in general from\nsuch activity. In addition, rehabilitation and considerations for restitution\nas well as prior or lack of prior custodial experiences by a person are in\nplay. If there are circumstances that mitigate or aggravate possible sanctions\nfor criminal conduct, the sentencing court must address them. The overall\npurpose of sentencing is described as being a contribution to respect for the\nlaw and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society.Mitigating\nFactors Relating To The Offences Of The Offender[47]In this case, the court has a 35 year old man\nwho came to Canada from Cambodia at the age of 19 years. It is fair to say that\nhe would have grown up during years of wartime strife in his country of birth.\nHe came to Canada for a better life, no doubt.[48]Sinhem Srun does not have any criminal record.\nHe received his Canadian citizenship in 2000.[49]Speaking of citizenship, the jury heard that\npart of the celebration for Vandin Svay on October 16, 2010 was his approval\nfor Canadian citizenship. He too had come to Canada from Cambodia.[50]Sinhem Srun appears to have tried to maintain\nemployment in Canada. His former employers described him in the pre-sentence\nreport as a good worker who got along well with others.Aggravating\nFactors Relating To The Offences Or The Offender[51]There are several specific circumstances\noutlined in section 718.2 of the Criminal Code.One applies to Sinhem Srun’s\ncase. That is the impact of the offence upon the victim or victims.[52]Here, the surviving widow of Vandin Svay is a\nvictim. Her Victim Impact Statement explains how the loss of her husband has\ncreated a tremendous effect upon her. She has the rest of her life to live\nalone should she not develop a relationship with another person.[53]Mao Kim is also a victim, having been stabbed in\nthe abdomen. His Victim Impact Statement also tells how the events of this\nnight and his injuries have affected his life.[54]Fighting in general without a motive appears to\nbe an aggravating circumstance here. To bring a knife to a social event and to\nuse it several times on two other people reflects conduct that can only be\ndescribed as negative. There is nothing positive flowing from this conduct of\nSinhem Srun.[55]He appears to have followed Vandin Svay along\nthe corridor at least after the wound to the artery of the victim’s arm. He\nheld his arm extended in front of him with the knife in that hand pointed in\nthe direction he was following Vandin Svay. One might conclude that his mindset\nwas that he was not finished with Vandin Svay. Anger out of control during this\nwhole altercation can best be described as an aggravating factor.The\nRecommendations Of The Jury For Parole Ineligibility For Second Degree Murder[56]The jury were asked for their recommendationsfor\nhow many years of his life sentence Sinhem Srun should servebefore having the\nopportunity to apply for parole. Eight jurors made no recommendation. One\nrecommended 10 years. Three recommended 15 years.[57]The recommendations take into account the\ncharacter of Mr. Srun, the nature of the offence and the circumstances\nsurrounding the offence.[58]The Criminal Code requires the jury to consider\nsuch recommendations.The Sentence\nto be Imposed for Second Degree Murder and for Attempted Murder[59]The starting point for Sinhem Srun is\nimprisonment for life because of the conviction for second degree murder. The\nquestion is how many years should he serve before having the opportunity to\napply for parole. The sentence for attempted murder has a maximum period of\nlife imprisonment.[60]Mr. Grahamsubmits that the parole\nineligibility for the second degree murder conviction be no more than the\nminimum of ten years. He notes that most of the jurors were content to see ten\nyears as appropriate.[61]Mr. Dionne notes that Sinhem Srun’s conduct was\nmore than minimal taking into account the fact that he stabbed two people. He\ndid not demonstrate any concern for the outcome of stabbing the two victims. There\nought to be more than ten years served prior to making a parole application\nbecause of this aggravating circumstance. Denunciation and generaldeterrence\nare important factors for this sentence hearing.[62]The sentencing court also considers the\ncharacter of Mr. Srun, the nature of the offence and the circumstances\nsurrounding the offence when determining parole ineligibility.[63]The positive factors of Sinhem Srun’s life lead\none to consider less than the maximum custodial time before being allowed to\napply for parole.[64]The use of a weapon that can end the life of a\nperson is a factor that carries an aggravating consideration. Stabbing Vandin\nSvay more than once reflects at the very least a casual consideration about the\nlife or safety of the other person. Embarking on a fight at a social event\nattended by many people illustrates creating a danger to many people.Stabbing\na second person is an additional serious factor.[65]The victims here have continued to experience an\nimpact upon their lives. The widow of Vandin Svay is alone. She may be alone\nfor the rest of her life. Even if she develops a relationship with another\nperson, she will always have the thoughts of seeing what happened on the night\nof October 16, 2010.[66]Mao Kim was wounded physically in a significant\nmanner. He saw his intestines coming out of his abdomen at the area of the\nknife cut. He was hospitalized and encountered an extensive recovery period.[67]In light of Mr. Srun’s lack of a criminal record\nand taking into account the positive reports about how he intermingled with\nco-workers and family, one might conclude that specific deterrence is less of a\nfactor.[68]Denunciation of a person taking a knife to a\nparty and using it as a weapon of attack on two other persons is an important\nconsideration here. Coupled with denunciation is a need to convey a message to\nthe community as a whole that such conduct is to be discouraged.[69]The two offences occurred during the same\naltercation so that the attempted murder sentence will run concurrently to the\nsecond degree life without parole for 13 years. The attempted murder is not a\nsubsequent offence. Inote that the Crown agrees with the Defence as well.[70]Iam persuaded that in spite of the positive\nfactors for Mr. Srun, the sanction should bemore than ten years in prison\nbefore being permittedto apply for parole. The aggravating factorsin these\nreasons demonstrate the need for imprisonment for more than ten years.[71]The sentence for second degree murder will be\nlife without parole eligibility for 13 years.[72]Sinhem Srun has been in custody since October 25,\n2010. The period of 13 years will be reached on October 24, 2023 at which time\nMr. Srun may make an application for parole. Although Sinhem Srun may be\ngranted parole in the future, his life sentence continues for the balance of\nhis life.[73]The sentence for attempted murder will be 8\nyears which will run concurrently to the life imprisonment sentence without\nparole for 13 years. In other words, the 8 years does not delay the parole\neligibility beyond 13 years.[74]There will be a weapons prohibition order for\nlife pursuant to section 109 of the Criminal Codefor each of the offences.\nTwo offences with weapons were committed here.[75]There will be a DNA order for each of the\noffences pursuant to section 487.051 of the Criminal\nCode.Justice B.

St. Amand, 2017 ONCA 913DATE: 20171127DOCKET: C62427Cronk, Juriansz and Paciocco\nJJ.A.BETWEENHer Majesty the QueenRespondentandSamuel St. AmandAppellantMichael F.W. Bennett, for the appellantMichelle Campbell, for the respondentHeard: September 29, 2017On appeal from the conviction entered on\nMarch 31, 2014 and the sentence imposed on June 1, 2016 by Justice John Kukurin\nof the Ontario Court of Justice.By the Court:Introduction[1]On April 17, 2013 the appellant, Samuel St.\nAmand, was arrested and charged with one count each of making available and\npossession of child pornography, contrary to ss. 163.1(3) and 163.1(4) of the Criminal\nCode, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.[2]During a lawful search of the appellant’s\nresidence and computer, the police discovered child pornography on the\nappellant’s computer. Subsequent forensic examination of the computer disclosed\nmore than 3,900 unique images.Most of the stored images were not immediately\naccessible, but 750 of them were.Forensic examination also disclosed that\nthere had been active sharing of the images through an electronic file sharing\nprogram.[3]While the search of his home and computer was in\nprogress, the appellant made an inculpatory statement to the police in which he\nacknowledged responsibility for the images.It is accepted that the statement\nwas voluntary and not obtained in breach of the appellant’s constitutional\nrights.[4]On March 31, 2014 the appellant pleaded guilty\nto making available child pornography.His sentencing hearing began shortly after\nthe entry of his guilty plea and continued thereafter on various dates until sentence\nwas eventually imposed on June 1, 2016.[5]The appellant testified at the sentencing\nhearing. He admitted his guilt on the making available pornography charge, but\nmaintained that all his actions were accidental.He said that he routinely\ndownloaded various files, without knowing their contents, and then deleted the\nfiles he did not want.He testified the only reason the child pornographic\nimages were readily accessible on his computer on the day of his arrest was\nbecause he “just didn’t get around to deleting [them]”.[6]The sentencing judge rejected the appellant’s\naccount.He found the appellant was aware of how the file sharing program\noperated.It followed that the appellant had knowingly acquired and shared\nimages through the program. He sentenced the appellant to the mandatory minimum\nsentence of 12 months imprisonment set out under s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal\nCode for the charged offence of making available child pornography, less\ncredit at the rate of 1.5:1 for pre-sentence custody.He also imposed a 15-month\nprobation order and various ancillary orders.The Crown withdrew the\npossession of pornography charge following sentencing.[7]The appellant appeals from his conviction, seeks\nleave to appeal his sentence and, if leave be granted, seeks a reduced sentence\nof six months imprisonment, less time served.Issues and Parties’ Positions[8]The appellant does not contest his guilty plea.\nHowever, he contends that the sentencing judge erred by failing to stay the\nproceedings against him in response to three distinct stay applications brought\nby the defense during the course of the sentencing hearing and, further, by\nfailing to properly address the appellant’s Notice of Constitutional Question,\nalso filed during the sentencing hearing.[9]The appellant raises three specific issues.\nFirst, he argues that the sentencing judge erred by dismissing his applications\nfor a stay of proceedings based onabuse of process, in breach of his constitutionally\nprotected rights under s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.[10]Next, and relatedly, the appellant submits that the\nsentencing judge erred in his treatment of the appellant’s Notice of\nConstitutional Question, in which the appellant challenged the propriety of the\nCrown’s decision to proceed in this case by indictment, rather than summarily.[11]Finally, the appellant submits that the\nsentencing judge erred by dismissing his application for a stay of proceedings\nbased on unreasonable delay, in breach of his s. 11(b) Charter right\nto be tried within a reasonable time.[12]The Crown submits that there was no abuse of\nprocess in this case.Further, the Crown says, the appellant’s Notice of\nConstitutional Question did not actually attack the constitutional validity of\nany Criminal Code provision and the sentencing judge was entitled to\nfind, as he did, that the appellant’s constitutional challenge failed because\nit essentially repeated the same arguments as those rejected on the appellant’s\nfirst abuse of process application.[13]The Crown readily acknowledges the delay in this\ncase was substantial.However, it argues the delay was reasonable pursuant to\nthe principles articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Jordan,\n2016 SCC 27 (CanLII), [2016] 1 S.C.R. 631, in particular under the transitional\nexceptional circumstance for the application of s. 11(b) of the Charter identified\nin that case.The Crown contends that the appellant’s\ncase was greatly protracted by the appellant’s own actions; that the appellant\nsuffered no prejudice from the delay; and that the offence of which the\nappellant was convicted is serious.Analysis(1)Abuse of Process Applications[14]We turn first to the appellant’s abuse of\nprocess claims.(a)First Abuse of Process Application[15]During his sentencing hearing, the appellant\ntwice sought a stay of proceedings based on abuse of process allegedly arising\nfrom prosecutorial misconduct.His first abuse of process application, dated\nApril 22, 2015,[1]\nfocused primarily on the Crown’s election to proceed by indictment in this\ncase, rather than summarily.[16]This election was important because, at the\ntime, the charge of making available child pornography was a hybrid offence.Under s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code, a prosecution by indictment for\na charge of making available child pornography triggered a mandatory minimum\nsentence of 12 months imprisonment.In contrast, a six-month mandatory minimum\nsentence applied on summary conviction for the same charge.[17]The appellant claimed that, by electing to\nproceed by indictment rather than summarily, the Crown “exercised its\ndiscretion in a manner that result[ed] in a grossly disproportionate sentence”.He relied on three aspects of the Crown’s conduct in support of this claim.[18]First, he argued that, prior to making its\nelection, the Crown failed to evaluate the nature and seriousness of the\nalleged offence by failing to review and organize the images in accordance with\na classification system called the “COPINE scale”.[19]Second, the appellant challenged the Crown’s\nfailure to reconsider its original election after receiving, both from police\nforensic experts and the defence, post-charge information favourable to the\ndefence.[20]Third, the appellant attacked the Crown’s change\nof position on sentencing.Initially, the Crown took the position that a fit\nsentence was 18 months imprisonment (six months more than the statutory\nmandatory minimum), or 15 months on a joint sentencing submission.In mid-December\n2014, the Crown offered a revised position on sentencing – 12 months imprisonment,\nplus three years probation and various ancillary orders, on a joint\nsubmission.This offer was time limited and was not accepted by the defence.Finally, in April 2015, the Crown informed the defence that it would seek a 12-month\nsentence of imprisonment, plus probation for 18 months and various ancillary\norders.This was the sentence ultimately sought by the Crown at the sentencing\nhearing.[21]The appellant maintained that these actions by\nthe Crown, in combination, were improper tactics that exposed him to greater potential\npenal consequences than were warranted in the circumstances; that sought to\nfetter the sentencing judge’s discretion regarding the available range of\nsentence; and that were designed to pressure him into agreeing to a sentence of\n12 months imprisonment.[22]The sentencing judge, for clear and cogent\nreasons, dismissed the appellant’s first abuse of process application. He began\nhis analysis by recognizing the wide prosecutorial discretion vested by\nParliament in the Crown regarding the manner of proceeding with prosecutions\nfor hybrid offences, like the one at issue in this case.As he put it, at\npara. 50 of his ruling, “prosecutors throughout this province make such\ndecisions routinely on a daily basis.”[23]He next set out the grounds advanced by the appellant\nin support of his application, and then turned to the governing principles for\nan abuse of process claim relating to the alleged improper exercise of\nprosecutorial discretion.Citing the Supreme Court of Canada’s leading decision\nin R. v. Anderson, 2014 SCC 41 (CanLII), [2014] 2 S.C.R. 167 and this court’s\ndecision in R. v. Delchev, 2015 ONCA 381 (CanLII), 126 O.R. (3d) 267, the\nsentencing judge noted, correctly, that the appellant was obliged to establish a\nproper evidentiary foundation for his abuse of process claim before it could\nproceed: Anderson, at paras. 52-53. As this court explained in Delchev,\nat para. 49, only if an accused meets this threshold evidentiary burden will\nthe court inquire into the reasons behind the exercise of prosecutorial\ndiscretion.This pre-condition for judicial intervention respects the\npresumption that prosecutorial discretion is exercised in good faith: Anderson,\nat para. 55.[24]The sentencing judge concluded that the appellant\nhad failed to satisfy this threshold evidentiary requirement.He held, at\npara. 69:Nothing in the evidence in the sentencing\nhearing persuades me that, in exercising its discretion, the Crown’s decision\nto proceed by indictment, both when it was first made, and for the duration it\nhas continued in effect, qualifies as egregious conduct. The word ‘egregious’\ncarries a connotation of scandalous, shocking and outrageous. The Crown’s\ncontinuing election comes nowhere close to this. It does not compromise the\nintegrity of the justice system.Nor does it, in my view, compromise the\nfairness of the sentencing (trial) process for this accused.I do not see “bad\nfaith” in this exercise of the Crown’s prosecutorial discretion.[25]The sentencing judge also dealt head-on with the\nappellant’s assertions that the Crown, prior to electing whether to proceed by indictment,\nwas obliged to examine and categorize the images found on the appellant’s computer\nin accordance with the COPINE scale and, thereafter, to re-examine its election\ndecision in light of subsequently obtained information about the appellant’s\ncircumstances and those of the offence.[26]With respect to the first assertion – the urged\ncompulsory use of the COPINE scale – the sentencing judge recognized that the\nCOPINE scale is not universally used or required in the investigation of child\npornography offences.He also recognized that the relative seriousness of the\nimages – something that the COPINE scale purports to measure – could be\naddressed during sentencing.He put it this way, at para. 73: “Whether or not\nthe COPINE scale is applied and in what manner is a decision that applies to\nthe imposition of sentence, not to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.”[27]The sentencing judge also rejected the appellant’s\nclaim the Crown was required to have regard to the particular attributes of the\naccused in exercising its discretion. To impose such a requirement on the Crown,\nin his view, would wrongly equate the duties of a prosecutor with those of a\nsentencing judge, contrary to the teachings of Anderson.Imposition\nof a proportionate sentence on an accused is a duty the law imposes on judges,\nnot prosecutors.Parliament, he emphasized, has created a discretionary framework\nunder the criminal law that affords the Crown discretion to choose how to\nproceed with the prosecution of a hybrid offence. The Crown’s resulting\nelection reflects the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.[28]Moreover, and in any event, the sentencing judge\nfound that, in fact, the Crown had not ignored or disregarded post-charge\ninformation about the appellant’s circumstances or those of the offence. To the\ncontrary, it had considered and challenged certain of that information,\nincluding a psychological assessment of the appellant furnished by the\ndefence.The Crown, he noted, was not obliged to accept this assessment at\nface value or to attenuate its election decision based on a defence\npsychological risk assessment of the appellant.[29]The sentencing judge summarized his conclusions\nat para. 74 of his reasons, in this fashion:In summary, the amended application (dated\nApril 22, 2015) is dismissed. The accused has not shown an abuse of process has\ntaken place as a result of the Crown’s election to proceed by indictment, or by\nits decision in maintaining this position.He has not shown bad faith, or\nimproper motive. The decisions of the Crown are not so rare or exceptional as\nto require an explanation.The accused has not demonstrated that his Charter\nright to liberty has been infringed by the decisions made by the Crown.Accordingly, he is not entitled to any remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter\non the basis of this amended application.[30]We see no basis for appellate interference with\nthe sentencing judge’s ruling on this application.To succeed on this\napplication, the appellant was obliged to demonstrate Crown conduct that was\n“egregious and seriously compromise[d] trial fairness and/or the integrity of\nthe justice system”: Anderson, at para. 50.He failed to establish\nany Crown conduct that met this exacting standard.Nor, as the sentencing\njudge recognized, can the Crown’s decision to proceed by indictment or its\npositions on sentence properly be characterized as rare and exceptional\nexercises of prosecutorial discretion.Decisions of this kind by the Crown are\ncommonplace in our criminal justice system.[31]The sentencing judge’s reasons confirm he\nrecognized the controlling legal principles for an abuse of process claim of\nthis nature and, having considered the evidence bearing on that claim, properly\napplied those principles.His holding that the appellant failed to establish\nan evidentiary foundation for his first abuse of process claim is amply\nsupported by the record.(b)Second Abuse of Process Application[32]We reach a similar conclusion regarding the\nsentencing judge’s ruling on the appellant’s second abuse of process\napplication.[33]The legal basis for this “fresh” abuse of\nprocess application, dated November 30, 2015, is not entirely clear.The\napplication appears to have rested on the contention that the Crown was\nrequired to give notice to the defence of its intention to cross-examine the\nappellant and other defence witnesses at the sentencing hearing, and that the\nCrown’s failure to do so occasioned prejudice to the appellant.[34]In support of this contention, the appellant argued\nthat it was an abuse of process for the Crown to cross-examine defence\nwitnesses, including the appellant, after the Crown had revised its original position\non sentencing and decided to seek the 12-month mandatory minimum under s. 163.1(3)\nof the Criminal Code.According to the appellant, this change in\nposition rendered any need to challenge the defence evidence moot.As a\nresult, the appellant claimed, the Crown’s continued pursuit of that challenge\nwas intended merely to vindicate its original election to proceed by indictment,\na decision already in issue on the first abuse of process application.[35]In our opinion, this claim is clearly\nmisconceived.Indeed, it may fairly be described as frivolous.As the\nsentencing judge observed, the Crown was under no legal obligation to provide\nnotice to the defence of its intention to cross-examine witnesses at the\nsentencing hearing.Further, absent evidence of bad faith or improper motives,\nwhich were not demonstrated here, the Crown is not obliged to provide reasons\nfor its decisions in the course of a prosecution: Anderson, at para.\n55.[36]Moreover, on the sentencing judge’s findings,\nthe appellant failed to adduce any evidence of prejudice arising from the\nCrown’s decision to cross-examine defence witnesses at the sentencing hearing.Nor, before this court, does the appellant point to evidence of such\nprejudice.[37]The sentencing judge expressly rejected the\nappellant’s assertion that the Crown’s decision to cross-examine witnesses at\nthe sentencing hearing was motivated by a desire to justify its impugned indictable\nelection, or its original decision to seek a sentence of 18 months imprisonment.He was entitled to do so.[38]Apart altogether from the application of the\nmandatory minimum sentence, there were legitimate reasons for the Crown to\ncross-examine the defence witnesses.First, the mandatory minimum aside, there\nwere other sentencing considerations in play.The Crown, for instance, was\nobliged to support the duration and terms of the probation order it was\nseeking.Second, as the appellant conceded at the appeal hearing, at the time\nof the cross-examinations, the appellant had already indicated his intention to\nlaunch a constitutional challenge.The Crown was entitled to seek to establish\nan evidentiary record that was responsive to that challenge.[39]Perhaps more importantly, as this court accepted\nin R. v. Khalid, 2010 ONCA 861 (CanLII), 183 O.R. (3d) 600, at para. 2, leave\nto appeal refused, [2011] S.C.C.A. No. 322, evidence regarding an accused’s\nstate of mind and his degree of moral blameworthiness is properly part of a sentencing\nhearing: R. v. Gardiner, 1982 CanLII 30 (SCC), [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368, 140 D.L.R. (3d) 612.The\nCrown is not compelled to accept defence evidence material to sentencing.Nor\nis it required to proceed to sentencing on a record of defence counsel’s\nchoosing. A sentencing judge is entitled to a full evidentiary record in making\nsentencing decisions, not the record preferred by the defence.[40]This was particularly true in this case, where\nthe appellant was prepared to admit only to wilful blindness in relation to the\ncharges, that is, to a reduced level of moral culpability. Having heard the\nappellant’s testimony, the sentencing judge rejected his claim that he was wilfully\nblind to the receipt and sharing of the child pornographic images found on his computer.To the contrary, the sentencing judge concluded that the appellant knew what he\nwas doing.[41]For these reasons, we reject the appellant’s\nchallenge to the sentencing judge’s dismissal of his second abuse of process\napplication.(2)Notice of Constitutional Question[42]The constitutional question proposed by the\nappellant is not clearly stated, either in his June 5, 2015 Notice of\nConstitutional Question or in his factum on appeal.While the appellant’s\nNotice urges that “the statutory mandatory minimum should be struck down”, it\ndoes not challenge any specific Criminal Code provision.Further, the\n“material facts” stated in the Notice echo the arguments advanced by the\nappellant in support of his unsuccessful first abuse of process claim.[43]The appellant posited no clear constitutional\nquestion, separate from his s. 7 Charter arguments on his first abuse\nof process application, before the sentencing judge.When questioned by the\nsentencing judge as to whether he was attacking the constitutional validity of\ns. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code, the responses of the appellant’s counsel\nwere equivocal.[44]Nonetheless, contrary to the appellant’s\nsubmission, the sentencing judge did address, and resolve, the appellant’s\nNotice of Constitutional Question.He dismissed the appellant’s constitutional\nchallenge – such as it was – for essentially the same reasons as those\nunderpinning his dismissal of the first abuse of process application.He did\nnot err in doing so.[45]To the extent the appellant may be taken as having\nargued that the sentencing judge erred by declining to hold that the Crown must\ninvariably justify its election with respect to the prosecution of a hybrid\noffence attracting different mandatory minimums, this argument must also fail.Simply put, it is not a constitutional question.[46]Notably, the appellant concedes on appeal that\nhe is not challenging the constitutional validity of any mandatory minimum\nsentencing provision of the Criminal Code.In his factum, the\nappellant states:The Appellant has not challenged the\nconstitutionality of mandatory minimums.His challenge is to the rule of law\npreventing a sentencing judge from scrutinizing the Crown’s election as to\nwhich of two mandatory minimums a judge is bound to impose.[47]On this ground, as well, no constitutional\nquestion arises.(3)Section 11(b) Application[48]As we have said, on April 10, 2015 the appellant\nbrought an application for a stay of proceedings based on an alleged breach of\nhis s. 11(b) Charter right to be tried within a reasonable time.[49]To recap, the appellant was charged on April 17,\n2013. On March 31, 2014 he entered a guilty plea to the charge of making\navailable child pornography, and his sentencing hearing began shortly thereafter.\nSentence was eventually imposed on June 1, 2016.Thus, the total delay was approximately\n38 months.(a)Sentencing Judge’s Ruling[50]At the time of the appellant’s s. 11(b) stay\napplication, the framework set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v.\nMorin, 1992 CanLII 89 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771, including the guidelines for how much\ninstitutional delay is generally tolerable, governed the application of s.\n11(b).Applying that framework, the sentencing judge found that the delay in\nthis case was not unreasonable and dismissed the application.[51]Under Morin, the determination whether\na s. 11(b) Charter breach has occurred requires the balancing of four\nfactors: i) the length of the delay; ii) defence waiver; iii) the reasons for\nthe delay; and iv) prejudice to the accused’s s. 7 Charter interests\nin liberty, security of the person, and a fair trial: Jordan, at para.\n30.Institutional delay is evaluated against a set of guidelines developed by\nthe court in Morin – eight to ten months as a guide for institutional\ndelay in the provincial court, and an additional six to eight months as a guide\nfor institutional delay in the superior court after an accused’s committal for\ntrial: Jordan, at para. 52.[52]As required under Morin, the sentencing\njudge considered each of these factors in determining the reasonableness of the\ntotal delay in this case.In doing so, he confined his analysis to the period\nfrom April 2013, when the appellant was charged, to September 2015, when his s.\n11(b) application was argued – a total of 29 months.[53]In examining the reasons for this delay, the\nsentencing judge attributed 17.5 months to neutral or inherent delay, four\nmonths delay to the Crown, and seven and one-half months delay to the defence.His breakdown, at paras. 27-37, was as follows:•April 17, 2013 to October 17,\n2013 (6 months): neutral intake delay, involving\nsuch matters as the retainer of counsel, bail proceedings, receipt of Crown\ndisclosure, and the like;•October 17, 2013 to\nDecember 19, 2013 (2 months): neutral inherent delay,\ninvolving a defence request for a December 2013 date for plea and disposition.\nOn December 16, 2013 the defence sought an adjournment of the scheduled plea\ndate.By then, the parties had agreed that a sentencing hearing would be\nnecessary;•December 19, 2013 to March\n31, 2014 (3.5 months): neutral inherent delay,\narising from both Crown and defence actions. Both parties agreed to the\ncancellation of the original December 2013 plea date, to the need for a\nsentencing hearing and to a new plea date of March 31, 2014.As well, the 2013\nholiday season intervened;•March 31, 2014 (one day): neutral inherent delay, involving the hearing of evidence and a\nfinding of guilty on the plea entered by the appellant;•March 31, 2014 to November\n12, 2014 (7.5 months): defence delay. The\nCrown had completed its evidence at the sentencing hearing, the defence was not\nprepared to set a continuation date until a pre-sentence report was received,\nand a defence expert was unavailable to testify until November 2014;•November 12, 2014 to\nDecember 19, 2014 (1 month): neutral inherent\ndelay. The hearing continued on November 12, 2014 but, again, was not\ncompleted. The defence needed time to consider and, if necessary, file a Charter\napplication, and the Crown required time to move for a disclosure order\nrelating to the work of a defence expert;•December 19, 2014 to April\n23, 2015 (4 months): institutional delay. A\ncontinuation date for the hearing could not be set prior to April 23, 2015 due\nto the unavailability of the assigned judge; and•April 23, 2015 to\nSeptember 14, 2015 (5 months): neutral inherent delay.\nThe evidence at the hearing was completed at the end of May 2015, but a\ncontinuation date acceptable to both counsel was not available until September\n2015.(b)Jordan Framework(i)Presumptive unreasonable delay[54]The Supreme Court of Canada released its\ndecision in Jordan approximately one month after the appellant was\nsentenced. Jordan establishes a materially new framework for applying\ns. 11(b), holding that there are presumptive ceilings beyond which delay, from\nthe date of the charge to the actual or anticipated end of an accused’s trial,\nis presumed to be unreasonable.[55]Under Jordan, the presumptive ceiling\nis 18 months for cases tried in the provincial court, like this one, and 30\nmonths for cases tried in the superior court.Delay caused or waived by the\ndefence does not count towards the presumptive ceiling: Jordan, at\nparas. 49, 60-62, 66, and 105.[56]If, in any case, the applicable presumptive\nceiling is exceeded, the Crown bears the burden of rebutting the presumption of\nunreasonableness by establishing the presence of exceptional circumstances.If\nthe Crown fails to do so, the delay is unreasonable and a stay of proceedings\nwill follow.If the delay in question falls below the presumptive ceiling, the\ndefence bears the burden to show that the delay is unreasonable: Jordan,\nat paras. 47-48.(ii)Transitional cases[57]Under Jordan, where the reasonableness\nof delay in a case commenced under the pre-Jordan s. 11(b) regime is\ndetermined post-Jordan, the s. 11(b) analysis involves three steps.[58]First, the total delay must be calculated for\ncomparison to the applicable presumptive ceiling.The delay attributable to\nthe defence is then subtracted from the total delay, to yield a net delay: Jordan,\nat paras. 60 and 66.[59]Second, if the net delay (total delay minus\ndefence delay) exceeds the applicable presumptive ceiling, the Crown may rebut\nthe resulting presumption of unreasonableness by demonstrating that the delay\nis reasonable because of exceptional circumstances: Jordan, at para.\n68.[2][60]Third, in cases where the charges pre-date Jordan,\nthe presumption of unreasonableness may nevertheless be rebutted where the\nCrown demonstrates that a transitional exceptional circumstance justifies the\ndelay. That is, that the time the case has taken is justified based on the\nparties’ reasonable reliance on the law as it previously existed: Jordan,\nat paras. 95-96; R. v. Picard, 2017 ONCA 692 (CanLII), at para. 26; R.\nv. Cody, 2017 SCC 31 (CanLII), [2017] SCC 31, 411 D.L.R. (4th) 619, at para. 25.As a\nresult, where, as here, the entirety of the proceedings pre-date Jordan\nand the presumptive ceiling is exceeded, the Crown may rebut the presumption of\nunreasonableness if it demonstrates that the delay was reasonable in light of\nthe parties’ reasonable reliance on Morin.(c)Application of Jordan[61]The sentencing judge did not have the benefit of\nthe Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Jordan. It therefore falls\nto this court to assess the reasonableness of the delay in this case in light\nof Jordan, including its directions for the application of s. 11(b) in\nrespect of cases that were already in the system when Jordan was\nreleased.[62]This approach is subject to one significant qualification.Most, although not all, the delay in this case arose in connection with the\nappellant’s sentencing hearing, after he had pleaded guilty and had been\nconvicted of making available child pornography. It is clear that s. 11(b)\napplies to sentencing proceedings: R. v. MacDougall, 1998 CanLII 763 (SCC), [1998] 3 S.C.R.\n45, at para. 27.It is not clear, however, that the presumptive ceilings\nestablished in Jordan similarly apply to such proceedings.The\nmajority of the Supreme Court in Jordan expressly declined to determine\nthis issue, stating, at footnote 2:The issue of delay in sentencing, however, is\nnot before us, and we make no comment about how this [presumptive] ceiling\nshould apply to s. 11(b) applications brought after a conviction is entered, or\nwhether additional time should be added to the ceiling in such cases.[63]Counsel in this case did not raise any issue\nabout how the Jordan presumptive ceilings for delay apply after a\nconviction has been entered.Accordingly, this important question must await\ndetermination in another case, where the court has the benefit of a full record\nand argument on the issue.We therefore approach our evaluation of the\nreasonableness of the delay in this case on the assumption, without deciding,\nthat the current Jordan presumptive ceilings for delay are\nimplicated.(i)Total delay and defence delay[64]The Crown accepts that the total delay here was\napproximately 38 months from the date of the appellant’s charges in April 2013\nuntil sentence was imposed in June 2016.We agree.[65]While this total delay exceeds the applicable Jordan\nguideline by 20 months, it is the net delay that is to be used to measure\nwhether the delay is presumptively unreasonable.It remains to determine how\nmuch of the 38-month delay, if any, is attributable to defence delay so that the\nnet delay can be calculated.[66]Jordan confirms\nthat defence delay has two components: delay waived by the defence and delay\ncaused solely or directly by defence conduct: Jordan, at paras. 61 and\n63; Cody, at para. 26.There is no suggestion here of any\ndefence-waived delay.Consequently, the focus is on the second component of\ndefence delay – delay attributable to defence conduct.[67]The Crown accepts the sentencing judge’s attribution\nof seven and one-half months delay to the defence for the period March 31, 2014\nto November 12, 2014.The date of March 31, 2014 had been set as the agreed date\nfor the sentencing hearing and the Crown led the entirety of its case on that\nday.However, the defence sought an adjournment in order to obtain a\npre-sentence report, to consider what defence evidence to call, and to arrange\nfor the attendance of a proposed defence expert, Dr. Valliant, a registered\npsychologist.This witness proved to be unavailable prior to November 12,\n2014.In short, the defence was unprepared on March 31 and had not even\ndetermined when Dr. Valliant would be available to testify.In these\ncircumstances, we agree that this seven and one-half months period is properly\nregarded as defence delay.[68]However, the Crown submits the last six and\none-half months before the appellant was finally sentenced, an interval not\nconsidered by the sentencing judge because it consists of delay after argument\nof the s. 11(b) application, is also defence delay.On this approach, the\ntotal defence delay is 14 months, yielding a net delay under the Jordan\nframework of about 24 months.[69]The Crown argues the additional six and one-half\nmonths delay was caused exclusively by the appellant’s unmeritorious and\nbelated second abuse of process application, described above.The Crown maintains\nthat this application derailed the sentencing judge’s deliberations, because it\nhad to be heard and resolved in order to know whether a sentence should be\nimposed.[70]We agree with the latter submissions.[71]We have already concluded that the appellant’s\nsecond abuse of process application was misconceived and frivolous.It was\ntherefore “illegitimate” defence conduct within the meaning of that term as\ncontemplated in Jordan and Cody.Jordan holds that deliberate\nand calculated defence tactics aimed at causing delay, including frivolous applications\nand requests, are straightforward examples of defence delay: Jordan,\nat para. 63; Cody, at paras. 30-35.[72]The second abuse of process application was also\nlate.Dated November 30, 2015 (more than two years and seven months after the\ncharges), it complained of Crown conduct that occurred in the spring of 2015,\nwhen the Crown cross-examined defence witnesses at the sentencing hearing.[73]Moreover, this belated application did indeed\nderail deliberations. The sentencing judge’s decisions on the s. 11(b) stay\napplication and the appellant’s first abuse of process application were\nscheduled for release on December 7, 2015 but the second application\nintervened.It was not until January 5, 2016 that this new application could\nbe argued.To expedite matters and avoid yet another hearing date, the\nsentencing judge ordered that sentencing submissions should be filed in\nwriting.Rulings on the defence applications and reasons for sentence were\nreleased on May 17, 2016 and sentence was imposed on June 1, 2016.[74]Thus, the timing of the second abuse of process\napplication directly caused delay in the progress of the sentencing hearing.As\nthe Crown argues, it also strongly suggests that the defence was indifferent\ntowards the delay it was causing.But for this application, it might\nreasonably have been expected that the sentencing judge’s rulings on the first\nabuse of process and s. 11(b) stay applications would have been available on\nthe set date of December 7, 2015, leaving only the sentencing matter to be\nresolved.As a result, the sentencing hearing may well have been concluded on\nJanuary 5, 2016 – a day used for submissions on the second abuse of process\napplication – or shortly thereafter.[75]Jordan holds\nthat “defence actions legitimately taken to respond to the charges” do not\nconstitute defence delay and should not be deducted: Jordan, at paras.\n65-66; see also Cody, at para. 29.In our view, in a post-Jordan\ncase, a frivolous and misconceived defence application or motion is unlikely to\nqualify as a legitimate response to charges against an accused, thus falling\nwithin the ambit of defence delay for the purposes of s. 11(b).Jordan\nessentially says so.[76]Here, however, the appellant’s sentencing\nhearing was conducted at a time when, under the operative s. 11(b) Morin\nframework, tactical defence decisions causing or contributing to delay did not\nhave the same prominence as they now do, under the Jordan regime.[77]Jordan makes\nclear that the new s. 11(b) framework is to be applied contextually and\nflexibly to pre-Jordan cases.As the Jordan court held, at\nparas. 94 and 96: “it is not fair to strictly judge participants in the\ncriminal justice system against standards of which they had no notice.”[78]For this reason, in this transitional case, fairness\nrequires that we decline to treat the additional six and one-half months\nimmediately preceding the date of the appellant’s sentencing as defence delay.[79]There were, however, other periods of defence\ndelay not included in the sentencing judge’s or the Crown’s calculations. Jordan\nrecognizes that defence delay may also result if the court and the Crown are\nready to proceed, but the defence is not. The ensuing delay resulting from that\nunavailability is to be attributed to the defence: Jordan, at para.\n64; Cody, at para. 30.[80]As we will elaborate at paras. 97 and 98 of\nthese reasons, the defence in this case declined available dates for the\ncontinuation of the sentencing hearing due to the unavailability of trial defence\ncounsel, leading to approximately four weeks of additional delay.This delay\nmust be added to the sentencing judge’s defence delay calculation, thereby\nresulting in total defence delay of approximately eight and one-half months.Deduction of this defence delay from the total delay of approximately 38 months\nyields a net delay of 29 and one-half months.This exceeds the ceiling for\ncases tried in the provincial court and, hence, is presumptively unreasonable\nunder the Jordan principles, subject to consideration of “discrete\nevents” – one category of “exceptional circumstances” under Jordan, to\nwhich we now turn.(ii)Exceptional circumstances[81]Exceptional circumstances that may rebut the\npresumption of unreasonable delay are those that lie outside the Crown’s\ncontrol because: i) they are reasonably unforeseen or reasonably unavoidable;\nand ii) they cannot reasonably be remedied by the Crown: Jordan, at\npara. 69; Cody, at para. 45.[82]Jordan holds\nthat, while the list of circumstances that may qualify as exceptional for these\npurposes is not closed, in general, exceptional circumstances fall under two\ncategories: discrete events and particularly complex cases: Jordan, at\npara. 71. Where the delay is reasonably attributable to a discrete event, for instance, to a participant’s\nunexpected illness or other unforeseen medical emergency, the delay\nattributable to that event must be subtracted from the total delay.If the\nexceptional circumstance arises from the complexity of the case, the delay is\nreasonable and no further analysis is required: Jordan, at paras. 75\nand 80.[83]The Crown does not rely in this case on any\ndiscrete event as an exceptional circumstance capable of rebutting the\npresumption of unreasonable delay.Nor did we understand it to argue that this\ncase, viewed as a whole, was sufficiently complex as to justify the overall\ndelay.These factors, therefore, need not be considered further.[84]That said, we note that complexity relating to\nthe offence is nonetheless relevant in considering the reasons for the delay.We will return to this issue later in these reasons.(iii)Transitional exceptional circumstance[85]Given that the Crown is not relying on the type\nof exceptional circumstances described above to rebut the presumption of\nunreasonableness, the s. 11(b) analysis in this case turns on whether the Crown\nhas established that the net delay is justified based on the third form of\nexceptional circumstance recognized in Jordan, namely, “the parties’\nreasonable reliance on the law as it previously existed”: Jordan, at\npara. 96.[86]Jordan\nemphasizes that this transitional exceptional circumstance requires “a\ncontextual assessment, sensitive to the manner in which the previous framework\nwas applied”, as well as “the fact that the parties’ behaviour cannot be judged\nstrictly against a standard of which they had no notice”: Jordan, at\npara. 96.Our consideration of the sentencing judge’s s. 11(b) analysis under\nthe former Morin framework proceeds on this basis.[87]First, the intake period of delay.Recall that\nthe sentencing judge identified 11.5 months (April 17, 2013 to March 31, 2014)\nas neutral inherent delay.In doing so, he addressed the complexity of a\nchild pornography prosecution, holding, at para. 38:That the initial intake period was longer than\nmight have been expected is explained, in part, by the nature of the charge and\nthe fact that police analysis of the computer files in the accused’s hard drive\nis a tedious, time consuming process, and it takes place, for the most part, after the charge is laid. As a result, Crown disclosure\nis delayed, as are Crown-defence discussions and negotiations. There is some\nappellate recognition of the lengthier post-charge investigation process in\nchild pornography cases. [Emphasis in original; Citation omitted.][88]This was a proper and necessary consideration\nunder the Morin framework.There can be no dispute that much of the\ntime consuming forensic investigation in a child pornography case occurs after\nthe charge, leading to a lengthier intake period: R. v. Stilwell, 2014\nONCA 563 (CanLII), 324 O.A.C. 72.[89]Moreover, much of the intake delay here was\ntriggered by the inability of the parties to agree on a sentencing position or\nto achieve an agreed statement of facts.When the Crown ultimately chose to\npresent oral evidence at a sentencing hearing, the parties consented to an\nadjournment to March 31, 2014 to prepare for and accommodate that hearing.The\nparties clearly were not ready to proceed until March 31, 2014.[90]Accordingly, we see no basis for interference with\nthe sentencing judge’s decision to treat 11.5 months as inherent delay.[91]As we have already discussed, the next material\nperiod of delay, March 31, 2014 to November 12, 2014, is properly regarded as\n7.5 months of defence delay, attributable to lack of preparation by the\ndefence.[92]On November 12, 2014, the day the sentencing\nhearing next continued, matters were not concluded.The next hearing date was\nset for December 19, 2014.The appellant required an adjournment to decide\nwhether to launch a Charter application.For its part, the Crown\nsought further production regarding the anticipated evidence of the defence\npsychologist, Dr. Valliant.The sentencing judge considered this one month\ndelay to be neutral inherent delay.We agree.Once again, the parties were\nnot ready to proceed, given the new issues that had arisen.[93]The following four months or so, from December\n19, 2014 to April 23, 2015, was institutional delay under the Morin\nregime.The matter did not conclude on December 19, 2014 and needed to be\ncontinued.The sentencing judge was unavailable, however, until after April\n15, 2015 leading to a continuation date about one week later.[94]The sentencing hearing was still not completed\non April 23, 2015.The evidentiary phase of the hearing ultimately concluded\nat the end of May 2015.Yet the appellant’s s. 11(b) stay application was not\nready to be heard until September 4, 2015.[3]This day proved to be insufficient and a further date of November 2, 2015 was\nassigned.Submissions concluded on that date.[95]Of this entire period of delay, the sentencing\njudge described about five months as neutral inherent delay (April 23, 2015 to\nSeptember 14, 2015) because much of it was caused by the unavailability of\ncounsel over the summer.As we have explained, he did not consider the delay\nafter mid-September 2015.The delay between April 23, 2015 and November 2,\n2015 was approximately six and one-half months.[96]On appeal, the Crown concedes that not all this\ndelay was neutral.Much of it was caused by Crown unavailability.The Crown\naccepts responsibility for delays between: i) April 23, 2015 to May 26, 2015;\nii) May 28, 2015 to September 4, 2015; and iii) September 10, 2015 to November\n2, 2015.Crown counsel was unavailable for dates offered when the court and\ndefence counsel could proceed.The Crown identifies only 15 days between April\n23, 2015 to September 10, 2015 as inherent delay, attributable to hearing dates\nand agreed adjournments.[97]In our view, this overstates the delay\nattributable to the Crown. Dates available to the court in August 2015 were not\nutilized because defence counsel was unavailable.Had he been, the hearing\ncould have continued several weeks before the September 4, 2015 date.[98]While we accept the inherent delay of 15 days\nidentified by the Crown, we also conclude that additional delay of\napproximately four weeks arose from defence counsel’s unavailability.The\nCrown delay under a Morin analysis for the period April 23, 2015 to\nNovember 2, 2015 therefore approaches four and one-half months, rather than\napproximately six months, as suggested by the Crown.[99]The Crown concedes that the period between\nNovember 2 and November 27, 2015 is institutional delay. We agree.[100]The next relevant period of delay is that arising between November\n27, 2015 and the imposition of sentence on June 1, 2016.As already discussed,\nthe Crown urges that this delay should be attributed to the defence.For the\nreasons already given, we disagree.[101]Some of this period, however, was inherent delay. The appellant’s\nsecond abuse of process application, dated November 30, 2015, generated at\nleast 30 days of inherent delay (the pre-hearing filing period applicable in\ncriminal cases).The remainder of this period, approximately five months, was\ninstitutional delay.[102]Of the total net delay of approximately 29 and one-half months\n(total delay minus defence delay), 14 months is therefore properly attributed\nto inherent delay.The remaining delay – approximately 15 and one-half months\n– consists of about 10 months of institutional delay, and about four and\none-half months of Crown delay.The aggregate delay, therefore, exceeds the Morin\nguideline of eight to ten months for cases tried in the provincial court.[103]Viewing the matter as a whole, we conclude that, in the\ncircumstances of this case, the Crown would have understood the delay of\napproximately 15 and one-half months to be justifiable, given its reasonable\nreliance on the Morin regime.We say this for several reasons.[104]First, with the exception of the filing of the appellant’s s. 11(b)\napplication, the conduct of the defence throughout demonstrated a marked\ndisinterest in moving the sentencing hearing forward.As a result, the\nappellant is poorly positioned to complain about the prejudicial impact of\ndelay, an important factor under the Morin framework.[105]Specifically, the record reveals that defence counsel was content to\nengage in protracted exchanges with Crown counsel, attempting to induce a\nchange of election by the Crown and to lower the potential sentencing range\nthat applied.In the meantime, the defence did little to advance the case.Once it was evident that an agreed statement of facts could not be achieved, it\nwas Crown counsel who sought a sentencing hearing.The defence agreed.Yet,\nwhen the set date for that hearing arrived, defence counsel was unprepared:\nstrategic decisions had not been made, and the availability of the defence\nexpert witness had not been ascertained.[106]The defence recalcitrance to a timely resolution did not end there.As we have explained, shortly after its filing, the appellant’s s. 11(b) Charter\napplication was amended to include a claim of abuse of process based on\nalleged prosecutorial misconduct.Then, on the eve of the date set for the\nrelease of the sentencing judge’s rulings on those applications, the defence\nbrought a second, frivolous abuse of process application, complaining of Crown\nconduct dating back many months earlier, to the spring of 2015.That this application\nwould derail the progress of the sentencing hearing was inevitable.[107]Second, we again emphasize that the net delay in this case arose\nprimarily in the context of the appellant’s sentencing hearing, after the\nappellant’s guilty plea and consequential loss of the presumption of\ninnocence.The sentencing judge rightly treated this as a pertinent\nconsideration.We agree with his observations, at para. 40:There is, in my view, a qualitative difference\nbetween a criminal case that proceeds on a not guilty plea and one that\nproceeds on a plea of guilt to the offence charged.In the latter, the accused\nno longer has the presumption of innocence. The disposition (sentencing)\nportion of a criminal case is unquestionably a part of the “trial”.However,\nthe finding of guilt does subtly affect the assessment of prejudice to the\naccused in the interval between such finding and the imposition of sentence.In the present case, the imposition of sentence could have taken place when the\nfinding of guilt was made on March 31, 2014. It was primarily the decisions and\nthe steps taken by the accused from then onwards that has precluded a\nfinalization of the “trial”. The accused has been having his “trial” all along,\nalbeit in a piecemeal fashion.[108]Finally, the seriousness of the offence and prejudice are central\nconsiderations under the Morin framework.They also continue to play\nan important role under the Jordan transitional exceptional\ncircumstance: Cody, at paras. 69-70. As the court said in Cody,\nat para. 71, for a case that pre-dates Jordan, “the focus should be on\nreliance on factors that were relevant under the Morin framework,\nincluding the seriousness of the offence and prejudice.”See also Picard,\nat para. 43.[109]The sentencing judge found that the evidence of prejudice to the\nappellant’s s. 7 Charter interests under the Morin framework was\nmodest.[110]We agree.The record reveals that the prejudice to the appellant\ncaused by the delay was minimal and, to a significant extent, self-inflicted.He was on bail throughout and the Crown consented to the only bail variation\nsought.Further, as we have emphasized, the defence conduct was inconsistent\nwith the objective of a timely resolution.[111]Unquestionably, the offence is also serious.We note, for example,\nthat the current provisions of the Criminal Code stipulate that the\ncharge of making available child pornography is an indictable offence and, upon\nconviction, an accused is subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of\n12 months imprisonment.[112]When all these factors are viewed cumulatively, and in light of the\nreasons for the delay described above, we agree with the sentencing judge’s\nconclusion that the prejudice sustained by the appellant from the delay in this\ncase did not outweigh the societal interest in having his sentencing hearing\nproceed to completion, without a stay of proceedings due to delay.To\nparaphrase the language from Jordan, the Crown would have understood\nthe delay to be reasonable, given expectations under Morin. Hence, the delay\nwas reasonable under the Jordan transitional exceptional circumstance.[113]We therefore reject this ground of appeal.Disposition[114]For the reasons given, the appeal from conviction is dismissed,\nleave to appeal sentence is granted, and the sentence appeal is dismissed.Released:“DMP”“E.A.\nCronk J.A.”“NOV 27 2017”“I\nagree R.G.

ROBERT JOSEPH DUGUAY (Applicant/Appellant)BEFORE:McMURTRY C.J.O.,\nMOLDAVER and BORINS JJ.A.COUNSEL:Paul Bursteinfor the appellantM. David Lepofskyfor the respondentHEARD:January 14, 1998E\nN D O R S E M E N T[1]After trial by judge and jury, the\nappellant was convicted of the offences of attempted murder, aggravated\nassault, and using a firearm in the commission of an indictable offence. He\nreceived a sentence totalling 13 years imprisonment. The appellant appeals only\nfrom his conviction on the offence of attempted murder. He also appeals against\nhis sentence.APPEAL AGAINST CONVICTION[2]The appellant essentially raised\ntwo grounds of appeal.[3]First, he submitted that the trial\njudge erroneously left the jury with the impression that the defence of\ndrunkenness would apply only if the jury believed, or had a reasonable doubt,\nthat at the time of the shootings, the appellant, by reason of his alcohol\nconsumption, lacked the capacity to form the requisite intent to kill.[4]Having regard to the circumstances\nof this case and in particular, the fact that the appellant fired a shotgun at\nthe victim Ms. St. Jules from close range, it is our view that it was\nappropriate for the trial judge to use the \"two-step\" approach and\ninstruct the jury on the legal implications of the appellant's alcohol\nconsumption both in terms of lack of capacity and actual intent.[5]Throughout his charge, the trial\njudge was careful to distinguish the two concepts. While it is true that on\noccasion he may have emphasized the issue of lack of capacity, when the charge\nis read as a whole, we are satisfied that the jury would have fully appreciated\nthe distinction between lack of capacity and actual intent and would not been\nmisled into thinking that the appellant's alcohol consumption could only enure\nto his benefit if it deprived the appellant of the capacity to form the\nrequisite intent to kill. This is particularly so when one considers the trial\njudge's response to the second question posed by the jury. In that response,\nthe trial judge directed the jury in no uncertain terms that the appellant\ncould not be convicted of attempted murder if the jury believed, or had a\nreasonable doubt, that at the time of the shootings, he either lacked the\ncapacity to form the intent to kill or in fact did not intend to kill. It is\nnoteworthy that this was the last word the jury heard on the subject.[6]Our conclusion that the jury was\nnot misled by the \"two-step\" approach is bolstered by the fact that\non the second count of attempted murder involving the victim Darrel Poliquin,\nthe jury returned a verdict of not guilty as charged but guilty to the lesser\nand included offence of aggravated assault. Given that the appellant did not\nraise the issue of inconsistent verdicts as a ground of appeal, the jury's\nverdict on the second count serves to refute the suggestion that the\n\"two-step\" approach was misleading. Accordingly, we see no merit in\nthis issue.[7]The appellant also complained that\nthe trial judge failed to adequately link the issue of drunkenness to the\ncommon sense inference \"that a sane and sober person intends the natural\nconsequences of his acts.\" We see no merit in this submission.[8]The trial judge made it clear to\nthe jury that the common sense inference was one which could be displaced if,\nafter considering all of the facts and circumstances, the jury believed, or had\na reasonable doubt, that the inference should not be drawn.[9]Immediately following this\ninstruction, the trial judge emphasized that in determining the appellant's\nintent, the jury was to consider all of the facts and circumstances relevant to\nthe appellant's state of mind at the time of the shootings. After providing the\njury with a brief overview of the evidence relevant to the appellant's state of\nmind at the crucial time, the trial judge commenced his instructions on the law\nof drunkenness by observing that \"the consumption of alcohol is also a\nrelevant circumstance in assessing the accused's state of mind at the time of\nthe shooting.\" This instruction is found one page after the trial judge's\ndiscussion of the common sense inference and the manner in which the jury was\nto approach that inference.[10]To summarize, the trial judge\ndirected the jury that the common sense inference was one which they could draw\nonly after an assessment of all of the facts and circumstances, including the\nevidence of intoxication and that the inference would not apply if the jury was\nleft in any reasonable doubt about the appellant's intent. In our view, these\ninstructions complied with the principles enunciated in R. v. Seymour\n(1996), 1996 CanLII 201 (SCC), 106 C.C.C. (3d) 520 (S.C.C.) and we would accordingly reject this\nground of appeal.[11]With respect to the second ground\nof appeal, the appellant submitted that his s. 10(b) Charter rights\nwere violated when the police continued to take a statement from him after his\naborted attempt to contact counsel at 11:19 p.m., shortly after his arrival at\nthe police station. According to the appellant, upon learning of the abortive\nattempt, the police were obliged to advise the appellant of his right to a\nreasonable opportunity to contact a lawyer, as well as their obligation to\nrefrain from taking any further statements from him until he had been given a\nreasonable opportunity to exercise that right. (R. v. Prosper (1995), 1994 CanLII 65 (SCC), 92\nC.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.))[12]The legal principles cited by the appellant\nare sound. The problem with his argument lies in the fact that, apart from\nspeculation, there was no evidence to establish that in the 11:19 p.m. call,\nthe appellant did not speak to his lawyer. Moreover, even if it could be\nassumed that the appellant failed to reach his lawyer in that call, there was\nno evidence that the appellant informed the police of his inability to do so.[13]On the voir dire, the\nappellant testified that he had no recollection of the 11:19 p.m. call. In his\nstatements to Officer Vallee later that evening, the appellant at one point\nsaid that he had not contacted his lawyer earlier on and at another point, he\nsaid that he had. Constable Gallagher's evidence on this point was vague and\ninconclusive and went no further than to indicate that the appellant may have\nunsuccessfully attempted to contact his lawyer, but he could not be certain of\nthis.[14]In sum, the evidence falls short\nof laying the foundation required to trigger the additional informational\ncomponents referred to in Prosper, supra. It follows, in our view, that\nthe appellant's s. 10(b) rights were not violated in the manner suggested and\naccordingly, his statements to the police were admissible.[15]Even if we are wrong in this, in\nour view, the appellant's statements were properly admissible under s. 24(2).\nThe trial judge found as a fact that, at all material times, the appellant had\nan almost irresistible desire to confess. In the words of the trial judge, the\nappellant \"was determined to make his confession.\"[16]In view of that finding, we are\nsatisfied on a balance of probabilities that the appellant would not have acted\ndifferently had the police fulfilled their information duty. Consequently, we\nare satisfied that the appellant's incriminating statements would have been made\nassuming his s. 10(b) rights had not been violated. In these circumstances, it\ncannot be said that the admission of the appellant's statements rendered his\ntrial unfair. (R. v. Harper (1994), 1994 CanLII 68 (SCC), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 423 (S.C.C.))[17]For these reasons, we are satisfied\nthat the appellant's statements were properly admitted into evidence and this\nground of appeal must fail.[18]The appeal against conviction is\naccordingly dismissed.SENTENCE[19]The trial judge imposed a sentence\nof 10 years' imprisonment for the offence of attempted murder, one year\nconcurrent on the aggravated assault and three years consecutive for the\noffence of using a firearm in the commission of an indictable offence.[20]Unquestionably, the offences were\nvery serious and we think that the total sentence of 10 years, in addition to\n10 months pre-trial custody, was entirely fit for the offences of attempted\nmurder and aggravated assault. In part, this lengthy sentence was justified\nbecause of the appellant's use of a shotgun in the commission of these\noffences. This aggravating feature was one which the trial judge properly took\ninto account in arriving at the 10 year sentence.[21]It is the three year consecutive\nsentence for the s. 85 offence that causes us concern. The trial judge gave no\nreasons for raising the mandatory minimum sentence for this offence from one to\nthree years. Having regard to all of the circumstances, including the trial\njudge's treatment of the use of the shotgun as an aggravating feature in\nimposing sentence on the substantive offences, we do not think that the trial\njudge was justified in imposing the three year consecutive sentence.\nAccordingly, the three year sentence cannot stand and in its place, a sentence\nof one year consecutive is substituted.[22]In the result, leave to appeal\nsentence is granted and the sentence of three years consecutive imposed on\ncount 3 is reduced to one year consecutive."}

Sampson, K.C., for Crown, respondent.April 18, 1933[1]HAULTAIN, C.J.S.—In each of these cases leave to appeal from\nsentence was given by the Court. The prisoner in each case was tried summarily,\nwith his consent, before Alexander MacDonald, Esquire, a police magistrate in\nand for the province of Saskatchewan.[2]John Piluk: This man was 21 years old, and the charge\nagainst him was robbery with personal violence. He was for this offence\nsentenced to four years’ imprisonment, and to be whipped three times with three\nstrokes of the lash on each whipping.[3]Mike Piluk: This man was 24 years old, and was convicted\non two charges: (1) Robbery, while armed with a rifle, on August 6, 1932; (2)\nRobbery, while armed with a rifle, on September 7, 1932. For the first offence\nhe was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment and to be whipped three times, with\nfive strokes on each whipping. For the second offence he was sentenced to eight\nyears’ imprisonment, to run concurrently with the term of the first\nimprisonment.[4]Nick Woroniuk: This man was 32 years old, and there were\ntwo charges against him: (1) Assault with intent to rob, while armed with a\nrifle; and .(2) Robbery, while armed with a rifle. For the first offence he was\nsentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment, and to be whipped three times, with five\nstrokes on each occasion. For the second offence he was sentenced to eight\nyears’ imprisonment, to run concurrently with the term of the first\nimprisonment.[5]In each of these cases the prisoner was convicted on a plea of\nguilty, and no evidence of any sort was heard either before or after\nconviction.[6]The prisoners were all tried on the same day, and in passing\nsentence the magistrate made the following remarks:I find it hard to conceive of more heinous circumstances\nsurrounding the commission of crimes, the brutality involved in these offences\nis shocking to the public. The victims, defenceless old-people, living quietly\nand peacefully, the remaining days of their lives have been struck with terror.\nAlso old age people similarly situated in these districts no doubt are in fear\nfor their safety. This Court also takes into consideration that it must\nendeavour to give all the assistance possible to prevent reoccurrence of this\nkind of crime by giving an appropriate sentence. I find in each case that your plans have been carefully laid\nand no hasty action entered apparently into the commission, of the crime.[7]In his report to the Court the magistrate stated in part as\nfollows:I beg to state that the above accused pleaded guilty to the\ncharges after electing for trial before me. There was no evidence taken or any\nexhibits filed in these cases. My remarks in passing sentence was taken by a\nstenographer who was engaged by the Crown in these cases. As the stenographer\nhas not attached her affidavit, I am\nsigning same as I have notes of\nthe remarks I gave. I am enclosing\nherewith my remarks in passing sentence. In regard to a report as to my opinion\non these cases, I may state shortly that I\nconsidered deterrent punishment very appropriate. My information as to\nthe circumstances attending the crimes and the reputation of the accused was\nobtained from Crown counsel and from police officers in charge of\ninvestigation, and the statements of the prisoners in the hands of the police.\nNone of these statements however were filed with me.[8]While the aggravating circumstances which accompany any\nparticular act, as, for instance, the victim and the character and previous\nrecord of the prisoner, are matters which may be taken into consideration in\ndetermining the appropriate punishment, all these matters must be properly and\nregularly brought before the Court. In these cases this was not done. One\nBabjuh took part in the offences above mentioned jointly with John Piluk, Mike\nPiluk and Nick Woroniuk, respectively; and after a plea of guilty was sentenced\nfor his part in them. Statements made by him and the other three men were\nobtained by the police, but were not used at any stage of the trial. No evidence\nof the character of any of the accused or of the circumstances attending the\noffences was given. In short, a number of matters were taken into consideration\nby the magistrate which were not properly placed before him, and which could\nnot have failed to influence him in determining the appropriate punishment.[9]The proper practice, and the duty of the Court, in cases of the\nsort is very well stated in Archbold’s Criminal Pleading, 28th ed., at\np. 236, as follows:As an aid to determining the appropriate punishment the Court\nwill, after verdict, hear evidence for the Crown or the defendant, either viva\nvoce or by affidavit * * * It is now the practice after verdict, to hear\nevidence of character generally, and of previous convictions not included in\nthe indictment. In Rex v. Campbell (1911) 75 J.P. 216, 27 T.L.R. 256, 6\nCr. App. R. 131, the Court of Criminal Appeal considered that in all trials\nafter conviction there should be given accurate information as to the general\ncharacter and other material circumstances of the prisoner even though such\ninformation was not available in the form of evidence proper, and that such\ninformation when given could rightly be taken into consideration by the Judge\nin determining the quantum of punishment unless it was challenged and\ncontradicted by or on behalf of the prisoner, in which case the Judge should\neither direct proper proof to be given or should ignore the information. It is\nimportant that there should be precision and accuracy in any such information.\nSee Rex v. Stratton (1914) 10 Cr. App. R. 35; Rex v. Elley (1921)\n85 J.P. 144, 15 Cr. App. R. 143.[10]The Court is therefore of the opinion that the sentence in each\nof these cases was too severe.[11]The Court of Criminal Appeal in England has decided that, as a\ngeneral rule, robbery with violence should be punished by flogging, but that\nlong sentences of penal servitude should not as a rule be given when flogging\nis ordered: Rex v. Swenson and Caba (1918) 13 Cr. App. R. 209; Rex v.\nEntwhistle (1912) 8 Cr. App. R. 93.[12]In Rex v. Swenson and Caba, supra, an original sentence of\nseven years’ penal servitude was changed to imprisonment with hard labour for\n12 months and 20 strokes of the cat. This was a very bad case, in which, after\nbreaking into a shop and stealing a quantity of goods, the prisoners on the\nsame night brutally assaulted the mate of a barge. One of them struck him on\nthe head, and while he was unconscious one of them knelt on his chest and\npunched him in the face, while the other was kicking him on the head.[13]In Rex v. Evans and Ireton (1921) 15 Cr. App. R. 173, a\ncase of robbery with violence and assault, the appellants were each sentenced\nto six months’ imprisonment with hard labour and 18 strokes with the cat. On\nappeal, the Court did not interfere with the sentence of Evans, who had not a\ngood character, but altered the sentence of Ireton, a first offender, 20 years\nof age, to nine months’ imprisonment.[14]In Rex v. Wilder and Townsley (1922) 17 Cr. App. R. 3, the\nappellants were convicted of robbery with violence and assault, and were\nsentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment with hard labour and 20 strokes of the\ncat. On appeal from sentence, it was argued that the appellants, being first\noffenders, should not be flogged, and Rex v. Evans and Ireton, supra, was\ncited in support of that contention. Darling, J., in delivering the judgment of\nthe Court, said:If the headnote [in Rex v. Evans and Ireton] means that\nI thought that first offenders should never be flogged, it is incorrect: I\nnever thought so and I do not now. There may be cases in which it would be\nproper.[15]While of the opinion that the sentences in the present case were\ntoo severe, the frequent cases of robbery with violence or while armed in this\nprovince as disclosed by the records of the Courts, necessitates, in the\nopinion of the Court, more severe punishment than apparently follows Crimes of\na like nature in England.[16]In the case of John Piluk, a first offender and only 21 years of\nage, the sentence of imprisonment will be reduced to two years in the penitentiary,\nwith the whipping as ordered in the original sentence.[17]In the case of Mike Piluk, who was guilty of two offences, the\nsentence of imprisonment for each offence will be reduced to five years in the\npenitentiary, to run concurrently, with the whipping as ordered in the original\nsentence.[18]In the case of Nick Woroniuk, who was guilty of two offences, the\nsentence of imprisonment for each offence will be reduced to five years in the\npenitentiary, to run concurrently, with the whipping as ordered in the original\nsentence.[19]The sentence of John Piluk shall begin to run from the date of\nhis original sentence, as it appears that he was committed to the penitentiary\nimmediately after conviction.[20]In the cases of Mike Piluk and Nick Woroniuk the sentences shall\nbegin to run from the date of this judgment as they have both been confined in\ngaol pending appeal."}

M. HARRADENCE, J[1]On October 1, 2008 I was presiding in docket court in North Battleford.Informations 24348461 and 24343449 were called.This accused, Larry Night,\nwith the assistance of counsel plead guilty to the following two charges:Information\n24348461 - Count 1 – being bound by a Probation Order made by a Judge of\nthe Provincial Court of Saskatchewan on the 19th day of June, A.D.\n2007, without reasonable excuse fail to comply with a condition thereof, to\nwit: that the person shall refrain from the use, possession or\nconsumption of alcohol, other intoxicants or drugs except in accordance with a\nmedical prescription, contrary to section 137 of the Youth Criminal\nJustice Act; andInformation\n24343449– being bound by a Probation Order made by the Youth Justice\nCourt of Saskatchewan on the 19th day of June, A.D. 2007, wilfully\nfail to comply with such Order, to wit: that the young person shall refrain\nfrom the use, possession or consumption of alcohol, other intoxicants or drugs\nexcept in accordance with a medical prescription, contrary to section 137 of the\nYouth Criminal Justice Act.[2]Count #2 on Information 24348461 was withdrawn by the Crown.Crown counsel\nthen advised me, that he and the defence had arrived at a joint submission for\nmy consideration: sixty days custody.After briefly hearing the facts I\ninformed counsel that I had a concern as the facts on the two charges indicated\nto me that the accused had a potential alcohol addiction and my concern was the\npossibility of sentencing an alcohol addicted individual to custody for\nbreaches of an abstinence clause.I invited counsel to make further\nsubmissions and then adjourned sentencing to November 28, 2008 in order to\nallow for the preparation of a Pre-Sentence Report.I was of the opinion that\na Pre-Sentence Report would provide me with helpful information regarding this\nindividual accused, including the degree of his addiction.The report which I\nhave received and reviewed has been of assistance.[3]Some time later on October 1, 2008 this accused was at the residence of\nhis brother when the police were called.After the police arrived and in plain\nview of the police, this accused, who was intoxicated, kicked his brother in\nthe head.He was charged with assault contrary to section 266 and this matter\nis now before me for sentencing, the accused having plead guilty at an earlier\ndate.There is no agreement between counsel in relation to sentencing on the\nassault charge.[4]To say sentencing is an individualized process is trite.[1]This process will and does result in disparity in sentencing.[2]JOINT SUBMISSIONS[5]The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal is abundantly clear that a joint\nsubmission recommended to the Court by experienced counsel should be respected\nby the Court unless it is unreasonable or unfit.[3]We begin with\nthe proposition that the interests of justice are well served by plea bargains\nand joint sentencing submissions. That is of course predicated upon the\nproposed sentence being within the acceptable range. See: R. v. Douglas.Trial judges\nshould not reject joint submissions on sentence unless the joint submission is\neither unreasonable or unfit and if accepted would bring the administration of\njustice into disrepute. Cameron J.A. set out the applicable principles in R.\nv. Webster:Given the\ngeneral point of concern raised by the Attorney General, we decided to grant\nleave to appeal and review the judge's disposition of the case. The principles\nat work in relation to the review were canvassed recently by the Court of\nAppeal for Alberta, in R. v. G.W.C. (2000), 2000 ABCA 333 (CanLII), 277 A.R. 20; 242 W.A.C. 20;\n150 C.C.C. (3d) 513 (C.A.). Speaking for the court in that case, Berger J.A.,\nsaid this at paras. 17-18:The\nobligation of a trial judge to give serious consideration to a joint sentencing\nsubmission stems from an attempt to maintain a proper balance between respect\nfor the plea bargain and the sentencing court's role in the administration of\njustice. The certainty that is required to induce accused persons to waive\ntheir rights to a trial can only be achieved in an atmosphere where the courts\ndo not lightly interfere with a negotiated disposition that falls within or is\nvery close to the appropriate range for a given offence.\"The\nbargaining process is undermined if the resulting compromise recommendation is\ntoo readily rejected by the sentencing judge\" - R. v. Pashe (1995),\n1995 CanLII 6256 (MB CA), 100 Man. R. (2d) 61, at para. 11.Joint submissions ... should be accepted by\nthe trial judge unless they are unfit: R. v. Sinclair, [1996] A.J. No.\n464, at para. 4 (Alta. C.A.) or unreasonable: R. v. Hudson, [1995] A.J.\nNo. 797 at para. 1 (Alta. C.A.). In R. v. Dorsey (1999), 1999 CanLII 3759 (ON CA), 123 O.A.C. 342,\nthe Ontario Court of Appeal held at p. 345 that \"a joint submission should\nbe departed from only where the trial judge considers the joint submission to\nbe contrary to the public interest and, ... if accepted, would bring the\nadministration of justice into disrepute.\"That view accords with the\nposition of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Pashe, supra,\nat para. 12, that \"while a sentencing judge has an overriding discretion\nto reject a joint recommendation, 'there must be good reason to do so,\nparticularly ... where the joint recommendation is made by experienced\ncounsel'.\"[6]As indicated a trial judge does have discretion to reject a joint\nsubmission where he or she is satisfied that the sentence recommended is unfit\nor contrary to the public interest:[4]First, counsel\ncontends the sentencing judge erred in failing to accept the joint sentencing\nsubmission. We disagree. The judge expressly referred to R. v. Webster,\n2001 SKCA 72 (CanLII), 207 Sask. R. 257, the leading authority in this area. As Webster\nexplains, trial judges must give serious consideration to a joint\nsentencing submission and should not reject such a submission unless it is\nunfit or otherwise contrary to the public interest.[7]Where a trial court is considering not following a joint submission\ncounsel should be informed and given an opportunity to make further or\nalternate submissions:[5]Both counsel for the appellant and Crown agree that no opportunity was\ngiven to them to explain the basis for their joint submission once the\nsentencing judge had decided to reject it.Both counsel submit that the\nlaw requires that a trial judge should not reject a joint submission unless it\nis unfit or unreasonable.This principle has been enunciated by the\nSaskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Webster, 2001 SKCA 72 (CanLII), (2001), 207 Sask. R.\n257, where the Court adopted the position of the Alberta Court of Appeal in R.\nv. G.W.C., 2000 ABCA 333 (CanLII),\n(2000), 150 C.C.C. (3d) 513.The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in McKenzie\nv. R., 2006 SKCA 13 (CanLII), 2006 SKCA\n13 endorsed further reasons in G.W.C., supra, and at para. 17 of McKenzie,\nsupra, Vancise J.A. states:. . . Once\nthe sentencing judge had concluded that he might not accept the joint\nsubmission fairness dictates that counsel be given an opportunity to make\nfurther submissions addressing the concerns expressed by a sentencing judge.\nSee: R. v. G.W.C. and R. v. McKerricher, [2005] A.J. No. 1268 (C.A.).[8]I am acutely aware of the negotiations that can go into a joint\nsubmission and the value of such submissions.I am also aware that in many\ninstances details for a joint submission may not be fully canvassed on the\nrecord by counsel.It is for this reason that counsel are given the\nopportunity to consider their position and make further submissions once they\nare aware the trial judge is considering whether or not to follow a joint\nsubmission.I have a great respect for joint submissions and understand that\nthey should be followed unless there is a basis on which to conclude the\nsubmission is unreasonable, unfit or contrary to the public interest.For this\nreason I have deliberately taken some time to consider this matter.INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ACCUSED[9]Larry Night is a youthful adult offender.He is age 19 and has his\ngrade 10 education.He is a Treaty Indian, being a member of the Saulteaux\nFirst Nation.He has no dependents.He accepts full responsibility for his\nactions and expresses a desire to receive alcohol treatment.The Crown\nsubmitted on October 1, 2008 that the accused has an alcohol problem.[10]The Pre-Sentence Report is not atypical of many that are prepared.The\nreport details this accused’s upbringing:[6]Larry\nsaid his home life was difficult as there was alcoholism in the home from his\nmother and her common-law husband, Lorne Moosomin.Larry and his brother\nWinston witnessed violence in the home as Lorne “beat up” his mother on\napproximately five occasions when drinking.This had a long-term negative\neffect on Larry as he continues to think about the violence to this day.Velma\nNight, Larry’s aunt, confirms there was violence in the home and added Larry\nand siblings were raised in a “rough upbringing”.He suffered from verbal and\nemotional abuse from his mother when she was drunk as she swore and yelled at\nhim, called him a “bastard” as well as other derogatory names.He also\nsuffered from physical abuse from his mother as she would slap him and “throw\nme around by the hair” when he was approximately 5-6 years old.She also hit\nhim with a broom on numerous occasions and left marks and bruises.Larry said\nthe violence stopped when he was 14 when he “stood up” to her.He states his\nrelationship with her now has improved and her drinking has declined.In a\n2006 Youth Probation Pre-Sentence Report, Larry revealed he was sexually\nassaulted at the age of 10 by a 17 year old female but did not report it to the\npolice.He did not discuss it with this writer.[11]The report further explains this accused’s history with alcohol:[7]Larry\nwas 13 when he first consumed alcohol and has continued until recently.He\nnormally consumes beer and hard liquor.He said he was drinking everyday from\nJune to October, 2008 with “whatever I could find”.Larry reports his alcohol\nuse has caused him problems legally, medically (frequent blackouts),\neducationally (dropped out of school), employment (showing up late, missing work)\nand his relationship with Melissa Durocher.He admits difficulty in quitting\nalcohol.He said his last consumption of alcohol as of this writing was on\nOctober 15, 2008 at Saulteaux First Nations with his cousins.However, Velma\nNight said she knows parties still happen at his apartment but cannot confirm\nif Larry has been drinking.[12]During the last court appearance Mr. Schmunk indicated that the accused\nwas now living with his girlfriend Tiffany Bear on the Moosomin First Nation.It is obvious from the contents of the Pre-Sentence Report and from the events\nof October 1, 2008 that living in an apartment with his brother was fuelling\nthis accused’s addiction.It appears from his appearance in Court on November\n28, 2008 with his partner that this accused has found, at least for the\npresent, stability with her and in her residence.I requested an update to the\nPre-Sentence Report in order to obtain further information regarding the new\nresidence.David McMaster, probation officer, filed a report dated December\n11, 2008 which reads in its entirety as follows:Larry\nNight reported to my office at 9:00 a.m., December 11, 2008 after his initial Pre-Sentence\nReport hearing.The Court wished to know what his current residential status\nis.As of November 21, 2008 Larry moved out of his apartment at #2 Elders\nLodge Saulteaux First Nation to his girlfriend’s, Tiffany Bear, home.The home\nis owned by her grandfather Clifford Whitecap and grandmother Alice Bear of\nR.R. #3 Hatherleigh District (Moosomin Treaty Land Entitlement), S9A 2X2.Larry\nlisted several reasons for his change of address: a no contact clause with his\nbrother Winston Night who was also his room-mate; his cousin Martin Night was\ngoing to be released from jail and Larry did not want to be negatively\ninfluenced by him; there was too much partying in the apartment and Larry did\nnot want to succumb to temptation and his desire to be with his girlfriend,\nTiffany.Alice\nBear confirmed Larry was living at their home and was helping with farm chores\nas needed.She stated she does not allow alcohol, drugs or negative influences\ninto their home as both her and Clifford have been sober for 29 years.She is\nokay if Larry continues to live there permanently.Larry\nstated he is unemployed at present but was applying at Battleford Publishing\nfor labour work.This writer gave Larry a list of current available jobs in\nthe North Battleford area should he not secure employment.Larry reports he\nhad one drink of alcohol on November 15, 2008 but none since.He said he is\nnot allowed to consume alcohol around Tiffany and she confirmed this.He is\ncurrently collecting Social Assistance but expressed a desire to maintain a\nregular pay cheque.[13]The accused does have a youth record which contains 26 convictions.(It\nwas a Youth Probation Order that he breached as an adult in this instance.)Significantly, of the 26 convictions, 11 are for failing to abide by a Court\norder.Three convictions are for mischief, four convictions are for\nobstruction, four convictions are for assault, two of these are causing bodily\nharm.A conviction for uttering threats and two theft related convictions are\nalso included in the accused’s record.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCES[14]The circumstances of the offences are straightforward:a)On June 29, 2008 police attended to the fairgrounds at approximately\n7:30 p.m.The accused was passed out.He was very intoxicated.He was held\nin cells until sober and at this time a determination was made that he was on a\nprobation order with an abstinence clause.b)On August 15, 2008 police attended a complaint of a fight.They spoke\nto the accused and as a result suspected him of being intoxicated.The accused\nadmitted to drinking and it was subsequently determined that he was on a\nprobation order with an abstinence clause.c)On October 1, 2008 as previously indicated, police attended to the\naccused’s brother’s apartment to investigate a complaint of a disturbance.The\naccused was present in the apartment and in full view of the officers he kicked\nhis brother in the head.He was intoxicated but at this time not bound by\nconditions of his probation order, which had expired on September 17, 2008.ANALYSIS[15]I am of the view that to sentence an alcoholic to a probation order that\nrequires him not to drink likely leads to an inevitable breach and therefore is\nmerely setting him up for a breach.This is not the purpose of probation.An\nabstinence clause should not be included in a probation order, if there is\ncompelling evidence that the accused is addicted to alcohol, without careful\nconsideration.I elaborate in my reasons in R. v. Ahenakew.[8]Recently, R. v. Ahenakew was overturned by the Court of Queen’s Bench\nbecause I had, in error attempted to impose a consecutive probation order.However, the Court of Queen’s Bench did not find that the sentence I imposed was\ndemonstrably unfit but rather indicated that their reasons should not be taken\nas an endorsement of my sentencing reasons:[9]While this appeal is granted on the ground of consecutive probation\nsentences, it must be dismissed on the ground of the sentence being\ndemonstrably unfit.That being said, this decision on appeal is not to be\nconsidered as an endorsement of the sentencing judge’s reasons (cited as 2007\nSKPC 108 (CanLII)) for declining to include an abstinence clause in the respondent’s\nterms of probation. As the sentencing judge acknowledged, sentencing is an\nindividualized process. This case is unique on its facts.[16]I place great emphasis on the individualized approach to sentencing.I\nalso remain firmly of the view that where a determination has been made that\nprobation is appropriate, to include an abstinence clause, where the evidence\nestablishes that the individual is addicted to alcohol, requires a focused\ninquiry.[10]Given the staggering numbers of offenders appearing before\nthis Court with alcohol related issues, alcohol abstinence clauses are a\nrelevant inquiry to the vast majority of probation orders. However, as with any\nsentencing, the individual circumstances of the offender must be considered.\nWhere there is compelling evidence that an offender suffers from alcoholism it\nstrikes me that a Court-imposed condition to abstain is not furthering\nrehabilitation or reintegration into society but may in fact limit it. In these\ncircumstances, assessment and treatment clauses would be more appropriate than\nan abstinence clause.Section 732.1 of the Criminal Code recognizes that a\nCourt can impose an abstinence clause as part of the optional conditions in a\nprobation order. Once the Court has determined that a probation order is\nappropriate, it is my view that an inquiry should be conducted to determine\nwhether an abstinence clause is an appropriate optional condition. Given the\nnumber of offenders who are appearing before this Court with alcohol issues, it\nmay well be that an abstinence clause would serve to assist their rehabilitation,\nhowever, where there is evidence that the offender is an alcoholic placing them\non an abstinence clause will only serve to lead to an inevitable breach and\nfurther criminal consequences. This is not the objective of probation and\nindeed it is punishing an offender for suffering from the illness of\nalcoholism.[17]I find support for this principle in the short decision of the Manitoba\nCourt of Appeal in R. v. Hall:[11]1The accused appeals\nthe sentence of ten months which was imposed upon him on a charge of\ntheft.He had spent about three and one-half months of pre-sentence\ndetention with respect to this offence.2We are not persuaded\nthat the sentence is an unfit one considering the circumstances of the offence\nand the offender.3We do, however,\ngrant leave to appeal in order to set aside a condition which was imposed on\nthe two-year probation order which is to follow the gaol sentence.4It is unrealistic\nto impose a condition that the accused abstain from the consumption of alcohol\nduring his probation when the past history indicates that he is addicted to\nalcohol.That condition is deleted. (Emphasis added)[18]I am of the opinion that if an abstinence clause in a probation order is\ninappropriate given the individual circumstances of the accused, it follows\nlogically that the sentence for the breach of that condition should reflect the\nfact that a breach was in all probability inevitable.This Court should not\njail an alcoholic for drinking if he is not a danger to the community.Mr.\nJacques, on behalf of the Crown, took the position that this accused should be\nsent to jail not because he is an alcoholic but because he breached a Court order.In order to ensure that the individualized approach to sentencing is respected,\nthe Court is required to look at the effect of an individual’s actions and the\nreasons for those actions, particularly in relation to a conviction for a\nsystem generated charge, such as a breach of probation.Throughout this\nindividualized sentencing process the Court must be mindful of the six\nfundamental principles of sentencing:[12]•to denounce unlawful conduct;•to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;•to separate offenders from society, where necessary;•to assist in rehabilitating offenders;•to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the\ncommunity; and•to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and\nacknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.[19]I find that the offences before the Court were the result of excessive\nalcohol consumption.I further find that the evidence satisfies me that the\naccused has over the past six years developed a severe dependence on alcohol.He is youthful.He is not a danger to the community.There is a reasonable\nprospect for his rehabilitation.I am reminded of the Saskatchewan Court of\nAppeal’s frequently repeated and applied direction regarding youthful\noffenders:[13]In\nmy view, the public can best be protected by the imposition of sentences that\npunish the offender for the offence committed; that may deter him and others\nfrom committing such an offence and that may assist in his reformation and\nrehabilitation.If the offender is one for whom reformation is beyond\nquestion, then the public can be protected only by depriving him of his\nfreedom.In the case of other offenders, and particularly young offenders, the\nprincipal element for consideration, consonant with the maintenance of public\nconfidence in the effective enforcement of the criminal law, should be the\noffender’s reformation and rehabilitation.This view finds support in the\n“Report of the Canadian Committee on Corrections”, which at p. 18 states:The\nCommittee sees the overall end of the criminal process as the protection of\nsociety and believes that this is best achieved by an attempt to rehabilitate\noffenders in that society is given long term protection at least expense in\nhuman values and material resources.The Committee believes that traditionally\npunishment has been over-stressed as a means of crime prevention yet it does\nnot deny the necessity for punishment as a sanction and it accepts that in some\ncases the person may be so dangerous as to justify his segregation from the\ncommunity for periods up to the whole of his life.[20]These comments are analogous to the direction provided by the Supreme\nCourt of Canada in Proulx when referring to restorative justice\nprinciples, for all offenders:[14]Parliament has mandated that expanded use be made of\nrestorative principles in sentencing as a result of the general failure of\nincarceration to rehabilitate offenders and reintegrate them into society. By\nplacing a new emphasis on restorative principles, Parliament expects both to\nreduce the rate of incarceration and improve the effectiveness of sentencing.\nDuring the second reading of Bill C-41 on September 20, 1994 (House of\nCommons Debates, vol. IV, 1st Sess., 35th Parl., at p. 5873), Minister of\nJustice Allan Rock made the following statements:A general principle that runs throughout Bill C-41 is that\njails should be reserved for those who should be there. Alternatives should be\nput in place for those who commit offences but who do not need or merit\nincarceration.. . .Jails and prisons will be there for those who need them,\nfor those who should be punished in that way or separated from society. . . .\n[T]his bill creates an environment which encourages community sanctions and the\nrehabilitation of offenders together with reparation to victims and promoting\nin criminals a sense of accountability for what they have done.It is not\nsimply by being more harsh that we will achieve more effective criminal\njustice. We must use our scarce resources wisely.[21]I find that there is reason to believe that this accused will respond\npositively to treatment if it is consistently offered and supported over a\nsignificant period of time.Mr. Jacques indicated in his submission that after\na point the service providers stop making referrals.While I understand the\nreasons for this approach it is evident to me that an alcoholic quite often requires\nsustained treatment efforts.This accused now says he is motivated to obtain\ntreatment and he appears to have found some measure of stability.I am also mindful\nthat this accused is of First Nations descent.I therefore apply section\n718.2(e) of the Criminal Code:[15]A\nCourt that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following\nprinciples:(e)All\navailable sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the\ncircumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention\nto the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.[22]Mr. Justice Cory directed sentencing judges to apply section 718.2(e) in\nthe following manner:[16]Section 718.2(e)\ndirects a Court, in imposing a sentence, to consider all available sanctions\nother than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances for all\noffenders, “with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders”.\nThe broad role of the provision is clear. As a general principle, s. 718.2(e)\napplies to all offenders, and states that imprisonment should be the penal\nsanction of last resort.Prison is to be used only where no other sanction or\ncombination of sanctions is appropriate to the offence and the offender.[23]I therefore exercise restraint in considering whether to incarcerate\nthis individual.When I consider all of the circumstances I conclude that to\nsentence this accused to custody would be demonstrably unfit and contrary to\nthe long-term public interest.The 60 days recommended on the two breach\ncharges is more akin to a tariff sentence than an individualized sentence.The\njoint submission is rejected.[24]I therefore must determine an appropriate sentence for this individual\naccused. As part of the process, I must consider a conditional sentence.According to Proulx as a preliminary matter I must consider whether a\npenitentiary sentence is appropriate.It is not.I must also consider as part\nof the threshold inquiry whether probationary measures are appropriate. [17][25]In this inquiry I appreciate that in addition to the charges of breach\nof probation there is also the charge of assault.I have therefore considered\nthe circumstances of the assault.The circumstances indicate that this assault\nwas fueled by alcohol.The assault was sudden, occurring in the presence of\npolice officers and resulted in no injuries.[26]In all of the circumstances I am of the view that the appropriate\nresponse to all three charges cumulatively, is a sentence of probation.SUMMARY[27]To reiterate I find the evidence does not satisfy me that the offender\nshould be separated from society (section 718(e) of the Criminal Code of\nCanada).I am satisfied that his unlawful conduct can be denounced and he,\nas well as other offenders, can be deterred without incarceration.I have\nconcluded that probationary conditions specific to this accused and these\ncircumstances, will have the effect of assisting his rehabilitation, as well as\nrequiring him to provide reparations to the community and promote in him a\nsense of responsibility.[28]I therefore suspend the passing of sentence in relation to all three\ncharges to which he has plead guilty and impose a probation order for a period\nof 9 months concurrent on each charge with the following conditions:1.The mandatory conditions contained in section 732.1 of the Criminal\nCode of Canada:a)Keep the peace and be of good behaviour;b)Appear before the Court when required to do so, the first appearance to\nbe Wednesday, January 21, 2009 at 3:00 p.m. and thereafter as required;c)Notify the Court or the probation officer in advance of any change of\nname or address and promptly notify the Court or probation office of any change\nof employment or occupation.2.The following additional conditions:d)Report to a probation officer within two working days of the making of\nthis order;e)Maintain a residence as directed by the probation officer and not change\nthat residence except with the order of the Court or with the permission of a\nprobation officer;f)Not attend at any premises where the primary function is the sale of\nalcohol;g)Attend such treatment as is ordered by the probation officer, including\nin-residence treatment for alcohol abuse;h)Attend such personal counseling as is ordered by the probation officer;i)Perform 30 hours of community service work within the first 6 months of\nprobation.[29]I specifically have not included an abstinence clause as I believe that\nit will not enhance the rehabilitation of this offender.It would not be a\nsurprise if he has a slip with the use of alcohol.I am hopeful he does not.However,\nif he does I do not want the use of alcohol, without any further substantive\ncharge to result in a charge of breach of probation.Rehabilitation is the\nprimary goal of probation.[18][30]This is a suspended sentence.If it is proven that the offender has\nbreached any terms of this sentence the sentence can be revisited.[19]I appreciate that this is not done in practice, however, it is what the law\nallows and I am of the view that this mechanism can assist in promoting a sense\nof responsibility in this offender.[31]Finally, in relation to the victim surcharge I am satisfied by the\ncontents of the Pre-Sentence Report that imposing a surcharge for all of the\noffences would create a hardship for this accused.I therefore exercise my\ndiscretion as contained in section 737(5) of the Criminal Code of Canada\nand waive the surcharge in relation to the two convictions for breach of\nprobation, but impose a surcharge of $50 on the assault charge (Information\n2429368) and will allow until March 31, 2009 for payment.Dated at the City of Prince Albert, in the\nProvince of Saskatchewan, this 17th day of December, 2008.____________________________________H.

Skinner (R.W.)Date: 2000-02-25Docket: 1999060107Between:Her Majesty The QueenandRobert Wesley SkinnerDymond, J.Counsel:Marcus Evans, for the Federal Crown;Donovan Molloy, for the Provincial Crown;Michael Ralph, for the defendant.[1]Dymond, J. [orally]: Mr. Robert Wesley Skinner has pleaded guilty\nto one count of possession for the purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2)\nof the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, R.S.C., which took place on\nOctober 14th, 1999. He has also pleaded guilty to breach of probation.[2]Mr. Skinner is 29 years of age with a grade 10 education. Except\nfor a six week welding course, he has no other formal training. He has a common\nlaw relationship with a Trina Piercey, presently aged 25 years. They have two\nchildren aged five years and two years. The relationship has been ongoing for\n11 years and they have been residing together for the past five years.[3]As to Mr. Skinner's work history, he has worked as a fish processor\nat FPI for two years in the late 1980s. He has been on Social Assistance for\nthe last six and a half years. His present total income from all sources is\n$792 per month. His only job prospect at the present time is as a tattoo artist\nin Ontario. He has been unemployed for the last number of years.[4]Section 5(4) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act states\nthat possession for the purpose of trafficking imposes a maximum period of\nimprisonment of five years in jail less one day if the drug is marijuana or\nhashish and the amount is less than 3 kg.[5]The amount seized as a result of a valid search warrant by the\nRCMP in Fortune was the amount of 9 grams which was individually wrapped in\ntinfoil along with a customer list. There were no scales seized. The accused\nwould be considered a street trafficker. He admitted in his presentence report\nto using about one gram of hashish per day. Mr. Skinner does not consider\nhimself having a drug problem. However, Mr. Skinner does appear to have a\ndependency and this has to be acknowledged by the accused.[6]There are some mitigating factors. The accused pleaded guilty and\nthus saved considerable court time in relation to a preliminary inquiry and a\ntrial on this matter. These factors have to be considered. As well, the drug was\ncannabis resin, a relatively soft drug. The accused has a family and his common\nlaw spouse has indicated in the presentence report that he is supportive of her\nand the children. She describes him as a caring person.[7]The aggravating factor is that he has a criminal record for\nproperty offences as late as April, 1999. One for theft and one for possession\nof stolen goods. He was given ten days on each count concurrent. There was also\na break and entry in June of 1992 which is rather dated at this point in time.\nHe was on probation at the time of this offence which is another aggravating\nfactor.Position Of The Parties[8]The Crown has taken the position on sentencing that deterrence is\nthe major principle of sentencing that has to be addressed by the court. The\nCrown takes the position that the prior record weighs against anything other\nthan incarceration of the accused. Defence counsel requested a presentence\nreport which I have had the opportunity to review in some detail. The report is\npositive and the factors as pointed out earlier in the decision have been\nreviewed as the report relates to the family and work history.[9]The defence argues that the plea of guilty of a small quantity of\ndrugs in his possession are factors that would allow the court a discretion as\nto some other disposition other than incarceration. The defence requests a fine\nplus probation in relation to the accused's disposition. The Crown has\nrequested a minimum of three to six months on the charge of possession for the\npurposes of trafficking and a further period of incarceration for breach of\nprobation to be consecutive to the time served on the trafficking charge.Analysis Of Sentencing Principles[10]The Crown has argued that any sentence imposed not be a\nconditional sentence. The defence, however, has argued that any sentence should\nbe a conditional sentence if the court deems that probation plus a fine is\ninappropriate.[11]Since this offence has been committed the Supreme Court of Canada\nhas filed a number of cases on appeal from conditional sentencing from several\nprovinces of Canada. The decisions were all heard on May 25th and 26th of 1999\nand written decisions were rendered on January 31st, 2000. The cases were R. v. Proulx (J.D.K.), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] S.C.J. No. 6; 249 N.R. 201; 142 Man.R.(2d) 161;\n212 W.A.C. 161 (S.C.C.); R. v. Bunn (T.A.), 2000 SCC 9 (CanLII), [2000] S.C.J. No. 10; 249\nN.R. 296; 142 Man.R.(2d) 256; 212 W.A.C. 256 (S.C.C.); R. v. R.A.R.,\n2000 SCC 8 (CanLII), [2000] S.C.J. No. 9; 249 N.R. 322; 142 Man.R.(2d) 282; 212 W.A.C. 282 (S.C.C.);\nR. v. R.N.S., 2000 SCC 7 (CanLII), [2000] S.C.J. No. 8; 249 N.R. 365; 132 B.C.A.C. 1; 215\nW.A.C. 1 (S.C.C.); and R. v. L.F.W., 2000 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2000] S.C.J. No. 7; 249 N.R. 345;\n185 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 1; 562 A.P.R. 1 (S.C.C.).[12]For the purposes of this decision I will refer to the main\ndecision which was the decision handed down by Chief Justice Lamer, the case is\nR. v. Proulx, supra. None of the decisions that were handed down by the\nSupreme Court of Canada on that date were cases dealing with drug trafficking.\nThe court set out principles for lower courts to follow in determining whether\nor not a particular case is one in which the conditional sentencing principles\nof the Criminal Code, s. 742.1 should apply. These cases are probably\nthe most important decisions handed down by the Supreme Court of Canada on\nsentencing since R. v. Gladue (J.T.), 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688; 238 N.R. 1;\n121 B.C.A.C. 161; 198 W.A.C. 161; 133 C.C.C.(3d) 385. That case dealt with the\nsentencing and considerations in relation to aboriginal offenders.[13]As such, the principles set out have to be reviewed to determine\nwhether these principles can be applied to the facts and circumstances of Mr.\nSkinner and his antecedents. The case is quite lengthy, some 130 paragraphs,\nspanning over 40 pages. For the purposes of this decision I will refer only to\na portion of the decision.[14]At para. 127 on p. 34 of the unreported decision Mr. Justice\nLamer summarizes 13 principles of law as it relates to conditional sentencing.\nThese principles have to be applied by trial judges to determine whether\nconditional sentencing is or is not appropriate to the facts of a case. For\nclarity, I will set out these 13 points below:\"1. Bill C-41 in general and the conditional sentence in\nparticular were enacted both to reduce reliance on incarceration as a sanction\nand to increase the use of principles of restorative justice in sentencing.\"2. A conditional sentence should be distinguished from\nprobationary measures. Probation is primarily a rehabilitative sentencing tool.\nBy contrast, Parliament intended conditional sentences to include both punitive\nand rehabilitative aspects. Therefore, conditional sentences should generally\ninclude punitive conditions that are restrictive of the offender's liberty.\nConditions such as house arrest should be the norm, not the exception.\"3. No offences are excluded from the conditional\nsentencing regime except those with a minimum term of imprisonment, nor should\nthere be presumptions in favour of or against a conditional sentence for\nspecific offences.\"4. The requirement in s. 742.1(a) that the judge impose\na sentence of imprisonment of less than two years does not require the judge to\nfirst impose a sentence of imprisonment of a fixed duration before considering\nwhether that sentence can be served in the community. Although this approach is\nsuggested by the text of s. 742.1(a), it is unrealistic and could lead to unfit\nsentences in some cases. Instead, a purposive interpretation of s. 742.1(a)\nshould be adopted. In a preliminary determination, the sentencing judge should\nreject a penitentiary term and probationary measures as inappropriate. Having\ndetermined that the appropriate range of sentence is a term of imprisonment of\nless than two years, the judge should then consider whether it is appropriate\nfor the offender to serve his or her sentence in the community.\"5. As a corollary of the purposive interpretation of s.\n742.1(a), a conditional sentence need not be of equivalent duration to the\nsentence of incarceration that would otherwise have been imposed. The sole\nrequirement is that the duration and conditions of a conditional sentence make\nfor a just and appropriate sentence.\"6. The requirement in s. 742.1(b) that the judge be\nsatisfied that the safety of the community would not be endangered by the\noffender serving his or her sentence in the community is a condition precedent\nto the imposition of a conditional sentence, and not the primary consideration\nin determining whether a conditional sentence is appropriate. In making this\ndetermination, the judge should consider the risk posed by the specific\noffender, not the broader risk of whether the imposition of a conditional\nsentence would endanger the safety of the community by providing insufficient\ngeneral deterrence or undermining general respect for the law. Two factors\nshould be taken into account: (1) the risk of the offender re-offending; and\n(2) the gravity of the damage that could ensue in the event of re-offence. A\nconsideration of the risk posed by the offender should include the risk of any\ncriminal activity, and not be limited solely to the risk of physical or\npsychological harm to individuals.\"7. Once the prerequisites of s. 742.1 are satisfied, the\njudge should give serious consideration to the possibility of a conditional\nsentence in all cases by examining whether a conditional sentence is consistent\nwith the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to\n718.2. This follows from Parliament's clear message to the judiciary to reduce\nthe use of incarceration as a sanction.\"8. A conditional sentence can provide significant\ndenunciation and deterrence. As a general matter, the more serious the offence,\nthe longer and more onerous the conditional sentence should be. There may be\nsome circumstances, however, where the need for denunciation or deterrence is\nso pressing that incarceration will be the only suitable way in which to\nexpress society's condemnation of the offender's conduct or to deter similar\nconduct in the future.\"9. Generally, a conditional sentence will be better than\nincarceration at achieving the restorative objectives of rehabilitation,\nreparations to the victim and the community, and promotion of a sense of\nresponsibility in the offender and acknowledgement of the harm done to the\nvictim and the community.\"10. Where a combination of both punitive and restorative\nobjectives may be achieved, a conditional sentence will likely be more\nappropriate than incarceration. Where objectives such as denunciation and\ndeterrence are particularly pressing, incarceration will generally be the\npreferable sanction. This may be so notwithstanding the fact that restorative\ngoals might be achieved. However, a conditional sentence may provide sufficient\ndenunciation and deterrence, even in cases in which restorative objectives are\nof lesser importance, depending on the nature of the conditions imposed, the\nduration of the sentence, and the circumstances of both the offender and the\ncommunity in which the conditional sentence is to be served.\"11. A conditional sentence may be imposed even where\nthere are aggravating circumstances, although the need for denunciation and\ndeterrence will increase in these circumstances.\"12. No party is under a burden of proof to establish\nthat a conditional sentence is either appropriate or inappropriate in the\ncircumstances. The judge should consider all relevant evidence, no matter by\nwhom it is adduced. However, it would be in the offender's best interests to\nestablish elements militating in favour of a conditional sentence.\"13. Sentencing judges have a wide discretion in the\nchoice of the appropriate sentence. They are entitled to considerable deference\nfrom appellate courts. As explained in C.A.M., supra, at para. 90: 'Put\nsimply, absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or\nan overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only\nintervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably\nunfit'.\"Application To The Facts Of The Case[15]After setting out these principles, I will attempt to apply these\nprinciples to the facts of this case. The case before the court is a case of\npossession of a small quantity of drugs, 8 to 9 grams. Under s. 5(4) of the Controlled\nDrugs and Substances Act, R.S.C. 1996, c. 19 as amended, the maximum period\nof incarceration is five years less a day. The purpose of interpretation of s.\n742.1(a) requests the trial judge to determine first of all if probation or\nincarceration into a penitentiary are appropriate considerations as it relates\nto the facts of the case. The Crown has not requested a period of incarceration\nof more than six months. The accused does not have the means of paying a large\nfine, as was the case in R. v. Butt (A.H.) and Gallant (M.A.) (1993),\n1993 CanLII 7743 (NL CA), 106 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 92; 334 A.P.R. 92 (Nfld. C.A.) or R. v. Jesso\n(A.J.) et al. (1994), 1994 CanLII 10382 (NL SCTD), 117 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 154; 365 A.P.R. 154 (Nfld.\nT.D.). In these cases there was a work history and it was likely that the\naccused would be able to pay larger fines.[16]This is not the case with the accused in this case. He has no\nwork history and has been on social assistance for a number of years. His job\nskills will have to be improved. He does say he can work as a tattoo artist and\ndid provide a letter from an employer on the Mainland indicating that he could\nhave potential employment. But this has come late in the day and only after\nbeing charged with the offence before the court. Mr. Skinner's work history\nspeaks for itself. As such, I have determined that a fine and probation is\ninappropriate for these charges and the circumstances as outlined. Also I have\ndetermined that a period of over two years for this offence would be totally\ninappropriate. I am satisfied after reviewing R. v. Proulx (supra) that\na conditional sentence is an option in cases dealing with possession for the\npurposes of trafficking. At para. 72 of the decision the court refers\nspecifically to drug cases. This was mentioned by Mr. Justice Lamer in the\ncontext of the offender re-offending. At p. 23 he states as follows:\"For example, a judge may wish to impose a conditional\nsentence with a treatment order on an offender with a drug addiction,\nnotwithstanding the fact that the offender has a lengthy criminal record linked\nto his addiction provided the judge is confident that there is a good chance of\nrehabilitation and that the level of supervision will be sufficient to ensure\nthat the offender complies with the sentence.\"[17]This, at least, on its face does not disqualify a person charged\nwith a drug offence or even a person addicted with a lengthy criminal record\nfrom qualifying for a conditional sentence if the judge deems it appropriate\nunder the circumstances.[18]The conditional sentencing provisions were introduced in the\namendments to Part XXIII of the Criminal Code. Two of the main objectives\nunderline the reform of Part XXIII were to reduce the use of incarceration as a\nsanction and to give greater prominence to the principles of restorative\njustice in sentencing, the objectives of rehabilitation, repatriation to the\nvictim and the community, and the promotion of a sense of responsibility in the\noffender:[19]Mr. Justice Lamer at para. 99 of Proulx (supra) states as\nfollows:\"The conditional sentence facilitates the achievement of\nboth of Parliament's objectives. It affords the sentencing judge the\nopportunity to craft a sentence with appropriate conditions that can lead to\nthe rehabilitation of the offender, reparations to the community, and the\npromotion of a sense of responsibility in ways that jail cannot. However, it is\nalso a punitive sanction. Indeed, it is the punitive aspect of conditional\nsentence that distinguishes it from probation. It was not Parliament's\nintention that offenders who would otherwise have gone to jail for up to two\nyears less a day now be given probation or some equivalent thereof. Thus, a\nconditional sentence can achieve both punitive and restorative objectives. To\nthe extent that both punitive and restorative objectives can be achieved in the\ngiven case, a conditional sentence is likely a better sanction than\nincarceration. Where the need for punishment is particularly pressing, and\nthere is little opportunity to achieve any restorative objectives,\nincarceration will likely be the more attractive sanction. However, even where\nrestorative objectives cannot be readily satisfied, a conditional sentence will\nbe preferable to incarceration in cases where a conditional sentence can\nachieve the objectives of denunciation and deterrence as effectively as\nincarceration.\"[20]Whether a conditional sentence would be consistent with the\nfundamental purpose and principle of sentencing, sentencing judges, like myself,\nhave to consider which sentencing objectives figure most prominently in the\nfactual circumstances of the particular case before the court. When a\ncombination of both punitive and restorative objectives may be achieved, a\nconditional sentence will likely be more appropriate than incarceration. Where\npunitive objectives such as denunciation and deterrence are particularly\npressing, such as cases in which there are aggravating circumstances,\nincarceration will generally be a preferable sanction.[21]In this case, as in other cases, there are objectives which\nmilitate in favour of a conditional sentence whereas others favour\nincarceration. It is the job of the sentencing judge to look at the importance\nof prevention, deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation and these vary\naccording to the nature of the crime and the circumstances of the offender.\nObviously there is no easy formula or test that a trial judge, such as myself,\ncan apply in weighing these factors. Much depends on the circumstances\nsurrounding the particular offence and the offender.[22]In relation to s. 718.3(1) of the Criminal Code states\nthat:\"Where an enactment prescribes different kinds of\npunishment in respect of an offence, the punishment to be imposed is, subject\nto the limitations subscribed in the enactment, in the discretion of the court\nthat convicts a person who commits the offence.\"(2) where an enactment prescribes a punishment in\nrespect of an offence, the punishment to be imposed is subject to the\nlimitations subscribed in the enactment, in the discretion of the court that\nconvicts a person who commits the offence, but no punishment is a minimum\npunishment unless it is declared to be a minimum punishment.\"[23]In the case before the court there is no minimum punishment as\nprescribed by law. And the sentence to be imposed in all the circumstances will\nbe less than two years so therefore the basic criteria has been met for a\nconditional sentence in this particular case.[24]The court has to be satisfied that the imposition of a\nconditional sentence would not endanger the safety of the community if\nappropriate conditions were imposed. In relation to whether or not it would be\na danger to the community to release the offender into the community to serve\nhis sentence one has to look at the risk of reoffending and as well the gravity\nof the damage that could ensue in the event of an accused re-offending. In\nrelation to the reoffending the court has to take into consideration several\nfactors.1. The nature of the offence;2. The relevant circumstances of the offence which can be put\nin issue prior and subsequent incidents;3. The degree of participation of the accused;4. The relationship of the accused with the victim;5. The profile of the accused that is his or her occupation,\nlifestyle, criminal record, family situation and mental state;6. His or her conduct following the commission of the offence;7. The danger which the interim release of the accused\nrepresents for the community, notably the part of the community effected by the\nmatter.[25]The risk of re-offence should also be assessed in light of the\nconditions attached to the sentence. Where an offender might pose some risk of\nendangering the safety of the community, it is possible that this risk be\nreduced to a minimum one by the imposition of appropriate conditions to the\nsentence.[26]Indeed, this is considered in s. 742.3(2)(f) which allows the\ncourt to include an optional condition such as other reasonable conditions as\nthe court considers desirable for securing the good conduct of the offender and\npreventing a repetition by the offender of the same offence or the commission\nof other offences.[27]The accused was on probation at the time that these offences were\ncommitted, obviously a factor which has to be taken into consideration in\nrelation to the potential of him re-offending.[28]After reviewing all of these principles and the circumstances\nsurrounding Mr. Robert Wesley Skinner's position, I have to come to the\nconclusion that the appropriate manner in which to deal with this case is as\nfollows.[29]Mr. Skinner, would you please stand. Taking into account all of\nthe circumstances and facts, I have decided I will sentence you to a\nconditional sentence of three months for a breach of s. 5(2) of the Controlled\nDrugs and Substances Act. I am satisfied that the safety of the community\nwill not be endangered, I direct that you serve your sentence in the community\nupon the conditions that you comply with the following terms that I now impose.[30]Section 742.3(1) requires that you comply with the following\nmandatory conditions:(a) keep the peace and be of good behaviour;(b) appear before the court when required to do so by the\ncourt;(c) report to a supervisor(i) within two working days, or such longer period as the\ncourt directs, after the making of the conditional sentence order, and(ii) thereafter, when required by the supervisor and in the\nmanner directed by the supervisor;(d) remain within the jurisdiction of the court unless written\npermission to go outside that jurisdiction is obtained from the court or the\nsupervisor; and(e) notify the court or the supervisor in advance of any\nchange of name or address and promptly notify the court or the supervisor of\nany change of employment or occupation.[31]The following conditions will also apply:(i) you will abstain from the use of nonprescription drugs;(ii) You will not contact or have any dealings with any known\ndrug dealers or persons that have a criminal record for the possession or\ntrafficking in drugs;(iii) Provide for the support and care of your common law\nspouse and two children.(iv) That you will perform 100 hours of community service to\nbe completed within 12 months of the date of this probation order.(v) Remain in your residence in Fortune except as following:(A) That you attend at an approved government treatment\nprogram for drug addiction as approved by your probation officer.(B) That you will be allowed to leave your home for three\nhours on Sunday between 10:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. for the purposes of attending\nchurch.(C) That you will be entitled to leave your home in relation\nto medical appointments and medical doctors dealing with yourself, your common\nlaw wife or your children that has been discussed with your probation officer.(D) That you will be allowed out one hour a day between 4:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. for the purposes of exercise and recreation.(E) Attendance to vote in a municipal or other elections.(F) Other attendance for periods no longer than one day, which\nmay require for significant and presently unforeseen reasons, i.e. funeral; in\nthe discretion of your probation officer.[32]I am obligated to inform you of the provisions of s. 732.2(3) of\nthe Criminal Code. Under that section, you have the right to apply to\nchange the additional conditions of the probation order, if a change in\ncircumstances occurs after these conditions are imposed today. The probation\nofficer or the prosecutor may also apply to change the additional conditions.\nThe change may include adding to or removing any of the additional conditions\nthat I have imposed; relieving you from having to comply with any of the\nadditional conditions either absolutely or for a specified period of time; or\nreducing the period for which you are bound by the probation order. A hearing\nwill be held to deal with the request for a change. You must attend at the\nhearing in person. If a change is made to your probation order, you will be\ninformed of that change and a new copy of the order will be given to you. You\nwill be required to comply with the order as changed.[33]In addition, I am obligated to inform you of the provisions of s.\n732.2(5) of the Criminal Code. That section provides that if you are\nconvicted of an offence during your term of probation, including the offence of\nviolating the probation order, you may be brought back to court and the court can\nadd to the conditions I have imposed or extend the period of probation.[34]Finally, I must inform you that under s. 733.1, if you wilfully\nfail or refuse to comply with the conditions of probation, that is a separate\noffence for which you may also be convicted and sentenced. I further direct the\nclerk to provide you with a copy of the order.[35]In relation to the breach of probation charge, I am suspending\nthe passing of sentence on this matter and placing you on probation for two\nyears. Following the conditional sentence order, your probation order for two\nyears will include the following conditions:(a) keep the peace and be of good behaviour;(b) appear before the court when required to do so by the\ncourt;(c) report to a supervisor(i) within two working days, or such longer period as the\ncourt directs, after the making of the conditional sentence order, and(ii) thereafter, when required by the supervisor and in the\nmanner directed by the supervisor;(d) remain within the jurisdiction of the court unless written\npermission to go outside that jurisdiction is obtained from the court or the\nsupervisor; and(e) notify the court or the supervisor in advance of any\nchange of name or address and promptly notify the court or the supervisor of\nany change of employment or occupation.[36]The following conditions will also apply:(i) you will abstain from the use of nonprescription drugs;(ii) You will not contact or have any dealings with any known\ndrug dealers or persons that have a criminal record for the possession or trafficking\nin drugs;(iii) Provide for the support and care of your common law\nspouse and two children.(iv) That you will perform 100 hours of community service to\nbe completed within 12 months of the date of this probation order.(v) That you attend at an approved government treatment\nprogram for drug addiction as approved by your probation officer.[37]There will be a victim fine surcharge for the breach of s. 5(2)\nof the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act in the amount of $50. All\nmonies seized by the Crown will be forfeited to the Crown. Accused sentenced."}

O’Regan on the respondent for a breach of s. 294(a) of the Criminal\nCode.[2]The respondent, a graduate in economics who had considerable\ntraining in accounting, while working for Almar Limited, came in possession of\na cheque for $5,395 dated November 28, 1983 drawn on that company’s operating\naccount with the Bank of Montreal, Water St., St. John’s, payable to IMP Group\nLimited. Instead of passing the cheque over to the IMP Group Limited the\nrespondent kept it in his briefcase until December 5, 1983 when he deposited it\nin his personal account at the Canada Permanent Trust Company after having\nconvinced an inexperienced teller there that he was the owner of IMP Group\nLimited. The money was refunded around the middle of February 1984 when the\ntheft was discovered.[3]The offence here was committed by one who was in a position of\ntrust. In sentencing the respondent on September 25, 1985 the District Court\njudge, though recognizing that general deterrence cried out for a custodial\nterm, completely overlooked that principle when imposing sentence. The personal\nwelfare of the respondent was the predominant, if not the whole, consideration.\nThis court has repeatedly held that the public interest must transcend personal\nwelfare when those in a position of trust violate that trust and commit the\noffence of theft, and that a custodial term is usually required to satisfy the\nprinciple of general deterrence. In the present case there are no compelling\ncircumstances which would justify a departure from the usual course. Therefore\na custodial term should have been imposed.[4]An appropriate sentence in the present case is one of three\nmonths’ imprisonment. Had the respondent not carried out the 100 hours of\ncommunity service ordered by the trial judge the sentence would have been much\nheavier.[5]Leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed and a sentence\nof three months’ imprisonment is imposed. Appeal allowed."}

Arrell of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a\njury, on April 7, 2010, and from the sentence imposed on November 2, 2010.R.A. Blair J.A.:OPENING[1]This appeal is one of six appeals that were\nheard together because, in one fashion or another, they all attack the\nconstitutionality of mandatory minimum sentences in the context of gun-related\ncrimes.[2]Mr. Meszaros appeals from his convictions and\nhis sentence for the following offences:(i)assault on William Thorne, contrary to s. 266 and pursuant to s.\n265(1)(c) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46;(ii)use\nof a firearm (a loaded shotgun) while committing an indictable offence (the\nassault), contrary to s. 85(1)(a); and(iii)two counts of unlawful storage of a\nfirearm, contrary to s. 86(2).[3]He was acquitted on a second charge of assault\non another individual, Ryan Gaudet.[4]The appellant seeks to set aside the convictions\non two main grounds.First, he submits that the trial judge erred in his\ninstructions to the jury by failing to correct the Crown’s closing submissions\nregarding the defence of property defence and that the verdicts are therefore\nunreasonable.Secondly, he argues that the conviction for use of a firearm\nwhile committing an indictable offence is barred in these circumstances by what\nis known as the Kienapple rule[1]\nbecause liability for the predicate indictable offence of assault pursuant to\ns. 265(1)(c) of the Criminal Code necessarily involves a finding of\nthe use of a firearm in the commission of that offence.The appellant\ntherefore submits as well that the conviction for use of a firearm contrary to\ns. 85(1)(a) contravenes his rights under s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of\nRights and Freedoms.[5]The appellant was sentenced to one year in\nprison for the use firearm conviction – the mandatory minimum sentence\nprescribed for such a conviction.He appeals his sentence on the ground that\nthe mandatory minimum constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, thereby\nviolating his rights under s. 12 of the Charter.It is for this\nreason that the appeal was heard at the same time as five other appeals raising\nsimilar issues.The decisions in all appeals are being released at the same\ntime.[6]This appeal raises distinct issues regarding the\nconvictions, however, and is therefore being made the subject of separate\nreasons.[7]For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the\nconviction and sentence appeals.BACKGROUND AND FACTS[8]Mr. Meszaros is the long-time owner of about ten\nacres of land, located between Brantford and Paris, Ontario.He has a\nprivately stocked trout pond and the property is clearly marked with “Private\nProperty/No Fishing” signs.[9]In May 2008, two young men – Ryan Gaudet and William\nThorne – were fishing in a nearby creek.After about an hour of fruitless luck,\nthey decided to try the appellant’s stocked pond, knowing when they did so that\nthey were poaching and trespassing on what turned out to be the Meszaros\nproperty.Unfortunately for them – and, as it turned out, for him – the\nappellant’s wife spotted them while the appellant was sitting down for his\nevening meal.[10]An avid 60-year-old sportsman, the appellant\nreacted quickly.He ran into a back room where he kept his guns in a closet,\ntook out his 20-gauge double-barrel shotgun and three rounds of ammunition,\nloaded the gun and went out onto his porch.He yelled at the young men,\ntelling them to stay put and not to move.[11]Instead of complying, Gaudet and Thorne began to\nrun.[12]The appellant fired a single shot.There was\nsome debate on the evidence whether the two men were struck with the shot, but in\nthe end it was conceded there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the\nappellant shot in the direction of the two men and hit them, or simply shot the\ngun in the air.Gaudet fled and escaped from the property.Thorne was not so\nfortunate.He slipped and fell to the ground.The appellant approached him\ncarrying the weapon.[13]According to the appellant, he approached Thorne\nwith his gun pointed up in the air and told him to stay down.He accused the\nyounger man of trespassing and threatened to call the police.Thorne begged\nhim not to do that.The appellant told Thorne to put the two fish the men had\ncaught back into the pond, which Thorne did.Thorne then promised never to\ntrespass again.The appellant declined to shake Thorne’s proffered hand but,\nsatisfied with the apology, told Thorne to get his “coward friend” and “get the\nhell off [his] property”.He denied ever pointing the gun at Thorne.[14]Mr. Thorne told a different story.He says the\nappellant approached him with the gun pointed at his chest, while Thorne stayed\nkneeling on the ground with his hands in the air, begging the appellant not to\nshoot him.The appellant told him to “get [his] buddy back here”.Thorne saw\nthat the appellant’s wife had come out of the house and, thinking that he would\nnot be shot in her presence, he got up and declared: “this isn’t Texas, you\ncan’t shoot people”.The appellant laughed and told him they were on his\nproperty and he could do whatever he wanted.Thorne did not recall the\nappellant threatening to call the police, but eventually apologized and put the\nfish back into the pond as directed by the appellant.He left the property by\nthe creek.[15]The incident leading to the assault charge\nregarding Gaudet arose at about this time.What happened exactly is again a\nsubject of debate, but at some point Gaudet returned and words were exchanged.[16]Gaudet says the appellant called him a “f……\ncoward” from the other side of the creek and told him to “come here”, and that\nhe responded by saying: “hey, pa, you got a shotgun, I’m not coming anywhere\nnear you”.The appellant testified, on the other hand, that Gaudet said to\nhim: “I’d kick your ass if you didn’t have a gun”, and Thorne is said to have\nchimed in at some point by suggesting that the appellant was lucky because he\n(Thorne) “[didn’t] beat up old men.”According to the appellant, he turned to\nGaudet, held the open shotgun up, and said, “putting it down”.He then placed\nthe shotgun on the ground and said, “if you want some, come on back”.In\neffect, he told Gaudet to “bring it on”.[17]A scuffle ensued.In the end, the 60-year old\nappellant bested the younger Gaudet, who ended up on the ground.[18]The jury acquitted the appellant on the charge\nof assaulting Gaudet.ANALYSIS[19]The appellant raises three issues: (i) the\ndefence of property jury charge issue; (ii) the Kienapple and s. 7 Charter\nissue; and (iii) the s. 12 Charter issue regarding the mandatory\nminimum one-year sentence upon conviction of the use of a firearm offence\ncontrary to s. 85(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.The Charge to the\nJury/Defence of Property Issue[20]The appellant’s defence to the assault charge\ninvolving Thorne was that his use of force was justified in order to apprehend\nthe trespassers, recover his property and/or defend his premises.He relied\nparticularly on s. 38(1) of the Criminal Code, which at the time stated:[2]38(1) Everyone who is in peaceable possession\nof personal property, and every one lawfully assisting him, is justified(a) in preventing a trespasser from\ntaking it, or(b) in taking it from a trespasser who\nhas taken it,if\nhe does not strike or cause bodily harm to the trespasser.[21]There was no element of disproportionate use of\nforce in this defence, provided the accused did not strike or cause bodily harm\nto the trespasser.[22]No criticism is levelled against the portion of\nthe trial judge’s charge to the jury in which he explained the elements of that\ndefence.The appellant argues, however, that in Crown counsel’s closing\naddress to the jury, counsel incorrectly misstated the law by arguing that the\ndefence of property was unavailable to the appellant because his actions in\nconfronting Thorne while armed with a shotgun were unreasonable and\ndisproportionate to Thorne’s act of trespass.The trial judge’s error, the\nappellant submits, was that he failed to correct this misstatement and instead\nreinforced it in his instructions and in his answer to a question from the\njurors.[23]I would not give effect to this ground of\nappeal.[24]In the portion of his charge setting out the\nelements of the s. 38 defence of property defence, the trial judge explained\nthat “the degree or extent of the force and the circumstances in which we may\nuse it for this purpose must come within the limits the law allows”\n(emphasis added).It is clear from the balance of his instructions on the\ndefence of personal property that “the limits the law [allowed]” in that\ncontext involved not striking or causing bodily harm to the trespasser.The\ntrial judge said:An accused who is in peaceable possession of\nhis property acts lawfully in using force to prevent a trespasser from taking\nit or to get it back if he does not strike or cause bodily harm to the\ntrespasser.An accused who uses force to prevent a\ntrespasser from taking his property or to get the property back, but does\nnot strike or cause bodily harm to the trespasser must be found not guilty.He\nhas committed no crime. [Emphasis added.][25]The appellant was relying on additional\nself-defence and other provisions in the Criminal Code that bring into\nplay elements of reasonableness and proportionality of the force used,\nhowever.These included the defence of real property (then s. 41, now s. 35),\nthe right to make a citizen’s arrest (s. 494) and, with respect to the count\nalleging assault against Gaudet, the defence of self-defence generally (s. 34\nand then also s. 37).[3]All these were limited by the concepts of reasonableness and proportionality of\nthe force used.[26]It is understandable, then, that in the Crown’s\nclosing and in the trial judge’s outline of the Crown’s submissions, counsel\nfor the Crown and the trial judge would focus on whether the appellant’s\nresponse to the situation exceeded what was reasonable in the circumstances.While it would have been preferable for the trial judge to exclude the s. 38\ndefence from his general comments about proportionality, I am not persuaded\nthat this flaw led to a miscarriage of justice.First, I note that defence\ncounsel did not object to the charge on this issue.While the failure to\nobject is not fatal in a criminal case, it does provide some measure of the\negregiousness of the error in the mind of defence counsel, who was there and\nattuned to the dynamics of what was happening at trial.[27]Secondly, there is another basis upon which the\njury may well have rejected the s. 38 defence.The Crown argued strongly that\ns. 38 did not apply because the purpose of the appellant’s conduct –\nquite apart from the proportionality of his response to the situation – did not\nbring him within the elements of that defence.The Crown contended that the\nappellant’s purpose was not to prevent Thorne and Gaudet from taking his\nproperty (the fish) or to recover the fish from them – reasons that would have\nmade s. 38 available.Rather, his purpose in shooting the gun and accosting\nthem was to frighten them and to teach them a lesson – reasons that did not\nfall within the scope of s. 38.[28]It was open to the jury to make this finding on\nthe evidence.[29]Since the thrust of the appellant’s argument\nthat the verdict was unreasonable is tied to the argument that his actions did\nnot exceed the limits of s. 38, the submission that the verdict is unreasonable\nmust fail as well.Kienapple[30]It is a fundamental principle of criminal law\nthat no person may be convicted twice for the same criminal wrong (nemo\ndebet bis puniri pro uno delicto).As developed in subsequent Supreme\nCourt of Canada and appellate jurisprudence, the Kienapple rule is an\nexpression of that principle.The rule is that there ought not to be multiple\nconvictions for the same “delict”, “matter”, or “cause”: Kienapple,\nper Laskin J. at pp. 749-50.For Kienapple to apply there must be both\na sufficiently close factual nexus and a sufficiently close legal\nnexus between the two offences in the circumstances: see R. v. McGuigan,\n1982 CanLII 41 (SCC), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 284; R. v. Krug, 1985 CanLII 2 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 255; R. v. Prince,\n1986 CanLII 40 (SCC), [1986] 2 S.C.R. 480; R. v. Provo, 1989 CanLII 71 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 3; R. v.\nLangevin (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d) 138 (Ont. C.A.); and R. v. R.K. (2005),\n2005 CanLII 21092 (ON CA), 198 C.C.C. (3d) 232 (Ont. C.A.).[31]Whether there is a sufficient factual nexus is\nnot usually the difficult enquiry.That question is easily answered,\ngenerally, by determining whether the charges arise out of the same\ntransaction, i.e., whether the same acts of the accused ground each of the\ncharges.[32]The more difficult question in the Kienapple\nanalysis is whether there is a sufficient legal nexus between the offences, i.e.,\nwhether the offences constitute a single wrong or delict: R.K., at\nparas. 31-32; and Prince, at pp. 489-90.This requirement focuses on\nthe presence of distinguishing elements between the offences rather than on the\npresence of common elements.As Dickson C.J.C. put it in Prince, at\npp. 498-99:I conclude, therefore, that the requirement of\nsufficient proximity between offences will only be satisfied if there is no\nadditional and distinguishing element that goes to guilt contained in the\noffence for which a conviction is sought to be precluded by the Kienapple\nprinciple.[33]As I read the authorities, the rationale for\nthis two-fold approach is to ensure that the Kienapple principle is\nnot too easily triggered by the simple finding of a factual nexus.Parliament\nis entitled to abrogate the application of the Kienapple rule and to\nprovide for the registration of more than one conviction where offences overlap\nbut where the offender has been guilty of more than one wrong, or to impose an\nadditional penalty for what is, in effect, an aggravated form of the underlying\nindictable offence: see Prince, at p. 498; McGuigan, at p.\n318; Krug, at pp. 263-64; and R.K., at paras. 52-53.An\napproach that founds the application of Kienapple on a simple factual\nconnection might well frustrate Parliament’s legitimate intentions in that\nregard.[34]The same may be said for an approach that founds\nthe application of Kienapple on a common element giving rise to a\nconviction as between the two offences: see Prince, at pp. 43 and 47.The Provisions of the Criminal Code[35]Here, the overlapping offences are described in\nss. 265(1)(c) and 85(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, which, for purposes\nof the appeal, state:265(1) A person commits an assault when(c) while openly wearing or carrying a weapon or an imitation\nthereof, he accosts or impedes another person …85(1) Every person commits an offence who uses\na firearm, whether or not the person causes or means to cause bodily harm\nto any person as a result of using the firearm,(a) while committing an indictable offence, other than … [the exceptions\ndo not apply here.]The Factual Nexus[36]On the facts, the basis for a conviction under\nboth provisions is made out.The appellant fired the shotgun.Whether he\nfired it in the air or in the direction of the poachers is immaterial: he used\nthe firearm.He ordered Thorne to remain, accosting and impeding him from\nleaving the premises; and he did so while carrying the gun.Whether the gun\nwas pointing at Thorne or was pointing in the air is also immaterial.[37]Both offences arise out of the same transaction\nand are based on the same acts of the accused.The Legal Nexus[38]Whether the Kienapple rule applies\ndepends on the outcome of the legal nexus analysis.The question is whether\nthere are sufficient additional and distinguishing elements between the s.\n265(1)(c) assault and the s. 85(1)(a) use of a firearm offences to preclude the\noperation of the rule.In my view, there are.[39]In Prince, at pp. 499-503, there is a\nlengthy analysis of when it can be said that the elements of two or more\noffences are “substantially the same” or “alternative” to one another for these\npurposes.Dickson C.J.C. found the question to be one that “defies precise\nanswers”.He nonetheless outlined three different ways in which elements would\nbe considered to be sufficiently correspondent to permit the application of Kienapple\n– always subject to “the manifestation of a legislative intent to increase\npunishment in the event that two or more offences overlap” (p. 500).They are:(i) where an element of one offence is simply a particularization of\nanother element in the other offence (p. 500);(ii) where there is more than one method embodied in more than one\noffence, to prove a single delict (p. 501); and(iii)where Parliament in effect deems a particular element to be\nsatisfied by proof of a different nature, not necessarily because logic compels\nthat conclusion, but because of social policy or inherent difficulties of proof\n(pp. 501-02).[40]In R.K. – a more recent decision of\nthis court – Doherty J.A. summarized these three categories, at para. 37, as follows:\n“[i]n essence, each presents a situation in which the offences charged do not\ndescribe different criminal wrongs, but instead describe different ways of\ncommitting the same criminal wrong.”[41]Dickson C.J.C. also outlined three factors in Prince\nthat would defeat the sufficient legal nexus argument.Doherty J.A.\nsummarized these factors at para. 38 of R.K.:(i)where the\noffences are designed to protect different societal interests;(ii)where the\noffences allege personal violence against different victims; and(iii) where the\noffences proscribe different consequences.[42]After examining the evolution of Kienapple\nand its progeny, including the Prince considerations – and after\nagreeing with the former Chief Justice’s characterization of the legal nexus\nproblem as one to which there can be “no precise answer” – Doherty J.A.\nconcluded, at para. 36 of R.K., that “[t]he sufficiency of the legal\nnexus between offences will depend on an interpretation of the statutory\nprovisions that create the offences and the application of those statutory\ndefinitions to the circumstances of the case.”At para. 39, he condensed the\nessence of the legal nexus inquiry into the following succinct proposition:The crucial distinction for the purposes of\nthe application of [the] Kienapple rule is between different wrongs and the\nsame wrong committed in different ways” (emphasis added).Kienapple Does Not Apply[43]Charter\nconsiderations aside, I am not persuaded that the Kienapple principle\napplies to prevent multiple convictions in the circumstances of this case.I\nsay this for two principal reasons.First, sections 265(1)(c) and 85(1)(a)\ndeal with different wrongs, not the same wrong committed in different ways.Secondly, by enacting s. 85 (and its predecessor, s. 83), Parliament has\nsignalled its intention to displace the operation of the Kienapple\nrule in such circumstances.Different\nWrongs[44]First, there is a well-settled line of Canadian\njurisprudence leading to the conclusion that “wearing or carrying a weapon” is\nnot synonymous with the “use” of that weapon for these purposes.McGuigan and\nKrug are illustrative and deal with an analogous situation.In both\ncases, the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed that “[stealing]… while armed\nwith an offensive weapon”, contrary to s. 302(d) (now s. 343(d)) of the Criminal\nCode does not necessarily involve the use of a firearm as\ncontemplated in s. 83 (now s. 85(1)).The element of “use” was an additional,\ndistinguishing element from that required for a conviction for stealing “while\narmed”.See also R. v. Steele, 2007 SCC 36 (CanLII), [2007]\n3 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 26-27 (“carrying” is not “using”; “discharging”,\n“pointing”, “pulling out” and “displaying a firearm for the purposes of\nintimidation”, are); and R. v. Poisson (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 381 (Ont.\nC.A.), at p. 390 (wounding and using a firearm).[45]In both McGuigan and Krug, the\nSupreme Court of Canada relied upon the decision of this court in Langevin,\nwhere Martin J.A. said, at p. 145:Being “armed” with an offensive weapon and\n“using” an offensive weapon are not synonymous.A person is “armed” with an\noffensive weapon if he is equipped with it: see R. v. Sloan (1974), 19\nC.C.C. (2d) 190 [B.C.C.A.] at p. 192.“Using” a firearm includes pulling out a\nfirearm which the offender has upon his person and holding it in his hand to\nintimidate another: see Rowe v. The King (1951), 10 C.C.C. 97 at p. 101\n[S.C.C.] [other citations omitted].Notwithstanding that in most cases of\n“armed robbery” the offender will have used the weapon, nonetheless, s. 83(1)\n[now s. 85(1)], by making the use of a firearm an essential element of the\noffence created by the subsection, unlike s. 122 [now s. 343(d)] which\nrequired only that the offender have a firearm on his person, imports a further\nelement in addition to those which suffice to constitute theft while armed with\na firearm. [Underlining added; italics in original.][46]For the appellant to have been convicted under\ns. 265(1)(c), the jury must have been satisfied that he accosted or impeded Mr.\nThorne while “openly wearing or carrying” a weapon, thereby committing an\nassault as defined in that section.If “carrying” or being “armed” with or\n“equipped” with a weapon, alone, is not enough to constitute the “use” a\nweapon, I do not see how “wearing or carrying” a weapon alone can do so, given\nthe foregoing jurisprudence.I see no practical distinction between “carrying”\nor being “equipped with,” or in possession of, a weapon and “wearing or\ncarrying” that weapon.Indeed, in Steele, at para. 26, the Supreme\nCourt of Canada was unequivocal that it has been “settled law,” at least since Krug,\n“that carrying a concealed weapon while committing an offence is\nnot ‘using’ a firearm within the meaning of s. 85(1)” (emphasis added).[47]I do not think the use of the word “openly” in\ns. 265(1)(c) changes the analysis for these purposes.While “pulling out” or\n“displaying” a weapon for purposes of intimidation may constitute a use of that\nweapon, s. 265(1)(c) does not require an element of intimidation to be made\nout.It requires only that the person wearing or carrying the weapon “accost” (i.e.,\napproach or address) or “impede” (i.e., obstruct or hinder) the victim.[4][48]There is an additional element further distinguishing\nthe ss. 265(1)(c) and 85(1)(a) offences, in my view.The former provides for\nthe commission of the defined assault where the offender is wearing or carrying\na “weapon”.The term “weapon” is broadly defined in s. 2 of the Criminal\nCode in a manner that includes, but is not limited to, a firearm.It\ncould include a wide variety of other objects.Thus, a conviction pursuant to\ns. 265(1)(c) does not presuppose the presence of a firearm as an essential\nelement.[49]I do not think it matters for these purposes\nthat Mr. Meszaros was undoubtedly convicted of the s. 265(1)(c) assault on the\nbasis that he had, in fact, used the shotgun by firing it.That circumstance\nsimply reinforces the factual nexus and indicates there was a common element –\nuse of the firearm – that was sufficient but not required for\nthe s. 265(1)(c) conviction.[50]The “same act” and the “common element”\napproaches were both rejected by the Supreme Court of Canada in Prince,\nhowever.Dickson C.J.C. observed that both principles were based upon the\n“used up” theory, i.e.,[t]he principle\nthat an act which constitutes an element of an offence can only be used to\nsustain a single conviction.It is thereafter “used up” for the purposes of\nthe criminal law.[5][51]Dickson C.J.C. declined to accept that analysis\nregarding either the “same act” or the “common element” tests: see Prince,\nat pp. 43 and 47.At p. 47, he concluded:The majority in Coté[6] thus pointed in the\ndirection of a test which focused not on the presence or absence of a common\nelement, but on the presence or absence of additional, distinguishing\nelements. [Emphasis in original.][52]This view was articulated as well in a decision\nof this court that pre-dated Prince, R. v. Poisson, (1983) 8\nC.C.C. (3d) 381, where Lacourcière J.A. for the majority said, at p. 390:As I read the precisely worded statements of\nMartin J.A. in R. v. Langevin, supra, and in Allison and Dinel[7], the invocation\nof [the predecessor of s. 85] is precluded only where the indictable offences, by\ntheir Code definitions, make the use (as distinct from the\npossession) of a firearm a constituent element of the offence. [Emphasis\nadded.][53]In short, for a conviction to have been\nregistered against Mr. Meszaros under the use firearm provisions of s. 85(1),\n“it was necessary to prove that the accused did something beyond what is\nrequired to establish the offence under [s. 265(1)(c)]”, to adopt the language\nof LaForest J. in Krug, at p. 263.See also Langevin, at p.\n145.The element of “use” is an additional and distinguishing element from\nthat required for a conviction for assault under s. 265(1)(c).[54]The decision of this court in R. v. Osbourne (1994), 1994 CanLII 7209 (ON CA), 21 O.R. (3d) 97 also supports\nthis analysis.In that case, the accused was convicted of aggravated assault\nand of using a firearm in the commission of the aggravated assault.He grabbed\na gun from a police officer and shot at, but missed, the police officer.Because his conduct endangered the life of the police officer, he was convicted\nof aggravated assault.Finlayson J.A. upheld both convictions.Notwithstanding\nthat the actus reus of the aggravated assault offence was the firing\nof the gun – the very same conduct involved in the charge of using a firearm in\nthe commission of the aggravated assault – he rejected the Kienapple\nargument.In doing so, he accepted (at p. 102) the Crown’s argument that:… the offence of aggravated assault can be\ncommitted in a variety of ways and with the use of different weapons, but if\nthe perpetrator elects to use a firearm as a weapon, he can expect to receive\nan additional and mandatory sentence by reason of s. 85 of the Code.[55]Similarly, the offence of assault under s.\n265(1)(c) “can be committed in a variety of ways and with the use of different\nweapons”.Having elected to use a firearm to perpetrate the offence, Mr.\nMeszaros “can expect to receive an additional and mandatory sentence by reason\nof s. 85”.To the same effect, see also R. v. Switzer (1987), 1987 ABCA 23 (CanLII), 75\nA.R. 167 (C.A.), and R. v. Griffin, [1996] B.C.J. No. 2142\n(C.A.).Kienapple Displaced[56]Secondly, the Kienapple rule does not\napply here, in my view, because its application has been displaced by\nParliament in the enactment of s. 85 (and its predecessor, s. 83).In putting\nthat provision in place, Parliament has signalled its intention to provide for\nmultiple convictions for offences that may overlap, but that involve the use of\nguns.Combatting the use of firearms during the commission of indictable\noffences is the purpose of s. 85.Moreover, the fact that the commission of\nthe indictable offence contemplated in s. 85(1)(a) may in many cases involve\nthe use of a firearm is not sufficient to attract the operation of the Kienapple\nrule if “use” is not an essential element of the predicate offence.[57]Martin J.A. emphasized these considerations in Langevin,\nat p. 146:It is clear to me that Parliament intended by\ns. 83 [now s. 85] to repress the use of firearms in the commission of crimes by\nmaking such use an offence in its own right, and one which attracts a\nminimum sentence of one year consecutive to that imposed for the offence which\nsuch use accompanies.The use of firearms in the commission of crimes is\nfraught with danger and gravely disturbing to the community, and Parliament has\nsought to protect the public from the danger and alarm caused by that use by\nenacting the present legislation.…Manifestly, the\nlegislation is directed at those crimes in which firearms are likely to be\nused, such as robbery, and not at offences where they are not likely to be\nused, for example, forgery.To construe the section as not applicable to\nthe use of a firearm during the commission of the offence of theft while armed\nwith a firearm would largely defeat the clear intention of Parliament.\n[Emphasis added.][58]These sentiments are as apt today as they were\nwhen they were written in 1979.Similar views are expressed in Krug,\nat pp. 269-70; in McGuigan, at p. 318; and in R. v. Morrisey,\n2000 SCC 39 (CanLII), [2000] 2 S.C.R. 90, at para. 17.[59]Parliament’s intention that Kienapple\nshould not apply to preclude multiple convictions in these circumstances is\nalso reinforced by its decision to impose heavier penalties for aggravated\nforms of committing the predicate indictable offence through ss. 85(3) and (4)\nof the Criminal Code.Section 85(3) provides for a mandatory minimum\nsentence of one year’s imprisonment for a first conviction under s. 85, and\nthree years for a second or subsequent conviction.Section 85(4) provides that\na sentence imposed on a conviction under subsections 85(1) or (2) is to be\nserved consecutively to any other punishment imposed for an offence arising\nout of the same event or series of events and to any other sentence to\nwhich the person convicted is subject at the time the sentence is imposed for\nthose convictions.[60]As noted above, Parliament is entitled – subject\nto Charter considerations – to suspend the operation of the Kienapple\nprinciple in appropriate cases: Kienapple, at p. 753; McGuigan,\nat p. 318; and R.K., at para. 40.The dictates of ss. 85(3) and (4)\ndemonstrate that Parliament intended to permit multiple convictions in\ncircumstances where offences overlap yet do not constitute the same wrong but\nwhere the use of a firearm aggravates the commission of the predicate offence.So, too, does the history of s. 85, first enacted in 1977 – and reaffirmed in\n1995 – as part of a package of firearms regulations designed to protect the\npublic from an escalating gun problem.[61]I conclude, therefore, that the Kienapple\nrule has no application to prevent a conviction under both ss. 265(1)(c) and\n85(1)(a).The trial judge did not err in declining to stay one or another of\nthe appellant’s convictions.There Is No\nViolation of Section 7 Of The Charter[62]The appellant further submits, however, that the\nfailure to apply Kienapple violates his s. 7 Charter rights.The argument is that the principles evolving out of the concept of res\njudicata in criminal matters – the bar against multiple prosecutions (the autrefois\npleas) and multiple convictions (Kienapple) and the bar against\nthe re-litigation of issues (issue estoppel) – are all principles of\nfundamental justice.Failure to give effect to them contravenes s. 7.[63]I agree that these principles form part of the\nnotion of fundamental justice, but I do not agree that Parliament has violated\nthem by providing for multiple convictions under ss. 265(1)(c) and 85(1)(a).[64]Kienapple and\nits cousin notions do not apply because the appellant has not been convicted\nfor the same wrong twice.As outlined above, s. 85(1)(a) imports the additional\nelements of “use” of a “firearm” that are not essential elements of a s.\n265(1)(c) conviction for assault by accosting or impeding someone while\n“wearing or carrying” a “weapon”.[65]Nor do the two offences protect the same\nsocietal interests, a factor highlighted in Prince and R.K.[66]Section 85 seeks to deter offenders from using\nfirearms in the commission of crimes and to protect the public’s life, liberty\nand security interests from the modern scourge of gun-related violence.It\ndoes so by creating a new offence of “use of a firearm” and by imposing a more\nsevere form of punishment on those who commit indictable offences that may – but\ndo not necessarily – involve the use of a firearm when they are committed in\nthe more aggravated fashion.Section 265(1)(c) is designed to prevent\ninterference with a person’s liberty and security interests by creating the\noffence of assault where that goal is accomplished by accosting or impeding the\nperson with a weapon – not necessarily a firearm – present but not necessarily\nused.As Doherty J.A. observed in R.K., at para. 39:If the offences target different societal\ninterests, different victims, or prohibit different consequences, it cannot be\nsaid that the distinctions between the offences amount to nothing more than a\ndifferent way of committing the same wrong.[67]It is only where “the distinctions between the\noffences amount to nothing more than a different way of committing the same\nwrong” that the Kienapple or res judicata-related notions\napply.[68]LaForest J. dealt directly with the “fundamental\njustice” issue in the context of s. 85, in Krug, at pp. 267-68:The question, then, is not so much whether\nParliament can displace the Kienapple principle, but whether\n“fundamental justice” within the meaning of s. 7 is breached by convicting an\naccused who has already committed a robbery of a second offence punishable by\nmandatory imprisonment for using, as opposed to being armed with, a firearm in\ncommitting that robbery.That brings us squarely to what Parliament has\ndone and why it has done it; not how it has done it.Now what Parliament has\ndone in this case, we saw, is in substance to create an aggravated form of\nrobbery, to punish more severely an accused who uses a firearm in perpetrating\nthat offence by imposing an additional penalty including a mandatory period of\nimprisonment.Parliament’s reason for so acting was its grave concern with the\nproliferation of firearm-related crime.That this aggravated form of robbery exposes\nthe victim to serious injury or death and that there has been a proliferation\nof such firearm-related offences in recent years scarcely needs demonstration.Under these circumstances, the creation of such an offence does not, in my\nview, constitute a departure from fundamental justice. [Emphasis added.][69]Replacing the word “robbery” in the foregoing\npassage with the words “a s. 265(1)(c) assault” makes this case and Krug\ncompletely analogous.There is no s. 7 violation, in my view.Sentence[70]Given my conclusion that the Kienapple\nrule does not apply to bar the appellant’s conviction under s. 85 and that\nthere is no violation of s. 7 of the Charter, and given my rejection\nof the other grounds raised by the appellant, it is necessary to deal with the\nappellant’s sentence appeal.He submits, first, that the mandatory minimum\nsentence of one year’s imprisonment imposed by s. 85(3)(a) is unconstitutional\nbecause it violates s. 12 of the Charter.Secondly, he argues that\nthe trial judge erred in imposing suspended sentences and probation instead of\ngranting discharges on counts 1, 4, and 5.[8][71]Underlying these submissions is the view that Mr.\nMeszaros is a first offender with an unblemished character, who was simply\ntrying to defend his property, as he was entitled to do. A period of incarceration\nis unnecessary to meet the goals of the sentencing regime, the argument goes,\nand therefore a mandatory minimum punishment of one year’s imprisonment constitutes\n“cruel and unusual punishment” as contemplated in s. 12.Similarly, in such\ncircumstances, the imposition of suspended sentences and probation instead of the\ngrant ofdischarges on the other counts in such circumstances is manifestly\nunfit.[72]I accept that Mr. Meszaros is a first offender\nof previously unblemished character; it may well be that he is the least\nmorally blameworthy of the six offenders whose appeals are being argued\ntogether on the mandatory minimum sentences issue.Arguably, there is an\nunfortunate irony in the fact that his more blameworthy co-appellants are to be\nrelieved of the impact of a mandatory minimum punishment.Nonetheless, his use\nfirearm offence was serious, and I am not persuaded that the mandatory minimum\nsentence imposed by s. 85(3)(a) is unconstitutional.Nor do I think there is\nany basis for interfering with the trial judge’s imposition of suspended\nsentences and probation in relation to Counts 1, 4, and 5.The Mandatory\nMinimum Sentence Does Not Contravene Section 12 of the Charter[73]Firearms are inherently dangerous.They always\n“present[] the ultimate threat of death to those in [their] presence”: R.\nv. Felawka, 1993 CanLII 36 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 199, at p.\n211, Cory J.[74]The use of firearms in the commission of crimes,\nas Martin J.A. noted in Langevin, at p. 146, “is fraught with danger\nand gravely disturbing to the community”.As a result, he added, “Parliament\nhas sought to protect the public from the danger and alarm caused by that use”.These observations are as fitting today as they were when made – perhaps more so.While they were first made in the context of the Kienapple analysis, in\nmy view they are equally apt to the social reality underpinning the enactment\nof the mandatory one-year minimum sentence provided for in s. 85(3)(a) of the Criminal\nCode.For the reasons that follow, I am not satisfied the mandatory\none-year minimum sentence imposed on Mr. Meszaros for use of his firearm constitutes\ncruel and unusual punishment, contrary to s. 12 of the Charter.[75]The principles underlying s. 12 and the analysis\nto be undertaken in determining whether a punishment is cruel and unusual have\nbeen thoroughly canvassed by Doherty J.A. in R. v. Nur, 2013 ONCA 677 (CanLII),\na related decision being released at the same time as this decision.I need\nnot repeat that general analysis here, but I refer in particular to paras.\n64-74 in which the question of what is “cruel and unusual” punishment is explored.Although Doherty J.A’s analysis is made in the context of the three-year\nmandatory minimum sentence provided for in s. 95 of the Criminal Code,\nthe principles underpinning that analysis are equally applicable to the s. 85\nchallenge.[76]For purposes of this appeal, I re-emphasize only\nthe following.To violate s. 12, the punishment must be “grossly\ndisproportionate”, and “[t]he test for determining whether a sentence is\ndisproportionately long is very properly stringent and demanding”: Steele\nv. Mountain Institution, 1990 CanLII 50 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1385, at p. 1417 (Cory J.).Cruel\nand unusual punishment has been characterized as punishment that is “so\nexcessive as to outrage standards of decency” and to be considered by Canadians\nas “abhorrent and intolerable”: R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2008] 1\nS.C.R. 96, at para. 14.Moreover, it is a punishment that is more than\nexcessive or demonstrably unfit in the circumstances; it must be “grossly”\ndisproportionate.See Nur, at paras. 64-66; R. v. McDonald (1998), 1998 CanLII 13327 (ON CA), 40 O.R. (3d) 641 at p. 665,\nRosenberg J.A.; R. v. Goltz, 1991 CanLII 51 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 485, at pp. 498-500; and R.\nv. Smith, 1987 CanLII 64 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045, at pp. 1072-84.[77]Against this background, the s. 12 analysis\ninvolves two enquiries: (i) whether the punishment would be grossly\ndisproportionate in comparison to what would otherwise have been appropriate\nfor the offender in question; and, if not, (ii) whether the punishment can be\nsaid to be grossly disproportionate having regard to what the jurisprudence\nrefers to as other “reasonable hypothetical circumstances”.[78]I observe at the outset that Mr. Breen did not\nseek to strike down this punishment on the basis of reasonable hypotheticals.He argued that the appellant’s case itself constituted the reasonable\nhypothetical – an elderly good citizen, never before in trouble with the law,\nwho was simply trying to defend his property against intruders, as he was\nentitled to do.In the circumstances of this offence and this offender, he\nsubmitted, the imposition of the minimum 12 month term of imprisonment amounts\nto cruel and unusual punishment.[79]Respectfully, I do not agree.In my view, a\nmandatory minimum one-year sentence for an offence involving the use of a\nfirearm cannot be said to be “grossly disproportionate” to whatever might\notherwise have been an appropriate punishment for such an offender having\nregard to the general principles of sentencing.Indeed, in spite of Mr. Breen’s\ndisavowal of the requirement in these circumstances, I cannot conceive of a\nreasonable hypothetical involving the use of a firearm where a mandatory\none-year sentence of imprisonment would be grossly disproportionate to what\nwould otherwise be appropriate in the circumstances.Such a punishment might\nwell be excessive, or perhaps even manifestly unfit, but it would not be\ngrossly disproportionate.[80]Section 85, and its predecessor s. 83, have\nsurvived a number of constitutional attacks, although none has focussed\nspecifically on the identical issue we face here – the constitutionality of the\nmandatory one-year minimum sentence imposed by s. 85(3)(a).The Supreme Court\nof Canada upheld the validity of the overall licensing and registration\nprovisions of the Firearms Act, S.C. 1995, c. 39, in Reference re\nFirearms Act (Can.), 2000 SCC 31 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 783.In three cases,\nthe s. 85(4) requirement (previously the s. 83(2) requirement) that the\nmandatory minimum sentence be served consecutively to the sentence imposed for\nthe underlying offence has been held not to violate s. 12 of the Charter:\nsee R. v. Brown, 1994 CanLII 29 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 749; R. v. Spark, [1986] O.J.\nNo. 1001 (C.A.); R. v. Wheatle, [1993] O.J. No. 2747 (C.A.); and R.K..[81]In McDonald, this court rejected a\nconstitutional challenge to the four-year minimum sentence for the offence of\nusing a firearm while committing robbery, contrary to what was then s. 344(a)\nof the Criminal Code.Expressing his reservations about having to\nsend a remorseful and relatively young man with a mental illness to the\npenitentiary, Rosenberg J.A. nonetheless refused to strike down the provision.At p. 666, he said:I also have reservations about putting this\nrelatively young man into a penitentiary setting.If it were open to this\ncourt to review the propriety of this sentence on the usual scale of appellate\nreview as explained in R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, I would\nfind a three- to four- year sentence to be demonstrably unfit.However, that\nis not the same as gross disproportionality and I am not convinced that\nhaving regard to the objective gravity of an offence involving the use of a\nfirearm, even an unloaded one, a sentence approaching four years shocks the\nconscience.As La Forest J. wrote in R. v. Lyons, 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R.\n309 at pp. 344-45, the standard under s. 12 is not so exacting as to require\nthe punishment to be “perfectly suited to accommodate the moral nuances of\nevery crime and every offender.” [Emphasis added.][82]These observations are as appropriate in the s.\n85(3)(a) context as they were in McDonald.Absent a mandatory\nminimum, different judges might differ on whether a period of incarceration was\nrequired to meet the goals of sentencing in the context of Mr. Meszaros’\noffence and Mr. Meszaros as an offender.However, use of the firearm is an\nessential requirement of the s. 85 offence – a factor that distinguishes s. 85\ncases from the reasonable hypotheticals presented by Doherty J.A.’s s. 95 analysis\nin Nur – and any offence involving the use of a firearm is high on the\ngravity scale. I do not think that some period of incarceration would be\nunreasonable in any such circumstance, and it would certainly not be\ndemonstrably unfit.Even if a one-year punishment were demonstrably unfit,\nthat would not make it unconstitutional.Adapting the language of Rosenberg\nJ.A. above, and of Lamer J. in Smith, I conclude that, “having regard\nto the objective gravity of an offence involving the use of a firearm”, a\nsentence of one year’s incarceration for an assault involving the use of a\nfirearm is not a punishment “that is so excessive as to outrage standards of\ndecency” in the community.[83]There is no violation of s. 12, in my opinion.Counts #1, 4, and 5[84]The appellant raised an additional ground of\nappeal respecting his sentence, arguing that the trial judge erred in failing\nto grant discharges for the assault conviction and the conviction for contravention\nof the storage firearm regulations.[85]I would not give effect to this ground of appeal\neither.The trial judge made no error in principle in assessing the gravity of\nthe assault, and the sentence imposed – a suspended sentence and a one-year\nprobation order – was not unfit.While it may have been open to him to impose\na conditional or absolute discharge on the storage of firearms counts, I\nconclude that, in the overall context of this case, he did not err in principle\nin declining to do so.DISPOSITION[86]For the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the\nconviction appeal.I would grant leave to appeal sentence but dismiss the\nsentence appeal.“R.A.\nBlair J.A.”“I\nagree D.

Stratton and Reid., - 2002 NSSC 103]HEARD BEFORE:The Honourable Justice Robert W. Wright at Truro, Nova\nScotia on April 2, 2002.ORAL DECISION:April\n4, 2002WRITTEN RELEASEOF DECISION:April 29, 2002COUNSEL: Crown\nCounsel - Robert HagellDefence\nCounsel - Anne Malick, Q.C. for Michael StrattonDefence\nCounsel - Kevin Coady for Joey ReidWright J. (Orally)[1]On September 14, 2001, Michael Stratton and Joey Reid\nwere convicted by a jury of manslaughter in the death of Joseph MacKay under s.\n236 (b) of the Criminal Code.Sentencing had to be delayed until\ntoday because one of the offenders, Mr. Reid, was since involved in a serious\nmotor vehicle accident, necessitating the adjournment of an earlier sentencing\ndate.[2]Let me say at the outset that I am bound to accept,\nand defer to, the verdict of the jury who, in order to convict, implicitly\nfound that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Stratton did\nnot act in self defence and that both offenders had caused the death of Mr.\nMacKay under the applicable legal test, albeit unintentionally, by the unlawful\nact of assault.[3]Sentencing in manslaughter cases is an especially\ndifficult task because of the wide variety of circumstances in which the\noffence can occur.It follows, in the words of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal\nin the recent case of R. v. Henry (2002) NSCA 33, that “the range of\nappropriate sentence is probably more extensive than for any other offence,\npresumably because the offence covers such an expansive array of methods of\ncommission”.The spectrum ranges from “almost accident” to “almost murder”.What the Henry case clearly illustrates is the principle that the\nappropriate sentence along the spectrum is to be tailored to suit the degree of\nmoral blameworthiness of the offender.[4]The assessment of moral blameworthiness first\nrequires a clear determination of the facts surrounding the commission of the\noffence.Because of the nature of the offence, and the complexity of the legal\ntests for self defence and causation, not all of the jury’s findings of fact in\nthis case are free from ambiguity.That must now be addressed where the issuehas been raised\nas to whether or not there are any aggravating factors to be taken into account\nas part of the moral blameworthiness analysis.[5]It is the contention of the Crown that Mr. Stratton,\nafter turning down Mr. MacKay’s request for a ride from the tavern parking lot,\nwas waiting for Mr. MacKay to arrive at the Giles Street residence to engage in\na fight with him.The defence contends that this was a chance second encounter\nwhich came about because Rachel Reid, Joey Reid’s cousin, also lived there and\nhad walked home with Mr. MacKay and his friend, Jason Boudreau, intending to\ngive them a drive somewhere in her car.This led to an argument over whether\nRachel Reid should be driving in her condition which ended up in a fight\nbreaking out between Mr. MacKay and Mr. Stratton, one that the defence contends\nthey both willingly engaged in.[6]The jury implicitly found that the Crown had proven\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Stratton did not act in self defence in\nassaulting Mr. MacKay.What we cannot expressly know is the jury’s specific\nfindings of fact in reaching that conclusion.When this situation arises, the\ntrial judge is entitled, and indeed required, to make an independent\ndetermination of the relevant facts, applying the beyond a reasonable doubt\nstandard of proof, which must be consistent with the finding of guilt by the\njury.As authority for that proposition, I have been referred to three leading\ncases, R. v. Braun (1995) 95 C.C.C. (3d) 443 (Man. C.A.),R. v.\nGardiner (1982) 1982 CanLII 30 (SCC), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 477 (S.C.C.) and R. v. Cooney (1995)\n1995 CanLII 707 (ON CA), 98 C.C.C. (3d) 196 (Ont. C.A.)In Braun, the court stated (at p. 453):It is well established that a\ntrial judge is bound by the express and implied factual implications of the\njury’s verdict when imposing sentence.It is also established that where the\nfactual implication is not clear, the court may come to its own independent\ndetermination of the relevant facts.[7]The court went on to\nraise the question, at p. 455-6:.... as to whether, during a\nsentence hearing following a jury trial it is open for the trial judge to find\nas a fact that there were aggravating circumstances in the commission of the\ncrime.As previously indicated, while the jury is the sole determinator of\nfact, the judge at sentencing must make his determination of the facts at trial\nconsistent with the jury’s verdict.There is simply no way of knowing which\nfacts the jury relied upon in coming to its verdict.[8]R. v. Gardiner is authority for the\nproposition that the sentencing hearing is part of the trial process and the\nburden of proof on disputed facts is on the Crown by the ordinary criminal\nstandard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.[9]As noted in R. v. Cooney (at p. 203), Gardiner\nwas a sentence hearing following a plea of guilty.The problem becomes more\ncomplex when the case is tried before a jury.Nonetheless, the court stated\nthat it is the task of the trial judge to make up his or her own mind as to\nwhat facts would be capable of sustaining the jury’s verdict.[10]At the trial of the present case, the Crown was\nsimply unable to prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the aggressor was, as\nbetween Mr. MacKay and Mr. Stratton.There was no credible or reliable\nevidence upon which the jury could reasonably have found that Mr. Stratton was\nwaiting for Mr. MacKay to arrive at the Giles Street residence to engage in a\nfight with him.Indeed, there was no evidence to prove that Mr. Stratton even\nknew that Mr. MacKay would be walking from the tavern to the Giles Street\nresidence to get a ride with Rachel Reid who had her car parked there.I\ntherefore find as a fact, after hearing the evidence at trial, that Mr.\nStratton was not lying in wait for Mr. MacKay to arrive at the Giles Street\nresidence to engage in a fight with him.I am satisfied that this was a\nsituation where the two groups came together again coincidentally at the Giles\nStreet residence at which Mr. Reid, from one group, and Rachel Reid from the\nother group, both resided.[11]Unfortunately, an argument ensued over Rachel Reid’s\nintention to give Mr. MacKay and his friend a ride somewhere which ended up in\na fight breaking out between Mr. MacKay and Mr. Stratton.As mentioned\nearlier, the jury in the final analysis was satisfied that the Crown had proven\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Stratton did not act in self defence but we\nhave no way of knowing which element or elements of that defence under s. 34(1)\nof the Criminal Code was decided not to be present, so as to preclude\nMr. Stratton from relying upon it.As I have already found, however, for\npurposes of determining the set of facts upon which the sentencing decision is\nto be made, it has not been proven that Mr. Stratton was waiting for Mr. MacKay\nto arrive at the Giles Street residence to engage in a fight with him.Had\nthat been proven, it would certainly have constituted an aggravating factor for\nthe court to take into account in assessing a fit and proper sentence.[12]The sequence of facts from that point on are not in\ndoubt and can be summarized as follows.In grappling with Mr. MacKay, Mr.\nStratton was able to get him in what is known as a sleeper hold or headlock\nfrom behind.While Mr. MacKay was in this restraining hold, Mr. Reid,\nintoxicated as he was, took a few staggering kicks at him.Reprehensible as\nthat was, the medical evidence confirmed that those kicks, in and of\nthemselves, did not cause serious bodily harm to Mr. MacKay .What happened\nwas that Mr. MacKay was rendered unconscious by the sleeper hold, after which\nMr. Stratton let him go.With Mr. MacKay lying unconscious on the ground,\npeople panicked and made the ill fated decision to try to administer CPR to\nresuscitate Mr. MacKay, by pressing on his chest area and giving mouth to mouth\nair inhalation.The evidence of the various witnesses painted a picture of\nconfusion and disorganization in the CPR attempts that were tried in vain by\nvarious combinations of Joey Reid, Rachel Reid, Holly De Coste and Andrew\nPace.[13]In fact, these resuscitation attempts tragically had\nthe very opposite effect.According to Dr. Bowes, the Crown’s expert witness,\nin all probability it was the pushing on Mr. MacKay’s chest area that caused\nhim to vomit, which was then inadvertently forced down his windpipe and lungs\nby the mouth to mouth resuscitation attempts.When Mr. MacKay was not revived,\nand an ambulance had not yet arrived at the scene, three of those present\nplaced Mr. MacKay in the back seat of a car and rushed him to the hospital.By\nthen, it was too late.The medical evidence was that Mr. MacKay died from\nasphyxiation, which would have occurred within a couple of minutes after\nblockage of the windpipe.[14]The medical evidence was unequivocal that Mr. MacKay\nhad otherwise sustained only a few superficial cuts and bruises from the\nincident, none of which either individually or combined were sufficient to\ncause death nor to have directly caused aspiration to occur.Nor would such\nsuperficial wounds by themselves even have required medical attention.Dr.\nBowes found no apparent injury to the abdomen or the neck of Mr. MacKay apart\nfrom two superficial linear marks on the neck area.Clearly, the medical cause\nof Mr. MacKay’s death was the aspiration of his stomach contents.[15]That completes my summary of the facts upon which\nthis sentencing decision must rest.I turn now to a review of the purpose and\nobjectives of sentencing and the principles to be considered, as set out in the\nCriminal Code.[16]I begin with s. 718 which reads as follows:The fundamental purpose of\nsentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to\nrespect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by\nimposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and\nother persons from committing offences;(c) to separate offenders from\nsociety, where necessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating\noffenders;(e) to provide reparations for\nharm done to victims or to the community; and(f) to promote a sense of\nresponsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and\nto the community.[17]Section 718.1 reads\nas follows:A sentence must\nbe proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility\nof the offender.[18]Section 718.2 reads as follows:A court that imposes a sentence\nshall also take into consideration the following principles:(a) a sentence should be\nincreased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating\ncircumstances relating to the offence or the offender, ...(b) a sentence should be similar\nto sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in\nsimilar circumstances;(c) where consecutive sentences\nare imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;(d) an offender should not be\ndeprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the\ncircumstances; and(e) all\navailable sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the\ncircumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention\nto the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.[19]When certain criteria are met, a judge may order that\na sentence be served in the community.Section 742.1 reads as follows:Where a person is convicted of an\noffence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term or\nimprisonment, and the court(a) imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years, and(b) is satisfied that serving the\nsentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and\nwould be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing\nset out in sections 718 to 718.2,the court may, for the purpose of\nsupervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender\nserve the sentence in the community, subject to the offender’s complying with\nthe conditions of a conditional sentence order made under section 742.3.[20]To add to the difficult task of sentencing in this\ncase, Crown counsel and defence counsel are worlds apart in their submissions\nas to what would constitute a fit and proper sentence for Messrs. Stratton and\nReid.The Crown seeks a sentence of five years incarceration in a\npenitentiary.Counsel for Mr. Stratton seeks a non-custodial sentence, or\nalternatively, a conditional sentence in the range of 12 months with house\narrest as a punitive measure as well as community service.Counsel for Mr.\nReid asks the court to impose an 18 month conditional sentence, again with\nhouse arrest as a punitive measure and community service.[21]In support of her submissions on sentencing, counsel\nfor Mr. Stratton called two witnesses to give evidence, namely, Trevor Forbes,\na dairy farmer from the same community and long time friend of Mr. Stratton’s,\nand Shirley Atkinson, his mother.Mr. Forbes described Mr. Stratton as “a good\nkid” who is not a violent person and not one to look for a fight.Mr. Stratton\nhas been active in the community as a Boy Scout leader for several years\n(although that has now been curtailed by reason of this offence).He was asked\nby Mr. Forbes to join the volunteer fire brigade in that community.He said\nthere are a number of community service opportunities available in that\ncommunity.[22]Ms. Atkinson also testified that her son is not a\nviolent person, nor a drinker.His future plans are to return to school to\ntake eco-tourism courses. He has the support of his parents and other family\nmembers.[23]The Pre-Sentence Report filed with the court under\ndate of December 18, 2001 provides a further profile of Mr. Stratton.He is 24\nyears of age, resides with his father, and has no criminal record of any sort.He is currently employed with Sproule Lumber doing labour work.He is\ndescribed by his employer as a reliable individual who is diligent in keeping\nup his work, one who is not aggressive and gets along well with other\nemployees.There is nothing to suggest that he presently has any sort of\nalcohol or substance abuse problem.He has expressed remorse for the victim\nand family of the victim but does not accept full responsibility for what\nhappened.He attributes blame to the victim also and the others who were\npresent at the time of the offence.The Pre-Sentence Report also notes that\nMr. Stratton has applied and been accepted at the Forest Ranger School in\nFredericton, New Brunswick.That too has been deferred, pending the outcome of\nhis sentencing.[24]A Pre-Sentence Report has also been filed with the\ncourt in respect of Mr. Reid, consisting of an initial report from another file\ndated October 2, 2001 and an update prepared on December 17, 2001.There is no\nsuggestion from anything in these reports that Mr. Reid is a violent person.He is spoken well of by his employer, Wayne Cameron of Cameron Farm Equipment,\nwhere Mr. Reid has been steadily employed since January 2001.Mr. Cameron\nreported that Mr. Reid has performed very well at his work and has a great deal\nof potential in that workplace.Indeed, Mr. Cameron confirmed that Mr. Reid\nhas been given a valuable opportunity to train as a farm equipment mechanic.He described Mr. Reid as an excellent employee and one who gets along well with\nother employees.He advises that Mr. Reid’s job is available as long as he is\nthere to perform it.[25]There is, however, a dark side to Mr. Reid’s\nPre-Sentence Report, one that is cast by a shadow of alcohol abuse that he\napparently fails to adequately recognize, and which appears to be the common\ndenominator of his derailments in life.Indeed, he was highly intoxicated on the\nnight of this offence and, according to the Pre-Sentence Report, is said to\naccept that his abuse of alcohol played a part in the offence and that his\njudgment was impaired.Nonetheless, he is said to have continued the use of\nalcohol to the date of the report and does not appear to fully understand the\nextent of this abuse and how it has affected himself and others.[26]Another disconcerting aspect of the Pre-Sentence\nReport is that Mr. Reid expresses little victim sympathy, feeling it was an\nunfortunate set of circumstances that led to Mr. MacKay’s death which could\nhave happened to anyone.He has not accepted full responsibility for his\nactions because he still continues to feel that he did not contribute to Mr.\nMacKay’s death.The comment that it has been “two years and everyone should\nmove on” is attributed to him in the Pre-Sentence Report.[27]A further blemish that is to be noted in respect of\nMr. Reid is that he does have a criminal record, although it is a relatively\nminor one and does not reflect any prior use of violence.He has three Liquor\nControl Act violations, one theft under and three break and enters (which\nthe court is advised were camp break-ins).He also has committed two breaches\nof undertaking, one of which is under appeal.[28]The pre-sentence report also tells us that Mr. Reid\nis 24 years old, and lives in a long time common-law relationship with Ms.\nHolly De Coste who remains supportive of him, as does his father.[29]I would add at this juncture that I have read the\nVictim Impact statements filed by Mr. MacKay’s parents and brother Shawn.They\nare emotionally charged statements that express their profound loss of a\nrevered son and brother.Even after the passage of more than two years, they\nhave been unable to attain a sense of closure from their grievous loss of a\nclose family member.[30]It is for me now to decide what constitutes a fit and\nproper sentence for these offenders for this offence, in light of the\nindividual circumstances of this case.In approaching this task, I refer to\ntwo recent decisions of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal which pertain to\nsentencing for manslaughter offences.The first is R. v. Lawrence\n(1999) 1999 CanLII 4129 (NS CA), 172 N.S.R. (2d) 375 where the court described the wide range of fit sentences\nfor manslaughter in the following terms (at para. 14):In my opinion, there is not a 4\nto 10 year “range” for manslaughter if the word “range” is used to suggest that\nmanslaughter sentences ought generally to fall within those limits.Cases from\nthis and other courts of appeal emphasize that manslaughter is an offence that\nmay be committed in an exceptionally wide variety of circumstances and for\nwhich the legal limits of possible sentences are very great: see, e.g. R. v.\nMacPhee (1977), 20 N.S.R. (2d) 520; R. v. McNeil (J.B.)\n(1998), 168 N.S.R. (2d) 59.These factors combine to make it unusually\ndifficult to establish any benchmark or range of fit sentences for such\noffences; see R. v. Selig [1994] N.S.J. 436 (C.A.) at para 13.As\nKelly, J. said in R. v. Smith, [1986] N.S.J. No. 424, this Court has\nobserved that the great majority of cases in fact receive sentences between\nfour and ten years, but the Court has not held that manslaughter sentences\nshould be restricted to or ought to fall within that range.[31]In R. v. Henry, supra, the Court of\nAppeal amplified its earlier decision on manslaughter sentencing options and\nprinciples.At para. 16, the court commented as follows:Sentences for the offence of\nmanslaughter cover a very wide scope, from suspended and conditional sentences,\nto life imprisonment.The range of appropriate sentence is probably more\nextensive than for any other offence, presumably because the offence covers\nsuch an expansive array of methods of commission.[32]After citing other authorities, notably R. v.\nCreighton (1993) 1993 CanLII 61 (SCC), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 346 (S.C.C.), the Court of Appeal in Henry\nenunciated the following principle (at para. 19):The court, while of course giving\ndue weight to all the principles of sentencing, must assess the extent of moral\nblameworthiness in a particular case, and should consider where on the\nspectrum, from almost accident to almost murder, the particular offence falls.Obviously, the nearly equivalent to murder offences will, in general, attract a\nsentence higher than the majority ... and those closer to an accidental killing\nwill generally fall below the average...[33]In applying this principle in Henry, the Court\nof Appeal concluded that the aggravating circumstances there in existence,\nespecially the offender’s “continued notion that his action was justified, and\nthe predatory callousness of his intentional assault on a smaller, intoxicated\nman, demonstrate a moral blameworthiness that places this offence well beyond\nthe near accident point on the spectrum”.The court also characterized Mr.\nHenry’s actions as a cowardly attack, one where he had time to compose himself\nand make the decision to follow the deceased up the street to exact some form\nof vigilante justice with a sucker punch as retribution for having struck a\nwoman.[34]On that fact situation, the Court of Appeal found\nthat this was one of those cases in which the need for denunciation was so\npressing that incarceration was the only suitable way in which to express\nsociety’s condemnation of the offender’s conduct.It ruled that a conditional\nsentence was not fit in those circumstances of moral blameworthiness and\nimposed a penitentiary term of four years.[35]It has been repeatedly recognized in the criminal law\nof this country that whenever an act of violence of any sort is involved, the\ncourt must ensure that the sentence to be handed down meets the statutory\nobjectives of denunciation of unlawful conduct and deterrence of both the\noffender and other persons from committing similar offences.The question that\nis germane to the sentencing task before me is whether those objectives can be\nmet by a conditional sentence on the unusual facts of this case, as is urged by\ndefence counsel, or whether the need for denunciation and deterrence is so\npressing that incarceration in a penitentiary will be the only suitable way in\nwhich to express society’s condemnation of the offender’s conduct.[36]The answer to this question takes me back to an\nassessment of the moral blameworthiness of this offence.The facts of this\ncase are unique.Given my earlier findings in that regard, there are no proven\naggravating circumstances to be fastened upon Mr. Stratton.There has been\nintroduced an element of aggravation attributable to Mr. Reid for having\nentered the fray by kicking Mr. MacKay while he was being restrained.Nevertheless, having regard to all the factual circumstances surrounding this\ncase, which I earlier summarized and needn’t now repeat, I consider this\noffence to fall towards the near accident point on the spectrum.Unfortunately, the ill fated attempts at CPR intended to save Mr. MacKay had\nthe very opposite effect.This case is therefore to be distinguished on its\nfacts from those established in R. v. Henry, where the Court of Appeal\nplaced the offence well beyond the near accident point on the spectrum.[37]Having made that finding, I conclude that the answer\nto the question earlier posed is that this is not one of those cases where the\nneed for denunciation and deterrence is so pressing that incarceration in a\npenitentiary will be the only suitable way in which to express society’s\ncondemnation of the offenders’ conduct.Neither would mere probationary\nmeasures be appropriate.Should, therefore, a conditional sentence be imposed\nagainst either or both of the offenders under s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code?[38]The leading case on conditional sentences is R. v.\nProulx (2000) 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449.In that case, Chief Justice Lamer\nlisted four criteria that a court must consider before deciding upon a\nconditional sentence:(1) the offender must be\nconvicted of an offence that is not punishable by a minimum term of\nimprisonment;(2) the safety of the community\nwould not be endangered by the offender serving the sentence in the community;(3)the court must impose a term\nof imprisonment of less than two years; and(4) a\nconditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and\nprinciples of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.[39]The first criterion is readily satisfied in that the\noffence of manslaughter is not punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment.[40]The second criterion above mentioned is a condition\nprecedent to the imposition of a conditional sentence.It involves the\ndetermination or assessment of the risk posed to the safety of the community by\nthe offender, and not the broader risk of whether the imposition of a\nconditional sentence would endanger the safety of the community by providing\ninsufficient general deterrence or undermining general respect for the law.Two factors should be taken into account:(1)\nThe risk of Mr. Stratton or Mr. Reid re-offending and;(2)\nThe gravity of the damage that could ensue in the event of a re-offence.[41]In view of the facts of this case, and the absence of\nany history of violence of any sort on the part of either Mr. Stratton or Mr.\nReid, I am satisfied that the safety of the community would not be endangered\nwere they permitted to serve their sentences in the community.Both were\ndescribed by Crown counsel and defence counsel alike as average young people\nwithin their community.[42]With respect to the\nlast two criteria, Chief Justice Lamer in Proulx stated that a purposive\ninterpretation of s. 742.1(a) should be adopted.He said (at paras 58-59):In my view, the requirement that\nthe court must impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years can be\nfulfilled by a preliminary determination of the appropriate range of available\nsentences.Thus, the approach I suggest still requires the judge to proceed in\ntwo stages.However, the judge need not impose a term of imprisonment of a\nfixed duration at the first stage of the analysis.Rather, at this stage, the\njudge simply has to exclude two possibilities: (a) probationary measures; and\n(b) a penitentiary term.If either of these sentences is appropriate, then a\nconditional sentence should not be imposed.In making this preliminary\ndetermination, the judge need only consider the fundamental purpose and\nprinciples of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2 to the extent necessary to\nnarrow the range of sentence for the offender.[43]I have already excluded probationary measures and the\nneed for a penitentiary term of two years plus where, in the latter\nconsideration, I have characterized this offence as falling towards the near\naccident point on the spectrum.Nonetheless, a consideration of the objectives\nand principles of sentencing, and bearing in mind that there was a loss of\nlife, leads me to narrow the range of an appropriate sentence here to something\nbordering on the two year mark.I conclude therefore that both offenders meet\nthe statutory conditions for a conditional sentence.[44]As noted by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in the\nearlier case of R. v. Parker (1997) 1997 CanLII 14391 (NS CA), 116 C.C.C. (3d)236,\nhowever, the satisfaction of the necessary conditions does not automatically\nentitle an offender to a conditional sentence, nor oblige the judge to impose\none.A discretion to do so remains with the sentencing judge.[45]The court went on to say that the thrust of the 1996\nlegislative initiative introducing conditional sentences to our criminal law is\nclearly to encourage courts to reduce the reliance upon incarceration of\noffenders, where appropriate. This is reflected in sections 718.2 (d) and (e)\nwhich the court must consider, in passing sentence.They bear rereading:(d) an offender should not be\ndeprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the\ncircumstances; and(e) all available sanctions other\nthan imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered\nfor all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal\noffenders.[46]After careful deliberation, and in light of the\nfindings I have earlier made in this decision, I have come to the conclusion\nthat a less restrictive sanction than total deprivation of liberty, namely, a\nconditional sentence, is appropriate in the unusual facts of this case.As was\nexpressly recognized in R. v. Proulx, a conditional sentence can provide\nsignificant denunciation and deterrence, particularly when onerous conditions\nare imposed.I am satisfied that the imposition of a period of incarceration\nto be served in the community, essentially through house arrest as a punitive\nmeasure, coupled with other conditions I will specify, and followed by a period\nof probation in the case of Mr. Reid, comprises a fit and proper sentence to be\nimposed.[47]I therefore sentence both Mr. Stratton and Mr. Reid\nto a period of incarceration of two years less a day, to be served in the\ncommunity, subject to the following conditions.First of all, section 742.3(1)\nrequires that they:(a)keep the peace and be of good behaviour;(b)\nappear before the court when required to do so by the court;(c)\nreport to a supervisor within 2 working days from today and thereafter continue\nto report as directed by the supervisor;(d)\ndo not leave the jurisdiction without the written permission of the court or\nthe supervisor; and(e)\nnotify the court or supervisor in advance of any change of name or address, and\npromptly notify the court or supervisor of any change of employment or\noccupation.[48]I impose the\nfollowing additional conditions upon Mr. Stratton:(a)\nhe is to perform 240 hours of community service over the next 18 months as\ndirected by his supervisor;(b)\nhe is to remain confined to his residence at all times for the first full year\nof his conditional sentence except for the following permitted absences:(1)\nTo travel to and from, and attend, his place of employment at regular hours;(2)\nTo perform community service work as directed, including any volunteer fireman\nwork as approved by his supervisor;(3)\nTo attend appointments with his supervisor;(4)\nBetween the hours of 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. each Saturday, solely for the\npurpose of buying groceries and other personal and household needs;(5)\nTo obtain medical treatment for himself;(6)\nIf written permission is first obtained by his supervisor for some other\npurpose.(c)\nhe is to have no contact with Mr. Reid or any members of the MacKay family;(d)\nhe is to receive only his own family members as visitors to his residence;(e)\nhe is to carry a copy of his conditional sentence order and present himself at\nthe door of his residence upon request by his supervisor or the police;(f)\nduring the second year of his conditional sentence, he is to observe a nightly\ncurfew from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. unless required by his employer to work\nnight shifts or to obtain emergency medical care.He is also to continue to\nobserve the no contact provision in respect of Mr. Reid and members of the\nMacKay family.[49]I now turn to the\nadditional conditions to be imposed on Mr. Reid:(a)\nhe is to perform 240 hours of community service over the next 18 months as\ndirected by his supervisor;(b)\nhe is to remain confined to his residence at all times for the first full year\nof his conditional sentence except for the following permitted absences:(1)\nTo travel to and from, and attend, his place of employment or apprenticeship\nprogram at regular hours;(2)\nTo perform community service work as directed;(3)\nTo attend appointments with his supervisor;(4)\nBetween the hours of 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. each Saturday, solely for the\npurpose of buying groceries and other personal and household needs;(5)\nTo obtain medical treatment for himself;(6)\nTo visit his grandmother in Truro one hour each Saturday;(7)\nTo attend, participate and complete alcohol abuse counselling as directed by\nhis supervisor;(8)\nIf written permission is first obtained by his supervisor for some other\npurpose.(c)\nto have no contact with Mr. Stratton or any members of the MacKay family;(d)\nto receive only his own family members as visitors to his residence (besides\nMs. De Coste);(e)\nto carry a copy of his conditional sentence order and present himself at the\ndoor of his residence upon request by his supervisor or the police.(f)\nto abstain from the consumption or possession of alcohol or any\nnon-prescription drugs;(g)\nduring the second year of his conditional sentence, he is to observe a nightly\ncurfew from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.He is also to continue to observe the no\ncontact provision in respect of Mr. Stratton and members of the MacKay family.Needless to say, the prohibition against the consumption of alcohol will\ncontinue as well.[50]Where I consider it beneficial that there be\ncontinued supervision for Mr. Reid, I am also ordering that he be under a\nprobation order for a term of two years to commence immediately following the\nexpiration of his conditional sentence.In addition to the mandatory\nconditions under s. 732.1(2) of the Code, I order that the reporting requirement\nand the no alcohol prohibition and no contact provisions earlier recited,\nremain in effect during this term of probation.[51]Finally, as part of this sentence the court must\nimpose the mandatory orders undersections 487.04 and 487.051, namely, the\nforensic DNA sample order and under s. 109, namely, the statutory firearms\nprohibition.If either offender has firearms, ammunition, explosives or other\nprohibited weapons in his possession, they are to be surrendered to a police officer\nor otherwise lawfully disposed of within one week from today.J."}

Pannu, 2015 ONCA 677 (CanLII).The quantity in this case is approximately a half\nkilogram or one pound.While the trial judge referred to the respondent’s\nrelatively young age, positive personal background, potential for\nrehabilitation, and unrelated criminal record, those considerations do not\namount to circumstances justifying such a significant departure from the\nrange.Rather, they support a sentence at the lower end of the range.[10]The respondent asks that if the appeal is\nallowed and the custodial sentence increased, that the court stay the execution\nof that sentence.While we acknowledge that the respondent has served the\nsentence that was imposed and a significant period of time has elapsed since\nhis release, in our view the seriousness of the offence militates against a\nstay.DISPOSITION[11]Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is\ngranted, the appeal is allowed, the sentence imposed at trial is set aside, and\nin its place a sentence of six years’ imprisonment is imposed.The respondent\nshall have forty-eight hours from the release of this endorsement and the order\nthat gives effect to it, to surrender into custody, failing which a warrant\nshall issue for his apprehension.“E.E.

Campbell J.COUNSEL:Megan Petrie, for the Crown, respondentTaufiq Hashmani, for\nthe accused, appellantHEARD:June 8, 2015ENDORSEMENT[Summary Conviction Appeal]A.Introduction[1]The appellant, Tshepho Onyaditswe, was charged with two counts of\nassault, two counts of assault with a weapon, and one count of sexual assault.The offences were all allegedly committed by the appellant in the context of\nhis domestic relationship with the female complainant.[2]The appellant was tried by the Honourable Mr. Justice B. Cavion of the\nOntario Court of Justice.The trial judge heard from only two witnesses, the\ncomplainant and the appellant.The case turned entirely upon the credibility\nof the two witnesses and the trial judge’s application of the burden of proof in\naccordance with the principles outlined in R. v. W.(D.), 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R.\n742, at pp. 757-758.After hearing the brief closing submissions of counsel,\nthe trial judge delivered oral reasons for judgment concluding that the\nappellant was not guilty of the charge of sexual assault, but was guilty of the\nremaining four offences.[3]The appellant then pled guilty to an additional charge of breaching his\nrecognizance by communicating with the complainant when he was obliged to\nabstain from such communication.[4]Recognizing that the appellant had already spent a total of six months\nand 11 days in custody on these charges, the trial judge imposed the sentence\njointly proposed by counsel, namely, one day in jail and a one year period of probation,\nconcurrent on all charges.However, he refused the accused’s request to\napportion the time served in pre-trial custody across the various offences.[5]The appellant now appeals against both his conviction and sentence.B.The Appeal\nAgainst Conviction1.Introduction[6]With respect to the appeal against conviction, defence counsel advanced four\narguments.First, he argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider\nwhether the Crown had established a lack of consent on the part of the\ncomplainant as one of the essential elements of the assault offences.Second,\nhe argued that the trial judge erred in failing to consider whether the Crown\nhad established that the appellant was not acting in self-defence.Third, he\ncontended that the trial judge misapprehended some of the evidence provided by\nthe appellant.Finally, defence counsel urged me to conclude that the reasons\nfor judgment provided by the trial judge were legally insufficient in that they\nfailed to explain why the trial judge had reached the conclusions he did\nregarding the verdict.For the following reasons, I reject each of these\narguments.2.Consent and Self-Defence[7]The first two grounds of appeal can be conveniently dealt with\ntogether.The trial judge did not expressly consider the issues of consent or\nself-defence in his reasons for judgment.The appellant argued that the trial\njudge was bound to consider these issues as, at one point in his reasons for\njudgment, the trial judge mentioned that he suspected that “on a few occasions\n[the complainant] gave as good as she got” from the appellant in relation to\ntheir fights.I see no error on the part of the trial judge in this regard.There was no suggestion by the appellant that he had ever been acting in\nself-defence, or that the complainant had consented to his assaultive conduct.Moreover, at trial, counsel for the appellant did not raise either argument on\nbehalf of the appellant.In addition, the complaint’s evidence, which the\ntrial judge accepted, established that she did not consent to the assaultive\nconduct by the appellant, and established that the appellant did not act in\nself-defence.See R. v. J.B., 2004 BCCA 342 (CanLII), [2004] B.C.J. No. 1234, at\npara.14.The mere fact that, on other occasions, not forming part of\nthe allegations before the court, the complainant may have assaulted the\nappellant as much as the appellant assaulted her, did not require the trial\njudge to engage in any further consideration of these issues in relation to the\ncounts before the court.3.Misapprehension of Evidence[8]I do not accept that the trial judge significantly misapprehended the\ntestimony of the appellant as to the nature of his relationship with the\ncomplainant.In concluding that he had “no doubt” that the alleged assaults\ntook place, and similarly had “no doubt” that the alleged incidents involving\nthe appellant assaulting the complainant with the “pot lid” and with the “cord”\ntook place, the trial judge rejected the denials of the appellant on the basis\nthat they did “not ring true.”In drawing his conclusions in this regard, the\ntrial judge indicated that he did “not believe for a moment that things were\nlovey-dovey and hunky-dory” between the appellant and the complainant, as the\nappellant suggested in his evidence, and that “it was all fabrication” on the\npart of the complainant.While the appellant certainly did not use those\nprecise terms to describe his relationship with the complainant, in my view this\nwas not an inaccurate characterization of the overall tenor of the appellant’s evidence.See R. v. Morrissey (1995), 1995 CanLII 3498 (ON CA), 22 O.R. (3d) 514 (C.A.), at pp. 538-541; R.\nv. Lohrer, 2004 SCC 80 (CanLII), [2004] 3 S.C.R. 732, at para. 2; R. v.

No. 3944, at para. 6.4.The Legal Adequacy of the Reasons for Judgment at Trial[9]I also reject the appellant’s argument that the reasons for judgment\nprovided by the trial judge are legally inadequate.Viewed from a functional\nand context-specific approach, and read in their entirety, against the evidentiary\nbackground of the case, and the live issues in this case, the reasons for\njudgment delivered by Cavion J. adequately explain why the appellant was convicted,\nprovide public accountability for the verdict, and permit effective appellate\nreview of the decision.See R. v. Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26 (CanLII), [2002] 1\nS.C.R. 869, at paras. 24-28, 46-52, 55; R. v. Braich, 2002 SCC 27 (CanLII),\n[2002] 1 S.C.R. 903, at para. 31; R. v.

F.C., 2015 ONCA 191 (CanLII), [2015] O.J. No. 1437, at paras. 27-36.C.The Appeal\nAgainst Sentence[10]With\nrespect to the appeal against sentence, defence counsel argues that the trial\njudge failed to properly consider the potential immigration consequences for\nthe appellant as required by R. v. Pham, 2013 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2013] 1 S.C.R.\n739.At trial, defence counsel obliquely suggested that, if the trial judge\nwere to “split up the time served between the counts” this would result in\neffective sentences of less than six months, and might avoid the deportation of\nthe appellant.Presumably, defence counsel was alluding to the fact that\ncertain provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C.\n2001, c. 27, ss. 36(1)(a) and 64(2), define “serious criminality,” which may\nlead to inadmissibility and other negative immigration consequences, as being\nconvicted of a crime that has been punished in Canada by a “term of\nimprisonment” of “more than six months, or “at least six months.”[11]According\nto the “fresh evidence” materials provided on the appeal, it appears that the\nCanada Border Services Agency has determined that it “will not be proceeding\nwith removal action at the present time.”At the same time, the appellant has\nbeen warned that this decision “may be reviewed in the future” in the event of\nfurther information or further criminal convictions, and could result in the\nappellant’s “removal from Canada.”[12]In\nany event, the Crown has fairly conceded that the appellant’s sentence appeal\nshould be allowed so as to more accurately and evenly apportion the pre-sentence\ncustody served by the appellant across his various convictions.I agree.See R.\nv. Pinas, 2015 ONCA 136 (CanLII), [2015] O.J. No. 941.In the result, while the formal\nsentence imposed upon the appellant remains the same, the pre-sentence custody\nserved by the appellant (i.e. six months and 11 days) shall be apportioned\nequally amongst the appellant’s four convictions for the assault-based\noffences.D.Conclusion[13]In\nthe result, the appeal by the appellant against his conviction is dismissed.However, with respect to his sentence appeal, the appeal is allowed, but only\nto the extent that the pre-sentence custody served by the appellant (i.e. six\nmonths and 11 days) will be apportioned equally amongst the four\nassault-related convictions.The sentence appeal is otherwise dismissed.An\norder shall issue accordingly.___________________________Kenneth L.\nCampbell J.Released:August 7, 2015"}

No. 2867\n(C.A.), we are not persuaded that the sentence she imposed was unfit.Indeed, in our view, having regard to the fact that this was a serious sexual\nassault perpetrated on a 15 year old in her home by an adult in a position of\ntrust, a custodial sentence of 1 year was fit.[8]Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is\ndismissed.Leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal from\nsentence is dismissed.“M.

Those\nreasons have since been reported in the Quicklaw system, at [2009] N.J. No. 9.\nA pre-sentence report was ordered, and sentencing set over to February 23,\n2009, to await preparation of the report.2.In the interim,\nthe Court received a letter from Renee Groves, a probation officer with the\nCorrections and Community Services division of the Department of Justice. The\nletter, dated February 9, 2009, advises that the writer is unable to complete a\npre-sentence report because the accused was “unwilling to participate in the\ninterview process”.3.Section 721(3)(a)\nof the Criminal Code provides as follows:“Unless\notherwise specified by the court, the report must, wherever possible, contain\ninformation on the following matters:(a)\nthe offender’s age, maturity, character, behavior, attitude and willingness to\nmakeamends;4.If an accused\nperson in unwilling to participate in the preparation of a report, then it may\nbe difficult for the Court to gauge the offender’s maturity, character,\nattitude and willingness to make amends. However, such refusal to participate\nin the process cannot derail the sentencing. Nor does it result in an inability\nto prepare a report: instead, it requires the probation officer to set out why\ninformation was not directly available from the accused, and puts the probation\nofficer to using other sources of information, if available.5.In the case at\nBar, counsel opted not to require a pre-sentence report prepared using sources\nother than the accused. Had that not been the case, then, as indicated above,\nthe Court would have expected a report compiled by the probation officer using\nsecondary sources of information.6.The Court was\nprovided with a victim impact statement. It confirmed the long term impact of\nthe crimes committed against the complainant, the requirement to eat soft foods\nfor eight weeks, lingering complications with the broken bones in her face,\nembarrassment and humiliation by the bruises to her face, and a lasting fear of\nintimacy with other men.7.The parties'\nrespective submissions displayed a wide range of sentence for these criminal\nadventures, which may be summarized as a range of sentence from three to seven\nyears in custody. I reserved the decision to consider the submissions in the\ncontext of the evidence, the jurisprudence, and general sentencing principles.8.Section 718 of\nthe Criminal Code generally codifies the principles of sentencing. However,\nsection 718.2(ii) specifically recognizes as aggravating the fact that the\nvictim of a crime is the spouse or common law partner of the accused, and\nsection 718.2(iii) also recognizes as aggravating the fact that the accused was\nin a position of trust towards the victim of the crime. These sections of the\nCriminal Code apply in the case at Bar, because of the nature of the\nrelationship between the accused and the complainant when the offences were\ncommitted. I say this advisedly, because the complainant and the accused were\nneither married nor cohabiting on a permanent basis, but were still involved in\na long term intimate relationship.9.The accused is\nnot a first offender. The Court was provided with a criminal record from this\nCourt, as well as a CPIC printout showing convictions in Ontario and Alberta.\nThese confirm that, from the years 1988 to 2003 inclusive, the accused had\ntwenty-nine convictions. These included ten crimes of violence (five of assault\nand five of sexual assault), ten breaches of probation, six breaches of\nundertaking, a breach of a section 811 recognizance, a conviction for mischief,\nunder section 430 of the Criminal Code, and a conviction under the Controlled\nDrugs and Substances Act. One of the assault convictions, dated September 26,\n2001, in Fort McMurray, Alberta, is described as a “spousal” assault.10.Since 2003, the\naccused has had no convictions, although it is noted that the present offences\nwere committed over a lengthy period of time. The jurisprudence which I will\nproceed to discuss will incorporate the gap in the offences committed by the\naccused.11.The appropriate\nmechanism for a Judge to follow when calculating sentence for an accused who\nhas been convicted of multiple offences is to assess the offences separately,\nand then to consider the totality of the sentences. Thus, while separate\ncriminal adventures ought usually to be dealt with by separate and consecutive\nsentences, there will be cases where the principle of totality requires the\noverall sentence to be moderated: see, for example R. v. Crocker,\n(1991), 1991 CanLII 2737 (NL CA), 93 Nfld \u0026 PEIR 222 (NLCA).12.In R. v. White,\n[2007] 270 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 351(NLCA), 2007 NLCA 44 (CanLII), the accused\nhad been sentenced to five years imprisonment for assault causing bodily harm.\nThe accused appealed, complaining of not having been granted a postponement,\nbut also citing thethe “jump effect”, sometimes called the “step-up\nprinciple”.13.At paragraph 5\nofR. v. White, Cameron, J.A., writing for a unanimous Court, referred\ntothe decision in R. v. Robitaille (1993),\n1993 CanLII 2561 (BC CA), 31 B.C.A.C. 7, where Lambert J.A. indicated that the “jump effect” should be\nused only in cases where rehabilitation is a significant sentencing factor. An\nobvious example is where the offender is a young person who has committed very\nfew offences. White was neither a young man, nor had he committed few offences.\nInstead, he was 52 years of age, and had a lengthy record which included\nconvictions for common assault and 8 convictions for assault causing bodily\nharm or assault with a weapon.14.The accused at\nBar is 44 years old, with 29 prior convictions. It is true that his convictions\nfor sexual assault and assault are somewhat dated, having been sentenced for\nthose crimes between 1988 and 2003, and it is also true that his sentences were\ntypically two years or less for those crimes. However, this is the first time\nthat he has ever been convicted of assault causing bodily harm, a more serious\noffence than those for which he was previously convicted.15.InR. v.\nWhite, supra, at paragraph 8, Cameron, J.A., makes it clear that the\nsentencing Court must consider rehabilitation when tailoring an appropriate\nsentence. Counsel for the accused urged the Court to consider rehabilitation in\nthis case. Certainly, the issue of rehabilitation must never be lost from due\nconsideration, and will factor in the ultimate sentence imposed in this case.\nHaving said that, however, the accused has repeatedly been sentenced to\nrelatively short periods of incarceration for assaults in the past, and these\nprior efforts to specifically deter him from re-offending have all failed. As\nnoted above, he has now moved to a more serious type of assault, one of causing\nbodily harm, as opposed to the common assaults on his record. This leads me to\nplace greater weight on protection of the public and general deterrence than on\nrehabilitation.16.For the assault\ncausing bodily harm in this case, which resulted in two broken bones in the\ncomplainant's face, requiring reconstructive surgery, the maximum sentence is\nten years. In the context of the circumstances of this offence, this offender,\nhis antecedents, and the lasting impact on the complainant, an appropriate\nsentence is five years.17.There is a\ngeneral range of sentence for sexual assault involving sexual intercourse of\nfrom three to seven years. In R. v. Noseworthy, Noseworthy, and Alcock, (1982), 40 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 193 (NLCA),\nthe Court of Appeal reduced the sentences of four years to three years for\nfirst offenders who had pleaded guilty to rape. Writing for a unanimous Court,\nMifflin, C.J.N., said “Three to seven years is simply the normal range.”18.That range has\nbeen consistently followed: see for example R. v. Pastiwet, [1993] N.J. No. 130(SCTD), at paragraph 33, R.\nv. Green [1996] N.J. No. 210 (SCTD), at\nparagraph 4,R. v. Rich, [2006]\nN.J. No. 142(SCTD), and R. v. A.W.,2008 NLCA 52 (CanLII), [2008] 279 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 199\n(NLCA), at paragraph 4.19.It is to be noted\nthat sexual assault simpliciter carries a maximum sentence of ten years, and so\nmust not be confused with the separate offences of sexual assault with a weapon\n(section 272(1)(a)), or sexual assault causing bodily harm (section 272(1)(c)),\nas these offences have a broader range of sentence, with a maximum sentence of\nfourteen years. In this regard, it is irrelevant that no weapon was used, or\nthat the victim was not physically injured as a result of the sexual assaults\ncommitted upon her by the accused.20.These sexual\nassaults were his sixth and seventh. They should not be dealt with in\nisolation, or as if first offences. Regrettably, without the pre-sentence\nreport, we are at a disadvantage in terms of assessing the attitude of the\naccused towards the offences. However, it is not lost on the Court that, when\nasked if he has any thing to say before being sentenced, the accused pleaded\nfor a light sentence so that he could see his children grow up. He did not say\nthat he was sorry. Sentences of four years each are appropriate for both counts\nof sexual assault.21.The common\nassault is both the least of the four crimes committed, and the first of the\nfour crimes committed against the present complainant. It is the sixth such\noffence for which the accused has been convicted. In the past, his common\nassault sentences have been, for the most part, relatively brief: thirty days\non three separate assault convictions in 1998, ninety days intermittent in 2001\nin Alberta, but twelve months for the last common assault, on July 10, 2003, in\nPlacentia. His sixth sentence for common assault should not be less than his\nfifth, and so a sentence of twelve months is appropriate for that offence.22.It is at this\npoint where the principle of totality requires the Court to adjust the total\nsentence so that, while the goals of protection of the public and general\ndeterrence are respected, they are balanced with the goals of specific\ndeterrence, rehabilitation, and reformation of the accused. Otherwise, the sum\ntotal, of five years for the assault causing bodily harm, four years each for\nthe two sexual assaults, and another year for the common assault, would result\nin a sentence of fourteen years, a sentence many would consider to be\ndisproportionate to the crimes committed by the accused. Accordingly, the total\nsentence will be adjusted, to reflect the principle of totality.23.The accused has\nserved five and a half months on remand since his arrest. This was not because\nof any breach of bail condition: he was denied judicial interim release ab\ninitio. Accordingly, I will follow the usual practice, of giving him credit\nat a rate of approximately two days for every day spent on remand, and sentence\nhim for the common assault to a sentence of time served.24.While the sexual\nassaults and the assault causing bodily harm were separate criminal adventures,\nthe balancing of rehabilitation with the principle of totality, as discussed by\nBarry, J., as he then was, in R. v. Martinez, (1994) 1994 CanLII 10523 (NL SCTD), 127 Nfld \u0026 PEIR\n157 (NLTD), persuades me to allow the accused to serve the remaining sentences\nconcurrently. This will reduce his total sentence, from the date of sentencing,\nto five years in custody.25.Ancillary orders\nare required in relation to the offences committed by the accused. These\ninclude forensic DNA orders, Sex Offender Registry orders, prohibition from\ncontact orders, victim fine surcharge orders, and firearms prohibition orders.\nLet me discuss these in turn.26.Sections\n487.051(1)(a) and (2) provide that when someone is convicted of a primary\ndesignated offence, a DNA order must be made unless the judge is satisfied that\nthe offender has established that the impact of the order on his or her privacy\nand security of the person would be grossly disproportionate to the public's\ninterest in the early detection, arrest and conviction of offenders. Sexual\nassault and assault causing bodily harm are primary designated offences: see\nsection 487.04 of the Criminal Code. The accused has not persuaded me that\nmaking such an order would be grossly disproportionate in this case.\nAccordingly, an order for collection of suitable DNA material from the accused\nwill issue in relation to both counts of sexual assault, as well as the offence\nof assault causing bodily harm.27.Pursuant to\nsection 490.013(2)(b), the accused will comply with the Sex Offender\nRegistration Act for twenty years in relation to each count of sexual assault.28.Pursuant to\nsection 743.21 of the Criminal Code, an order prohibiting the offender from communicating,\ndirectly or indirectly, with the complainant during the custodial period of the\nsentence, is made.29.The victim fine\nsurcharges are mandatory, except when the imposition of a victim fine surcharge\nwould result in “undue hardship” to the offender: see sections 737(1) and\n737(5) of the Criminal Code. The accusedis, and will remain in, custody, and\nis therefore incapable of paying a victim fine surcharge. These are, therefore,\nwaived.30.Section 109(1)(a)\nof the Criminal Code provides that where a person is convicted of an indictable\noffence in the commission of which violence against a person was used,\nthreatened or attempted and for which the person may be sentenced to\nimprisonment for ten years or more, the sentencing Court shall make an\norder prohibiting the person from possessing any firearm, cross-bow, prohibited\nweapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition\nand explosive substance during the period specified in the order as determined\nin accordance with subsection (2) or (3), as the case may be.31.Sexual assault\nand assault causing bodily harm are violent offences with maximum sentences of\nten years. Accordingly, a section 109 order applies to each of those three\noffences.32.Following\nsections 109(1)(a) and 109(3) of the Criminal Code, it is ordered, in relation\nto both counts of sexual assault, and in relation to the offence of assault\ncausing bodily harm, that the accused is prohibited from possessing any\nfirearm, cross-bow, restricted weapon, ammunition and explosive substance for\nlife. While it may well be unnecessarily repetitive, in relation to both counts\nof sexual assault, and the count of assault causing bodily harm, pursuant to\nsection 109(2)(b) of the Criminal Code, he is also prohibited from possessing any\nprohibited firearm, restricted firearm, prohibited weapon, prohibited device\nand prohibited ammunition for life.33.Pursuant to\nsection 110(1)(a), and in relation to the common assault count, the accused is\nprohibited from from possessing any firearm, cross-bow, prohibited weapon,\nrestricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition or\nexplosive substance for a period ending not later than ten years from his\nrelease from imprisonment.34.In summary, the\naccused is sentenced to five years in custody, in addition to the five and a\nhalf months that he has spent on remand. DNA samples will be taken from him and\nentered into the national databank, he will be enrolled in the sex offender\nregistry, he is prohibited from contacting the complainant while serving his\nsentence, and he is prohibited from possession of any firearm, ammunition, or\nexplosive device for the rest of his life. He is not required to pay any victim\nimpact surcharges.Order Accordingly, this 27th\nday of February, 2009, at Grand Bank, NL.Porter, P.C.J.Crown counsel D. HowellCounsel for the Accused K. Baker"}

KonyerHeard\non November 21, 2016 and January 23 and February 13, 2017Reasons\nfor Sentence released on February 27, 2017Ms. K. Lederri....................................................................................... counsel\nfor the CrownMr. K. Bernhardt...............................................counsel for the accused Megan DiminieKONYER J.:[1]Megan Diminie is a 28 year old first offender.She entered a guilty plea before me on November 21, 2016 to a single count of\ntrafficking in cocaine.The sentencing in her matter was adjourned for the\npreparation of a pre-sentence report, and to allow her to complete some\nrehabilitative programs prior to being sentenced.The Crown seeks a sentence\nof 6 months jail followed by probation, while the defence has urged me to\nimpose a non-custodial sentence.These are my reasons for sentence.[2]The offence that Ms. Diminie committed is\nmanifestly serious.She sold 0.4 grams of cocaine to Rodney Decoste outside\nthe Best Western hotel in Cobourg for $40 on April 18, 2016.At the time, she and\nher domestic partner, Michael Rutledge, were under police surveillance as a\nresult of information the police had received that they were involved in the\nsale of cocaine.Ms. Diminie was arrested two days later, at which time she\nwas in possession of $922 in cash.[3]It is beyond dispute that cocaine is a serious\nand harmful drug.It is highly addictive, and wreaks havoc on the lives of\nthose who become addicted.It destroys families and harms communities.Because it is illegal yet highly profitable, the cocaine industry attracts\norganized criminals who use violence to carry out their business.It is not a\nstretch to say that those who traffic in cocaine peddle human misery for\nprofit.Accordingly, as the Crown rightly points out, this is “a serious\noffence warranting emphasis on the principles of deterrence and denunciation”: R.\nv. Woolcock, [2002] O.J. No. 4927 (C.A.), at para. 8.[4]Therefore, it is important that the sentence for\nMs. Diminie’s conduct sends the appropriate message.The sentence I impose\nmust, in part, represent “a symbolic, collective statement” that Ms. Diminie’s\nconduct “should be punished for encroaching on our society’s basic code of\nvalues”: see R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 81.[5]At the same time, Ms. Diminie is a youthful\nfirst offender, which means that the objectives of rehabilitation and specific\ndeterrence must also be primary sentencing objectives: see R. v. Priest,\n1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA), [1996] O.J. No. 3369 (C.A.); R. v. Nassri, 2015 ONCA 316 (CanLII), at para 30.[6]From the evidence before me, it appears as\nthough Ms. Diminie was addicted to cocaine at the time she committed this\noffence.She has a history of serious substance abuse dating back to the age\nof 12, and her intimate partner at the time this offence was committed was also\nan addict.I am satisfied on the evidence before me that Ms. Diminie was a\nstreet level cocaine dealer at the time of her arrest who was selling small\nquantities of the drug to support her own addiction.Accordingly, her level of\nmoral culpability for the trafficking offence is markedly lower than a\ntrafficker motivated solely for profit.[7]Ms. Diminie has been involved in a series of\nunhealthy and abusive domestic relationships with partners who have also been\naddicts.Despite her drug use and lifestyle, she successfully completed high\nschool and does have some history of gainful employment, though her employment\nwas also in fields that were compatible with her lifestyle and drug use.She\nis now living with and being supported by her mother, who works as a nurse.[8]Ms. Diminie has accessed counseling services\nsince being charged, and prior to her plea being entered.She has attended\nregular appointments with FourCAST (Four Counties Addiction Services Team) since\nNovember 8, 2016 and “has been engaged and actively participates” according to\nher counsellor: see Exhibit 5.This service assisted Ms. Diminie in completing\nan application for residential treatment, and she completed the residential\ncomponent of treatment at the New Port Centre, a residential treatment facility\nfor substance abuse in Port Colborne, Ontario, from January 3-19, 2017: see\nExhibit 7.She is currently engaged in follow-up counseling in accordance with\nher discharge plan, which includes “increasing stress management and coping\nskills, increasing knowledge of anger management and conflict resolution, as\nwell as increasing knowledge on improving healthy relationships”: see Exhibit\n5.[9]I have the benefit of a comprehensive\npre-sentence report, which I would characterize as cautiously optimistic.Ms.\nDiminie has a long history of substance abuse and has been entrenched in a\nnegative lifestyle for most of her young life.She has, however, made\nsignificant progress recently in addressing the issues underlying her negative lifestyle\nand her offending behaviour.It is the opinion of the probation officer who\nauthored the report that Ms. Diminie “would be a suitable candidate for\ncommunity supervision with compliance and willingness to seek assistance on an\nongoing basis”: see Exhibit 3, page 6.Based on all of the information before\nme, I share this opinion.[10]In arguing for a sentence of custody, the Crown\nrelies upon R. v. Woolcock, supra, where the Court of Appeal\nreduced the sentence imposed after trial of two years less a day jail to\nfifteen months jail for possession of crack cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.The appellant, who was 53 years old and had two prior drug convictions for\nwhich he had received jail sentences, was found in possession of over 6 grams\nof crack cocaine, cash and other drug trafficking paraphernalia.He was\nconvicted following a jury trial.The sentencing judge found that appellant\nwas a commercial trafficker.In that context, the Court of Appeal held that\n“[t]he range of sentence for this type of offence appears to be 6 months to 2\nyears less a day”: para. 15.[11]While I appreciate that the seriousness of cocaine\ntrafficking will usually mean that nothing short of jail can properly reflect\nthe pressing need to denounce and deter this conduct, my fundamental\nduty as a sentencing judge is to “engage in an individualized assessment of all\nof the relevant factors and circumstances, including the status and life\nexperiences, of the person standing before [me]”: R. v. Ipeelee, 2012\nSCC 13 (CanLII), at para. 75.[12]Sentencing is a highly individualized process that cannot be\nreduced to a mathematical calculation.While sentencing ranges may be useful\nguides, the Supreme Court has directed sentencing judges that they cannot be\nsubstitutes for an individualized analysis.“Sentencing ranges are nothing\nmore than summaries of the minimum and maximum sentences imposed in the past,\nwhich serve in any given case as guides for the application of all the relevant\nprinciples and objectives. However, they should not be considered ‘averages’,\nlet alone straitjackets, but should instead be seen as historical portraits for\nthe use of sentencing judges, who must still exercise their discretion in each\ncase”: R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII), at para. 57.[13]I am required, in every case, to consider “all\navailable sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the\ncircumstances and consistent with the harm done to victims or to the\ncommunity”: s. 718.2(e).In Ms. Diminie’s case, she has spent 17 days in a\nresidential treatment facility, which I consider to be the equivalent of\ncustody.She has made significant gains to positively address the issues at\nthe root of her offending behaviour.A community-based sentence is the best option\nto foster her ongoing rehabilitation through counseling and other\nrehabilitative programming.In the long term, her successful rehabilitation is\nthe best means to protect society from a repetition of similar behaviour.Although a jail sentence would send a stronger deterrent and denunciatory\nmessage, these objectives are still achieved to a significant degree through a\nrecognition of time spent in residential treatment coupled with lengthy\nprobation and significant community service hours.[14]Accordingly, I take into account the 17 days spent\nin residential treatment.I suspend the passing of sentence and place Ms.\nDiminie on probation for the maximum term of 3 years.The conditions of her\nprobation order are as follows:•To keep the peace and be of good behaviour;•Appear before the court when required to do so•Notify the court or probation officer in advance of any change of\nname of address and promptly notify the court or probation officer of any\nchange in employment or occupation•Report in person to a probation officer within 2 working days and\nafter that, at all times and places as directed by the probation officer or any\nperson authorized by a probation officer to assist in your supervision•Your reporting requirement ends when you have satisfied your\nprobation officer that you have completed all of your community service hours\nand completed all of your counselling•Cooperate with your probation officer. You must sign any releases\nnecessary to permit the probation officer to monitor your compliance and you\nmust provide proof of compliance with any condition of this Order to your\nprobation officer on request.•Live at a place approved of by the probation officer and not\nchange that address without obtaining the consent of the probation officer in\nadvance•Do not contact or communicate in any way, directly or indirectly\n, by any physical, electronic or other means, with Michael Rutledge or Rodney\nDecoste•Do not be within 100 metres of any place where you know any of\nthe person(s) named above live, work, go to school, frequent or any place you\nknow the person(s) to be EXCEPT for required court attendances.•Do not attend at the Best Western Hotel, 930\nBurnham St., Cobourg, Ontario•Do not possess or consume any unlawful drugs or substances (refer\nto the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act) except with a valid prescription in\nyour name or those available over the counter•Attend and actively participate in all assessment, counselling or\nrehabilitative programs as directed by the probation officer and complete them\nto the satisfaction of the probation officer for substance abuse and life\nskills•Perform 150 hours of community service work on a rate and\nschedule to be directed by the probation officer but must be completed within 18\nmonths of the start date to this Order[15]I also make an order pursuant to section 109 of\nthe Criminal Code prohibiting Ms. Diminie from possessing any\nfirearm, crossbow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device,\nammunition, prohibited ammunition and explosive substance for a period of 10\nyears.[16]Finally, I am required to impose a victim\nsurcharge of $200 for this offence.Ms. Diminie has 60 days to pay the\nsurcharge.Released:February\n27, 2017Signed:\nJustice S.

Minuk, for the respondent.(AR 99-30-04053)[1]Monnin, J.A.\n[Orally]: This is a Crown appeal from a sentence of 18 months' incarceration\nimposed on the respondent for three offences of possession of cocaine for the\npurpose of trafficking and one of possession of the proceeds of drug\ntrafficking.[2]At the conclusion of the hearing, the appeal was\nallowed and the sentence was increased to 30 months with reasons to follow.\nThese are the reasons.[3]On June 30, 1998, the respondent was arrested\nand charged with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. A search\nof the respondent's car at the time of arrest resulted in the police seizing\nsixteen 1/4-gram flaps of cocaine. The respondent was released on a promise to\nappear in court on July 29, 1998.[4]On July 6, 1998, the respondent was again\ncharged with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. On this day,\non two different occasions, undercover police officers called the respondent on\nhis cell phone and made arrangements to purchase cocaine from him. All told,\nfour 1/4-ounce flaps were sold to police officers. Upon the respondent's\narrest, three more 1/4-ounce flaps were seized. The respondent was released on\na recognizance on July 7, 1998.[5]On December 1, 1998, the respondent, while still\non bail for the prior two charges, again sold cocaine to an undercover police\nofficer. At the time of his arrest, the respondent had in his possession --\napart from the two flaps sold to the officer -- twenty-three 1/4-ounce flaps,\nalong with $645.[6]Following a plea of guilty, the respondent was\nsentenced on December 9, 1998. In passing sentence, the sentencing judge\nacknowledged the Crown's argument that a sentence of 36 months was not an\nunrealistic suggestion, but nonetheless imposed the sentence that he did\nbecause the respondent was dealing in 1/4-ounce sales as opposed to ounce\nsales.[7]The sentencing judge might well have been\ncorrect in his assessment had he been dealing with but one charge. He was in\nerror, however, in failing to consider only the amounts being sold per flap as\nopposed to the total amounts that the accused had in his possession, packaged\nand ready for sale. He was also in error in failing to recognize the clearly\ncommercial and overt aspect of the respondent's involvement that included a\ncall and delivery service. Finally, the sentencing judge failed to give\nadequate weight to the fact that two of the offending incidents occurred while\nthe respondent was on bail for the very same thing.[8]In imposing a sentence for trafficking in\ncocaine, the amount involved in a transaction merits attention and\nconsideration by a sentencing court. The amount involved is, however, not the\nsole criteria and, in this case, the sentencing judge erred by not sufficiently\nbalancing the issue of amounts with the commercial aspects of the respondent's\nactions and his repeated involvement.[9]A sentence of 18 months does not properly\nreflect the extent of the respondent's offending behaviour. The sentence of 18\nmonths is therefore to be set aside and replaced with one of 30 months.[10]In addition, both counsel for the Crown and the\nrespondent agreed that because the respondent was convicted of an offence\nrelating to the contravention of ss. 6(1) or (2) or 7(1) or (2) of the Controlled\nDrugs and Substances Act, a 10-year firearm restriction should be\nimposed effective from the respondent's release from imprisonment. This\nautomatic requirement had not been brought to the attention of the sentencing\njudge. The sentence is therefore also varied to so provide.Appeal allowed."}

De Corbyfor\nthe CrownCameron I. McCannellfor\nthe accusedSENTENCINGJUDGMENTKEENE J.July 3, 2014INTRODUCTION[3]On\nDecember 20, 2012, the offender, Francis David Sparvier, was convicted after\ntrial by Madam Justice J.E. McMurtry on one count of robbery with violence in\nrelation to the theft of a van and some of its contents contrary to s. 344(b)\nof the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. The offence was committed on\nMay 6, 2008 in the City of Regina. This is the predicate offence in this\ndecision.[4]The Crown\nthen sought an order for an assessment of Mr. Sparvier pursuant to the\nprovisions of Part XXIV of the Criminal Code. Madam Justice McMurtry\ngranted that order on March 27, 2013 directing that Dr. Roger Holden prepare\nthe assessment.[5]The\nreport of Dr. Holden was filed with the court on June 26, 2013.[6]On April\n25, 2014, Crown counsel filed a Notice of Application seeking a determination\nthat Mr. Sparvier be declared a dangerous offender pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal\nCode returnable in court on May 5, 2014. Unfortunately Justice McMurtry was\nunable to continue and accordingly, pursuant to s. 669.2(1), Chief Justice\nPopesculassigned myself to complete this case.[7]At the\nopening of the hearing on May 5, 2014, counsel for the Crown and the defence\nadvised the court that an agreement had been reached to deal with the\nsentencing by way of a joint submission that Mr. Sparvier be found to be a\nlong-term offender and not a dangerous offender. Counsel jointly recommended a\nterm of imprisonment of seven years followed by the maximum term of community\nsupervision of ten years. In addition, Crown counsel submits ancillary orders\nunder s.487.051: DNA (mandatory); s. 760 (mandatory); and a s. 109 lifetime\nfirearms order, are necessary.[8]This\nCourt heard the testimony from two witnesses called by the Crown. The defence\ncalled Mr. Sparvier and one other witness. In addition the Crown tendered seven\nexhibits, including Dr. Holden’s original report (P4) and his\nupdated report (P5) and two large binders containing reports and other\ndocuments regarding Mr. Sparvier (P6 and P7). Mr. Sparvier provided two letters\nof support (D1 and D2).PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER[9]Mr.\nSparvier’s background is detailed in Dr. Holden’s report (P4). Mr.\nSparvier was born on December 26, 1957 in Broadview, Saskatchewan. He was the\nonly child of Ernest Lavallie, who died in 1981 and his mother Dorothy, who\ndied in 1994. It appears that Mr. Sparvier grew up on the Cowessess First\nNation Reserve. According to Mr. Sparvier, his mother did not have a\nrelationship with Mr. Lavallie. He was reared by his mother and her partner,\nXavier Sparvier. Mr. Sparvier reports he has 22 half siblings. He complained\nthat his step-father was at times mean to him. It appears he felt isolated in\nthe Sparvier household because he was not Xavier Sparvier’s biological child. Mr.\nSparvier said he had an excellent relationship with his mother. When Mr.\nSparvier was about eight years old, he went to live in Calgary with another\nfamily for a couple of years. He did not like it there and claims he was\nemotionally and physically abused. He returned home. It appears both his mother\nand Xavier Sparvier abused alcohol and this resulted in Mr. Sparvier being\nassaulted by his step-father from time to time. In short it appears that Mr.\nSparvier did not enjoy a truly happy home but did participate in sports and\nother activities and seemed to have a reasonably good association with some of\nhis siblings.[10]Mr.\nSparvier’s longest relationship was for about eight years (1978\n- 1986) with “Donna”. The couple had four children, now\n34, 33, 31 and 29 years of age. His children are reported to be successful and\ndoing well. He is presently in a relationship.[11]Mr.\nSparvier has had difficulties with relationships. Dr. Holden’s report highlights the\nspousal abuse issues.[12]Mr.\nSparvier completed his grade 12 and a carpentry course through SIAST and holds\na journeyman’s certificate. He has also taken business\nadministration courses. He has served on the Cowessess Band Council.[13]At present\nMr. Sparvier enjoys the support of his family and community. He has found work\nas a contractor. He has been in the community for over three years without\ncommitting any further violent offences.[14]Unfortunately,\nas highlighted in Dr. Holden’s report, he has had an almost\nlifetime long battle with substance abuse. This struggle seems to, for the most\npart, have caused his criminogenic activity.MR. SPARVIER’S CRIMINAL HISTORY[15]Mr.\nSparvier has a lengthy criminal history that started when he was around 11 (see\np. 14 of Dr. Holden’s report - P4). His criminal record\nstarted in 1979 and is set out in Tab 2 found in P6 and also p. 15 of Dr.\nHolden’s report, (P4). The Crown has provided a “summary of violent offence\nconvictions” (Tab 2 - P6) which describes 15 violent crimes\nranging from assault to armed robbery and robbery with violence. He has\nreceived custodial sentences with the most individually lengthy sentence being\nfive years for armed robbery. He has also received consecutive sentences of\nthree years (totalling it seems six years on one occasion) for robbery with\nviolence. He has spent a considerable amount of his adult life in the\npenitentiary.[16]Madam\nJustice McMurtry set out the circumstances of this present conviction in her\njudgment of December 20, 2012 which has been transcribed and is on the court\nfile. In short, Mr. Sparvier and two ladies decided to rob an elderly gentleman\n(who as it turns out was suffering from dementia). Mr. Sparvier assaulted the\nvictim and stole his van. I note Mr. Sparvier told Dr. Holden somewhat of a\ndifferent story (p. 16 of Dr. Holden’s report P4).[17]The first\nwitness called by the Crown at the sentencing hearing was Linda Gallant. She is\nthe manager of the community residential facility in Regina called the Oskana\nCommunity Centre which is operated by Corrections Services Canada. She\ntestified about supervision, support and programming available to offenders in\nthe community. Ms. Gallant testified that offenders can be placed in various\ncommunity correctional facilities or community residential facilities depending\non the needs of the parolee or long-term offender under a supervision order.\nShe stated that she supervises long-term offenders at Oskana. Ms. Gallant\ncommented that success in re-integration into the community is dependant on the\nmotivation of the offender.[18]The second\nwitness was Lee Anne Skene who is presently the Deputy Warden at the Healing\nLodge at the Nekaneet First Nation near Maple Creek, Saskatchewan. She is\nfamiliar with Mr. Sparvier’s case file and has reviewed a copy\nof Justice McMurtry’s decision. She commented on Mr.\nSparvier’s long history of violent offences and his significant\nissue with substance abuse. She advised that Corrections Service Canada can\ndevelop a correctional plan for Mr. Sparvier once he is sentenced and will\ndeliver appropriate high intensity programming to Mr. Sparvier. Ms. Skene\nstated that Mr. Sparvier appeared motivated to follow his corrections plan\nbefore and completed numerous programs while in custody. He worked with Elders\nand engaged in cultural programming. He has struggled on release however and\nhas a problem with cocaine addiction. She outlined programs available to Mr.\nSparvier including programs to deal with domestic violence and addictions.[19]Dr. Holden\nis a clinical psychologist. His two reports were admitted into the record by\nconsent. Dr. Holden was not called to testify. Dr. Holden interviewed Mr.\nSparvier on May 1 and 2, 2013. During the interview process, a detailed\npsychosocial history was obtained and Mr. Sparvier was extensively tested. The\ntotal interview time was approximately six hours. In addition, Dr. Holden\nreviewed numerous reports and records pertaining to Mr. Sparvier (see p. 1 of\nDr. Holden’s report, P4).[20]Dr. Holden\nhas provided a detailed and comprehensive assessment. I accept his findings. I\nquote from Dr. Holden’s summary in his June 22, 2013 report\n(P4) at pps. 58-62:The Five Basic\nQuestions:Boer and. his\ncolleagues (Boer, Hart, Kropp \u0026 Webster, 1997) in their manual associated\nwith sex offending suggest that five basic questions be addressed when making a\nrisk assessment. It seems to me that the questions have at least equal\nsignificance for violent offending and they will be addressed here:1.What is the\nlikelihood that the individual will engage in violence if no efforts are made\nto manage risk?I have no doubt\nthat, unless measures are taken to manage Mr. Sparvier's risk, he will continue\nto perpetrate acts of physical violence.2.What is the\nprobable nature, frequency, and severity of any future violence?It is obviously\nspeculative to try to predict the nature of any future violence in Mr.\nSparvier. His record contains acts of instrumental violence ‑ his armed\nrobberies ‑ where he used threats of violence, which he enforced, on\noccasion, with a weapon.His index offence\nappears to be instrumental too, in my opinion. He appears to have made an\narrangement with his accomplices to extort money from his victim and as the\nextortion continued, it evolved into a physical altercation with the victim. It\nis of concern that in the interview, Mr. Sparvier indicated he was the victim\nof the individual who he assaulted. He said the victim was \"trying to\nchoke me\".His other acts of violence\nappear to be impulsive assaults against his common‑law partners.Therefore, the\nnature of any future assaults perpetrated by Mr. Sparvier may include\ninstrumental and spousal assault.The frequency of\nsuch behaviours is, again, speculative. His criminal record details convictions\nfor assault beginning in 1988 and the summary of violence offence convictions\nsuggests he has eleven violence related offences. Given that he has spent a\nsignificant amount of the last two decades in prison, one might speculate he is\nhighly likely to commit violence related behaviours quite frequently.Regarding the\nseverity of such violence, his behaviour falls into two different categories,\nin my opinion. The instrumental violence, except for the index offence, did not\ninvolve any actual physical contact with the victims who were employees of the\nvarious establishments that he robbed. In my opinion, these individuals would\nhave been severely traumatized by his behaviour.In the index\noffence, the victim received cuts and bruising to the left side of his face.The spousal assaults\ninvolved grabbing one of his partner's by the arms and pulling her from the\nchair. The second assault perpetrated against the same victim indicated that he\nthrew her onto the kitchen floor and then forced her to have sexual intercourse\nwith him. The third spousal assault, in my opinion, is a much more serious\nassault.In my opinion, the\nspousal assaults have increased in intensity, which is of considerable concern.In the commission of\nhis robberies, Mr. Sparvier armed himself and at least on one occasion placed a\nknife against the stomach of one of his victims.3.Who are the\nlikely victims of any future physical violence?As noted above, he\nhas physically assaulted his partners and future partners may well be likely\nvictims of Mr. Sparvier. It is of concern that he apparently intends to live,\nshould he be released, near to the victim upon whom he was convicted of ACBH.4.What steps\ncould be taken to manage this individual's risk of future violence?Obviously, if Mr.\nSparvier would be incarcerated, his potential to commit acts of violence in the\ncommunity would be nil.Treatment programs\ndesigned to address criminogenic factors have been tried repeatedly with Mr.\nSparvier. Results suggest he does extremely well when incarcerated but has less\nsuccess at maintaining sobriety and abiding by conditions when released into\nthe community.Given his age and\npast lack of success with applying whatever he has learned in the programs he\nhas taken, I do not think that he is treatable using traditional cognitive\nbehavioural methods.One way in managing\nhim in the community would be to impose very tight restrictions upon his\nactivities and require him to commit to sobriety and to provide urinalysis\nsamples at the request of any supervising officer. While his violent behaviour\ncannot be totally attributed to his substance abuse, there is, in this case, in\nmy opinion, a significant correlation between the two and his friend in the\ncommunity suggested that when he is not drinking he is a very pleasant,\napproachable man who changes considerably as soon as he chooses to drink.\nTherefore, controlling his drinking behaviour, in my opinion, would be a very\nimportant factor in controlling his general criminality and potential for\nviolence. Of course, attempts to do exactly this have been tried in the past\nwith minimal amounts of success. However, I do not believe that these attempts\nshould not be tried again if he were to be released. If Mr. Sparvier were to\nagree to a supervised application of an anti‑alcohol agent such as\nDisulfiram his potential for relapsing into alcohol abuse would, in my opinion,\nwould be significantly reduced.There is a growing\nbody of literature suggesting that, as individuals age their potential to\ncommit violent crime significantly decreases (for example, Dekker and Bryant,\n2010; and Craig, 2011). These publications strongly suggest the majority of violent\nbehaviour in Canada and elsewhere is perpetrated by males in their late\nadolescence or early adulthood. Although, it is somewhat arbitrary, most\nresearchers appear to agree the potential for individuals over the age of 60 to\ncommit violent crimes rapidly declines.Mr. Sparvier is\npresently aged 55 and one might assume that, following a term of imprisonment,\nhe will be released in his 60's. One might opine his potential to commit\nviolent acts then will be much less because of his age.He seems to have significant\nunresolved issues with intimate partners and, in my opinion, this is one area\nof significant risk for him. He should not be allowed to have unsupervised\naccess to intimate partners for a considerable time following his release and\nhe must demonstrate to the satisfaction of supervising officers that he is\ncapable of handling such relationships in the future.Again, it is\nrecognized that this risk factor has been seen as part of his background for a\nconsiderable amount of time.His general\ncriminality would be expected to decline as a result of his age, too, and his\ninvestment in using the skills and tools that he has in the construction\nindustry and being committing to doing so might well be a buffer against his\nrelapsing into violent behaviour.5.What\ncircumstances might exacerbate the individual's risk for violence?Mr. Sparvier is, in\nmy opinion, a high risk to relapse into substance abuse and general criminality\nand a high risk to perpetrate acts of violence especially against female\npartners. Unless his alcohol and substance issues are sincerely addressed by\nMr. Sparvier and unless he learns more appropriate ways of involving himself in\nintimate partnerships both of these areas, in my opinion, would exacerbate his\nrisk for future violence.CONSIDERATION OF\nLONG‑TERM OR DANGEROUS OFFENDER STATUSIn reviewing the\nsections of the Criminal Code connected with such matters, I believe Mr.\nSparvier has demonstrated a repetitive pattern of violent behaviour for many\nyears now and believe that there is a high risk for him to offend violently in\nthe future. However, for reasons noted above, I believe that there is a\nreasonable possibility that his risk to reoffend violently in the community can\nbe controlled and therefore, I believe he fits a designation of a long‑term\noffender as I understand the term.[Emphasis in\noriginal][21]Additionally,\nDr. Holden provided an update of his opinion (P5). I quote from p. 10 of that\nreport:The new materials\nhighlight, in my opinion, the following:•He has a chronic and apparently intractable substance\nabuse problem, despite his attempts to treat it over the past twenty or so\nyears.•He has lived an essentially criminal life-style for most\nof his adult life.•He is probably untreatable.•The conclusions drawn in my initial report on pages 60-61\nare reinforced by the new materials.•My conclusion Mr. Sparvier is a high risk to commit\nviolent crimes in the future is supported by the new documents.•He will remain a high-risk offender for, probably, the\nremainder of his life but, statistically, his potential for committing violent\ncrimes will diminish as he grows older.•His risk to commit violent crimes in the community will be\nconsiderably increased unless he has a total commitment to abstention from all\nsubstances.•He remains,\nin my opinion, a long-term offender, as I understand the term.[Emphasis\nin original]EVIDENCE OF DEFENCE WITNESSES[22]Defence\ncounsel filed letters from Patrina Friedle, a sister of Mr. Sparvier (D1) and\nJodie Delorme, a daughter of Mr. Sparvier (D2). Both letters are supportive.\nAdditionally Valerie Tanner was called as a defence witness. She has recently\nrekindled an acquaintanceship with Mr. Sparvier. She is an elected official for\nthe Cowessess First Nation. She advised the court that for the last two years\nMr. Sparvier has joined a seniors group and has been quite active. She is\nsupportive of Mr. Sparvier.[23]Mr.\nSparvier took the witness stand and read from a prepared statement (D3). The\nstatement sets out his remorse and also provides some further information about\nhis present life. Mr. Sparvier appears to acknowledge his wrongdoing and seems\ngenuine in his desire to lead a better life. He noted his involvement with his\nfamily.THE ISSUES[24]The Crown\ndoes not seek an order declaring Mr. Sparvier to be a dangerous offender under\ns. 753.1 of the Criminal Code. Both the Crown and counsel for Mr.\nSparvier, by joint submission, request that Mr. Sparvier be designated a\nlong-term offender as defined in s.753.1 of the Criminal Code. They\njointly suggest a term of incarceration of seven years, less remand credit and\na ten year period of community supervision.[25]The issues\ntherefore are:1.Does Mr. Sparvier meet\nthe definition of a long-term offender pursuant to s. 753.1 of the Criminal\nCode?2.If he does, is the\ndeterminate sentence and long-term supervision order suggested by the Crown and\ndefence counsel in their joint submissions appropriate in this case?THE CRIMINAL CODE PROVISIONS[26]Section\n753.1 states:753.1 (1) The court\nmay, on application made under this Part following the filing of an assessment\nreport under subsection 752.1(2), find an offender to be a long‑term\noffender if it is satisfied that(a) it would be appropriate to impose a\nsentence of imprisonment of two years or more for the offence for which the\noffender has been convicted;(b) there is a substantial risk that the\noffender will reoffend; and(c) there is a reasonable possibility of\neventual control of the risk in the community.(2) The court shall\nbe satisfied that there is a substantial risk that the offender will reoffend\nif(a) the offender has been convicted of an\noffence under section 151 (sexual interference), 152 (invitation to sexual\ntouching) or 153 (sexual exploitation), subsection 163.1(2) (making child\npornography), 163.1(3) (distribution, etc., of child pornography), 163.1(4)\n(possession of child pornography) or 163.1(4.1) (accessing child pornography),\nsection 170 (parent or guardian procuring sexual activity), 171 (householder\npermitting sexual activity), 171.1 (making sexually explicit material available\nto child), 172.1 (luring a child) or 172.2 (agreement or arrangement — sexual offence against child), subsection\n173(2) (exposure), 212(2) (living on the avails of prostitution of person under\neighteen), 212(2.1) (aggravated offence in relation to living on the avails of\nprostitution of a person under the age of eighteen years) or 212(4) (offence — prostitution of person under eighteen) or\nsection 271 (sexual assault), 272 (sexual assault with a weapon) or 273\n(aggravated sexual assault), or has engaged in serious conduct of a sexual\nnature in the commission of another offence of which the offender has been\nconvicted; and(b) the offender(i) has shown a pattern of repetitive\nbehaviour, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a\npart, that shows a likelihood of the offender’s causing death or injury to other persons\nor inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons, or(ii) by conduct in any sexual matter\nincluding that involved in the commission of the offence for which the offender\nhas been convicted, has shown a likelihood of causing injury, pain or other\nevil to other persons in the future through similar offences.(3) If the court\nfinds an offender to be a long‑term offender, it shall(a) impose a sentence for the offence for\nwhich the offender has been convicted, which must be a minimum punishment of\nimprisonment for a term of two years; and(b) order that the offender be subject to\nlong‑term supervision for a period that does not exceed 10 years.(3.1) The court may\nnot impose a sentence under paragraph (3)(a) and the sentence that was imposed\nfor the offence for which the offender was convicted stands despite the\noffender’s being found to be a long‑term\noffender, if the application was one that(a) was made after the offender begins to\nserve the sentence in a case to which paragraphs 753(2)(a) and (b) apply; and(b) was treated as an application under\nthis section further to the court deciding to do so under paragraph 753(5)(a).(4) and (5)\n[Repealed, 2008, c. 6, s. 44](6) If the court\ndoes not find an offender to be a long‑term offender, the court shall\nimpose sentence for the offence for which the offender has been convictedANALYSIS1.Does Mr. Sparvier meet the\ndefinition of a long term offender pursuant to s. 753.1 of the Criminal Code?[27]In order to\nfind Mr. Sparvier to be a long-term offender, I must be satisfied that it would\nbe appropriate to impose a sentence of imprisonment of two years or more for\nthe offence for which he stands convicted; that there is a substantial risk\nthat he will reoffend; and that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual\ncontrol of the risk in the community. I must also find that Mr. Sparvier has\nshown a pattern of repetitive behaviour, of which the predicate offence forms a\npart that shows a likelihood of his causing death or injury to other persons or\ninflicting severe psychological damage on other persons.[28]I have no\ndifficulty in finding that the criteria for declaring Mr. Sparvier to be a\nlong-term offender have been met. The circumstances of the robbery in this case\nare serious and inflicted with violence. The victim was particularly vulnerable\nin that he was elderly and suffering from dementia. Accordingly this warrants\nthe imposition of a sentence in excess of two years. Additionally, Mr. Sparvier\nas noted has a lengthy criminal record.[29]I am also\nsatisfied that Mr. Sparvier is at a high risk to reoffend. This is the opinion\nof Dr. Holden. The fact that Mr. Sparvier has already spent a considerable part\nof his life in prison attests to his inability to curb his criminal behaviour,\nespecially given his substance abuse issues. I note that he has not committed a\ncriminal offence for the past three years. However, his personal history\nreveals a troubling tenancy to perpetrate violent crimes particularly when he\nis intoxicated or under the influence of illegal drugs.[30]I am also\nsatisfied based on the reports of Dr. Holden that there is a reasonable\npossibility of eventual control of the risk in the community. Dr. Holden is of\nthe opinion that Mr. Sparvier is a good candidate for comprehensive and\nintensive treatment interventions and that there is a reasonable likelihood\nthat, within the foreseeable future, his risk can be reduced through\nappropriate treatment interventions to the point that he can be safely managed\nin the community. Neither the Crown nor defence counsel dispute these\nconclusions. I also note Ms. Skene’s comment that Mr.\nSparvier has been compliant with institutional programming.[31]Therefore\nall the criteria to have Mr. Sparvier declared to be a long-term offender have\nbeen met.[32]Section\n753.1(3) directs the court to impose a sentence of at least two years\nimprisonment and an order that the offender be subject to long-term supervision\nfor a period not exceeding ten years.2.If he does, is the\ndeterminate sentence and long term supervision order suggested by the Crown and\ndefence counsel in their joint submissions appropriate in this case?The Determinate Sentence[33]In\ndetermining what is a fit and proper sentence, this Court must have regard to\nthe sentencing principles and objectives set forth in s. 718, 718.1 and 718.2\nof the Criminal Code. Since Mr. Sparvier is Aboriginal, I must also\nconsider the particular circumstances of Aboriginal offenders, also known as “the Gladue factors” which refer to the\nSupreme Court of Canada’s directions in R.\nv. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, 171 D.L.R. (4th) 385.\nHowever, when asked by the court to address Gladue factors, both Crown\ncounsel and defence submitted that such factors are not predominate in this\ncase. I accept their submission in this regard. The maximum penalty for robbery\nwith violence is life in prison, which is indicative of the seriousness\nattributed to the commission of this offence by the Parliament of Canada.[34]Justice\nMcMurtry has set out the facts of this offence in her judgment of December 20,\n2012. As I have noted above, this was a premeditated robbery of an elderly gentleman\nwho was suffering from dementia. There was some violence in the attack and the\nvictim was undoubtedly traumatised. I asked the Crown if there was going to be\na victim impact statement but one had not been obtained. This may have been\nbecause the victim is suffering from dementia. However as indicated, this was a\ncallus attack on an relatively defenceless victim. The purpose was to obtain\nthe property of the victim. The joint submission of seven years can be\nsupported by the case law in this jurisdiction (see R. v. Gordon, 2011\nSKCA 130 (CanLII), 375 Sask.R. 312; R. v. Keewatin (J.W.), 2009 SKQB 58 (CanLII), 323\nSask.R. 150; R. v. Rudolph (B.J.), 2012 SKQB 442 (CanLII), 410 Sask.R. 134; R.\nv. Papequash, 2013 SKQB 369 (CanLII), 431 Sask.R. 24; R. v. Pelletier, 2014\nSKQB 90 (CanLII), [2014] S.J. No. 183 (QL); R. v. Castle (A.E.), 2009 SKQB 407 (CanLII),\n345 Sask.R. 95; and R. v. Edinborough (G.S.), 2010 SKQB 30 (CanLII), 348 Sask.R.\n136).However the sentence of seven years will be reduced by remand time\nserved to 6 years and 11 months. This is based on pre-trial remand of two weeks\nand because this predates the legislative change, I am prepared to give Mr.\nSparvier 2:1 time (i.e. one month). Accordingly I accept the joint submission\nand sentence Mr. Sparvier to a prison term of 6 years and 11 months.The Long-Term Supervision Order[35]Counsel for\nthe Crown and defence counsel have jointly submitted that the maximum allowable\nperiod of supervision, being ten years, should be ordered in this case. I am\nsatisfied that this is appropriate. This is based on Dr. Holden’s report, Mr. Sparvier’s record and his history\nof reoffending. This lengthy period of supervision should give Mr. Sparvier a\nchance to succeed and it will protect the public.[36]Therefore I\norder that Mr. Pelletier be supervised in the community for a period of ten\nyears after completion of his sentence in accordance with s. 753.1 of the Criminal\nCode and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c.\n20.SUMMARY[37]I find Mr.\nSparvier to be a long-term offender. The appropriate determinative sentence for\nthe charge of robbery with violence is seven years. Mr. Sparvier will receivecredit for time served in pre-trial (being one month) and accordingly he is\nsentenced to the penitentiary for 6 years and 11 months.[38]In\naddition, I order that Mr. Sparvier be subject to long-term supervision for a\nperiod of ten years following completion of his determinative sentence.[39]Section 109\nof the Criminal Code applies in this case since the offence is anoffence in which violence against a person was used, threatened or attempted,\nand for which a person may be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years or more.\nAccordingly, Mr. Sparvier is prohibited from possessing any firearm, cross-bow,\nprohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited\nammunition and explosive substances for life.[40]Robbery is\na primary designated offence within the meaning of s. 487.04 of the Criminal\nCode. I am satisfied that an order allowing the taking of bodily substances\nfor DNA analysis would not be grossly disproportionate to the public interest\nin the protection of society and the proper administration of justice.\nAccordingly, such an order in Form 5.03 authorizing the taking of the number of\nsamples of bodily substance that is reasonably required for the purpose of\nforensic DNA analysis from Mr. Sparvier shall issue. Before taking samples of\nbodily substances from Mr. Sparvier under this order, the peace officer or\nperson acting under their direction, shall verify whether the Convicted\nOffenders Index of the National DNA Data Bank, established under the DNA\nIdentification Act, S.C. 1998, c. 37 contains Mr. Sparvier’s profile, and otherwise\nproceed in accordance with the requirements of s. 487.071 of the Criminal\nCode.[41]I will\nwaive the victim surcharge. This offence took place prior to the recent\namendments to the Criminal Code.[42]Section 760\nof the Criminal Code provides as follows:760. Where a court\nfinds an offender to be a dangerous offender or a long‑term offender, the\ncourt shall order that a copy of all reports and testimony given by\npsychiatrists, psychologists, criminologists and other experts and any\nobservations of the court with respect to the reasons for the finding, together\nwith a transcript of the trial of the offender, be forwarded to the\nCorrectional Service of Canada for information.[43]Accordingly,\nmy reasons for sentencing, together with all exhibits, assessments, required\ntranscripts and documents are be forwarded to the Corrections Service of\nCanada.J.T.J.

Cudmore for J. SmithH. Palin for CrownGEORGE J.:[1]Jamie Smith pleaded guilty to failing\nto remain at the scene of an accident, knowing that bodily harm was caused,\ncontrary to section 252(1.2) of the Criminal Code of Canada.[2]On May 15, 2015 I found her guilty.[3]This is a straight indictable\noffence.[4]The central sentencing issue is\nwhether jail is the appropriate consequence.All agree a conditional sentence\nis not available.[5]These are the facts.Jamie Smith was\noperating her motor vehicle on January 1, 2015, returning from a local pub\nafter New Year’s celebrations.A pedestrian, the victim Alison Chmara, was\ncrossing Central Street, in London, from the south side towards the north.The\nvictim's companion told her to \"watch it…and be careful\".Ms.\nSmith's vehicle then collided with her, knocking her to the ground.In the\nprocess the vehicle's side mirror was broken.Ms. Smith did not stop. She kept\ndriving making no attempt to offer assistance.[6]Ms. Chmara sustained serious\ninjuries.Plates were inserted in her head.She suffered a concussion.There\nwas injury to her shoulder, and her teeth were damaged.[7]The investigation revealed that Ms.\nSmith purchased a new mirror, replacing the broken one, clearly an attempt to\nconceal what had happened.As it was initially unknown who the driver was, a\nfriend of Ms. Chmara posted on Facebook, essentially a plea for anyone with\ninformation to come forward. This led to the police identifying Ms. Smith as\nthe driver.She was arrested on January 31, 2015, a full month after the\nincident.[8]Upon arrest, Ms. Smith admitted to\nbeing the driver and to striking a pedestrian. She did not believe the impact\nwas bad enough to cause injury, which doesn't explain how she reconciled that\nbelief with the clear and obvious damage to her vehicle.Nor does it explain\nwhy she felt the need to leave the scene; a failure of her moral obligation.[9]32 year old Ms. Smith has no criminal\nrecord.She is separated; a mother of two children, ages 4 and 6.[10]I have the benefit of a presentence\nreport, victim impact statement, and information respecting (and photographs\nof) Ms. Chmara's injuries.[11]There are no underlying issues. That\nis, no addictions or mental health issues contributed to Ms. Smith’s offending\nbehaviour.Her formative years were uneventful.She is from a broken home,\nbut by all accounts her parents remained focused on her well-being post\nseparation.She has a good relationship with her step mother, step father,\nbiological family, and two step brothers.She describes her childhood as\nhappy, never experiencing extreme hardship or tragedy.[12]Ms. Smith was married, separating from\nher husband in 2014.Since that time, she has been the primary caregiver for\nher children.Her ex-husband contributes little, financially or otherwise.[13]The report describes Ms. Smith as a\nloving mother. She speaks of her children in caring terms, making it clear they\nare her number one priority.Her ability to provide for her children and give\nthem the lifestyle she wants, is complicated by the fact that, according to the\nreport, the father has \"lost interest\" in the children and is seeing\nthem with ever decreasing frequency.[14]Ms. Smith is currently single, not\nhaving dated anyone since the dissolution of her marriage. To her parenting\nabilities, Ms. Smith's mother calls her \"an amazing mother who is actively\ninvolved in every facet of her children's life including volunteering at their\nschool, daycare, and at the humane society\".She is said to,\nnotwithstanding her financial limitations, always prioritize her children's\nactivities so they have as many opportunities as possible.[15]Ms. Smith has worked full time since\nthe age of 19.She has been employed, on a full time basis, and at the same\ncompany, since 2003.This experience - being charged, going through the court\nsystem, and staring at, potentially, a fairly lengthy jail sentence - has had\nan impact on her.She has not worked since being charged, supporting herself\nthrough the short term disability program offered by her employer.She is\npresently applying for long term disability benefits.[16]She is suffering from anxiety and\npanic attacks, and is under the care of a doctor and taking medication to\nmanage her symptoms.The report's author suggests that not only is she scared\nof the potential personal consequences of her behaviour, but that she feels\nhorrible about the accident and impact upon the victim.Ms. Smith is\nremorseful.The following passage from the report, found at the top of page 5,\nbest captures her response to this ordeal:The\noffender was quite nervous at the onset of the presentence report interview.She became very emotional when discussing the index offence and expressed\nguilt, shame and remorse for her actions that have brought her before the\ncourt.When discussing the injuries the victim sustained the offender began to\ncry and acknowledged that she has not told anyone aside from her mother about\nthe offence as she is so ashamed of herself…[17]The author goes on to write:The\noffender takes responsibility and expressed genuine remorse for her actions on\nthe night of the offence.These actions do not appear consistent or\nrepresentative of the pro-social lifestyle that she has led and continues to\nlead.Throughout her life she has maintained employment, positive family\nrelationships, social use of substances, volunteered in her community and has\nnever been in conflict with the law.She is the primary caregiver to her\ndaughters aged 4 and 6.She does not have any criminogenic targets that\nrequire intervention……….[18]The Crown seeks a, relatively\nspeaking, lengthy period of incarceration, one in the range set forth in the\nauthorities it has provided and relies upon.I will summarize them.In R. v.\nEichler 2012 ONCJ 480 (CanLII), [2012] O.J. No. 3390, a 2012 Ontario Court decision, Justice Hearn\nimposed a six month sentence; two year driving prohibition; and 12 months of\nprobation.In that matter the offender had no prior record, was remorseful,\nand pleaded guilty.Mr. Eichler was a youthful first offender, with a positive\npre-sentence report.He pleaded guilty to failing to remain at the scene of an\naccident knowing that the victim had suffered bodily harm, the same offence for\nwhich Ms. Smith has been found guilty.Mr. Eichler consumed two beers prior to\ndriving, and there was no evidence of erratic driving.He did, however, strike\nthe victim, a pedestrian attempting to cross the street, leaving (after\ntemporarily slowing) offering no assistance.[19]Like Ms. Smith, his conduct was\ndescribed as being motivated by sheer panic.In his case, the victim’s leg was\nbroken in three places.Two surgeries were required which involved the\ninsertion of plates and steel bars.The victim also suffered a fractured skull\nand upper vertebrae together with extensive scraping and bruising.Those\ninjuries, not unlike this matter, resulted in significant pain, lengthy\nrehabilitation, and a diminished quality of life.Depression ensued, with\nsevere impacts upon his once very active life and social existence.[20]The court in Eichler clearly views\ndenunciation as the foremost factor to consider, the sentencing goal clearly\nbeing to communicate society's condemnation of the offender's conduct.It\nquotes the still relevant 1983 Court of Appeal decision in R. v. Gummer [1983]\nO.J. No. 181, where at para 14 the court writes that:Failing\nto remain at the scene of an accident to offer assistance to an injured person\nwas a grave failure to comport with the standards of humanity and decency.[21]At paragraph 16, it goes on to write\nthat:The\ncourt has a duty to bring home to persons having the charge of a motor vehicle\nwhich has been involved in an accident that the courts of this country will not\ncountenance the failure to remain at the scene and discharge the duties\nrequired by the criminal code.[22]I was also provided the case of R. v.\nRamdass [1982] O.J. No. 177, a 1982 Court of Appeal opinion, which confirmed a\nlower court’s decision to impose a 9 month jail sentence.Respecting this case\nI note two things.First, not to suggest this is no longer good law, but this\ndecision is dated some 34 years.Second, death ensued, which was the direct\nresult of the offender's bad driving. That is, in that matter, the fail to\nremain conviction was entered together with a finding that he drove\ncarelessly.Neither is the case here.In other words, there is no underlying\n(or accompanying) substantive offence and, thankfully, death was not the\nresult.[23]The defence advocates for a suspended\nsentence and lengthy period of probation. There being no underlying issues\nsuggesting a counselling need, the only real and meaningful way for Ms. smith\nto be held accountable, should I accept this argument, would be through the\nimposition of a significant number of community service hours.[24]I found this to be a difficult and\nchallenging sentencing.While denunciation and deterrence are paramount, that\ndoesn't entirely diminish every other consideration.The biggest challenge has\nbeen determining a fit, individualized sentence, while at the same time having\nit properly reflect the serious victim impact.This is not easy because the\ncalculus should never be, as a general rule, to increase the punitive nature of\na sentence in an attempt to have it commensurate with victim suffering.It\nsimply cannot work that way, for many reasons, including the fact it wouldn’t\nbe realistic or achievable.It is not formulaic in that sense.[25]Conversely, denunciation demands that\na sentencing judge be responsible in signalling to the community that certain\nkinds of behaviour cannot and will not be tolerated, and that, if certain\nstandards of decency are not met, stern consequences will follow.[26]This is a delicate balancing act, with\nmany interests at stake, and in that sense, one must never lose sight of the\nfact that the primary purpose of sentencing is to fashion a proportional\npunishment.In all cases, a sentence must be proportionate to the severity of\nthe crime and degree of responsibility of the offender. In doing so, I must consider\nthe nature and gravity of the offence, and be informed by the notion of parity\nin that the sentence should be like those imposed on others, who are similarly\nsituated, having committed similar crimes.[27]This doesn't detract from the fact\nsentencing is an individualized process.A fit sentence cannot be determined\nwithout knowing the background and current circumstances of the particular\noffender before the court.This must mean that, at least to some extent, I\nshould consider the impact and ramifications of this offence on the offender,\nbeyond the formal sentence I endorse.[28]Professor Benjamin Berger puts it\nbest, in a piece found in the Supreme Court Law Review titled \"Sentencing\nand the Salience of Pain and Hope\" SCLR (2d.), where he writes:Sentencing\njudges rarely speak about punishment.There is much discussion of sentencing\nobjectives, with courts debating, for example, the relative situational\nimportance of deterrence and denunciation, as compared with rehabilitation.Appellate courts emphasize the fundamental purpose of sentencing, which, in\nCanada \"is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to\nrespect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by\nimposing just sanctions”.One can find careful reflection on the principles of\nsentencing, with appellate courts giving guidance on principles of parity and\nparsimony, mitigation and aggravation.With this, a rich sentencing\njurisprudence has developed to help judges to arrive at an appropriate form of\nsanction, imposed in a fit quantum.But all of this is really just the\ntechnocratic rendering of the thing itself.\"Sentencing\" - and the\nlanguage of principles and objectives that fuel it - is the bureaucratized\nexpression of how one arrives at what truly is at stake after a finding of\ncriminal liability; the infliction and experience of suffering at the hands of\nthe state.The law of sentencing, as we have it now, is overwhelmingly a kind\nof meta-narrative; a principled and careful reflection, to be sure, but a\nprincipled and careful reflection about how to engage in a process already one\nstep removed from punishment itself.What\nwould a jurisprudence of sentencing that was induced from the experience of\npunishment rather than deduced from the technocracy of criminal justice look\nlike? Otherwise put, what would we expect to find in sentencing jurisprudence\nif one began with a phenomenology of punishment? One answer is that we would\nexpect to find more careful attention paid to the empirical bases for our hopes\nsurrounding punishment.One might expect to see more interest in and\nsignificance attach to how, when, and why offenders are actually deterred,\nrehabilitated, or made more responsible.At a time when facts are out of\npolitical favour in matters of criminal justice policy, such a jurisprudential\nreinvestment in the empirical would be refreshing, treating sentencing\nobjectives with the seriousness and realism that one would think they demand.[29]I believe what he is talking about,\nand specifically suggesting, is that sentencing judges should be mindful of the\nbroad scope of the offenders experience in and with the criminal justice\nsystem. Later in that same article, Professor Berger writes:In\nthis jurisprudence \"from up close\", we would be interested in the\npain, loss, estrangement, alienation and other features of the life that the\ncriminal justice system imposes on the offender in response to his or herwrongdoing.Rather than the abstract of quantum, the focus would be the experience of\nsuffering at the hands of the state.It is, after all, the character of that\nexperience that acts upon the offender and, in so doing, dictates the\nrealization of our sentencing objectives.[30]I appreciate what I have quoted is an\nopinion, from the academic world, which essentially advocates for the expansion\nof what we would consider in assessing proportionality.And while this is\nsomewhat novel, higher courts haven't been entirely silent either.The Supreme\nCourt, in R. v. Pham 2013 SCC 15 (CanLII) discusses sentence fitness where there are\nlooming collateral consequences from the Immigration and Refugee Protection\nAct.Similarly, in R. v. Nasogaluak 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII), the Supreme Court assesses\nthe impact of police misconduct during an arrest, and how that should impact\nupon the \"gravity of the offence\".[31]Furthermore, Justice Lebel talks\nextensively about proportionality in R. v. Ipeelee 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII), which is not,\nas some believe, simply an aboriginal sentencing case.[32]The point is this, it is not wrong to\nconsider the impact of, for example, a driving prohibition on Ms. Smith as\ncompared to its impact on another offender; the impact a jail sentence would\nhave on her and her two young, vulnerable, and dependent children; the impact\non her employment situation and prospects; the impact a criminal conviction\nwould have on her specifically; and the significant toll this process has taken\non her mental health and emotional well-being.[33]With my thanks to Professor Berger\nfor, in a very thoughtful and articulate way, setting out what I would be\nincapable of expressing, I must now consider what impact Ms. Smith’s particular\ncircumstances and attendant hardships, has on sentence quantum.In other\nwords, is this a part of her punishment?Again, this is a balancing act. And I\nunderstand and appreciate the counter-argument to applying proportionality in\nthe way I suggest, to Ms. Smith. Which is to say, to keep with the examples\nalready cited: she does not have the antecedents of an aboriginal person who has\nto constantly deal with inherent unfairness within the system, she is not\nfacing collateral immigration consequences, nor has she been the target of\npolice aggression.I would point out simply that a proportionality analysis is\nnot limited to pre-determined factors. This is always dependent on an\noffender’s personal circumstances.[34]To be clear, no one should take my\noffender-specific and focussed comments to this point, to be a minimization of\nthe extreme harm caused by Ms. Smith’s actions and the significant injuries\noccasioned the victim. These too are sentencing considerations.Whatever\nsentence I impose, it won’t detract from that, nor should it be construed as a\nreflection of the value of Ms. Chmara’s life and level of suffering.No matter\nwhat I do, Ms. Chmara will continue to struggle and cope with this, all of\nwhich should weigh heavily upon Ms. Smith’s conscience.And I have no doubt it\nwill.She should feel bad, remorseful, guilty and sad. If she didn't,\nsomething would be very wrong with her moral compass, a compass that we know\ncan be corrupted given her decision to leave Ms. Chmara without offering\nassistance.[35]The authorities the Crown relies upon\nare examples of courts determining there is no reasonable alternative to\ncustody. This isn't, however, always the case. If Parliament wanted to require\nthe imposition of a jail sentence, it would have done so.It has not created\nsuch a regime for this offence.[36]In similar cases, courts have, on occasion,\ntaken a different view.Most aren’t binding, they are merely instructive, but\ndo represent a counter position to other instances where there is an enhanced\nreliance on denunciation and deterrence as a basis for the position that no\noption but custody exists.[37]In\nR. v. Oliveira, an unreported decision of Ontario’s Superior Court, the\noffender received a three month jail sentence (to be served on weekends), after\n3 months credit for some of the time he spent on bail.Mr. Oliveira operated a\nvehicle, striking the victim, who was riding a bicycle.The victim succumbed\nto his injuries, and lost his life.Mr. Oliveira did not stop, and did not\nturn himself in until two days later.The sentence included a two year driving\nprohibition, and a probation order with 240 hours of community service.[38]In\nR. v. Smith [2015] O.J. No. 134, Justice DeFillipis suspended the passing of\nsentence placing the offender on probation for two years.In arriving at that\ndecision, he wrote this:Although denunciation and general deterrence\npoint to incarceration as the appropriate response, considering the defendant\ninjured his passenger and could have injured others, his youth, guilty plea,\nand lack of criminal record were important mitigating factors.The right\nbalance was achieved by suspending sentence and placing the defendant on\nprobation.[39]This\nwas a concurrent sentence for three offences: impaired driving causing bodily\nharm, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle and failing to remain at the scene\nof an accident.[40]Also\ninstructive, if not entirely on par, is the court’s decision in R. v. Rayner\n[2014] O.J. No. 2444, where Justice Harris saw fit to impose a 60 day\nintermittent sentence for the offence of dangerous driving causing bodily\nharm.Jail was imposed, but far less than would ordinarily be the case.The\nobvious distinguishing feature here is Rayner deals only with the substantive\noffence of bad driving, there being no charge that the offender failed to stop\nand assist.There is a debate to be had here, that focusses on whether one is\nmore morally culpable by committing a bad act which directly leads to harm, or\none who, while not causing the harm through a criminal act, fails to fulfill\ntheir moral and societal obligation to assist.Reasonable people can disagree on\nthis, and I suppose it could be they are equivalents, but to compare and\ncontrast various approaches to similar cases highlights the difficulty in\nplacing conduct on the spectrum of seriousness, which is a prerequisite to\ndetermining a fit sentence.[41]The\npoint in referencing Rayner is to simply illustrate an approach and sentence\nthat is outside the range suggested by the Crown in Ms. Smith’s case, for\nsomeone who is, arguably, as morally culpable.[42]There\nis no question that Ms. Smith would not fit well within the milieu of a jail.She committed a crime, no doubt, but she has no criminal antecedents.I would\ngo so far as to say she has specifically been deterred, and that it would be\nnaïve to think housing her in a jail cell and exposing her, for the first time,\nto the criminal element, will enhance that effect. I am confident she won’t\never do this again, and that we won’t see her stand as a defendant in a\ncriminal prosecution after today.[43]This\nis not to suggest first time offenders, who live predominantly pro social\nlives, should never go to jail, nor does it mean being a parent of young\nchildren is a get out of jail free card.But both considerations are a part of\nthe overall picture.These realities should, and in this case will, impact the\nnature of the sentence, and quantum.[44]As\nI have already stressed, victim impact is a factor to consider.The statements\nprepared by Ms. Chmara and her mother were powerful, and gave me insight into\nthe consequences of Ms. Smith’s behavior.[45]Beyond\nthe statutory right for a victim to provide their very important input, it is\nalways helpful to remind ourselves of the purpose of victim impact statements.The intention is not for the statement to direct, at least not to any\nsignificant degree, the severity of the penalty ultimately imposed.In fact,\nCanadian courts have been careful to avoid any appearance that it impacts, for\nexample, quantum.It is a factor, among other factors. It provides victims a\nvoice, where they didn’t before have one, and this does represent an important\nstep in the evolution of Canadian criminal law.[46]We\nmust, however, recognize that a crime is more than the occasion of harm upon an\nindividual.It is that, but it’s more than that.It is a wrong against the\ncommunity as a whole.Which is to say this - the equation should never be to\nconflate the measure of one’s life with the amount of time one spends in a jail\ncell.Ms. Chmara has value beyond that, and I won’t trivialize her real trauma\nand extensive injuries by artificially attempting to place that kind of price\non it.[47]By\nthe same token, and this is to state the obvious, the more serious the harm,\nthe, practically speaking, higher likelihood a penal consequence will be\nimposed.But the question remains, is there an alternative to custody that is\nreasonable in the circumstances.Because, despite the proliferation of\nmandatory minimum jail sentences; despite the limiting of conditional sentences\n(which by the way would have been a very constructive and legitimate option in\nthis case); and notwithstanding the seeming increased prominence of general\ndeterrence, and reliance on incarceration as a sentencing tool, there are other\nways to hold people accountable, and to engage in appropriate messaging with\nthe broader public.[48]In\nthis case, jail, while available, and while the typical punishment, is not the\nonly viable sentencing option.[49]I\nam going to impose a $1000 fine.Ms. Smith will have a year to pay that fine\nand the 30% victim fine surcharge.In addition, I make a probation order. It\nwill be in effect for two years, during which time she’ll be bound by these\nterms:-keep\nthe peace and be of good behavior and abide by all statutory terms;-report\nto probation today and thereafter as required;-not\noperate or be in the care and control of a motor vehicle;-complete\n200 hours of community service, completing them at a rate and in a manner\napproved of by probation.She will have to complete them before the order\nexpires, but I will note that once the hours are complete, the reporting\nobligation will end.[50]Finally,\nI prohibit Ms. Smith from operating a motor vehicle on any street, road,\nhighway, or other public place.This order will remain in effect for two\nyears, starting today.[51]DNA\nis declined.January\n29, 2016“Justice\nJ.

We are all of the opinion there is no tenable basis to\ninterfere with the decision of the trial judge declining to expunge the guilty\npleas entered by the accused.[2]Following upon a serious automobile\naccident, the accused pled guilty to impaired driving, uttering a threat of\ndeath, and breach of probation. His sentencing hearing then proceeded on the\nbasis of a joint submission as to sentence. The hearing concluded but was\nadjourned for a period to allow him to put his affairs into order in\nanticipation of being sentenced to a term of imprisonment. On the resumption of\nthe sentencing hearing he applied to have the guilty pleas expunged.[3]It was incumbent upon him in applying\nto have the pleas expunged to satisfy the trial judge that they had not been\nentered voluntarily, or were equivocal, or were uninformed: R. v. T.(R.)\n(1992), 1992 CanLII 2834 (ON CA), 17 C.R. (4th) 247 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Leonard, 2007 SKCA. The accused did not testify in support\nof his application, leaving the matter to be determined on the basis of the\nrecord. On that basis, the judge declined to expunge the pleas.[4]In our judgment, there is ample\nsupport in the record to demonstrate that in entering the pleas the accused was\nfully aware of the nature of the allegations against him, the effect of his\npleas, and their consequences. And the pleas cannot be said to have been\nanything but unequivocal. Indeed, the accused had entered into a plea bargain\nwith the Crown (under which some of the charges against him were stayed and\nanother was reduced), and had agreed to a joint submission as to sentence. Only\nlater, after the joint submission was made, did he seek to have the pleas\nexpunged.[5]It follows that the only conceivable\nbasis upon which he might have succeeded in having his pleas expunged was to\nhave convinced the trial judge that he had not acted voluntarily in entering\nthem. However, there is little if anything in the record to suggest his\ndecision to plead guilty to the charges was not made voluntarily. Indeed, the\nrecord suggests otherwise. During the early stages of the sentencing hearing,\nfor example, he candidly acknowledged that he needed help to overcome a\nlong-standing drinking problem and asked, in consequence, to be placed in a\ntreatment centre as part of his sentence. This suggests that he had come to\nunderstand the root of his problems, that he had resolved to face up to what he\nhad done and why, and that he had decided to make a concerted effort to turn\nhis life around. In other words, the record does not so much suggest he did not\nact voluntarily in entering the guilty pleas as it suggests otherwise.[6]On the whole, then, we are of the\nopinion there is no tenable basis upon which we could interfere with the trial\njudge’s decision declining to expunge the guilty pleas. Accordingly, we have\ndecided to dismiss the appeal."}

BrownHeard on March\n26, 2014Reasons for\nSentence released on May 27, 2014Mary Ward................................................................................................................for\nthe CrownBruce Daley.................................................................................for\nthe accused David DrozdowskiBrown, J.:1:INTRODUCTION[1]David Drozdowski pleaded guilty before me to\nthree counts of impaired driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 255(2) of\nthe Criminal Code.[2]The Crown proceeded by way of indictment.A\npreliminary hearing was conducted and during the course of the preliminary\nhearing the accused agreed to a committal to the Superior Court of Justice.At\na later date he then re-elected trial before me and pleaded guilty to these\ncharges.2:CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCE[3]The offence date is September 13, 2011.On\nthat date at 9:59 p.m. several cars were stopped or slowing to stop at the\nstoplight on the 9th line and Dundas Street in the Town of Oakville.\nThe weather was clear and the roads were dry.[4]Patricia Gonzalez, who testified before me\nat the preliminary hearing, was driving the first vehicle in the line of cars.As\nthe light changed to green she was about to proceed when she was rear ended by\nthe vehicle behind her.Behind her it appeared that there were approximately\nfour vehicles that had been involved in the collision.The offender’s vehicle\nhad failed to stop or slow down significantly and ran into the back of another\nvehicle carrying Asma Riaz and Mahum Sheikh causing this chain reaction.Ms.\nGonzalez suffered soft tissue injuries that persisted up until the time she\ntestified at the preliminary hearing on December 10, 2012, and Justin\nKuscanian, who also testified at the preliminary hearing, stated that he\nsuffered neck pain that resolved in a couple of weeks.[5]Mr. Drozdowski was subsequently arrested at\nthe scene and later provided breath samples into an approved instrument.The\nblood alcohol readings in this matter were 188 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres\nof blood and the second was 182 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of\nblood and, as such, are deemed to be an aggravating factor on sentencing\npursuant to s. 255.1 of the Criminal Code.[6]The most seriously injured people were the\nindividuals named in the indictment that the accused pleaded guilty to.They\nwere Asma Riaz, Sharda Aleem, and Mahum Sheikh.[7]Although I did not get a victim impact\nstatement from Sharda Aleem, she testified before me at the preliminary hearing\nand described her injuries.She described her neck, back and arm as being\nblack and blue and she was required to be off work for about two months and\nthen gradually returned over the next two months.She could not go to the\nhospital because she was breastfeeding, but subsequently saw her family doctor\nwho prescribed her physiotherapy and Naproxen.It was unclear to me whether\nher injuries eventually resolved or whether she has lingering effects from the\ncollision.Since the Crown has not provided this information to me, I will\nproceed with the sentencing assuming that the injuries have completely healed\nand there are no permanent effects from the collision regarding this victim.[8]I have reviewed Mahum Sheik’s victim impact\nstatement filed as an exhibit in this proceeding.In that statement dated\nFebruary 28, 2014 she says that she suffers from extreme anxiety when she is\ndriving and has panic attacks during certain driving situations.She says that\nher body is constantly in pain, including her neck and shoulders, lower back, gluteus\nmaximus, arms, hands and feet.She describes disturbed sleep\npatterns and nightmares about dying in a car accident.She also describes\nbecoming less social and staying in her room often rather than socializing, and\nalso a shortened attention span.She states that she was unable to resume work\nfor one and one half months. She was prescribed Oxycontin, Naproxen, Celexa and\nother medications, and has had to engage in massage therapy, physiotherapy and\npurchase orthopaedic shoes.She describes this collision as the most\ntraumatizing experience of her life.[9]Asma Riaz was in the same vehicle as Ms.\nSheik and suffered similar injuries.She broke her nose and had to have\nsurgery for that and had a piece of glass that went into her eye and split her\neyelid.She spent overnight in the hospital.She still says that her nose and\njaw are somewhat crooked and she avoids smiling as it makes her self-conscious.She suffers from back, hip, neck, wrist, foot and jaw pain, and suffers from\nPTSD.She has been told that the eye injury puts her at greater risk of\nglaucoma and that it prevents her from wearing contact lenses.She states that\nshe is more withdrawn than before and is constantly in pain, which puts her in\na bad mood.She has lost most of the strength in her left wrist and hand and\nshe relies on medication to get her through the day at work and to sleep at\nnight.She was still taking physiotherapy as of the date of the statement,\nwhich was February 28, 2014.3:CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER[10]Mr. Daley filed a helpful sentencing brief\non behalf of Mr. Drozdowski that is Exhibit 3 in these proceedings.[11]I have also had the benefit of reading the\npresentence report filed as Exhibit 2.[12]The offender is presently 26 years of age\nand would have been 23 years old at the time of the offences.He has no\ncriminal record.[13]He is the younger of two sons born to his\nparents.His mother is currently employed as a supply teacher.His mother\nworked as a full-time teacher until her children were born and then stayed at\nhome to raise them before returning to work when they were both in school.[14]His father owns an electrical contracting\ncompany where the offender is employed as a fifth-year apprentice electrician.By\nall accounts, he is a well liked, reliable and hardworking young man who is\nclose to finishing his apprenticeship.It is expected that he and his brother\nwill one day take over his father’s business.[15]The offender comes from a supportive and\nclose family and is well liked and respected by his fellow employees and others\nin the community.The sentencing brief contains eleven letters of reference\nspeaking to his good character in the community and his acceptance of\nresponsibility for the harm that these offences have caused the victims and his\nfamily.[16]At the age of 13 he was diagnosed with\njuvenile diabetes and ultimately had to be put on an insulin pump and has a\ncatheter in his leg that the pump dispenses insulin to.This changed his life\nfor some time as he was adjusting to this diagnosis and prevented him from\nengaging in sports that he enjoyed until his diabetes was well managed.He is\nvery responsible with his diabetes management and follows a strict dietary\nregimen.[17]His family has had several health concerns\nover the years.In 2008 his father was diagnosed with prostate cancer and in\n2011 the cancer returned and he underwent radiation treatments.His paternal\ngrandfather passed away in 2011 and his aunt was diagnosed with terminal cancer\nand passed away a few weeks before the offence.His mother was diagnosed with\nbreast cancer last year and has undergone treatment.The offender and his\nbrother have been very supportive and helpful to their parents during these\nordeals.[18]The offender progressed normally through\nhigh school and then took a two-year Business Administration course through\nSheridan College.He is one credit short of having his diploma from this\ncourse.He has never presented as a disciplinary problem in school or\notherwise and is a respectful and well liked young man by all who know him.[19]He has no previous problems with drugs or\nalcohol, having never used drugs, and describes himself as a social drinker.He\ndid see a psychologist, Dr. James Long, for an assessment after the offence and\nhis report dated February 23, 2014 has been reviewed for this sentencing.Dr.\nLong suggests that he may be vulnerable to developing difficulties with the use\nof alcohol.He recognizes that the offender is concerned about his use of\nalcohol and the effect that it has on his diabetes and that this points to his\nmotivation to be vigilant about the use of alcohol.He states that he is\ncurrently not addicted to alcohol and that he restricts himself to the\nconsumption of beer in small quantities.However, alcohol use had been an important\npart of his social activities as it was with a fairly large group of college\nstudents of his age.Dr. Long suggests that further counselling may be helpful\nto Mr. Drozdowski to help him avoid any further problems.[20]Dr. Long does comment on the genuine degree\nof remorse that the offender has expressed during their discussions, and this\ngenuine remorse is mirrored in other character references and in his oral\nstatement before me at the end of the sentencing hearing.It is also to be\nnoted that the offender has made a voluntary donation of $200.00 to MADD Canada\nin February of this year and has done some volunteer work at a long-term care\nand seniors supportive housing complex operated by the Salvation Army and at a\nfood bank in Fort Myers, Florida when on holiday with his parents.[21]His grandfather suffered from dementia\nbefore his death and the offender regularly visited him and took him on\noutings.He does the same with his grandmother, who also suffers from the same\ndisease.4:POSITION OF THE PARTIES[22]The Crown seeks a sentence of incarceration\nin the range of three to six months, a driving prohibition of 2 to 3 years and\na period of probation with terms as suggested in the presentence report.Ms.\nWard has not sought a DNA order in this case.[23]Mr. Daley, on behalf of the offender,\nsuggests that the appropriate principles of sentencing can be addressed by way\nof a high fine, an extended period of driving prohibition and a lengthy period\nof probation that would include a significant amount of community service and a\nperiod of house arrest conditions for the first several months of the probation\norder.5:ANALYSIS[24]The principles regarding this sentencing\nthat I have taken into account are set out in section 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal\nCode and read as follows:718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing\nis to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the\nlaw and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just\nsanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful\nconduct;(b) to deter the offender and\nother persons from committing offences;(c) to separate offenders from\nsociety, where necessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating\noffenders;(e) to provide\nreparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f) to promote a\nsense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to\nvictims and to the community.[25]Section 718.1 sets out the proportionality\nconcept as follows:718.1. A sentence must be proportionate to\nthe gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.[26]Also section 718.2 sets out the relevant\nmitigating and aggravating factors that come into play:718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall\nalso take into consideration the following principles:(a) a sentence\nshould be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or\nmitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender and…(b) a sentence\nshould be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar\noffences committed in similar circumstances;…(d) an offender\nshould not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be\nappropriate in the circumstances; and(e) all available\nsanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances\nshould be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the\ncircumstances of aboriginal offenders.[27]Finally section 255.1 states:255.1 Without limiting the generality of\nsection 718.2, where a court imposes a sentence for an offence committed under\nthis Act by means of a motor vehicle, vessel or aircraft or of railway\nequipment, evidence that the concentration of alcohol in the blood of the\noffender at the time when the offence was committed exceeded one hundred and\nsixty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood shall be deemed\nto be aggravating circumstances relating to the offence that the court shall\nconsider under paragraph 718.2(a).[28]The Crown relies on the case decided by my\ncolleague Justice Zisman in R. v. Verbitski, [2012] O.J. No 5422 (OCJ).In\nthat case the offender was 24 years of age and had driven through a stop sign\nand collided with another motor vehicle containing the victim and his two\ndaughters ages 13 and 15.The victim in that case suffered a loss of\nconsciousness, a broken left arm, bruising to his left thigh and a lasting\ncontusion.His daughters suffered no injuries. The offender in that case\nprovided breath samples yielding results of 140 and 130 milligrams of alcohol\nin 100 millilitres of blood.[29]The victim in that case had his arm in a\ncast for a month and had to use two weeks of his vacation to recover.He had\nto attend physiotherapy for a month and still felt anxious every time he drove.[30]His daughters suffered emotional injuries in\nthat they thought their father had been killed in the collision and now are\nvery anxious themselves about being in a car.[31]The defendant had an unrelated criminal\nrecord.In 2006 he was convicted of robbery as a youth and was placed on\nprobation for 34 months, and in 2008 he was convicted of theft under and placed\non probation for 12 months.[32]That offender pleaded guilty, albeit on the\nday of trial, and had expressed his remorse, which Justice Zisman had no reason\nto doubt.He had apologized to the victim and his family.He completed 30 to\n40 hours of community service prior to his plea.[33]That offender had a supportive family, but\nhis father deflected the blame for the drinking on his son’s employer.There\nwas a possibility that the offender would lose his employment if he were\nsentenced to a period of custody that exceeded the intermittent range.[34]In the end, Justice Zisman sentenced Mr.\nVerbitski to a sentence of 5 months imprisonment and placed him on probation\nfor 12 months and there was an 18-month driving prohibition ordered.[35]Mr. Daley asks me to distinguish this case\nand takes exception to the comment made by Justice Zisman at paragraph 49 where\nshe states that:49It\nappears that although drinking and driving offences continue to occur there has\nbeen an increase in public awareness of the dangers and that harsh penalties\nwill be imposed for those that are caught. It is clear that in these types of\noffences the general public can be deterred by the prospect of a substantial\nsentence for drinking and driving offences.[36]Mr. Daley argues that there was no evidence\nbefore the Court to warrant this observation.He also states that in that case\nthe offender had a prior record where he had been placed on two terms of\nprobation for a total of almost four years yet still committed the offence,\nunlike the case at bar where Mr. Drozdowski has no criminal record and has\ncomplied with all terms of his release without incident.[37]He suggests that harsh conditions of\nprobation, combined with a high fine and an extended driving prohibition, can\nserve to address the punitive requirements for a sentence to address the issues\nof general deterrence and denunciation, that a well-informed member of the\npublic apprised of all the material that is before me on this sentencing would\nconsider the sentence that he is proposing to be a punitive one and thus\nadequately addresses the issues of general deterrence.[38]Colvin, J. was faced with a similar\nchallenge in the case of R. v. Stefinashen, [2010] O.J.\nNo. 6293 (OCJ).Commencing at paragraph 19 of that decision, my colleague\nreflects on the requirements for the paramountcy of general deterrence and\ndenunciation in sentencing in these types of cases.He states:19Sentences\nfor impaired driving causing bodily harm rise to a maximum of ten years imprisonment.\nThe sentences vary enormously. Some have been as low as 90 days as in, for\nexample, the Biernat decision mentioned earlier. Some have been as high\nas three years. R. v. Van Puyenbroek, 2007 ONCA 824 (CanLII), 2007 ONCA 824 (Ont. C.A.), is an example.20Until\nParliament amended our Criminal Code in 2008, one of the options available in\nsentencing was the conditional sentence or house arrest. This, Parliament has\ntaken away as a tool of sentence. Parliament has said that Mr. Stefinashen must\ngo to jail and the question simply is for how long. Parliament has determined\nthat general deterrence is now the paramount consideration in dealing with a\n\"serious personal injury offence\". This is the combined result of s.\n742.1 and s. 752 of the Criminal Code.21The\nfact that this sentencing was argued, and I had to reserve to come to a\ndecision, review the materials and that there is such a range of sentence being\nproposed, underscores the fact that imprisonment, as general deterrence, is a\nmost questionable concept.22In R.\nv. W. (J.)(1997), 1997 CanLII 3294 (ON CA), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 18 (Ont. C.A.), Justice Rosenberg of\nthe Ontario Court of Appeal in writing of conditional sentences said:In my view the enactment of the\nconditional sentence regime, represents a concession to the view that the\ngeneral deterrent effect of incarceration has been and continues to be somewhat\nspeculative and that there are other ways to give effect to the objective of\ngeneral deterrence.23In\nthe W. (J.) decision Justice Rosenberg reviewed the reports of the Canadian\nsentencing commissions of 1987, the 1969 Ouimet Committee, the report of the\nCanadian Committee on corrections, the Ledain Commission, the final report of\nthe commission of inquiry into the non-medical use of drugs 1973, and the 1977\nSolicitor General of Canada summary and analysis of major inquires on corrections.\nThe long and the short of the conclusion he arrives at does not favour prison\nas a tool of rehabilitative or indeed, as a method of general deterrence. This\nview was also expressed by Justice Shalhaney (sic) in a 1995 decision R. v.\nFlynn, [1995] O.J. No. 1216 (Ont. Gen. Div.). In that case Justice\nSalhaney wrote:We have to start with the basic\nrecognition that it is not the function of the courts to prevent crime -- that\nis the duty and the responsibility of the police. The function of the courts is\nto punish offenders who have been proven to have committed crimes.\nUnfortunately, there is a misguided and simplistic belief by some members of\nthe public that the imposition of heavy sentences will automatically deter\ncrime. We know from history and experience that this is simply not true. Such a\nbelief places an unfair burden on the courts and instills an unrealistic expectation\nin the minds of the public.24Our\nParliament brought in a major change in sentencing in 2008. Parliament, in\neffect, ruled that there must be a sentence of imprisonment for people such as\nMr. Stefinashen, in offences such as this, regardless of the negative effects\nthat might have on them, and the lack of any positive effect on their victims.\nThe cost of incarcerating Mr. Stefinashen will be somewhere between $73,000.00\nand $90,000.00 a year. The fact that government resources will go to incarcerating\nMr. Stefinashen rather than assisting Ashley Hyatt and Megan Hyatt to recover\nfrom the injuries they have suffered is irrelevant.25As a\njudge, I must give effect to what Parliament has laid down. I must therefore\nconsider how long a period of incarceration Mr. Stefinashen should face. In\ndoing so, I must bear in mind the comments of Justice Cory in R. v. Bernshaw (1994),\n1995 CanLII 150 (SCC), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.). In that decision the Supreme Court of Canada\nin 1995, Justice Cory reviewed the serious costs, monetary and physical, that\nflow from drinking and driving.26While\nthe Biernat decision raised by Mr. Evans is attractive, the nature of\nthe injuries in that case compared to the injuries in this case require that\nthe outcome be different. The Biernat case involved driving in a parking\nlot at low speed knocking the victim to the ground with resulting relatively\nminor injuries. It is vastly different from this case.27I\nmust balance the prospects for Mr. Stefinashen's future with the serious nature\nof the offence. It is appropriate, in my view, that he should be sentenced to a\nperiod of six months imprisonment.[39]In that case, the facts were far more\nserious that the case at bar, resulting in one victim having a closed head injury,\nwhich altered her personality and will be something she would live with for the\nremainder of her life. The other victim had a broken bone that required surgery\nto repair.As well, the accused in that case suffered serious and debilitating\ninjuries, including an eye injury that required surgery and depression over the\ninjuries that he had caused to the victims.Notwithstanding the accused’s\nyoung age and lack of a criminal record, the profound remorse that he felt, the\npositive presentence report that he received, and his family and community\nsupport, he was sentenced to a period of six months in custody rather than the\nperiod of 12 to 18 months sought by the Crown.I suspect that absent the\nsignificant injuries suffered by the accused himself in that case that he may have\neven received a sentence more closely approaching that requested by the Crown.[40]Justice Zisman correctly states the\nprinciples to be addressed in sentencing on impaired causing bodily harm cases\nas follows commencing at paragraph 12 of Verbitski, supra, and I adopt\nher reasoning wherein she states:12The\noverriding principle of sentencing in cases such as this is general deterrence.\nThis was the conclusion of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. McVeigh\n(1985), 1985 CanLII 115 (ON CA), 22 C.C.C. (3d) 145, where the court clearly stated its policy approach\nand underlying rationale. In my view, the passage from this decision that I\nintend to quote is as true today as it was then, and would also currently find\noverwhelming public support:In my view, the sentences for the so-called\nlesser offences in this field should be increased. The variations in the\npenalties imposed for drinking and driving are great and increasing sentences\nfor offences at the \"lower end\" would emphasize that it is the\nconduct of the accused, not just the consequences, that is the criminality\npunished. If such an approach acts as a general deterrent then the\npossibilities of serious and tragic results from such driving are reduced. No\none takes to the road after drinking with the thought that someone may be\nkilled as a result of his drinking. The sentences should be such as to make it\nvery much less attractive for the drinker to get behind the wheel of a car\nafter drinking. The public should not have to wait until members of the public\nare killed before the courts' repudiation of the conduct that led to the\nkilling is made clear. It is trite to say that every drinking driver is a\npotential killer.Members of the public when they\nexercise their lawful right to use the highways of this province should not live\nin the fear that they may meet with a driver whose faculties are impaired by\nalcohol. It is true that many of those convicted of these crimes have never\nbeen convicted of other crimes and have good work and family records. It can be\nsaid on behalf of all such people that a light sentence would be in their best\ninterests and be the most effective form of rehabilitation. However, it is\nobvious that such an approach has not gone any length towards solving the\nproblem. In my opinion, these are the very ones who could be deterred by the\nprospect of a substantial sentence for drinking and driving if caught. General\ndeterrence in these cases should be the predominant concern, and such deterrence\nis not realized by overemphasizing that individual deterrence is seldom needed\nonce tragedy has resulted from the driving.13Ten\nyears later Justice Cory spoke of the gravity of drinking and driving offences\nin an often quoted passage from his decision in R. v. Bernshaw 1995 CanLII 150 (SCC), [1995] 1\nS.C.R. 254 at paragraph 16:Every year, drunk driving leaves a\nterrible trail of death, injury, heartbreak and destruction. From the point of\nview of numbers alone, it has a far greater impact on Canadian society than any\nother crime. In terms of the deaths and serious injuries resulting in hospitalization,\ndrunk driving is clearly the crime which causes the most significant social\nloss to the country.14It is\nalso clear from these decisions that denunciation is also an important\nobjective of sentencing where personal injury or death is involved. It is\nthrough denunciation that general deterrence is reinforced, shared community\nvalues are communicated and the public is assured that the offender has been\nheld to account for his or her particular conduct. Depending on the offender's\npersonal circumstances and circumstances surrounding the offence under\nconsideration, personal deterrence may also come into play.15In R.\nv. Biancofiore (1997) 1997 CanLII 3420 (ON CA), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 344 (Ont. C.A.), Justice Rosenberg\nfurther concluded that courts must take care not to de-stigmatize drinking and\ndriving offences. Denunciation through incarceration would generally have this\neffect and would guard against law-abiding people regarding such behaviour as a\nmere \"accident\" or \"error in judgment\", rather than the\ncriminal act is was (supra, at paragraphs 25 to 29).16In R.\nv. Biancofiore, supra, the Court of Appeal concluded that under the\nsentencing regime introduced by Sections 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal\nCode, incarceration was proportionate to the gravity of the offence and\ndegree of responsibility of the offender in serious drinking and driving cases.\nThere is a high degree of moral culpability when an offender intentionally\ntakes a risk that manifests itself in an unsafe manner of driving resulting in\nharm to someone else. Justice Rosenberg reconfirmed the gravity of drinking and\ndriving offences, quoting the passage written by Lamer J. in R. v. Bernshaw,\nibid.17As\nresult of Biancofiore and subsequent decisions of the Ontario Court of\nAppeal and this court, it is clear that denunciation and deterrence are still\nthe governing sentencing principles in these cases, and for all the same\nreasons.18Counsel\nfor both the Crown and defendant provided the court with several cases to\nsupport their respective positions.1 It is clear from these\ncases and the principles I have cited above that the courts emphasize that any\nsentence imposed must address the principles of deterrence and denunciation and\nprotection of society. In most of the cases, a term of incarceration is imposed\nto emphasize the serious nature of this crime. However, the sentences in these\ncases vary from short intermittent sentences as requested by the defendant to\nterms of penitentiary. Although an examination of similar cases is helpful, few\ncases are identical on their facts.[41]The facts in Verbitski, supra, are in\nsome ways less aggravating than in this case.[42]In that case, the victim attended\nphysiotherapy for approximately one month where in the case at bar, two of the\nvictims continue to attend physiotherapy and engage in chemical pain relief\nsome two years and five months after the collision.As in Verbitski, at\nleast three individuals suffer anxiety from being in a car.In Verbitski,\nthe offender pleaded guilty on the day of trial and avoided the trauma of\nhaving the victims testify.In the case at bar, the victims did testify at the\npreliminary hearing and did not avoid the trauma of having to relive the\ncircumstances of that evening.Certainly some mitigation is to be given this\noffender for his plea of guilt and acceptance of responsibility, but on a\nlesser basis than if he had accepted responsibility without the necessity of\nhaving witnesses called at the preliminary hearing.[43]As well, in the case at bar, the blood\nalcohol readings are in the statutorily aggravating range identified in s.\n255.1 of the Criminal Code.[44]It is true that the defendant in this case\ncomes before the Court with absolutely no criminal record, that he is a young\nman of good character and that he is kind and compassionate, and a young man\nwho, as Mr. Daley submits, anyone would like to have as a son or a friend.However,\noffenders charged with this type of offence all too often share these same\ncharacteristics.In my view, what is critical to the analysis are the injuries\nthat the victims of these offences suffer.[45]In the case at bar, the injuries have\nprofoundly affected the victim’s enjoyment of life.The injuries have\npersisted long after the offence and continue to impact at least two of the\nvictims up to February 2014 and probably still to this day.They may continue\nindefinitely, and one victim is at serious risk of having glaucoma that could\nresult in blindness in her eye.[46]As observed by Vaillancourt J. in R. v.\nRooplal, [2009] O.J. No. 5493 (OCJ), some cases of impaired driving causing\nbodily harm can result in the imposition of a non-custodial sentence.As he\nstated at paragraph 30:30I am\naware that incarceration is not the only sentencing option when dealing with\nthe offence of impaired driving causing bodily harm. The Criminal Code\nprovides for a minimum monetary penalty. The trial judge in R. v. Rowan,\n[2004] O.J. No. 3719, (C.A.), adopted a joint submission for a fine, probation\nand a three-year driving suspension. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal\nregarding the length of the driving suspension noting in paragraph three that,\n\"The trial judge, [2003] O.J. No. 5922, accepted a joint submission that a\nfine and period of probation, as opposed to a jail sentence, were sufficient to\nreflect the principles of general and specific deterrence but only with a\ndriving prohibition of three years.\" In Rowan the injuries were\n\"not as serious as in some cases.\" One victim received a hairline\nfracture of her right wrist and some back pain. Another victim experienced some\nback pain. Mr. Rowan had a breath reading of 220 and 210.[47]In R. v. Sinnarasa, [2005] O.J. No.\n4039 (Ont. Sup. Ct.) Justice Durno was asked to sentence a youthful first\noffender to a conditional sentence (now unavailable for this offence) wherein\nthe victim, who was a passenger, suffered a broken vertebra.The victim made a\nfull recovery from his injuries and did not hold any feelings of ill will\nagainst the offender and did not want the offender punished too harshly.In\nthat case, Durno, J. felt that the imposition of a conditional sentence would\nnot be consistent with the purposes and principles of sentencing;in\nparticular, general deterrence and denunciation.That offender was sentenced\nto a period of 60 days in custody.[48]In my view, it will be rare for an offender,\neven a remorseful one with no prior record, to be sentenced to a non-custodial\nterm in a case such as this when the injuries are more than just above the\nlevel of proving bodily harm absent clear direction from an appellate court to\nthe contrary.People who chose to get behind the wheel of a car and risk permanently\naltering or taking away the lives of members of the public, having them remain\nin pain on a daily basis for an extended period of time, must know that their\nsentence will be determined by placing great weight on painful life-altering\ninjuries that persist long after the criminal act and indeed long after the\nsentencing.To be grossly impaired and to operate a motor vehicle which\nresults in serious injury to a member of the public will result in, in all but\nthe most exceptional of cases, a custodial sentence of ever increasing length\nin great part depending on the nature and seriousness and length of the\ninjuries.That is the game of chance that all impaired drivers face.[49]If the injuries are of a relatively minor\nnature, yet enough to meet the threshold of the definition of “bodily harm” in\nthe Criminal Code, and if the offender’s background and community\nsupports are good and they are remorseful and accept responsibility for their\nacts and are not a danger to the public, then a non-custodial sentence is\npossible and should be considered.As the severity of the injury to the victim\nincreases, the impact on their life becomes more pronounced, and the length of\ntime that the injury and its consequences is expected to last, then the\npossibility of a non-custodial sentence diminishes in direct proportion to\nthese factors even with the exceptional background that is possessed by this\noffender and many other similar offenders sentenced in these types of cases.[50]Absent a clear signal from an appellate\ncourt that there should be a downward departure from these principles, they are\nthe ones that I am bound to adhere to.Yet, it always hurts me to “sacrifice a\nperson on the altar of general deterrence” in a case such as this.[51]Perhaps this type of case suggests a need\nfor a more focused restorative justice court, which more actively involves the\nvictims in the entire sentencing process.In my view, a victim impact\nstatement completed in February of this year for a sentencing in May, without\nany real knowledge of the person that put them in their pain, is limiting from\na restorative justice perspective.[52]I would have preferred the victims in this\ncase to have all of the information that is before me now that they have not\nbeen privy to, but, most importantly, the real and visceral remorse that this\naccused feels and has felt since the outset for causing their pain and to have\nhim apologize to them face to face, and perhaps for them to forgive him.That\nwould be true restorative justice and would be healing for both the victims for\nthe accused and would enable me to formulate a sentence that may have been more\nappropriate for this young man and more understandable to all involved.[53]The following are the mitigating factors\nthat I have found:1.The offender has no previous criminal record.2.He has plead guilty and accepted responsibility\nfor his conduct.Although the victims were not spared the trauma of testifying\nat the preliminary hearing, the plea does save court time and expense that\nwould be associated with a trial.3.He comes from a close-knit, pro-social and\nsupportive family and enjoys their love and support.4.He is employed and well regarded by his employer\nand his coworkers and supervisors.5.He has a positive presentence report as well as\nsupporting letters.6.He has made a voluntary charitable donation to\nMADD and has completed some community service hours, although the amount is not\nspecifically quantified.7.There is no evidence that he has a substance\nabuse problem.8.I accept that he is remorseful and has empathy\nwith the suffering of victims.9.He does suffer from Type 1 Diabetes and requires\nan insulin pump.There is, however, no evidence before me that the Correctional\nauthorities could not accommodate his medical needs while in custody.10.\nI think that there is little need to address the\nissue of specific deterrence as the offender’s remorse, the consulting of\nprofessional help, comments in the supporting letters that he always arranges\nfor designated drivers and warns his friends about the dangers of drinking and\ndriving make it unlikely, in my view, that he would repeat this type of\nconduct.[54]The aggravating factors that I have taken\ninto account are the following:1.The nature of the accident involves a reasonable\ninference that he was travelling at a high rate of speed in good driving\nconditions and clear visibility and did not notice three or four vehicles that\nwere stopped or stopping at a plainly marked stop light when he ran into the\nlast vehicle starting a chain reaction that caused serious property damage and\npersonal injury.2.His blood alcohol was 180 milligrams of alcohol\nin 100 millilitres of blood, thus a statutorily deemed aggravating factor. See\ns. 255.1 of the Criminal Code.3.The injuries suffered by the victims were not\njust above the threshold for bodily harm, but caused serious interference with\nthe lives of the victims and persisted for over 2 years after the collision.[55]Having regard to all the factors in this\ncase, I have come to the reluctant conclusion that the principles of general\ndeterrence and denunciation cannot be adequately addressed by a non-custodial\nterm, a fine, significant community service hours and an extended driving\nprohibition.[56]In all the circumstances of this case, I\nbelieve that the appropriate sentence is one of 90 days in custody.[57]I will, as well, prohibit the offender from\noperating a motor vehicle on any road, highway or other public place in Canada\nfor a period of 18 months.[58]He will be placed on probation that will be\nfor a period of 12 months.[59]He will be required to report to a probation\nofficer within seven days of his release from custody, to report as directed,\nto keep the peace and be of good behaviour and to attend the Missing You program.[60]He will be required to attend a substance\nabuse relapse prevention program, take any other counselling as directed by his\nprobation officer and to sign all releases to allow his probation officer to\nmonitor his compliance with that program or counselling.[61]He is not to consume or possess alcohol\nduring the period of his probation.[62]Because of the charitable donation that he\nhas made, I will waive the victim surcharge.Released:May 27, 2014Signed: “Justice Stephen D.\nBrown”"}

Humphreyfor theappellant)Respondent))- and -)KennethL. Campbell)for therespondent)BONNIE SUSAN SIMCOE))))Appellant)HEARD:January 11, 2002On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice D. J. Halikowski on February\n27, 2001.FELDMAN J.A.:[1]The appellant pled guilty to manslaughter in the death of her father.\nShe was sentenced to 4 years in prison in addition to 8 months of pretrial\ncustody. The appellant appeals her sentence.[2]For the reasons which follow, I would allow the appeal and reduce the\nsentence.FACTS[3]The plea was accepted based on an agreed statement of facts. On June 26,\n2000, the appellant, who was 41 years old, was visiting her father at his\ntownhouse, together with an old school friend of the family, David Keleman.\nThey were watching T.V. and drinking. Mr. Keleman left to go to his home for an\nantenna. When he returned, he found the appellant’s father naked on top of his\ndaughter. He had her top up and her pants down and he was tying to nuzzle and\npenetrate her. Mr. Keleman became angry, began to yell at Mr. Simcoe, then\nstruck him. The appellant woke up and was yelling and hysterical. Mr. Keleman\ntook the appellant upstairs to calm her down. Mr. Simcoe was shouting\nobscenities and taunting the appellant. She went back downstairs in a rage and\nbegan throwing things around the room. At that point, Mr. Keleman left. After\nthat, the appellant, who was highly intoxicated, used a large kitchen knife to\nstab her father repeatedly on the arms. During this time she called 9-1-1 and\ntold them she was stabbing her father and that if they did not get there\nquickly, he would be dead. When the police arrived, the appellant was screaming\nthat she hoped her father was dead as he was a monster. When she learned later\nthat he was dead, she first said: “Good, he deserved it if he is”, then “Please\ntell me he isn’t”, then “I won’t have to suck his cock anymore or kiss him.”BACKGROUND OF THE APPELLANT AND POSITIONS ON SENTENCE[4]The Crown’s position was that the appropriate sentence\nwas5 to 7 years in prison. The defence asked for a suspended sentence\nwith 3 years’ probation, or in the alternative, a conditional sentence. The\nappellant recognized that she needed treatment for her drug and alcohol abuse\nas well as her depression and low self-esteem. She even asked to go to the\npenitentiary if she had to go to jail because she understood that she would\nreceive better treatment there.[5]On sentence, the trial judge had an extensive pre-sentence report, the viva\nvoce evidence of a psychologist called by the defence, the report of a psychiatrist\nwho examined the appellant on the issue of her fitness to stand trial, and\nvictim impact statements from two of the appellant’s siblings and from a\ngrandchild of her father as well as a letter from the appellant’s maternal\ngrandmother.[6]The appellant had no criminal record. Her life\nexperience was described by the author of the pre-sentence report as “very\ntragic.” She was born out of wedlock at a home for unwed mothers, although her\nparents subsequently marriedand had three more children. Her parents\nmoved many times to accommodate her father’s job. Her father sexually abused\nher and was verbally and emotionally abusive to herself and her mother. She\nleft home at age 14, but returned after her parents separated. Her parents then\nreconciled and separated several times, and the appellant was further abused.\nThe appellant was significantly affected by the death of her boyfriend when she\nwas 18. She then began to abuse drugs and alcohol and was unable to hold a job.\nIn 1995 she returned to Oshawa to look after her mother who was dying.\nThereafter she squandered her inheritance. She began to see her father\nsporadically but he continued to emotionally and verbally abuse her, and also\nattempted to sexually abuse her, resulting on one occasion in him urinating on\nher in rage. At the time of the offence the appellant had a history of\ndepression, including 5 attempts at suicide and was on methadone treatment. She\nhad had many failed relationships and was unable to have children.[7]Dr. Chiarot, a consulting psychologist with the Ministry of Correctional\nServices, interviewed the appellant and testified about the effect of incest\nbased on the sexual abuse the appellant described to him. The sexual abuse\nincluded oral sex, and on the occasions when her father would drink and be\nphysically abusive and give her wet kisses in the day, he would sexually abuse\nher at night. She would wake in the morning to find semen present and to find\nthat her underwear had been removed. The final incident before she left home\ninvolved her father inserting a chicken baster into her, causing injury and\nbleeding. There was no sexual abuse when the appellant was in her twenties and\nthirties, but, as is often the case in incest relationships, the appellant\nstill wanted her father’s love and attention. She spent time with him and even\nallowed him to stay with her on occasion when he had no other place to stay.[8]Dr. Chiarot identified trigger factors that led up to the stabbing\nincluding that this was the first occasion the sexual abuse had been witnessed\nby someone else, and the fact that she had just spent a nice Father’s Day with\nher father one week earlier. The other factors he identified were alcohol and anger.[9]The appellant’s siblings were angry at the appellant for what she did\nand did not believe that she had been sexually abused by their father.DISPOSITION BY THE TRIAL JUDGE[10]The trial judge imposed a sentence of 4 years in penitentiary following\n8 months pretrial custody, which he determined to be a sentence at the low end\nof what he expressed to be the applicable range of 5 to 10 years for a homicide\nof this nature. He discussed the applicability of the range in the following\nway:The crime of homicide always attracts a lengthy penitentiary term, ranging,\nat least in the case law, from between five and ten years imprisonment, subject\nto any extenuating circumstances. Cases falling within this range are\ncharacterized by the accused being impaired by alcohol at the time of the\nincident. Weapons are sometimes sought and used in the crime. The victim is\noften in a defenceless position, either impaired himself or wounded or\nunconscious when the final blow is applied. Even minor provocation by the\nvictim is not enough to reduce this type of sentence. Other factors include the\nlapse of time between a provoking event and the action of the accused.[11]The trial judge discounted the legal effect of provocation on the sentence.\nHe was also influenced by his understanding that a significant amount of time\nhad passed between the sexual assault by the father and his death at the hand\nof his daughter as a result of the interruption and intervention of the friend,\nMr. Keleman.ANALYSIS[12]The appellant’s principal position on this appeal is\nthatthe sentence imposed by the trial judge was manifestly unfit for\nthis appellant in all the circumstances. However, I prefer to approach the case\nby determining whether the trial judge made an error in principle or\nmisapprehended the evidence, leading him to overemphasize a particular factor.[13]In my view, the trial judge erred in principle in three respects: (1) he\nmisapprehended the correct range of sentence available in the circumstances;\n(2) he erred in holding that provocation is not a factor to be taken into\naccount in sentencing for manslaughter; and (3) he misapprehended the evidence\non the issue of the timing of the events, thus overemphasizing the fact that time\nhad passed between the sexual assault and the homicide as an aggravating\nfactor.(1)The Appropriate\nRange of Sentence[14]The trial judge stated that the range of sentence for a homicide is 5 to\n10 years, particularly for cases where the accused is impaired by alcohol at\nthe time, weapons are used, and the victim is defenceless either because of\nimpairment or having already been wounded. This statement of the range is in\nerror. In R. v. Turcotte (2000), 2000 CanLII 14721 (ON CA), 48 O.R. (3d) 97 at 101, 144 C.C.C. (3d)\n139, this court recently made a clear statement about the range of sentence\navailable in a manslaughter case:While many, if not most, sentences for manslaughter are in the penitentiary\nrange, maximum reformatory sentences are not unknown and are clearly within the\nacceptable range: Clewley \u0026 McDermott, Sentencing: The Practitioner’s\nGuide (Aurora, Ont.: Canada Law Book Inc., 1999), at sec. 8.150.\nConditional sentences of that duration and, indeed, of shorter duration, have\nbeen passed against persons found guilty of manslaughter both in this province\nand elsewhere: R. v. Ferguson, [1997] O.J. No. 2488 (Gen. Div.); R.\nv. Mananghaya, [1997] M.J. No. 267, 118 Man. R. (2d) 30 (C.A.); R. v.\nEmard, [1999] B.C.J. No. 463 (S.C.); R. v. Oster, [1997] B.C.J. No.\n3099 (Prov. Ct.); R. v. Hariczuk, [1999] O.J. No. 3110 (C.J.). The\nSupreme Court of Canada has recently rejected the suggestion that conditional\nsentences are inappropriate for serious offences, including manslaughter: R.\nv. Proulx (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) at paras. 80-81. The\nimposition of a conditional sentence upon a person convicted of manslaughter is\nnot, in and of itself, an error in principle.[15]Furthermore, the courts have been faced with a number of manslaughter\ncases arising out of abusive relationships where some or all of the features\nreferred to by the trial judge (alcohol, a weapon, and an impaired or otherwise\nincapacitated victim) have been present. But, recognizing the effect of the\nabusive relationship, the courts have imposed non-custodial or minimal custody\nsentences, including suspended sentence with probation: R. v. Millar\n(1994), 1994 CanLII 7558 (ON SC), 31 C.R. (4th) 315 (Ont. Gen. Div.), R. v. Bennett,\n[1993] O.J. No. 1011 (Prov. Div.), R. v. Whitten (1992), 110 N.S.R. (2d)\n148 (N.S.S.C.), R. v. Fors (1987), 3 W.C.B. (2d) 31(Ont. H.C.); twelve\nmonths plus probation: R. v. Tran, [1991] O.J. No. 2052;\nconditional sentence of two years less a day: R. v. Getkate, [1998] O.J.\nNo. 6329 (Gen. Div.); R. v. Ferguson, [1997] O.J. No. 2488 (Gen. Div.);\nseven months imprisonment with three years probation: R. v. Cowley, [1995]\nO.J. No. 592 (Gen. Div.).(2)The Effect of\nProvocation on Sentence[16]The trial judge stated that: “Even minor provocation by the victim is\nnot enough to reduce this type of sentence.” This statement represents an error\nin principle. The issue was discussed and resolved by the Supreme Court of\nCanada in R. v. Stone, 1999 CanLII 688 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290. In that case, the defence of\nprovocation had been used to reduce a homicide from murder to manslaughter. The\nquestion was whether the effect or use of the provocation was thereby spent,\nand therefore not available for consideration a second time on the issue of the\nappropriate sentence to be imposed. At p. 405, Bastarache J. referred to the\nprinciple that “punishment must be meted out with regard to the moral\nculpability or blameworthiness of an offender”. He concluded at p. 407 that:In cases involving provocation, s. 232 permits a verdict of murder to be reduced\nto one of manslaughter, for which there is no minimum penalty unless a firearm\nwas used in the commission of the offence (s. 236) This in turn allows for the\nconsideration of provocation in the assessment of the offender’s moral\nculpability and hence in the determination of an appropriate sentence. It is\nParliament that has chosen to accord special attention to provocation.[17]In his factum, appellant’s counsel fairly points out that the\nmanslaughter plea in this case may not have been based on the defence of\nprovocation but rather on lack of intent to kill. However, it was clear that\ndefence counsel at trial did rely on the deceased’s historical abuse of the\nappellant as well as the sexual assault on her that evening, as a mitigating\nfactor on sentence. In my view, whether or not provocation was the basis of the\nacceptance of the plea to manslaughter, where the existence of clearly\nprovocative conduct affects the moral culpability of the appellant, that\nconduct can and should be taken into account when considering the appropriate\nsentence.(3)Misapprehension\nofthe Evidence[18]In his reasons for sentence the trial judge made the following statement\nwhich was not founded on the agreed statement of facts that formed the basis of\nthe plea. He referred to the independent evidence of the deceased’s sexual\nassault of the appellant that evening:David Keleman had been with the two parties that night. Everybody had been\ndrinking. David Keleman left the residence at one point. On his return he\nwitnessed the deceased naked on top of his daughter and Ms. Simcoe essentially\npassed out and partially naked beneath him. Mr. Keleman shouted at the\ndeceased to leave Ms. Simcoe alone and then after some time had passed he left\nthe building, believing that the incident was effectively over.\n(Emphasis added).[19]The following is the description of the role of Mr. Keleman in the facts\nread in by Crown counsel on the guilty plea:The night of the incident, he had been at Ken’s [the deceased’s] townhouse\nwith Ken and Bonnie Simcoe. They were watching T.V. and drinking. He left to\nreturn to his own home to get an antennae. When he returned, he states,\n\"Ken was nude on top of Bonnie. He had her top up and bottoms down. He was\ntrying to nuzzle her, trying to penetrate her.” Mr. Keleman stated that he got\nmad and began to yell at Ken Simcoe, and that he struck Ken Simcoe.Ms. Simcoe woke up. She was yelling and was hysterical. Mr. Keleman\ntook Ms. Simcoe upstairs to calm her down. He indicates that Mr. Simcoe\nwas shouting obscenities and taunting her. She returned downstairs in a rage\nand began to throw items around the room. Mr. Keleman states that he then left\nthe apartment.[20]Based on this description, there was no basis for the trial judge to\nconclude that Mr. Keleman left thinking the incident was over. Although one\nmight wonder how he could have left during the yelling and throwing, and\nperhaps infer that he only did so when he thought the incident was over, that\nwas not the evidence before the court.[21]The trial judge also concluded from the above description, including\nthat Mr. Keleman took the appellant upstairs to calm her down, that some\ntime passed between the sexual assault and the homicide, and that the appellant\nhad in fact calmed down. He said: “True, he had behaved abominably towards his\ndaughter, but his actions had been interrupted by a concerned friend of both\nthe accused and the deceased. Some time had passed because of this\ninterruption. Ms. Simcoe could have left the scene completely. She chose not to\ndo so.” However, the brief recitation of the circumstances of the offence\nsuggest that only a very short time had passed and that the appellant did not\nhave the opportunity to calm down as her father was shouting obscenities and\ncontinuing the incident. The trial judge mentioned the lapse of time as a\nfactor in sentencing, and one which weighed against the appellant.[22]I conclude that the trial judge made three significant\nerrors in determining sentence. He began by using a range of sentence with a\nlower limit that was far above the correct range, which range can, in\nappropriate circumstances, include a suspended sentence. He was in error in\nconcluding that he could not consider the provocative actions of the deceased\nin mitigation of sentence. Third, he placed emphasis on his misunderstanding\nthat when the friend, Mr. Keleman, left the appellant and the victim, the\nincident appeared to be over, and that a period of time passed between the assault\nby the victim and the manslaughter, so that the appellant’s actions were in\neffect unprovoked. This was a misapprehension ofthe evidence as\ndisclosed in the statement of facts read in by the Crown.[23]As a result of these errors, this court may set aside the sentence\nimposed by the trial judge and impose the proper sentence.THE PROPER SENTENCE[24]The taking of a life is always a terrible tragedy and a most serious\noffence no matter the circumstances. It is therefore difficult to consider how\na prison sentence of a term of years can be viewed as disproportionate to the\noffence. Rather, courts have viewed the offence of manslaughter in the context\nin which it occurred, including the relationship between the victim and the\naccused, together with the personal characteristics of the accused, in order to\ndetermine the appropriate sentence.[25]In this case there are several mitigating factors that militate in\nfavour of a more lenient sentence:(1)The moral culpability of the appellant is significantly reduced by\nseveral key factors: first, she did not intend to kill her father due to her\nconsumption of alcohol; second, the extreme provocation of the sexual assault\nin front of a friend, followed by the taunting and obscenities; third, the\nassault capped the long history of abuse by her father.(2)No criminal record.(3)No history of conduct that would suggest she would be a threat to the\ncommunity.(4)The appellant is remorseful for what she did and pled guilty.(5)The appellant has a tragic history marked by sexual abuse, the loss of\nher boyfriend in a car accident, drug and alcohol abuse and suicide attempts.(6)The appellant wished treatment whether in the community or in custody.[26]In my view, the mitigating factors in this case suggest that a sentence\nin the upper reformatory range would have been appropriate. I am also of the\nview that the trial judge could have imposed a conditional sentence to be\nserved in the community. In this case and for this appellant, such a sentence,\nincluding strict terms of house arrest together with treatment for substance\nabuse and community service would well have served the sentencing objectives\nset out in the Code.[27]However, the appellant has now served one year in custody following\nsentencing as well as 8 months of pretrial custody which is credited as 16\nmonths. As a result, the appropriate sentence at this time, is time served. The\nappellant should also be on probation for 2 years on the statutory conditions\nand on terms that she take treatment as required and perform 100 hours of\ncommunity service.DISPOSITION[28]I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the sentence and\nsubstitute a sentence of time served together with probation on the conditions\ndescribed.Signed:“\nK.

Walsh, Esq. - for the CrownMichael Noel, Esq. - for the accusedSENTENCINGRIORDON,\nJ. (Orally):On July 13th this Court convicted\nNathan Nagle of defrauding Gordon Richardson of a sum of money exceeding one\nthousand dollars, contrary to Section 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code\nof Canada.Mr. Gordon Richardson purchased a\nmotor vehicle from Nathan Nagle for the sum of $7,500.00. This transaction was\nconcluded in Chatham on April 18th, 1989. The vehicle in question was subject\nto a conditional sale contract in favour of Ford Credit Canada Limited and had\nbeen financed through that Company in the month of[Page\n2]September of 1988. At\nthat time the amount of $18,544.80 was financed and was to be payable monthly.The outstanding balance of the\nconditional sale contract was not paid by Mr. Nagle to Ford Credit Canada\nLimited. He continued to make the monthly payments until July of '89. In\nSeptember of 1989 the vehicle was repossessed from Mr. Richardson because of a\ndefault in the monthly prescribed payments to Ford Credit. After repossession,\nthe vehicle was again purchased by Mr. Richardson from Ford Credit Canada\nLimited for the sum of $5,900.00, Mr. Richardson being the highest bidder for\nthe vehicle.Nathan Nagle is 36 years of age, he\nis married and the father of four children, one child by his first wife and three\nchildren by his present wife. The children are relatively young, I understand\nthe oldest is 12 years of age and the youngest four months of age. He has a\nGrade 7 education. He has worked at several labour-type jobs. At the time of\nthe commission of the present offence both he and his wife were providing home\ncare and management services for an elderly incapacitated infirm person and\nthey were earning a modest income and received as well living allowance of free\nroom and board.Throughout the proceedings Mr. Nagle\nhas denied wilful intent. At the time that this offence occurred he was\nobviously experiencing financial difficulties caused by irresponsible use of\ncredit over a period of some years. As I said, he was in receipt of a modest\nincome only at this time but, nonetheless, he was able to obtain substantial\ncredit approvals for purchases of automobiles, and according to the\npre-sentence report,[Page\n3]had some 30 credit cards\nfrom various financial institutions. These were obtained through various means,\nobviously some of them appear to have been obtained by devious means according\nto the pre-sentence report. He spent money compulsively, he used the money that\nwas obtained on credit for various expenses, there were some travel expenses,\nthere were purchases of goods on credit including at least one, possibly two,\nother automobiles which were financed and sold with conditional sales contracts\noutstanding.I find it difficult to understand\nhow in his circumstances he was able to obtain such an extensive amount of\ncredit. Obviously a complete and through credit check could not have been made.It is my conclusion that Mr. Nagle\nhas demonstrated an irresponsible attitude towards credit and towards honesty.\nI'm satisfied that he knew better, he acted immaturely. Although I hesitate to\nmake reference to the pre-sentence report in regard to a comment that the\nauthor of same is not known, I will say that it was probably a proper\ndescription when they compared the use of his credit card to a five year old\nchild left unattended in a candy store. Obviously Mr. Nagle was unable to\nhandle the credit that he obtained.His conduct has obviously caused\ngreat concern to his family. He has not lived up to their standards and\ncertainly has not lived up to the high standards of his church. Both his family\nand his church are obviously disappointed with his actions, and I don't doubt\nthat he has caused considerable stress to both his family members and to the\nchurch that he belongs to.[Page\n4]Counsel are aware of the aims of\nsentencing, I point them out for your benefit at this time, Mr. Nagle. I have\nto consider protection of society, punishment and general deterrence which is a\nvery important factor. The message has to be given to the public that this type\nof action will not be accepted by the courts and will not be tolerated. Then of\ncourse there's specific deterrence to you, to demonstrate that this conduct is\nnot acceptable and of course there's reformation and rehabilitation. I have to\napply and try to balance all of these aims in determining a proper sentence.Several factors must be considered,\nyour age, your education, your family, your record, your record is that you're\na first offender, cases of course of similar types, decisions of other courts,\nall must be considered.Important factors for this Court to\nconsider, in my opinion, are the expressed intention throughout of Mr. Nagle to\nrepay Ford Credit Canada Limited and I think he intended to repay them.The obvious ease in which he\nobtained credit, the failure of the credit granting authorities to adequately\ncheck his credit when they granted credit to him, and of course the fact that\nhe is a first offender, a family man with four young children, all this must be\ntaken into consideration.I must also, however, consider the\ninnocent victims. Mr. and Mrs. Richardson had to borrow approximately $6,000.00\nto pay Ford Credit of Canada in order to purchase or retain the vehicle. Ford\nCredit has obviously a substantial deficiency. The pre-sentence report\nindicates credit card debts that are outstanding[Page\n5]in the range of\n$30,000.00, not including the debt to Ford Credit, and it indicates as well\nthat Mr. Nagle has filed for personal bankruptcy.I recall the testimony of Mrs.\nRichardson when she testified that she said that she and her husband could not\nafford this loss. Undoubtedly the borrowing of $6,000.00 or thereabouts caused\nthem a very substantial hardship and considerable prejudice.The offence is a serious one, the Criminal Code provides for a maximum penalty of a\nterm of imprisonment of ten years.The decision of The Queen v.\nRoberts, reported in 59 N.B.R. (2d), 368,\nwas referred to by myself during submissions of counsel. In that case an\n18-month sentence was imposed by a trial judge along with two years of\nprobation. This was reduced by the Court of Appeal to a sentence of six months\ndetention plus two years of probation. That case involved the illegal use of\ncredit cards by a person who was managing a service station.Another New Brunswick Court of\nAppeal decision is that of The Queen v. Landry, N.B.C.A. No. 71/85, June 12, 1985, which has been\nreferred by counsel, where the Court of Appeal reduced a six-month sentence to\na sentence of two months on each of two counts for a total of four months of\nimprisonment on a charge of similar nature involving video machines. In that\ncase video machines were rented and sold.Several other cases from other\njurisdictions have been considered. I have examined a number of them, they\nindicate a wide range of sentences, from a fine and[Page\n6]suspended sentence, up\nto six years of imprisonment. Mr. Noel has done a considerable amount of work\nand I think in his research he found cases in which longer terms of\nimprisonment were imposed.What is in the best interest of\nsociety in this particular case. I have a responsibility to make a decision\nthat must demonstrate to Mr. Nagle and to others that this is unacceptable\nbehaviour. My first reaction was to follow the guidelines set down by the Court\nof Appeal in the Roberts decision, which I have referred to earlier. I have, however, to take\ninto consideration the particular facts of this case, and the special factors\nthat I mentioned, and of course the possibility and the offer that has been\nmade with respect to restitution. My initial reaction was that looking at the\ncircumstances and the financial situation of Mr. Nagle that restitution would\nnot be possible, even remotely possible.After having considered all of the\nmatters, it is my decision that, considering the seriousness of the matter, a\nterm of imprisonment must be imposed but I make that decision with an allowance\nfor the time of imprisonment to be served intermittently so as to allow Mr.\nNagle the opportunity to continue to pursue avenues of employment. In my view,\nI will exercise leniency, I impose a term of imprisonment of 60 days and allow\nthe time to be served intermittently rather than all at one time to permit\nemployment endeavours to take place. I have made this decision in light of the\nfact that Mr. Nagle has a young family and has prospects for employment. The\nimprisonment or detention could be[Page\n7]served on weekends so as\nnot to interfere with employment.In addition, I feel it is\nappropriate that there be a period of probation and I impose a twenty-four\nmonth period of probation. During this period Mr. Nagle is to keep the peace\nand be of good behaviour, and report to a Probation Officer as required to do\nso. He will be under the direction and supervision of a Probation Officer for\nthis period of time. He is to continue with his efforts to find and maintain\nsuitable employment.In addition, he is to do community\nservice work in his community, and I direct the completion of 800 hours of\ncommunity service work during the period of probation of 24 months. This would\namount to approximately eight hours per week.In addition, I direct that there be\nrestitution to the Richardsons in the amount of $5,900.00, it's to be paid in\nfull by way of three instalments, the amount of\n$2,000.00 by July the 31st, 1991, $2,000.00 by July the 31st, 1992 and the\nbalance by July the 31st, 1993.I direct the Clerk to complete the\nterms of probation and to give a copy of the Probation Order to Mr. Nagle, and\nto work out the terms of the intermittent detention.MR. WALSH:My\nlord, may I make one suggestion?COURT:Yes,\nplease, certainly.MR. WALSH:Would -- would the Court\nconsider a problem in as much as the restitution would extent over a longer\nperiod of 24 months 'cause that poses a problem that[Page 8]-- because an Order is being made under a Probation\nOrder that will --COURT:Yes.MR. WALSH:Expire in 24 months but the\nrestitution will be paid over an additional year. There would be --COURT:Obviously\n--MR. WALSH:I\nwould expect problems with the CourtCOURT:It\nwas an oversight obviously and I --MR. NOEL:We\nhave no objection to it being extended to 36.COURT:I think in the\ncircumstances that should be 36 months. Thank you, Mr. Walsh, for bringing that\nto my attention.I might say that this has been a\nvery difficult matter to decide and I trust the parties can appreciate that\nit's not always a pleasant responsibility.[S]Thomas W.

THE QUEEN* Supreme Court of Canada, Laskin, C.J.C., Martland, Judson, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson, Beets and de Grandpré, JJ. October 7, 1975. *On November 13, 1975, a motion for rehearing of this appeal was granted on the question of law on which leave to appeal was originally granted, and on December 19, 1975, following a rehearing by the Full Court, the appeal was dismissed, Laskin, C.J.C., Spence, Dick-son and Beetz, JJ., dissenting. The reasons for judgment will be reported as soon as possible. J. R. Belleghem, for appellant. E. G. Hach born, for the Crown, respondent. LAsku, C.J.C. (dissenting) :—I have had the advantage of seeing the reasons proposed by my brothers Spence and Pigeon. There are two questions in this appeal, a preliminary question of jurisdiction and the question going to the merits on which leave to appeal was granted. Like my brother Spence, I am in agreement with my brother Pigeon in his disposition of the question of jurisdiction, a disposition that affirms juris- diction in this case and which consequently involves the overruling of the Goldhar v. The Queen case (1959), 125 C.C.C. 209, [1960] S.C.R. 60, 31 C.R. 374, and of other cases which adopted its approach to deny jurisdiction. On the question of the merits, I am fully in accord with the reasons and conclusions of my brother Spence. What prompts me to add observations of my own is a troubled concern about the way in which I think the two questions in this appeal have been assessed. Both in the Goldhar case and in other cases, such as Paul v. The Queen (1960), 127 C.C.C. 129, [1960] S.C.R. 452, 34 C.R. 110, which applied it, and in the reasons of my brother Pigeon in the present case, the issue of jurisdiction was resolved according to different canons of statutory construction leading to different results. My brother Pigeon declares in the present case in favour of literal construction while Fauteux, J. (as he then was), in Goldhar and in Paul was of the view that literal construction would lead to repugnancy with other statutory provisions. Does this mean then that the choice of a canon of construction determines the meaning and application of a statutory provision which is under review? My experience does not persuade me that the matter is so simple. The relevant question is surely that of determining why one approach is selected rather than another, involving therefore a consideration of the factors that bear on the selection. I assume in this connection that different results will flow according to the selection made. This is not however invariably so. In the vast majority of the cases where statutes have to be interpreted and the interpretation determines the result, it makes no difference which canon of interpretation (tbe it the so-called literal rule or the golden rule or the mischief rule) is chosen. There are contradictions or difficulties in all of the canons that have been usually relied on. Judges may disagree on what the plain meaning is even when they agree that it is the plain meaning or literal approach that should prevail. Similarly, Judges may disagree on what is the social purpose of a statute, although agreeing that under the mischief rule that is what they should seek in construing a statutory provision. In my view, we cannot escape making our own determination of purpose, or policy, regardless of the canon that is invoked; indeed, we make it when we purport to apply one canon rather than another. The present appeal is illustrative of this view in respect of both of the questions that are involved in it. I take first the preliminary question of jurisdiction. It is to me unreal to think that literal construction determines the result when in order to arrive at it a detailed review of legislative history is required (and properly so) and the purpose of the measure under review is pursued through an examination of the changes made in the jurisdiction and role of this Court. Once it is admitted, as it must be here, that reasonable men can differ on the effect of language directed to a particular end which itself is in issue, we are in a situation where our conclusion will be influenced by our view of what this Court's jurisdiction and role should be. Since I would not exclude cases from the leave jurisdiction of this Court unless it is quite plain that they have been excluded by statute, and since I do not regard the present appeal as plainly excluded I support the conclusion of my brother Pigeon on the question of jurisdiction. On the question of the merits, I think this is eminently a case where under any canon of construction the result reached by my brother Spence is the preferable one. I readily admit to a predisposition to that result by reason of my dissent, as a member of the Ontario Court of Appeal, in R. v. Willis, [1969] 2 C.C.C. 84, [1969] 1 O.R. 64, 4 C.R.N.S. 325. My conclusion there was based on a full examination of the legislative history, on an assessment of social purpose as I saw it reflected in the statutory language, and on my appreciation of the nature of an appeal. I have never understood an appeal to carry additional jeopardy to an appellant beyond that already incurred as a result of the trial; and this must be especially so where criminal justice is involved. The result that I reached in the Willis case and that I would reach here has been made even clearer to me by the canvass that my brother Spence has made of the language of the various provisions of the Criminal Code bearing upon the issue, a canvass which emphasizes literal construction of the whole of s. 614 (1) in the context of the rights of appeal open to the Crown as well as to the accused. The provincial appellate Courts in this country appear to have been influenced by English cases without, at least so far as their reasons disclose, dwelling on the terms of the English legislation on which those cases were based. The judgment of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Christakos (1946), 87 C.C.C. 40, [1947] 2 D.L.R. 151, 1 C.R. 34, which seems to have become a pivotal case on the question at issue, contains nothing but a bare reference to some English cases. The majority in R. v. Willis purported to proceed on a literal approach and it was applied without more by the Quebec Court of Appeal in Valade v. The Queen (1970), 15 C.R.N.S. 42. Since this was the approach taken by my brother Spence in reaching an opposite result, I am reinforced in my observations on the canons of construction. As is well known, the English Criminal Appeal Act of 1907 (U.K.), c. 23, gave express power to increase a sentence on an appeal by the accused. There was no right of appeal against sentence in the Crown, and hence it might well have been the view of the Court of Appeal that the language of s. 4 (3) of the 1907 Act (which empowered it \"if they think that a different sentence should have been imposed . . . [to] pass such other sentence warranted in law by the verdict\") would support the exercise of power to impose a harsher sentence even without express authority to do so. But s. 4 (3) included the words \"whether more or less severe\", indicating an appreciation by the British Parliament of the ordinary limits of an appeal, especially in criminal matters. I may add that the English Criminal Appeal Act of 1968 (U.K.), c. 19, s. 10, as amended by the Courts Act, 1971 (U.K.) , c. 23, s. 56 and Sch. 8, has removed the express power theretofore given to increase a sentence upon an appeal against it by an accused. I regard the judgment in appeal as a departure by a provincial appellate Court from judicial justice and as a venture into a species of administrative justice, a departure from ordinary appellate procedure all the more startling because criminal justice is involved. I would allow the appeal as proposed by my brother Spence. MARYLAND and JUDSON, JJ., concur with PIGEON, J. SPENCE, J. (dissenting) :—I have had the opportunity to peruse the reasons for judgment written by Mr. Justice Pigeon and I adopt the facts as stated in those reasons and will find it necessary to refer to very few other facts. In so far as Mr. Justice Pigeon finds that this 'Court had jurisdiction to consider this appeal, I am in complete agreement with him and I have nothing to add. With respect, however, I am of the opinion that the appeal should succeed and that the Court of Appeal for Ontario had no jurisdiction to increase the sentence imposed upon the accused when the Crown had chosen merely to serve upon the accused a notice that if he persisted in his appeal the Crown would request the Court to impose a more severe sentence. This conclusion entails the determination that in my opinion, the decision of the Court of Appeal in R. v. Willis, [1969] 2 'C.C.C. 84, [1969] 1 O.R. 64, 4 C.R.N.S. 325, was in error and that also the decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba in R. v. Chris -takos (1946), 87 C.C.C. 40, [1947] 2 D.L.R. 151, 1 C.R. 34, and of the Quebec Court of Appeal in Valade y. The Queen (1970), 15 C.R.N.S. 42, suffered from like defect. I commence with the proposition that a right of appeal is altogether statutory. This principle itself appears in the Criminal Code in s. 602. It reads: 602. No proceedings other than those authorized by this Part and Part XXIPI shall be taken by way of appeal in proceedings in respect of indictable offences. The right of appeal of the Attorney-General or counsel at his direction is granted by s. 605 of the Code and as to sentence is dealt with in para. (1) (b) thereof which reads: 605 (1) The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal (b) with leave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof, against the sentence passed by a trial court in proceedings by indictment, unless that sentence is one fixed by law. Section 607 [am. 1972, c. 13, s. 53] of the Code governs procedure on appeals by either the Crown or the accused and provides particularly that the appellant \"shall give notice of appeal or notice of his application for leave to appeal, in such manner and within such period as may be directed by rules of court\" [s-s. (1)]. Those Rules of Court, in the case of Ontario, are contained in Rules 10 to 25 [Rules 10 to 38, since repealed and replaced March 1, 1974] of the Criminal Appeal Rules and Rule 12 (2) thereof provides that: 12(2) Where the appeal is from sentence ... the notice of appeal shall be served within thirty days from the day of sentence. Rule 13(b) provides: 13. Service of a notice of appeal shall be effected, (b) in a11 other cases, by delivering to the office cf the registrar personally or by registered mail three copies of a notice of appeal, and, in addition, in appeals by an attorney-general, by personal serνiςe on the convicted person. When the Crown served notice upon the accused, the appellant in the Court of Appeal and in this Court, of an intention to request a more severe sentence, it was, in fact, attempting to assert a right of appeal from sentence. The Crown was doing so without carrying out the formalities required by the provisions of the Code which I have cited and the proper carrying out of such requirements was, in my view, requisite for obtaining the right to ask the Court of Appeal to increase the sentence, and failing due compliance with those requirements, the Crown had no jurisdiction to apply for an increase in sentence and the 'Court had no jurisdiction to grant such an increase: Dennis v. The Queen (1958), 121 C.C.C. 129, [1958] S.C.R. 473, 28 C.R. 173. If the Crown had complied with the requirements, then the Crown would have had to make application for leave to appeal from the sentence and both upon such application and on the appeal itself, if leave to appeal had been granted, the Crown would have the same onus as has an appellant on all appeals. Using the procedure which the Crown used in this particular case, there was no statutory onus at all upon the Crown and it would appear that, in fact, the onus was thrown upon the accused not only in his vain attempt to demonstrate that the sentence imposed on him was too severe but to prevent that sentence from being increased. I am, moreover, of the opinion that the powers of the Court of Appeal defined in s. 614 of the Code are exact and do not permit the Court to exercise powers other than those given. Section 614(1) provides: 614(1) Where an appeal is taken against sentence the court of appeal shall, unless the sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against, and may upon such evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to receive, (a) vary the sentence with the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the accused was convicted, or (b) dismiss the appeal. In the present appeal, the certificate of the formal judgment of the Court of Appeal reads, in part: Τητs Couaτ Dm ORDER Τaar the said appeal should be and the same was thereby dismissed but that the sentence of twelve (12) years on the charge of rape should be varied to one of life imprisonment. Jessup, J.A., in giving reasons for the Court of Appeal, said [15 C.C.C. (2d) 145 at p. 148] : In the result, I would dismiss the appellant's appeal but vary the sentence on the charge of rape by changing it to one of life imprisonment. So the certificate of the formal order accurately reflects the reasons given for the Court of Appeal. It will be seen, therefore, that the Court of Appeal purported to act under both paras. (a) and (b) of s. 614(1) in that it not only dismissed the appeal as authorized by para. (b) but it also varied the sentence as authorized by para. (a). The powers in paras. (a) and (b) are disjunctive. The word \"or\" is the word which is at the end of para. (a) and I am of the opinion that s. 614 of the Code does not permit a Court on the consideration of a specific appeal to exercise its jurisdiction under both paras. (a) and (b) but that the Court of Appeal must choose whether to exercise its powers under para. (a) by varying or under para. (b) by dismissing the appeal. I think this is a convincing indication that by the words of s. 614(1) (a), \"vary the sentence with the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the accused was convicted\", Parliament only intended to permit a variation by way of decrease upon the appeal of an accused person or, if the Crown were the appellant, to consider a variation by way of increase upon the Crown's appeal. It is, I think, of some interest and value to note that in the United Kingdom, when the power of the Court of Appeal to increase sentence was granted by s. 4(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1907 (U.K.), c. 23, the appellate Court was empowered to quash the sentence passed at trial and \"(2) pass such other sentence warranted in law by the verdict (whether more or less severe) in substitution therefor\". Thus, the Parliament in the United Kingdom by specific words granted a power to increase. No such words as \"whether more or less severe\" appear in s. 614 (1) (a) of the Code and, in my view, the words \"such other sentence warranted in law\" as they appear in the United Kingdom statute and the words \"the sentence with the limits prescribed by law\" as they appear in the Criminal Code are exactly in pari materia. It is, I think, indeed significant that Parliament in the United Kingdom thought it necessary to add a specific authorization for the imposition of a more severe sentence. I note also the opening words of s. 614 (1) \"where an appeal is taken against sentence\" and that the words are not \"where any appeal is taken against sentence\", again indicating that the power to vary is limited to a power in considering an appeal not in considering a motion by the Crown urged at the time that an appeal by the accused is before the Court. There is another reason for my conclusion which I find most convincing. In the present case, counsel for the Attorney-General relying on R. r. Willis, supra, first advised counsel for the appellant by telephone and later confirmed by letter that if the appellant had put his sentence in issue the Court of Appeal would be at liberty to increase it if it saw fit and that the Crown would be asking the Court of Appeal to increase the sentence, possibly to life. The Crown and the appellant's counsel agreed to adjourn the appeal and maintain the status quo of the proceedings to enable the appellant's counsel to obtain instructions. Jessup, J.A., in his reasons for judgment, said: The appellant was given notice of the Crown's motion from its statement of law and fact and did not abandon his appeal but rather argued it with vigour. I am of the opinion that this is a most objectionable in ter-rorem procedure. An accused person, on the advice of counsel, is of the opinion that he has a serious appeal as to the quantum of sentence which he wishes to urge before the Court of Appeal. The Crown seeks to intimidate him from doing so by threatening that if he does urge his appeal then the Crown will ask that the sentence be increased. If the Crown desires to obtain an increase in sentence, then the Crown should apply for leave to appeal against sentence and take on the burden of an appellant to which I have already referred, rather than by threatening the accused that if he is bold enough to assert his own right of appeal dire results will ensue. For all of these reasons, I would allow the appeal and restore the sentence imposed by the Provincial Court Judge. PIGEON, J.: —Before Provincial Court Judge, D. V. Latimer, the appellant pleaded guilty to charges of rape and wounding. He was sentenced to 12 years' concurrent. On his appeal against sentence, this was increased to life imprisonment. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on the following question of law: On an appeal by the accused against sentence, where there is no cross-appeal by the Crown to have the sentence increased does the Ontario Court of Appeal on dismissing the accused's appeal have the power to increase the sentence imposed upon the accused? Rather than summarize the reasons stated by Jessup, J.A., for the Court of Appeal, I will quote the essential [15 C.C.C. (2d) 145, pp. 146, 147-8] : The appellant appeals his sentence of 12 years imposed after his plea of guilty to a charge of rape and his sentence of 12 years concurrent imposed upon his plea of guilty to a charge of causing bodily harm with intent to wound, maim or disfigure. The sentences having put in issue, the Crown moves for their increase, citing R. v. Willis, [1969] 2 C.C.C. 84, [1969] 1 O.R. 64, 4 C.R.N.S. 325. The appellant was given notice of the 'Crown's motion from its statement of law and fact and did not abandon his appeal but rather argued it with vigour. Under circumstances indicating planning and deliberation, the appellant went at night to a home where the 14-year-old, virginal complainant was baby-sitting. After assaulting her with his fists he forcibly stripped her of all her clothes and, although she was menstruating, then raped her. He then forced the complainant, unclothed except for a jacket she threw on, to go outside with the evident intention of taking her somewhere in his car. When the complainant attempted to run away he overtook her and forced her back into the house. When the complainant then attempted to use the telephone, the appellant knocked her to the floor and with a paring knife stabbed her repeatedly in the face and eyes and about the throat until the knife broke. As a result the complainant may lose the sight of one eye. The appellant then fled the house abandoning the wounded complainant. While the appellant had considerable to drink the evening of the crimes, there is no suggestion that he lacked the requisite intent to commit them. The reports and evidence available to the learned Provincial Judge at the time of sentencing show that the appellant is not insane, mentally ill or psychotic. However, he suffers from a 'personality disorder manifested in impulsiveness, low stress tolerance, anger which he does not know how to handle properly and difficulty in knowing his own sexual identity. Dr. Karen Galbraith, a psychologist, and Dr. Peter Rowsell, a psychiatrist, both agreed that he was dangerous to the community. Both were testifying for the appellant. When an accused has been convicted of a serious crime in itself calling for a substantial sentence and when he suffers from some mental or personality disorder rendering him a danger to the community but not subjecting him to confinement in a mental institution and when it is uncertain when, if ever, the accused will be cured of his affliction, in my opinion the appropriate sentence is one of life. Such a sentence, in such circumstances, amounts to an indefinite sentence under which the parole board can release him to the community when it is satisfied, upon adequate psychiatric examination, it is in the interest df the accused and cf the community for him to return to society. The policy expressed in my opinion is that of the Criminal Division of the English Court of Appeal, cf. Thomas, Principles of Sentencing, at pp. 272-9. In the result, I would dismiss the appellant's appeal but vary the sentence on the charge of rape by changing it to one of life imprisonment. On the hearing of this appeal, counsel for the Crown objected to the jurisdiction of this Court relying on Goldhar v. The Queen (1959), 125 C.C.C. 209, [1960] S.C.R. 60, 31 C.R. 374, a decision rendered on an application for leave to appeal heard by a Court of five Judges in which it was held, Cart-wright, J., dissenting, \"that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against a sentence imposed for the commission of an indictable offence\". In my view, that decision is not binding and should not be followed for the following reasons. Before the 1949 amendments, the Supreme Court Act [now R.S.C. 1970, c. S-19] did not confer jurisdiction to this Court in criminal cases. This was due to the following words in s. 36: \"except in criminal causes and in proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition arising out of a criminal charge\". Therefore, any jurisdiction in criminal matters had to be found in the Criminal Code or other statute. In Goldhammer v. The King (1924), 42 C.C.C. 354, [1924] 3 D.L.R. 1009, [1924] S.C.R. 290, the appeal to this Court was from a judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal increasing the sentence passed on conviction. This had been done on an appeal by the Crown under s. 1013 of the Criminal Code then in force as replaced by 1923 (Can.), c. 41, s. 9, and reading in part as follows: 1013(1) A person cnnvicted on indictment may appeal to the court of appeal against his conviction— (2) A person convicted on indictment, or the Attorney General, or the counsel for the Crown at the trial, may with leave of a judge of the court of appeal, appeal to that court against the sentence passed by the trial court, unless that sentence is one fixed by law. Appeals to this Court were then governed by ss. 1024 and 1024A of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1906, c. 146. The latter section governed appeals by leave from judgments setting aside or affirming a conviction of an indictable offence in the case of a conflict with a judgment of another Court of appeal in a like case. Therefore, it was clear that the only possible foundation for the appeal was in s. 1024 of which the only relevant part, s-s. (1), then read as follows: 1024(1) Any person convicted of any indictable offence, whose conviction has been affirmed on an appeal taken under section ten hundred and thirteen may appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada against the affirmance of such conviction: Provided that no such appeal can be taken if the court of appeal is unanimous in affirming the conviction, nor unless notice of appeal in writing has been served on the Attorney General within fifteen days after such affirmance or such further time as may be allowed by the Supreme Court of Canada or 'a judge thereof. It was held that this Court had no jurisdiction, Duff, J., saying [at p. 357 C.C.C., pp. 1011-2 D.L.R., p. 293 S.C.R.] : As my brother Idington points out, the word \"conviction\" cannot, perhaps, be said to be capable of only one necessarily exclusive meaning, and it may be capable of being employed with a signification including the sentence. Section 1013 does, however, I think, distinguish very clearly between the conviction and the sentence for the purposes of appeal, and the 1923 Act, by which the present section was brought into force, made no change in s. 1024. Accordingly, I think the word \"conviction\" in the last mentioned section should be read in its less technical sense, and consequently that there is no right of appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment given by a Court of Appeal on an appeal under section 1013(2). In 1949, after the Privy Council had affirmed (A.-G. Ont. et al. v. A.-G. Can. et al., [1947] 1 D.L.R. 801, [1947] A.C. 127, [1947] 1 W.W.R. 305) the opinion of this Court on a reference (sub nom. Reference re Privy Council Appeals, [1940] 1 D.L.R. 289, [1940] S.C.R. 49), Parliament enacted important amendments to the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 35, by 1949, c. 37. Appeals to the Privy Council which had previously been abolished in criminal matters only, by re-enacting in 1933 [1932-33, c. 53, s. 17] s. 1024 (4) of the Criminal Code, were definitely abolished in all cases. Much wider provision than before was made for appeals by special leave in a new s. 41, the material part of which is as follows (parentheses indicate words deleted in 1956, c. 48, s. 2) : 41(1) Subject to subsection three [and to section forty-four] an appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada with leave of that court from any final or ether judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed 'to the Supreme •Court of 'Canada, whether or not leave to appeal to the 'Supreme Court of Canada has been refused by any other court. (3) No appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada lies under this section from the judgment af any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indictable offence or, except in respect of a question af law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an indictable offence. The first case in which leave to appeal in a criminal cause was sought to be obtained under those provisions appears to be Goodyear Tire \u0026 Rubber Co. of Canada Ltd. et al. v. The Queen (1956), 114 'C.C.C. 380, 2 D.L.R. (2d) 11, [1956] S.C.R. 303. It is unfortunately reported on the merits only. The judgment appealed to this Court was a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario affirming with variations an order of prohibition issued out of the Supreme Court of Ontario under the provisions of s. 31 of the Combines Investigation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 26, as amended, subsequent to a conviction upon indictment for an offence under that Act. The appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario had been taken under the provisions of the Criminal Code pertaining to an appeal from a sentence and the Court of Appeal had varied the judgment appealed from expressly holding it to be a sentence by virtue of s. 1012(e) of the Criminal Code providing that for the purposes of appeal: \"'sentence' includes any order of a trial court made on conviction with reference to the person convicted ...\" (108 C.C.C. 321 at p. 333, [1954] 4 D.L.R. 61 at p. 72, [1954] O.R. 377 at pp. 396-7) . The application for leave was first heard on June 22, 1954. A reargu-ment was directed that took place on December 6, 1954. On January 25th, judgment granting leave was rendered by the full Court. No written reasons were delivered and the decision was recorded as follows in the Minute Book: The majority being of the opinion that this Court has jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal, the applications therefor are allowed. The material filed by the applicants on the motions for leave shows that the applications were made exclusively under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act. The decision in Goldhammer was referred to as showing that this Court did not have jurisdiction under the Criminal Code. On the merits, the judgment of the Court of Appeal was affirmed and this would seem to indicate that this Court did not consider that the Court below had erred in asserting jurisdiction to deal with the order as being a sentence. The next case of an application for leave to appeal in a criminal cause under the Supreme Court Act was Parkes v. The Queen, [1956] S.C.R. 134. The subject-matter of the appeal was a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal from a decision of a County Court Judge finding that the appellant was a habitual criminal and sentencing him to an undetermined term in the penitentiary under the provisions of s. 660 of the Criminal Code. It was held unanimously by a Court of five Judges that such a decision is a judgment within the meaning of that word in s. 41(1) and does not fall within the terms of s. 41(3) so that this Court had jurisdiction to grant leave. In the reasons of the Court no reference was made to the decision in the Goodyear case, but it was referred to in the material on the application for leave. On the merits, the appeal was allowed unanimously and the sentence of preventive detention was quashed, 116 C.C.C. 86, 6 D.L.R. (2d) 449, [1956] S.C.R. 768). (This precedent has been uniformly followed in appeals from sentences of preventive detention, jurisdiction' being asserted to hear such appeals in a number of cases culminating in Poole u. The Queen, [1968] 3 . C.C.C. 257, 68 D.L.R. (2d) 449, [1968] S.C.R. 381, where the majority of the full Court held that this applied not only against the finding that the accused is an habitual criminal but also to the conclusion that it is expedient to sentence him to preventive detention.) A few years later, s. 41 was considered in connection with an offence other than an indictable offence in Smith v. The Queen ex rel. Chmielewski (1959), 124 C.C.C. 71, 22 D.L.R. (2d) 129, [1959] S.C.R. 638. The appeal was from the dismissal of an application for a writ of certiorari against a finding of delinquency against a child under the Juvenile Delinquents Act. Leave to appeal was granted subject to argument as to the right to grant leave. On the merits, the appeal was allowed. The reasoning of Kerwin, C.J.C. (at p. 75 C.C.C., pp. 132-3 D.L.R., p. 642 S.C.R.), concurred in expressly by Judson, J., and inferentially by the other members of the Court, was as follows on the question of jurisdiction: This Court had power to grant leave to appeal under s. 41(1) of the Supreme Court Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 259: \"41(1) Subject to subsection (3), an appeal lies to the Supreme Court with leave of that Court from any final or other judgment of the highest court of final resort in a province, or a judge thereof, in which judgment can be had in the particular case sought to be appealed to the Supreme Court, whether or net leave to appeal to the Supreme Court has been refused by any other court.\" Subsection (3) reads: \"41(3) No appeal to the Supreme Court lies under this section from the judgment of any court acquitting or convicting or setting aside or affirming a conviction or acquittal of an indi'cta'ble offence or, except in respect cif a question cf law or jurisdiction, of an offence other than an indictable offence.\" It has no application as the judgment of the Court cf Appeal is not one affirming a conviction. It will be noted that up to nearly 10 years after the enactment of s. 41, this Court uniformly adhered to literal construction and granted leave to appeal in criminal matters from any judgments not excluded by s-s. 3. Consideration must now be given to the decisions in which a different view was taken. This will be done in chronological order. In Guldhar v. The Queen (1959), 125 C.C.C. 209, [1960] S.C.R. 60, 31 C.R. 374, the application was for leave to appeal a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario dismissing an appeal against a sentence imposed on conviction for an indictable offence. In the reasons of the majority of the five Judges sitting, Fauteux, J., after saying that no right of appeal to this Court was given in such case by the provisions of the Criminal Code, pointed out the inconsistencies that would ensue if this Court had jurisdiction in the matter of sentence under s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act and said (at p. 227 C.C.C., p. 70 S.C.R.) : I cannot think that Parliament ever intended or even contem- plated these inconsistencies flowing from either one of these interpretations. And this, in my view, clearly indicates that it was never intended by Patliament that the right of appeal given under s. 41 would extend to indictable offences, as distinguished frcm non-indictable offences. Reference was made to Goldhammer v. The King but not to any of the previous decisions above mentioned dealing with the application in criminal matters of s. 41 of the Supreme Court Act after its replacement by the statute of 1949. In Paul v. The Queen (1960), 127 C.C.C. 129, [1960] S.C.R. 452, 34 C.R. 110, substantially the same reasoning was made on an application for leave to appeal from the refusal of a Court of Appeal to hear an appeal in a summary conviction matter or alternatively from the dismissal of the appeal to a County Court Judge. It was held on a four to three division that this Court did not have jurisdiction. Taschereau, J. (as he then was), said (at p. 133 C.C.C., pp. 457-8 S.C.R.): It was held in Goldhar v. The Queen (1959), 125 Can. C.C. 209, that if an appeal from a sentence was not given by 41 (3), nor the Criminal Code, we could not find any authority in 41(1) to review a sentence imposed by the Courts below. In that case it was stated by Fauteux J. with whcm all the members of the Court agreed, Cartwright J. dissenting, that in order to determine if a convicted person could appeal against a sentence in a matter of indictable offence, it was not permissible to look to s. 41 (1) for the authority to intervene, but only in the Criminal Code which does not permit an appeal against a sentence. The general proposition that matters which are not mentioned in s. 41(3) must be taken to be included in s. 41(1) has been ruled out in Goldhar, supra. Fauteux, J., said (at p. 143 C.C.C., p. 467 S.C.R.) : The proposition that judgments which are not within the scope of s. 41 (3) are necessarily embraced in s. 41(1) has been ruled out in the Goldhar case, where a strict adherence to the rule of literal construction of s. 41 was, in the matter, shown to lead to repug-nancy. Such a result would equally obtain if the judgment refusing leave to appeal, in this case, was held to come within s. 41(1). For on the same reasoning, one would have to hold that, for indictable offences, s. 41 (1) authorizes an appeal to this Court from a judgment of the Court of Appeal refusing leave to appeal to its Court from the verdict or judgment of first instance on grounds of mixed law and facts or pure facts. Such a jurisdiction would be inconsistent with the limitation of our jurisdiction to pure questions of law in criminal appeals from convictions or acquittals of offences. The majority decision in Paul v. The Queen was followed by a Court of five Judges in R. v. J. Alepin Freres Ltee et al., [1965] 3 C.C.C. 1, 49 D.L.R. (2d) 220, [1965] S.C.R. 359. Also in R. v. MacDonald, [1966] 2 C.C.C. 1, 52 D.L.R. (2d) 701, [1965] S.C.R. 831, a four to three decision, an appeal by the Crown from a judgment setting aside a sentence of preventive detention was quashed, the majority relying on the decisions in Goldhar, Paul and Alepin Freres. There is a clear conflict between the four last-mentioned cases and the other judgments adhering explicitly or implicitly to a different view of s. 41. This means that on any view of the rule of stare decisis the Court has to choose between the two conflicting views. In my opinion, the literal construction is preferable not only because in the absence of ambiguity the literal meaning should always be adhered to despite any inconsistencies short of absurdity, but also because any assumption that Parliament did not intend to depart from the previous state of the law is unjustified. Section 41 was enacted substantially in its present form at the time when appeals to the Privy Council were being abolished and this Court was being made truly supreme. The Privy Council had enjoyed unlimited jurisdiction by special leave and it is apparent that the new provision was intended to effect the change from a limited specific jurisdiction to a broad general jurisdiction. To hold that the inconsistencies resulting from this sweeping change indicate the intention of leaving some wide gaps open is, in my view, entirely unwarranted. On the contrary, the enactment of a provision that undoubtedly confers some jurisdiction in criminal matters beyond that existing under the Criminal Code, clearly indicates Parliament's will to remedy the omission to extend the jurisdiction of this Court in criminal cases when the Privy Council's jurisdiction in such cases was effectively abolished after the Statute of Westminster, 1932 (Can.), p. v. No reason has been advanced for construing the words \"con-victing\" and \"conviction\" in s-s. (3) of s. 41 otherwise than the same words in s. 1024(1) of the Criminal Code in force when it was enacted had been construed in the Goldhammer case. It is already firmly established by a long line of cases in this Court that those words in s. 41 (3) do not include a judgment imposing a sentence of preventive detention. It is also established by the decision of the Full Court in the Goodyear case that those same words do not apply to an order of prohibition that was a sentence within the meaning of the definition of that word in the same Criminal Code. Although the possibility of a distinction with respect to other sentences was left open in Poole, this now appears impossible on further consideration especially in view of what was said in Gold-hammer. For those reasons, it does not appear to me that s. 41(3) should be construed otherwise than in accordance with the strict meaning of \"convicting\" and \"conviction\" as established by the Goldhammer decision. This means that, in my view, the objection to jurisdiction fails. However, I consider it appropriate to point out that such conclusion implies no departure from our rules of never entertaining an appeal concerning the fitness of a sentence. Dealing now with the question on which leave was granted in this case, the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code are the following: 603 (1) A person who is convicted by a trial court in proceedings by indictment may appeal to the court of appeal (a) against his conviction .. . or (b) against the sentence passed by the trial court, with leave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof unless that sentence is one fixed by law. 605(1) The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal (b) with leave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof, against the sentence passed by a trial court in proceedings by indictment, unless that sentence is one fixed by law. 607(1) An appellant who proposes to appeal to the court of appeal or to obtain the leave of that court to appeal shall give notice of appeal or notice of his application for leave to appeal, in such manner and within such period as may be directed by rules of court. (2) The court of appeal or a judge thereof may at any time extend the time within which notice of appeal or notice of an application for leave to appeal may be given, but this subsection does not apply where a sentence of death has been imposed pursuant to a conviction. 614(1) Where an appeal is taken against sentence the court of appeal shall, unless the sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against, and may upon such evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to receive, (a) vary the sentence with the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the accused was convicted, or (b) dismiss the appeal. (In 614(1) (a) \"with\" is a typographical error, it should read \"within\" as in s. 593 of the Criminal Code as enacted by 1953-54 (Can.) , c. 51.) The question, in my view, is whether, on an appeal against sentence by the accused, the words \"vary the sentence within the limits prescribed by law\" are to be read as restricted to a variation by way of reduction. Counsel for appellant relied heavily on the judgment of this Court in Rickard ν. The Queen (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 153, 13 D.L.R. (3d) 591, [1970] S.C.R. 1022. It was an appeal in a summary conviction case. At trial, the accused who had been charged with criminal negligence in the operation of his motor vehicle, was convicted of the lesser offence of driving in a manner that was dangerous to the public. On his appeal from this conviction he was, at the end of the trial de noro, convicted of criminal negligence as originally charged. The majority in this Court, reversing the Ontario Court of Appeal, held that, in what is now s. 755(1), the words \"the appeal court shall hear and determine the appeal by holding a trial de noro\" meant in the case of an appeal \"from a conviction\" a determination in respect of such conviction, not in respect of the charge originally laid. Consequently, the Judge hearing the appeal had no power to enter a conviction of the more serious offence originally charged, because the conviction for the lesser included offence involved an acquittal of the more serious offence. There was no provision which, on an appeal by the accused from the conviction for the lesser offence, authorized the Judge hearing such appeal to set aside that acquittal. In my view, this decision on the construction of a different provision concerning appeals from summary convictions is of no assistance in the instant case. It dealt with the meaning of the words \"determine the appeal from a conviction\", while here the words used are \"vary the sentence within the limits prescribed by law\". In my view, those are plain words which fix the scope of the power conferred upon the Court by reference to the maximum applicable penalty, irrespective of the prior decision. I am unable to find any good reason for departing from this plain meaning or for introducing restrictions. A full review of the legislative history of the enactment was made by Laskin, J.A. (as he then was) in his dissenting reasons in R. ν. Willis, [1969] 2 C.C.C.' 84, [1969] 1 O.R. 64, 4 C.R.N.S. 325. Concerning the power to vary mentioned in Rule 503 (Ontario) and in Rule 100 of the Supreme Court of Canada Rules, I cannot, with respect, agree that, without those provisions the power to increase or decrease damages in civil cases, even without a cross-appeal or notice to vary, would exist. In my view, those Rules involve a recognition that the jurisdiction exists to do it and do not create it. Rule 100 reads: RULE 100. It shall not, under any circumstances, be necessary for a respondent to give notice of motion by way of cross-appeal, but if a respondent intends upon the hearing of an appeal to contend that the decision of the court below should be varied, he shall, within fifteen days after the service of the notice of appeal, or such further time as may be prescribed by the Court or a Judge in Chambers, give notice of such intention to all parties who may be affected thereby. The omission to give such notice shall not in any way interfere with the power cf the Court on the hearing of an appeal to treat the whole case as open, but may, in the discretion of the Court, be ground for an adjournment of the appeal or for special order as to costs. I't seems to me that this provision as written clearly implies that, once the case is inscribed in appeal, jurisdiction exists to \"treat the whole case as open\". The giving of notice to vary is only a procedural requirement which can be remedied or waived, if omitted. The same should be said, I think, with respect to the prescribed form for prisoner appeals including this notification [Criminal Appeal Rules (Ont.), Form 13, note II] II. Further take notice that if you appeal from sentence the Court of Appeal may increase your sentence without further notice to you if the Court of Appeal considers the sentence inadequate. Although those Rules and forms cannot have the effect of conferring a jurisdiction which the Courts of appeal would not otherwise have, they ought, I think, to be considered as of great authority in support of the proposition that the jurisdiction does exist. I will also note that decisions similar to that of the Ontario Court of Appeal in the Willis case were rendered by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Christakos (1946), 87 C.C.C. 40, [1947] 2 D.L.R. 151, 1 C.R. 34, and by the Quebec Court of Appeal in Valade v. The Queen (1970), 15 C.R.N.S. 42. If the accused had not been given adequate notice that at the hearing of his appeal, consideration would be given to an increase in his sentence, I would think that the same rule ought to be applied as in Lowry and Lepper v. The Queen (1972), 6 C.C.C. (2d) 531, 26 D.L.R. (3d) 224, [1974] S.C.R. 195, where sentence was passed without hearing submissions. It would have to be held that the accused was not given an opportunity to be heard before the adverse determination was made against him. In this case however, counsel for the Crown made it known prior to the hearing that an increased sentence would be required. This was mentioned in the statement of fact and law filed by the 'Crown on the appeal. Due to this notice, it seems to me that the objection to jurisdiction is based purely on a matter of form. Counsel for the Crown could, under s. 605 (b) apply for leave to appeal against the sentence. The time for making this application is not fixed by law and may be extended at any time by the Court of Appeal under s. 607 as well as Rule 28 (1) of the Supreme Court of Ontario Criminal Appeal Rules. [Rules 10 to 38, since repealed and replaced March 1, 1974.] Even assuming that an application by counsel for the Crown to the Court of Appeal was necessary for directing an increase in sentence, I fail to see what could prevent the Court at the hearing of the appeal from treating the statement of fact and law as a notice of appeal and granting an extension of time, no question could be raised as to counsel's instructions: R. v. Badall (1974), 17 C.C.C. (2d) 420, 47 D.L.R. (3d) 478, [1974] 6 W.W.R. 382. To say that the Court of Appeal lacked jurisdiction because all this was not spelled out in a formal order is, in my view, to treat as going to jurisdiction a purely formal objection. Sometimes, as in Dennis v. The Queen (1958), 121 C.C.C. 129, [1958] S.C.R. 473, 28 C.R. 173, a failure to comply with certain formalities is destructive of jurisdiction, but this is so only when, by law, jurisdiction is made dependent on a particular formality that was omitted. This is not one of those cases as I see it. I would also consider as without substance the objection that, under s. 614 (1) the Court of Appeal may vary the sentence or dismiss the appeal and therefore cannot do both as was done by the formal order in this case. What was intended to be done is abundantly clear: it was to vary the sentence. This cannot be nullified by the superfluous addition of words purporting to dismiss the appeal. It does not appear to me that the construction of s. 514 Cr. Code, can be influenced by consideration of s. 4(3) of the United Kingdom Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, c. 23, which was in the following terms: 4(3) On an appeal against sentence the Court of Criminal Appeal shall, if they think that a different sentence should have been passed, quash the sentence passed at the trial, and pass such other sentence warranted in law by the verdict (whether more or less severe) in substitution therefor as they think ought to have been passed, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal. It must first be noted that the United Kingdom Act gave a right of appeal to the person convicted only, not to the Crown as well. In such a situation, one can readily see why it was deemed necessary to provide explicitly that, on an appeal, the Court would have jurisdiction, not only to decrease, but also to increase the sentence. No such implica- tun ever arose under our Code in which there is a right of appeal by the Crown as well as by the person convicted. It must also be considered that while the sections of our Criminal Code dealing with appeals were, in 1923 generally replaced by verbatim copies of the corresponding provisions of the above-mentioned U.K. Act, such was not the case with respect to the particular provision with which we are here concerned. The right of appeal from sentence by the Crown as well as by the person convicted was preserved. Section 1015 (1) defining the powers of the Court of Appeal on appeals against sentence was a re-enactment of s. 1055A, enacted by 1921 (Can.), c. 25, s. 22, as noted by Laskin, J.A., as he then was, in R. v. Willis supra, at p. 95 C.C.C., p. 73 O.R., it was not copied from s. 4 (3) of the U.K. Act, anymore than present s. 614 was. I should also say that I doubt very much whether, in any case, the omission in an enactment of some words found in a similar enactment of another jurisdiction can ever have the effect of restricting the clear meaning of the words actually used. Would not this imply that words used elsewhere could never be omitted as surplusage? Concerning the propriety of Crown prosecutors, on an appeal from sentence by the accused, requesting an increase without a formal inscription in appeal to that end, I would quote those words of Goddard, L.C.J., spoken on behalf of a Court on which he sat with Lewis, J., and Denning, J. (as he then was) , in R. v. McBain (1946) , 31 Cr. App. R. 113 at pp. 114-5: The appellant was convicted on the clearest possible evidence, and was sentenced to three years' penal servitude. He had not been convicted before. He applied for leave to appeal against both conviction and sentence. The Court refused his application for leave to appeal against conviction, but gave him leave to appeal against sentence for one reason only, in order that it might consider whether or not it should substantially increase his sentence. Hitherto, when this Court has considered an application for leave to appeal against sentence, and has formed the opinion •that the sentence was not severe enough, it has generally warned the applicant that if he persists in his appeal the Court may increase his sentence. This Court no longer intends to take that course. The Criminal Appeal Act, 1907, does not require it, by section 4(3) provides that where a prisoner applies for and obtains leave to appeal against his sentence, this Court, if it thinks that a different sentence should have been passed, shall pass such sentence as it thinks ought to have been passed, whether greater or less than the sentence actually passed. In that case there was no increased sentence. but the benefit of time served pending judgment in appeal was denied. However, three other cases are noted in which a two-year increase was ordered. Two other such cases are noted in the [1962] Crim. L.R. 495, 853. It is true that the United Kingdom Parliament provided by the Criminal Appeal Act, 1968, c. 19, s. 11 (3), that the Court of Appeal shall so exercise their powers that the appellant is not more severely dealt with on appeal than he was dealt with by the Court 'below. However, the Canadian Parliament has not so amended s. 614 (1) Cr. Code, and has not repealed the right of appeal by the Crown against sentence. Inasmuch as counsel for the accused had reasonable notice that an increased sentence was sought and opportunity to be heard on that, as was the case herein as in Willis, every essential of proper judicial conduct was met. On any view of this case, there is no basis for adverse comment against counsel for the Crown or the Court below. I would dismiss the appeal. DICKsoN, J., concurs with SPENCE, J. ΒΕΕΤΖ, J. (dissenting) :— I agree with Mr. Justice Pigeon as to the jurisdiction of this Court to hear this appeal. But I find myself in agreement with Mr. Justice Spence's analysis and construction of s. 614 of the Criminal Code. By virtue of s. 603 (1) (b) and s. 605 (1) (b) , a person convicted by a trial Court and the Attorney-General may both, with leave of the Court of Appeal or a Judge thereof, appeal the sentence passed by the trial Court. The wording of s. 614 reflects both possibilities in a single enactment. However, such economy of words was not, in my view, meant to relieve the Attorney-General from the need to seek leave and, such leave being granted, from actually appealing, merely because a convicted person avails himself of his right to try to have his sentence reduced. Nor does s. 614 give to the Court of Appeal jurisdiction to hear what amounts to an appeal as of right by the Crown where the Code explicitly provides against such a right and where no formal notice was given to the convicted person. Even if failure to observe formalities relating to application for leave, to the granting of leave and to notice may be remedied in time, it was not remedied in this case. I would dispose of this appeal as is proposed by Mr. Justice Spence. DE GRANDPRE, J., concurs with PIGEON, J. Appeal dismissed."}

Buttazzoni, et al, 2015\nONSC 6411 (CanLII).[2]The offenders now must be sentenced for these\nvery serious crimes.Factual Overview[3]A ship transporting a sea container carrying the\ncocaine traveled from Guyana to St. John, New Brunswick, and arrived there on\nMay 28, 2012.The shipment of cocaine was detected and identified by police\nauthorities in St. John, New Brunswick, and a controlled delivery of the\nshipment was undertaken by the police.The cocaine was hidden inside wooden\nplanks in pallets located in the sea container.The container also held a large\nquantity of canned and prepared food products.Following the seizure and\nexamination of the container by police authorities, a small quantity of cocaine\nwas left within the container as part of the controlled delivery.[4]The container was transported by rail from New\nBrunswick to a rail yard in Mississauga, Ontario, where the container was\npicked up and transported to a storage facility.The offender Buttazzoni and\none Lawrence Dalloo, who were found to be co-conspirators in the plan to import\nthe cocaine into Canada, took physical delivery of the shipping container\nholding the pallets at the storage facility in Mississauga.[5]The offender Ramlall, who was engaged in\ncommunications with Dalloo and was found to be a co-conspirator with respect to\nthe plan to import the cocaine into Canada, attended at the storage facility\nwhere he entered the container and examined and counted the pallets.Buttazzoni\nalso entered the container and examined the pallets in the presence of Ramlall.[6]The pallets were subsequently offloaded into a\ntruck and transported from the storage facility to Ramlall’s residence in\nWhitby.Ramlall, as a party to the conspiracy to import cocaine into Canada,\ntook actual possession and control of the pallets upon their delivery to his\nhome, at which time they were placed within the garage.Through the entire\ntime following the delivery of the container to the storage facility in\nMississauga, the offenders, Dalloo, and others were under police surveillance\nand telephone and text intercepts were carried out.[7]A police takedown was conducted at Ramlall’s\nresidence, shortly after which the offenders Ramlall and Buttazzoni were\narrested along with others including Dalloo.[8]A sample of the cocaine that was seized from the\nshipping container was analyzed to be 74% pure.The cocaine, if sold at the\nkilogram level, had a value of approximately $3.9 million and if sold at the\ngram level had a value of approximately $8.9 million.[9]The offenders Buttazzoni and Ramlall were found\nto be co-conspirators with Dalloo. Dalloo pled guilty to the offences of\nimporting cocaine into Canada and possession for the purpose of trafficking.Nelson\nJ., in her reasons on sentence following his plea, imposed a sentence upon\nDalloo of 15 years in penitentiary, concurrent on both charges.[10]The scheme by which the cocaine was transported\nfrom Guyana to Canada was an elaborate and sophisticated one.The cocaine was\nsecreted inside the boards of the wooden pallets.The pallets were placed in\nthe shipping container with a large quantity of canned food products.The\ncontainer was shipped to Canada through the assistance of a legitimate customs\nbroker and the container was destined for delivery to the consignee Moe’s\nIsland Grocery, which for all purposes appears to be a legitimate business in\nMississauga.Legal Frameword[11]Guided by the principles of sentencing as set\nout in ss. 718, 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code and specifically\nrecognizing the fundamental principle of proportionality as set out in s.\n718.1, the sentence to be imposed must be in keeping with the gravity of the\noffence and the degree of the offender’s responsibility.In addition to the\nguiding principles set out in the Criminal Code, a sentencing court must also\ntake into consideration the factors outlined in s. 10 of the Controlled\nDrugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19.[12]The offenders have been found guilty of two most\nserious offences involving an extraordinarily large quantity of cocaine.The\nimpact of cocaine upon our citizens cannot be underestimated.It is a plague\non our community and impacts on all aspects of society by destroying the lives\nof those involved in its use as well as their families.[13]The principles of parity and proportionality of\nsentences must guide the courts in establishing a just and appropriate\nsentence.Rehabilitation of offenders also remains one of the fundamental\nmoral values that must be considered when setting a proper sentence: see R.\nv. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII).[14]In cases involving offences that are\nparticularly serious, in that they cause or threaten to cause significant harm\nto an individual or a segment of the community, the objectives of denunciation\nand general deterrence will usually dominate the other objectives identified in\ns. 718.In the decision R. v. Hamilton (2004), 2004 CanLII 5549 (ON CA), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.),\nDoherty J.A. noted that the importation of dangerous drugs like cocaine has\nalways been considered among the most serious crimes known to Canadian law.He\nfurther stated at para. 104:The use and sale of cocaine kills\nand harms both directly and indirectly. The direct adverse health effects on\nthose who use the drug are enormous and disastrous. Cocaine sale and use is\nclosely and strongly associated with violent crime. Cocaine importation begets\na multiplicity of violent acts. Viewed in isolation from the conduct which\ninevitably follows the importation of cocaine, the act itself is not a violent\none in the strict sense. It cannot, however, be disassociated from its\ninevitable consequences. Unlike the trial judge (para. 224), I characterize\ncocaine importation as both a violent and serious offence: see R. v. Pearson,\n1992 CanLII 52 (SCC), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 665, 77 C.C.C. (3d) 124, at pp. 693 – 96 S.C.R. , pp.143 – 44\nC.C.C.[15]It was further noted in Hamilton, at\npara. 105, that cocaine is not indigenous to Canada and that without the\ncocaine importer, there would be no cocaine problem.[16]Finally, in Hamilton, Doherty J.A.\nemphasized the gravity of the crime of importing cocaine and the need to stress\ndenunciation and deterrence even in the case of vulnerable first offenders.[17]The degree of criminal culpability of the\noffender must be assessed in the course of setting a just and fit sentence,\nparticularly in this case, in terms of the offender’s role in the conspiracy to\nimport and traffic a controlled substance.[18]The appropriate starting point for this\nconsideration is that both offenders were principals in respect of both the\nconspiracy to import cocaine and the possession of the drug for the purpose of\ntrafficking.This is a presumption that can be rebutted by an individual\noffender: see R. v. Holder, 1998 CanLII 14962 (ON SC), [1998] O.J. No. 5102; R. v. Kusi, 2015\nONCA 638 (CanLII).Evidence establishing that the offender played a lesser role in the\noffences in question may be a mitigating factor to be considered on sentencing.However, a finding that the offender was a principal is not to be taken as an\naggravating factor on sentencing.[19]Sentences imposed in cases involving very large\ncocaine importation conspiracies and possession for the purpose of trafficking\nhave been significant, even for first-time offenders, and have recognized the\nneed for general deterrence and denunciation.[20]In R. v. D’Onofrio, 2011 ONSC 195 (CanLII), aff’d\n2013 ONCA 145 (CanLII), Ratushny J. sentenced the offender following a conviction of\npossession of 111.85 kg of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and imposed a\nsentence of 15 years incarceration.Having considered several authorities for\nthe more serious offence of importation of cocaine, the trial judge concluded\nthat the range of sentence for such an offence was 12 to 20 years: see D’Onofrio,\nat para. 27.[21]In its decision in D’Onofrio, it is\nnotable that the Court of Appeal concluded that, although the offender was a\ncourier, given the quantity of cocaine, which is virtually identical to the\nquantity involved in this case, and the offender’s prior record for the same\noffence, the sentence of 15 years was not manifestly outside the appropriate\nrange.[22]In R. v. Ambrose, 1994 CanLII 1378 (ON CA), [1994] O.J. No. 1457\n(C.A.), a case in which three accused were charged with conspiracy to import\nand traffic 22 kg of cocaine, the Court of Appeal upheld sentences of 11 years\nfor two of the offenders and 13 years for the offender who was the lead\nprincipal in the offences.None of the offenders had a criminal record of any\nsignificance.[23]In R. v. Malanca, 2007 ONCA 859 (CanLII), 88 O.R.\n(3d) 570, the offender was convicted of conspiracy to import and importing 270\nkg of cocaine into Canada.He was a first-time offender and approximately 26\nyears of age.The trial judge found him to be one of the principal planners of\nthe importation conspiracy.A life sentence was imposed at trial.However,\nthe sentence was reduced to 19 years on appeal as the Court of Appeal concluded\nthat a life sentence was crushing and left little room for the offender’s\nrehabilitation.[24]As to the offence of possession for the purpose\nof trafficking, Ratushny J. in D’Onofrio at para. 29 concluded,\nfollowing the review of several decisions, that the range of sentences imposed\nfor trafficking was between 10 and 13 years in cases involving significantly\nsmaller quantities of cocaine.[25]In imposing a sentence of 15 years upon Dalloo,\nNelson J. clearly recognized that the sentencing principles that must be\nconsidered are denunciation and deterrence.She concluded that he had a\nsignificant role in the importation scheme and as such the sentence to be\nimposed moved towards the higher part of the range of 12 to 20 years.His plea\nand genuine remorse and the impact of his incarceration on his family were\nconsidered to mitigate the aggravating factors determined.[26]Counsel referred to several decisions from\nOntario, British Columbia and Manitoba provincial, superior and appellate\ncourts.Counsel for the offenders relied upon several decisions involving\ncouriers and large quantities of drugs.Both of the offenders in this case\nwere far more than mere couriers and many of the decisions referred to by their\ncounsel are not apt to the facts in this case.[27]Counsel for the offender Ramlall relied upon the\nCourt of Appeal decision in R. v. Aujla, 2015 ONCA 350 (CanLII), which\ninvolved two offenders who were truck drivers convicted of importing cocaine\nand possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.The cocaine had a\nvalue of $3.5 million and was hidden in the offenders’ truck which they had\nbrought from California and into Canada through Windsor.The trial judge\nsentenced the offenders to 16 and 14 years in penitentiary.[28]On appeal as to sentence in Aujla,\nrecognizing that denunciation and deterrence are the most relevant sentencing\nprinciples to be considered, the Court found that the trial judge erred in\nprinciple and granted leave as to the sentences which were reduced to 12 and 10\nyears.The conviction of one of the offenders was later overturned by the Supreme\nCourt of Canada, but the sentences imposed were not part of that appeal: see R.\nv. Riar, 2015 SCC 50 (CanLII).The result on appeal as to sentence was based on the\nCourt’s conclusion that the trial judge made two errors, firstly by sentencing\nthe accused as if they were high-level importers and secondly by sentencing\nthem on the basis that they had been in a breach of trust.The Court\ndetermined that there was no evidence to support either of these conclusions.[29]The Court of Appeal also noted that the sentences\nwere outside the appropriate range for first-time offenders established in R.\nv. Cunningham (1996), 1996 CanLII 1311 (ON CA), 27 O.R. (3d) 786.Counsel for the offender\nRamlall submits that these principles are apt to the present case.I disagree.As discussed below, neither of the offenders was simply a first-time offender\ncourier.The offender Ramlall was a first-time offender, but acted at a level\nfar above that of a simple courier.Position of the Crown[30]With respect to the offender Buttazzoni, the\nCrown seeks a total sentence of 18 years for the offences of conspiracy to\nimport and to traffic cocaine, less time spent in pre-sentence custody, along\nwith certain ancillary orders.[31]In respect of the offender Ramlall, the Crown\nseeks a sentence of 17 years for the same offences, less time spent in pre-sentence\ncustody, along with the same ancillary orders.Positions of the Offenders[32]It was submitted on behalf of the offender\nButtazzoni that a sentence of 7 to 10 years was appropriate, less time served\nin pre-sentence custody.[33]On behalf of Ramlall, counsel submitted that the\nappropriate sentence would be at the lower end of the sentencing range of 12 to\n20 years as determined in D’Onofrio, less time served in pre-sentence\ncustody and with credit for time spent on house arrest bail.The OffendersA.Buttazzoni[34]Buttazzoni was born July 14, 1971, and as such\nis currently 45 years of age.He is single and has no children.[35]He was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, and\nprior to the offences in question he had resided with his mother and sister in\nthe family home.In the pre-sentence report filed at the sentencing hearing,\nthe author had been advised by Buttazzoni that he had lived in Florida\ntemporarily for the purpose of starting a real estate business, but he returned\nto his family’s home when the business did not take off.[36]Notably absent from the pre-sentence report is\ndisclosure by Buttazzoni of the fact that he was convicted of the offence of\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 100 kg of marijuana,\nthat conviction being registered on January 4, 2008, in the United States\nDistrict Court in West Palm Beach, Florida.The judgment with respect to that\nconviction was entered in evidence at the time of the sentencing hearing.The Court\nsentenced him to a term of 40 months imprisonment followed by a term of\nsupervised release for a period of four years.The supervised release was\nsubject to the following term: “The defendant shall not unlawfully possess a\ncontrolled substance.The defendant shall refrain from any unlawful use of a\ncontrolled substance.The defendant shall submit to one drug test within 15\ndays of release from imprisonment, at least two periodic drug tests thereafter,\nas determined by the court.”[37]The offences which gave rise to the present\nconvictions occurred within the period of Buttazzoni’s period of supervised\nrelease following his discharge from the Florida penitentiary.[38]In the pre-sentence report, the offender advised\nthat he had his high school diploma and that he had completed some courses at\ncollege towards a Business Administration Degree.He also obtained his real\nestate broker’s license and was employed in that field in various real estate\nfirms.Although a release on bail would have been available to him, he\nremained in custody from the time of his arrest in 2012 until December 2015 as\nhe was unable to obtain a suitable surety.He was released in December 2015\nfor approximately five weeks through to the sentencing hearing date, so as to\nallow him to spend time with his mother who was gravely ill with cancer.[39]The offender reported to the probation officer\nwho prepared the pre-sentence report that he did not use either drugs or\nalcohol and made the point that he did not even smoke cigarettes.[40]Several letters of reference were submitted on\nbehalf of Buttazzoni.However the authors of these letters appear to have\nlittle insight, if any, into the life of this offender and as such the letters are\nof little assistance to the Court in setting the appropriate sentence.B.Ramlall[41]Ramlall was born March 4, 1975, in Guyana.He\nis married with two young children.He was raised on a farm with his family in\nGuyana.He has had no prior convictions or involvement with the criminal\njustice system.He emigrated from Guyana to Canada in 2001 and he is currently\nsponsoring his parents as they wish to relocate to Canada as well.The\noffender’s brother resides in Canada, arriving a year or so following the\noffender.[42]Ramlall married his wife in 2004 and although\nboth acknowledge “ups and downs” in their marriage, sources advised the\nprobation officer who prepared the pre-sentence report that the offender is\ncommitted to his family and in particular his two young children.His sons are\nfour and six years of age and reside in the family home with the offender and\nhis wife.He also has a 20 year-old daughter from a previous marriage who\nresides in Guyana.[43]As to his education, he left school at 13 to\nbegin work and through work he acquired various skills on his own.He is\ncurrently self-employed doing renovation work in recent months.At the time of\nhis arrest he owned and operated a used car dealership which he had in business\nfor approximately five years.He has also done work as an unlicensed mechanic\nand was involved in managing a garage.[44]The offender acknowledges that he has consumed\nalcohol occasionally but denies ever using street drugs.[45]His wife described him as very loving and a very\ngood father and stated that he does everything for his boys.The offender’s\ninability to support his family has been troubling for him.In the probation\nofficer’s discussions with the offender, he requested that the author include\nin the report his statement as follows: “I’m sorry for whatever I did. I’m\nwrong. I didn’t know what was going on. I did it, but I didn’t know what was\nhappening. I’m sorry if I hurt anyone, cause problems for police or problems\nfor the community. The way I look at it, if I could have seen this happening, I\nwouldn’t. I didn’t mean to do what I did.”[46]Several reference and character letters were submitted\non behalf of the offender Ramlall, including letters from his brother,\nbrother-in-law, priest and his wife Elana Chavez.His wife described him as\nvery hard-working and as a loving and responsible person who has a very close\nrelationship with his young sons.[47]His surety, his mother-in-law, also submitted a\nreference letter where she described the offender as a most committed father\nand husband and she urges that her grandsons have the opportunity to have their\nfather back with them.[48]On having the opportunity to speak for himself\nduring the sentencing hearing, Ramlall demonstrated what I took to be sincere\nremorse and regret for his actions.He stated he was truly sorry for what he\nhad done and that he did not wish to harm anyone, including his family.He\nspoke of the suffering that his wife and young children will face while he is\nin prison.Analysis[49]In determining a fit and appropriate sentence\nfor the offenders in this case, there are several features of the offenders’\nconduct and the conspiracy plan that must be examined to determine where in the\nrange of sentences the sentence for each offender is located.[50]The conspiracy to import the cocaine was a\nsophisticated one obviously involving significant planning and deliberation as\nevidenced by the intercepted communications, the use of legitimate businesses\nand facilities such as the shipping company, the broker, and the legitimate\nconsignee of the container.Further, the method of hiding the cocaine within\nthe pallets inside the cargo container beneath legitimate food products\ndemonstrates a high level of sophistication and coordination among various\nparties.[51]The type and quantity of drug involved is quite\nextraordinary, namely 112 kg of 74% pure cocaine having a value in 2012 in the\nrange of $3.9 million to $8.9 million.This represents a significant feature\nof the crimes committed that must be taken into account in setting the\nappropriate sentence.Further, the fact that cocaine is not indigenous to\nCanada weighs significantly in the assessment of the seriousness of these\noffences.A.Buttazzoni(a)Mitigating Factors[52]No mitigating factors were identified by either\ncounsel for the offender or the Crown. Counsel for Buttazzoni simply referred\nto the letters of support filed with the court on his behalf.(b)Aggravating Factors[53]As noted above, several aggravating factors are\napplicable equally to the offenders, including the type and quantity of the\nnonindigenous drug and the inherent violent nature of the conspiracy to import\nand traffic cocaine.The aggravating factors which apply specifically to\nButtzzoni include the threats of use of violence by Buttazzoni and his prior\ncriminal record for a significant drug offence in the United States.[54]As to Buttazzoni’s threats of violence, the\nevidentiary record is clear that when he believed that the drug transaction, as\nfar as he and Dalloo were concerned, was in jeopardy, in a telephone\nconversation on June 15, 2012, at 10:39 a.m., Buttazzoni stated to Dalloo:\n“They don’t wanna pay bro. You gotta tell fuckin’ Teddy he’s takin’ a fuckin’\nbullet now, you know what I mean.”B.Ramlall(a)Mitigating Factors[55]The most significant mitigating factor in favor\nof this offender is that he has no prior criminal convictions or involvement\nwith the law.Further, it appears that prior to his involvement in the\nconspiracy to import the cocaine and to traffic it, he was a supportive husband\nand father who was employed and caring for his family.[56]Ramlall appears to have a very supportive family\nwho unfortunately will lose both his financial and emotional support as a\nresult of his incarceration.[57]Ramlall also complied with his house arrest bail\nterms throughout and there are no outstanding charges pending.(b)Aggravating Factors[58]The aggravating factors outlined above with\nrespect to Buttazzoni apply to this offender, other than the outward threats of\nviolence which were expressed by Buttazzoni.The Roles Of the Offenders in the\nOffencesA.Buttazzoni[59]It was urged on behalf of Buttazzoni that on the\nevidentiary record, he was a lower level participant and did not act in any way\nas a lead participant in the conspiracy to import the cocaine.[60]This submission is in no way borne out or\nsupported by the evidence as to Buttazzoni’s involvement in the conspiracy to\nimport, nor in the possession of the cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.[61]Several features of the evidence support the\nCrown’s submission that Buttazzoni had a higher level involvement than simply\nthat of a courier.His involvement in arranging for the container’s safe\ndelivery and the movement of the contents of cocaine were apparent from the\nintercepted text and phone calls commencing on January 12, 2012.[62]The evidence is clear and uncontradicted that\nButtazzoni was actively involved in the transport of the cocaine to the storage\nfacility in Mississauga.He had a significant financial interest in the\ncocaine as evidenced by his discussions with Dalloo, which are set out in my\nreasons for judgment at page 23 as excerpts from the telephone intercepts of\nJune 15, 2012, at 10:39 a.m.In that phone call, Buttazzoni indicates that he\nis concerned that they will not receive their “two hundred grand”.In a\nsimilar vein, throughout many of the intercepts, Buttazzoni refers to he and\nDalloo as “we, us, our” when making reference to their shared interest in the\ncocaine or the proceeds to be received from it.[63]Buttazzoni’s anger and voiced threats of\nshooting “Teddy”, who I have determined is Ramlall, clearly demonstrate a financial\ninterest in the cocaine at a much higher level than simply that of a courier or\nfacilitator.It is particularly notable that when Buttazzoni’s concerns about\nthe drug transaction were increasing, he indicated that he himself would go out\nto Whitby to Ramlall’s residence after the pallets had been transported to that\nlocation.[64]His higher level of involvement is also clearly\ndemonstrated in the regular communication and reporting by Dalloo to him as to\nthe status of the container prior to its delivery to the storage facility,\nupdates as to Dalloo’s communications with persons in Guyana, where the\ncontainer originated from, and his reports to Buttazzoni with respect to the\nstatus of the cocaine after it had been taken to Ramlall’s residence in Whitby.[65]Buttazzoni’s name was also identified as a\ncontact person, along with Dalloo, on the contract documentation for the rental\nof the storage unit in the storage facility where the container was ultimately\ndelivered.Buttazzoni and Dalloo were present at the time the container was\ndelivered to the storage facility.Buttazzoni showed his delight in the\ndelivery of the container by his gestures.[66]After Ramlall arrived at the container on the\nday it was opened, he first entered the container and inspected the pallets,\nfollowed by Buttazzoni.Notably, Dalloo did not enter the container to inspect\nthe pallets.[67]All of this is consistent with Buttazzoni\nparticipating in the conspiracy at a significantly high level of involvement\nand financial interest, well above that of a courier.His level of participation\nand financial interest in the importing and distribution of the cocaine was at\nleast equal to that of Dalloo.The evidence shows that they were working as\npartners with a shared interest in the safe delivery of the cocaine.[68]The role the offender plays in a conspiracy to\nimport cocaine or in respect of possession for the purpose of trafficking\ncocaine cannot constitute an aggravating factor as to sentence.However, if\nthe offender plays a role as a very low end courier, without any involvement in\nthe conspiracy to import or traffic and with compensation unconnected with the\nreal value of the drug, arguably that offender’s criminal culpability would be\nfar less than that of the offender higher up the hierarchy in the conspiracy to\nimport and in the offence of trafficking.There is simply no evidence that\nButtazzoni stands on a lower rung in the hierarchy in this importation\nconspiracy or with respect to the possession for the purpose of trafficking.B.Ramlall[69]Ramlall’s role in the conspiracy to import and\nin the offence of possession for the purpose of trafficking is at the higher\nlevel of the hierarchy of those involved.His criminal culpability is\ndemonstrated by the fact that he had contact with and the trust of those in\nGuyana who were involved in shipping the cocaine to Canada.That level of\ntrust is clearly demonstrated by the fact that the pallets containing the\ncocaine were first inspected and counted by Ramlall upon the opening of the\ncontainer, and thereafter the pallets were taken to his residence in Whitby for\nthe purpose of extracting the cocaine from the pallets.This all demonstrates\na very high level of trust on the part of those in Guyana who arranged for the\ndelivery of the drugs via the container.[70]Notably, the seals on the container were only\nbroken and the doors opened after Ramlall arrived and the numbers on the seals\nwere confirmed to be the same ones as were affixed to the container prior to\nits shipment.Dalloo had been instructed by the Guyanese contact Singh that\nsomeone would come by and verify the seal numbers and that that would be the\nsame person who would be retrieving the pallets.Ultimately, that person was\nthe offender Ramlall.[71]While each of Ramlall, Buttazzoni and Dalloo had\nsome form of participation in the conspiracy to import that may have differed\none from to the other, each was a principal participant and not simply an\nintermediary or courier at the lower end of the hierarchy. Ramlall was the\nultimate recipient of the pallets, it being his assignment to see that the\ncocaine was extracted from the pallets to thereafter facilitate distribution of\nthe cocaine.[72]Apart from his level of criminal culpability,\nhis prospect for successful rehabilitation must also be considered and this was\nacknowledged on behalf of the Crown. Given his status as a first-time offender\nand his sincere remorse as expressed during the sentencing hearing, I believe\nthat this offender has a genuine prospect of turning his life around and that\nhis rehabilitation must also be considered in setting a just and fit sentence.The SentencesA.Buttazzoni[73]Having determined his level of criminal\nculpability in this sophisticated importation conspiracy and cocaine\ntrafficking, involving an extraordinary quantity of cocaine, I have concluded\nthat a just and fit sentence for this offender is 17 years in custody, concurrent\non both offences, less time spent in pre-sentence custody.[74]This sentence meets the fundamental sentencing\nprinciples of denunciation and deterrence and reflects the aggravating factors\noutlined above.[75]This offender was in custody from June 15, 2012\nto December 17, 2015, namely 1281 days.He was then released on strict house\narrest bail for a period of 40 days in order to spend time with his mother who\nwas gravely ill and he returned to custody on January 27, 2016.[76]On March 4, 2016, Tulloch J.A. granted\nButtazzoni a release from custody on strict house arrest bail terms which\nrequired him to surrender back into custody on March 31, the 2016.[77]He therefore has spent an additional 38 days in\npre-sentence custody from January 27 to April 1, 2016, resulting in a total\ntime in pre-sentence custody of 1319 days.[78]On behalf of this offender, credit for time\nserved in pre-sentence custody was sought at a ratio of 1.5:1 in accordance\nwith the decision of the Supreme Court in R. v. Summers, 2014 SCC 26 (CanLII), [2014]\n1 S.C.R. 575. Counsel for the Crown agreed that this was the appropriate\ncredit.[79]Thus the offender shall have credit for\npre-sentence custody of 1979 days.[80]Credit is also sought on behalf of the\noffender for the period of strict house arrest bail from December 17, 2015 to\nJanuary 27, 2016 and from March 4 to March 31 , 2016 which totals 67 days.Exercising\nthe discretion available to me as to credit for time spent on house arrest\nbail, I have determined that 1/5 credit is appropriate in the circumstances and\nthus an additional eight days credit is accorded to the offender.Thus, the\ntotal credit for pre-sentence time spent in custody and under house arrest bail\nis 1993 days or approximately 5 ½ years: see R. v. Downes (2006), 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA), 79\nO.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.).[81]As to items seized from the offender, on his\nconsent, he shall forfeit his cell phone and on the consent of the Crown his\nApple laptop computer shall be returned to him.[82]As to ancillary orders, a s. 109 weapons\nprohibition order shall issue for 10 years and life respectively, in accordance\nwith the terms of that section.Further, given the nature of the offences and\nin keeping with the public interest, I order that the offender Buttazzoni\nprovide a sample of his DNA.B.Ramlall[83]Although, he is a first-time offender, he played\na significant role in the very serious offences of conspiracy to import cocaine\nand to traffic in that drug.While there are several mitigating circumstances\nrelated to this offender, his criminal culpability must be examined having\nregard to deterrence and denunciation as well as parity and proportionality.I\nhave concluded that the just and fit sentence for this offender is 15 years in\ncustody, less time served in pre-sentence custody and house arrest bail.[84]This offender served 13 days in custody prior to his release on\nhouse arrest bail.After applying a 1.5:1 credit for pre-sentence custody he is\ntherefore entitled to 20 days credit for time served.[85]Following the granting of house arrest bail he was subject to\nstrict terms where he was not allowed out of the home to attend work and at no\ntime was he allowed outside the home without his surety.His house arrest bail\nterms were subsequently varied to allow for him to go to and from work.He\ncomplied with all of the terms imposed.Recognizing the impact on his freedom\nand the strict terms placed on him, I have concluded that a 25% credit for the\ntime served under house arrest from June 29, 2012 to April 1, 2016 is\nappropriate: see R. v. Downes.[86]The time spent by the offender under house arrest bail was from\nJune 29, 2012 to the date of sentencing on April 1, 2016, namely 1372 days.I\nhave therefore concluded that in recognition of time spent under house arrest\nbail this offender shall have a credit of 25%, namely 347 days.[87]As to ancillary orders, a s. 109 weapons prohibition order shall\nissue for 10 years and life respectively, in accordance with the terms of that\nsection.Further, given the nature of the offences, I order that the offender\nRamlall provide a sample of his DNA.DALEY RSJ.Released: April 1, 2016CITATION: R. v.

Brown............................................................................................................for\nthe CrownM. Peterson........................................................................for\nthe accused, Darvin ArguetaWATSON J.:[1]Darvin Argueta was found guilty of a number\nof counts in a multi-count information involving a home invasion that occurred\non October 5th, 2011.[1]A summary of the evidence and my findings of fact in relation to the\nparticipation of the defendant in the home invasion are set out in detail in\nthese earlier judgments.[2]The defendant was convicted on the following\ncounts:(a)Count 1 - Break and enterof a\ndwelling-house and committing theoffence ofrobbery contrary to section\n348(1)(b) of the CriminalCode;(b)Count 4 - Unlawfulconfinement of\nSarah Smith contrary tosection 279(2) of the Criminal Code;(c)Count 5 - Unlawfulconfinement of\nDavid Graham contrary tosection 279(2) of the Criminal Code;(d)Count 6 - Unlawfulconfinement of\nBill Viele contrary tosection 279(2) of the Criminal Code;(e)Count 7 - Assaulting BillViele\nwith a weapon, namely a steel pipe,contraryto section 267(a) of the Criminal\nCode;(f)Count 8 - AssaultingDavid Graham\nand thereby causing bodilyharm to David Graham contrary to section 267(b) of\nthe CriminalCode;(g)Count 9 - Robbery of SarahSmith\ncontrary to section 344(1) of theCriminal Code;(h)Count 10 - Robbery of DavidGraham\ncontrary to section 344(1) ofthe Criminal Code;(i)Count 12 - Failing tocomply with\na recognizance prohibiting thepossession of firearms contrary to\nsection 145(3) of the CriminalCode; and(j)Count 13 - Failing tocomply with\na recognizance by being outsideof hisresidence in contravention\nthereof contrary to section 145(3)of the Criminal Code.[3]The defendant was found not guilty on counts\n2 and 3.These counts alleged the offence of pointing a shotgun at Sarah Smith\ncontrary to section 87(2) of the Criminal Code and the offence of possessing\na shotgun without being the holder of a licence permitting such possession and\nwithout being the holder of a registration certificate contrary to section\n91(3) of the Criminal Code.The defendant was found not guilty of these\ncounts the Crown having failed to prove that the gun involved was a firearm as\ndefined by the Criminal Code.I have found, however, that the “gun”\nwielded by the defendant looked like a sawed-off shotgun and the victims had\nevery right to believe that the gun was real.[4]Rider Guerrero, a co-accused in the home\ninvasion, pled guilty to count 9 in the information before another judge.Rider Guerrero’s plea was to the offence of robbery while armed with a weapon,\nnamely a shotgun.According to the information Rider Guerrero has a date\nof birth of August 2, 1986.Rider Guerrero has a lengthy and related criminal\nrecord, which was marked as Exhibit 2 on this sentencing.His criminal record includes\na prior conviction for armed robbery in 2007 for which he was sentenced to two\nyears plus one day in the penitentiary.Rider Guerrero was sentenced to 7\nyears and 11 months custody in addition to 201 days of pre‑trial\ncustody credited on a 2:1 basis.[5]The offence date of this home invasion\npre-dates the amendments to section 719 of the Criminal Code which\nplace limitations on the amount of credit that may be given for pre‑sentence\ncustody.The Crown however argues that the pre-trial custody ought\nnevertheless to be calculated on a 1:1 basis because at the time of the home\ninvasion, the defendant was bound by a recognizance of bail. The defendant was\nconvicted of two counts of being in breach of this recognizance, counts 12 and 13.The Crown also notes that the allegations for which the defendant was granted\nbail were similar to the offences before this court for which he was found\nguilty.I am advised these alleged offences are still outstanding.The\ndefendant has no criminal record and has a date of birth of January 7, 1985.In my view, given that he was 24 years of age at the time of the home invasion\nand has no criminal record, he is to be viewed as a youthful first offender at\nthis sentencing.[6]A pre-sentence report was ordered and marked\nas Exhibit 1.The defendant was born in Guatemala.His parents immigrated to\nCanada in the late 1980’s.He and his four siblings were left in the care of\nhis grandparents in Guatemala.He and his siblings then immigrated to Canada\nin 1997 and settled in St. Catharines.He attended grades 7 to 11 in\nSt. Catharines, having left school partway through his grade 11 year.He\nmoved out on his own at age 19.Although he was in a common-law relationship\nfor two years, he is currently single and without children. The defendant had\nreturned to an adult education learning centre at the time he was charged with\nthe offences before this court.[7]The defendant has worked at various jobs and\nwas working for his parents as well prior to his incarceration. He reports he\nwould like to return to school and finish his high school education and then\nstudy auto mechanics.[8]The defendant denies that he had\nexperimented with “mushrooms” in high school as set out in the pre-sentence\nreport.Indeed he denies that he has any issues regarding substance abuse and\ndenies that he has used drugs.The only other correction the defendant made to\nthe pre‑sentence report was concerning his relationship with his\nco-accused Rider Guerrero who he described as one of his only two friends in\nthe report.He indicated that his co-accused was an acquaintance only since\nhis co-accused was in and out of prison over a number of years.[9]The home invasion in this case was related\nto the drug subculture.The victims were ones of mistaken identity.The\ndefendant and his co-accused clearly believed that an individual named “Joe”\nwas living at the location where the home invasion took place and that he would\nbe in possession of money and drugs.The defendant’s denial that he is a user\nof drugs does not absolve him from involvement in the local drug subculture.If he was not a user of drugs, then the only reasonable inference on the\nevidence that I have heard is that he would stand to profit financially from\nhis actions.[10]The Crown filed a victim impact statement\nfrom the victim Sarah Smith, marked as Exhibit 4 on the sentencing hearing.The other two victims, David Graham and Bill Viele, declined their opportunity\nto provide victim impact statements.Sarah Smith outlines in some detail the\nimpact the home invasion has had on her and continues to have on her.The home\ninvasion occurred at a vulnerable time in her life which was also a time in her\nlife when things were finally turning around for her.She continues to be\ntraumatized by the events and continues to live with, as she put it, “one eye\nalways over my shoulder.”She feared for her life during the home invasion,\nwhich was on the evidence called, a reasonably held fear.All three victims\nwere terrorized and both Bill Viele and David Graham were the victims of\ngratuitous violence perpetrated by the co‑accused Rider Guerrero when he\nstruck them with a pipe when they were already down on the floor.Although\nthere was nothing in the evidence to suggest that the defendant ordered the\nco-accused to strike them, it was the defendant who ordered them down on the\nfloor in the living room while wielding the gun.Some of the defendant’s words\nhighlight the terror in the apartment.It was, according to the defendant,\n“going to be a graveyard.”[11]The Crown’s position regarding sentence is\nthat the appropriate range of sentence is one of six to eight years less credit\nfor pre-trial custody on a 1:1 basis.The defence position regarding sentence\nis that the appropriate range of sentence is one of three to five years less\ncredit for pre-trial custody on a 2:1 basis.The defendant has been in custody\nsince January 7, 2010 and as of the date of this sentencing will have been in\ncustody 663 days or approximately 22 months.It can be seen that the\nissue of the appropriate calculation for pre-sentence custody is critical at\nthis sentencing.As noted earlier, Rider Guerrero was given credit for his\npre-trial custody on a 2:1 basis, noting however that unlike the defendant he\nwas not on a form of release at the time the home invasion occurred.Pre-Trial Custody Calculation[12]The defendant did not apply for bail and has\nremained in custody since his arrest on these charges, as indicated earlier\napproximately 22 months.It is submitted by the defence that the reason that\nthe defendant did not apply for bail was because of the remote possibility that\nhe would be released given that he was already out on bail on similar charges\non a surety release with terms approaching a house arrest.As such, although\nhe had technically not been detained after a bail hearing, I accept that the\nreality of the situation was that any further release was highly unlikely given\nthe serious nature of the charges.[13]The predecessor section 719(3) of the Code\nin force at the time the offence was committed reads as follows:719(3)In determining the sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of an offence,\na court may take into account any time spent in custody by the person as a\nresult of the offence.[14]This section was considered by the Supreme\nCourt of Canada in R. v. Wust, 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII), [2000] S.C.J. No. 19.At paras. 44 and\n45, Arbour J., speaking for the Court writes as follows:D.Calculating the Amount of Credit for\nPre-sentence Custody44I see no advantage in detracting from the well-entrenched\njudicial discretion provided in s. 719(3) by endorsing a mechanical\nformula for crediting pre-sentencing custody. As we have re-affirmed in this\ndecision, the goal of sentencing is to impose a just and fit sentence,\nresponsive to the facts of the individual offender and the particular\ncircumstances of the commission of the offence. I adopt the reasoning of Laskin\nJ.A., supra, in Rezaie, supra, at p. 105, where he noted that:... provincial appellate courts have\nrejected a mathematical formula for crediting pre-trial custody, instead\ninsisting that the amount of time to be credited should be determined on a case\nby case basis... . Although a fixed multiplier may be unwise, absent\njustification, sentencing judges should give some credit for time spent in\ncustody before trial (and before sentencing). [Citations omitted.]45In the past, many judges have given more or less two\nmonths credit for each month spent in pre-sentencing detention. This is\nentirely appropriate even though a different ratio could also be applied, for\nexample if the accused has been detained prior to trial in an institution where\nhe or she has had full access to educational, vocational and rehabilitation\nprograms. The often applied ratio of 2:1 reflects not only the harshness of the\ndetention due to the absence of programs, which may be more severe in some\ncases than in others, but reflects also the fact that none of the remission\nmechanisms contained in the Corrections and Conditional Release Act apply to\nthat period of detention. \"Dead time\" is \"real\" time. The\ncredit cannot and need not be determined by a rigid formula and is thus best\nleft to the sentencing judge, who remains in the best position to carefully\nweigh all the factors which go toward the determination of the appropriate\nsentence, including the decision to credit the offender for any time spent in\npre-sentencing custody.[15]More recently in R. v. Monje, 2011 ONCA 1 (CanLII), [2011]\nO.J. No. 1, LaForme J.A. writing for the Ontario Court of Appeal states at paras.\n14 to 18 inclusive as follows:14Here we are concerned with the rules that were in\nplace on November 12, 2009 when the appellant was sentenced. At the time,\nappellate courts had not set down any fixed formula, although it was generally\naccepted that trial courts should give more than 1:1 credit for pre‑sentence\ncustody. This was in recognition of the circumstances that in most cases are\npresent pre-sentence custody.15Laskin J.A. in R. v. Rezaie (1997), 1996 CanLII 1241 (ON CA), 31 O.R.\n(3d) 713 (C.A.), at p. 721, described the approach that a sentencing judge\nshould take:Although [s. 721(3) of the Criminal Code]\nis discretionary, not mandatory, in my view a sentencing judge should\nordinarily give credit for pre-trial custody. At least a judge should not deny\ncredit without good reason. To do so offends one's sense of fairness.\nIncarceration at any stage of the criminal process is a denial of an accused's\nliberty.16As a general rule, trial courts gave 2:1 credit for\npre-sentence custody and occasionally enhanced credit where the circumstances\nunder which the offender spent his or her time had been particularly onerous. I\nwould also note however, that in some cases less than 2:1 credit was given.17Giving\nextra credit for pre-sentence custody was the practice in order to take into\naccount certain circumstances. These generally included lack of programming or\nactivities, overcrowding, and the fact that, unlike time spent in post-sentence\ncustody, pre-sentence custody does not count towards a prisoner's eligibility\nfor full parole or statutory release. As Laskin J.A. observed at p. 721 of Rezaie,\nthis is the reason that pre-sentence custody is commonly referred to as\n\"dead time\".18I would note parenthetically that, to the extent that\nthe recently legislated \"new rules\" concerning credit for\npre-sentence custody limit an offender's entitlement to credit on a 2:1 basis,\nthe reality of what \"dead time\" is remains. That is, pre-sentence\ncustody continues to be \"dead time\" for the same reasons Laskin J.A.\nnoted in Rezaie and remains as one of the most punitive forms of imprisonment\nin Canada.[16]Even more recently in R. v. C.T.W.,\n[2011] O.J. No. 4092, the Ontario Court of Appeal in brief oral reasons stated\nin part as follows:2Sentencing in this case took place before the\namendments to s. 719 of the Criminal Code limiting the amount of credit\nfor pre-trial custody. Moreover, when he sentenced the appellant, the trial\njudge did not have the benefit of this court's decision in R. v. Monje,\n2011 ONCA 1 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 1. In that case, LaForme J.A. for this panel, wrote\nthat parole ineligibility is a relevant consideration in assessing credit for\npre-trial custody. Thus, in refusing to consider the unavailability of parole\nwhen he assessed the credit to be given to the appellant for his pre-trial\ncustody, the trial judge erred. In Monje we increased the credit to 2:1\nand we do so here. Giving 2:1 credit the appellant has now effectively served\nhis sentence.[17]The Crown argues that the defendant has\ndisqualified himself from the benefit of enhanced credit given that he was on\nthe highest form of release, a surety recognizance, at the time that he\nre-offended.The Crown submits that not only was he the author of his own\nre-incarceration but he flagrantly breached the conditions imposed upon him.[18]The Crown references the case of R. v.\nMultani, [2009] O.J. No. 5623 (S.C.J.).In this decision Fuerst J.\nexamined the pre-sentence credit to be accorded to a defendant who after being\nreleased from custody on charges of criminal negligence causing death while\nstreet racing breached his recognizance and was returned into custody as a\nresult.I note that the defendant in this case, like the offender before this\ncourt, had no previous criminal record and was youthful.Madam Justice Fuerst\nwrites as follows at paras. 54 and 55:54If Mr. Multani had simply remained in custody until\nhis sentencing, I would extend him 2 for 1 credit for the duration. He was\nreleased on bail, however, and given the opportunity to remain at large pending\ndisposition of the criminal negligence charge. Notwithstanding the seriousness\nof that outstanding charge, he jeopardized his bail status by his own actions.\nHe committed repeated breaches of the condition requiring him to report to the\npolice weekly. He breached a constellation of conditions imposed to protect the\npublic by preventing him from driving a motor vehicle. His reincarceration\noccurred because of his flagrant violation of important conditions designed to\nensure his good conduct and to protect society. While he is entitled to credit\nfor his time in pre-sentencing custody, would not be appropriate in these\ncircumstances to grant him full 2 for 1 credit: see, R. v. Warren, 1999 CanLII 2205 (ON CA), [1999] O.J.\nNo. 4591 (Ont. C.A.).55I extend him 2 for 1 credit for the 67 days that the\njail was in total lockdown. I also extend him 2 for 1 credit for the 12 days of\ndetention that followed his initial arrest. Accordingly, I treat his\npre-sentencing custody as the equivalent of 13 months.[19]The Crown also referred to the Warren\ndecision referenced by Madam Justice Fuerst.Noting that the appellant was\nheld in custody before trial because of his repeated violations of the terms of\ntwo recognizances of bail, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that the trial\njudge was not in error in refusing to give a full 2:1 credit for the pre-trial\ncustody.The Court of Appeal states at para. 7 of the endorsement:7It will be seen that the appellant was repeatedly\nreleased in the period from 1994 to 1997 and that he violated the terms of his\nrelease on many occasions. These were flagrant violations of important terms\ndesigned to protect society and ensure the good conduct of the appellant until\nthese serious charges could be dealt with. In the circumstances, we are not\npersuaded that the trial judge erred in principle in refusing to give full two‑for-one\ncredit for the pre-trial custody. The appellant had been given every\nopportunity to remain at large so that he would not suffer the prejudice from\npre-trial custody. By his own actions, he jeopardized his bail status and\nultimately he had to be detained pending his trial. Like the trial judge, we\nwould not refuse to give the appellant any credit for pre-trial custody.\nHowever, in the circumstances we cannot say that it was an error in principle\nfor the trial judge to refuse to give a full two-for-one credit.[20]In R. v. Francis, 2006 CanLII 10203 (ON CA), [2006] O.J. No.\n1287, the Ontario Court of Appeal comments on two factors which may justify a\ndeparture from giving 2:1 credit for pre-trial custody at para. 23 as follows:23Two\nof the factors articulated at p. 211 in Pangman, supra, as justifying a\ndeparture from giving 2-for-1 credit for pre-sentence custody that are relevant\nhere are: (1) whether the incarceration history of the accused indicates that\nthe accused is unlikely to obtain early parole; and (2) whether the accused is\nseen to pose a serious danger to society. Similarly, in R. v. Mills\n(1999), 1999 BCCA 159 (CanLII), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 451 at para. 48 (B.C.C.A.), the court commented that it\nwould be inappropriate to give double time to an accused with a bad record who\nwould not get parole because \"the accused would obtain compensation for a\nloss he is unlikely to suffer.\" At the same time the court noted that\nsince very few inmates are held beyond their statutory release date, or\ntwo-thirds of their sentence, the sentencing judge \"may properly consider\ngiving more than straight time.\" See also R. v. Young (2004), 2004 MBCA 69 (CanLII), 186\nC.C.C. (3d) 219 at para. 20 (Man. C.A.), which is to the same effect.[21]I note that the appellant in the Francis\ndecision appears to have had a significant criminal record.[2][22]The Crown also referenced the Manitoba Court\nof Appeal decision in R. v. Young, 2004 MBCA 69 (CanLII), [2004] M.J. No. 188, wherein the\nagreed facts set out that the accused had shared conditions identical to\ninmates serving sentences at an institution where a full range of programming\nand educational opportunities were available.The Court held that a useful\nguide in that case was 1.5:1 for pre-sentence custody in circumstances where\nthe harshness of the pre-sentence custody is not a factor.This is not however\nto be considered a rigid or precise mathematical one.[3][23]I note that although the harshness of the\npre-sentence custody was not argued specifically in the case before me, the\ndefendant would have been lodged for some portion if not all of his\npre-sentence detention at the local Niagara Detention Centre which does not\nhave programs and educational opportunities equivalent to other provincial and\nfederal detention centres where sentences are ultimately served.[24]The fact that the defendant was on judicial\ninterim release at the time the offences were committed, is one factor that\nmust be assessed in light of the law regarding pre-sentence custody and all of\nthe other relevant factors.In determining the appropriate credit for pre‑sentence\ncustody I have considered the following factors:(a)The pre-sentence custody served by the defendant does not count\ntowards his eligibility for parole or statutory release.(b)The pre-sentence custody in this case is substantial.(c)Much of the pre-sentence custody was necessitated as a result of adjournments\npending submissions and judgments on the evidence called.To that regard the\nevidence concluded on March 18, 2011.(d)The youthful age of the defendant who has been detained locally for\nsome if not all of his pre-sentence detention at the Niagara Detention Centre,\na place where the programming and educational opportunities are not as readily\navailable as at other places of detention where custodial sentences are served.(e)The defendant was on judicial interim release and subject to strict\nterms at the time that these offences occurred.(f)The defendant will be sentenced to consecutive sentences of\nimprisonment for the two breaches of the judicial interim release order arising\nout of the circumstances of the offences committed.(g)Given the defendant’s lack of a criminal record, the incarceration\nhistory of the defendant does not necessarily suggest that he would be an unlikely\ncandidate for early release.(h)The co-accused Rider Guerrero was afforded a pre-sentence custody\ncalculation on a 2:1 basis notwithstanding his serious and related criminal\nrecord.(i)The Ontario Court of Appeal has reaffirmed the reality of pre‑sentence\ncustody in examining the post amendments to section 719 of the Code\nas remaining “one of the most punitive forms of imprisonment in Canada.”[4][25]Having regard to all of the relevant factors\nand noting that I will be sentencing the defendant to consecutive sentences of\nimprisonment for breaching his recognizance, the pre-sentence custody will be\ncredited on a 1.8:1 basis for his time spent in custody to the conclusion of\nthe evidence and a 2:1 basis from the conclusion of the evidence to the date of\nsentencing.Sentencing Case Law for Home\nInvasion and General Principles of Sentencing[26]The Crown has made reference to a number of\ncases in support of the Crown position that a sentence in the range of six to\neight years custody is appropriate with emphasis on the upper end of that\nrange.[27]In R. v. Wright, 2006 CanLII 40975 (ON CA), [2006] O.J. No.\n4870, the Ontario Court of Appeal recognizes that home invasion is a serious,\nand increasingly prevalent, crime in our society. [5]I note that the crime of home\ninvasion has become increasingly prevalent over the last several years in the\nNiagara Region where it is often associated with the drug subculture.In R.\nv. Wright, supra, the Ontario Court of Appeal examines the issue of\nthe appropriate “range” of sentence for offences involving home invasions.Blair J.A. writing for the Court states at paras. 23 and 24 set out below:23The cases to which we have been referred, and which my\nown research has uncovered, reflect a gamut of sentencing dispositions in\n\"home invasion\" cases from as low as four or five years,7 to as high as eleven to thirteen years8 - with the suggestion that even higher sentences may\nbe reserved for situations involving kidnapping, the infliction of serious\ninjuries, sexual assault or death.9\nWhether a \"range\" of that elasticity is of much assistance to trial\njudges in their efforts to preserve sentencing parity for similar offences\ninvolving similar offenders - apart from signalling that a significant\npenitentiary jail term is generally called for - is not clear to me. The\ndownside of attempting to articulate a range for a type of crime that can\nmanifest itself in such a wide variety of ways, and be committed by such a wide\nvariety of individuals, is that the \"range\" becomes so broad, it is\nvirtually meaningless. Nonetheless, to the extent there can be said to be a\nrange in home invasion cases, it would appear that the one that currently\nexists is the expansive one outlined above. [Footnotes omitted.]24In my view, however, \"home invasion\" cases\ncall for a particularly nuanced approach to sentencing. They require a careful\nexamination of the circumstances of the particular case in question, of the\nnature and severity of the criminal acts perpetrated in the course of the home\ninvasion, and of the situation of the individual offender. Whether a case falls\nwithin the existing guidelines or range - or, indeed, whether it may be one of\nthose exceptional cases that falls outside the range and results in a moving of\nthe yardsticks - will depend upon the results of such an examination. I agree\nwith the British Columbia Court of Appeal in A.J.C. (at para. 29),\nhowever, that in cases of this nature the objectives of protection of the public,\ngeneral deterrence and denunciation should be given priority, although of\ncourse the prospects of the offender's rehabilitation and the other factors\npertaining to sentencing must also be considered. Certainly, a stiff\npenitentiary sentence is generally called for.[28]In R. v. Wright, supra, the\nCourt of Appeal upheld a sentence of eight years imprisonment in circumstances\ninvolving a home invasion wherein a small business owner and his family were\nheld captive by five men, armed with handguns and wearing gloves and\ndisguises.The motive was to facilitate access to a safe at the victim’s\nstore.During the course of the home invasion threats were made to the life of\nthe business owner within earshot of his 11 year old son and an older\ndaughter.The defendant pled guilty to being one of the robbers.He was 27\nyears of age with a prior criminal record involving three convictions for theft\nunder $5,000.00 (one as a youth), one conviction for attempted theft under\n$5,000.00, and one conviction for failure to attend court.His convictions\nwere somewhat dated.The trial judge was impressed by the appellant’s remorse\nand prospects for rehabilitation. The Court of Appeal took note that the victim\nhad been targeted, forcibly confined and terrorized at gunpoint. As well the\nordeal lasted over 45 minutes.The sentences of two of the other perpetrators\nwere ones of 11 and 12 years (both of whom had more significant criminal records).In the circumstances of this case, the Ontario Court of Appeal viewed the\neight-year sentence imposed to be wholly appropriate.[29]The Crown’s submission is that if the lowest\nend of an appropriate “range” of sentence is four to five years as referenced\nin the case law, then given the egregious facts in the case before me, the\nsentence falls within a range of six to eight years.I am further invited by\nthe Crown in the case before me to find that it was the defendant and not Rider\nGuerrero who appeared to be in control of the home invasion.He had the gun\nand held it as if prepared to shoot while he directed orders to the victims.Rider Guerrero however inflicted actual injury to two of the victims.The\ninjuries inflicted amounted to gratuitous violence noting that there was no\nneed for him to hit the two men with the pipe.The two men were already on the\nfloor and complying with the demands of the defendant.I note, however, that\nthe defendant did not order Rider Guerrero to hit the victims with the metal\npipe.In my view, both Rider Guerrero and the defendant were equal participants\nin this crime.[30]One of the offences for which the defendant\nis being sentenced is the offence of breaking and entering of a dwelling-house\nand committing the offence of robbery.Section 348.1 states:348.1 Aggravating circumstance – home invasion - If a person is convicted of an offence\nunder section 98 or 98.1, or subsection 279(2) or section 343, 346, or 348 in\nrelation to a dwelling-house, the court imposing the sentence on the person\nshall consider as an aggravating circumstance the fact that the dwelling-house\nwas occupied at the time of the commission of the offence and that the person,\nin committing the offence,(a)knew that or was reckless as to whether the\ndwelling-house was occupied; and(b)used violence or threats of violence to a\nperson or property.[31]I have further considered the principles and\nobjectives of sentencing set out in sections 718, 718.01, 718.02, 718.1 and\n718.2 of the Criminal Code:Principles and objectives of sentencing718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute,\nalong with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the\nmaintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions\nthat have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons\nfrom committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where\nnecessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to\nvictims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in\noffenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.718.01 When a court imposes a sentence for an offence\nthat involved the abuse of a person under the age of eighteen years, it shall\ngive primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence of\nsuch conduct.718.02 When a court imposes a sentence for an offence\nunder subsection 270(1), section 270.01 or 270.02 or paragraph 423.1(1)(b), the\ncourt shall give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and\ndeterrence of the conduct that forms the basis of the offence.718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity\nof the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take\ninto consideration the following principles:(a)a sentence should be increased or reduced\nto account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to\nthe offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the\nforegoing,(i)evidence that the offence was motivated by\nbias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language,\ncolour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation,\nor any other similar factor,(ii)evidence that the offender, in committing\nthe offence, abused the offender’s spouse or common-law partner,(ii.1)evidence that the offender, in committing\nthe offence, abused a person under the age of eighteen years,(iii)evidence that the offender, in committing\nthe offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim,(iv)evidence that the offence was committed for\nthe benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal\norganization, or(v)evidence that the offence was a terrorism\noffence shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;(b)a sentence should be similar to sentences\nimposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar\ncircumstances;(c)where consecutive sentences are imposed,\nthe combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;(d)an offender should not be deprived of\nliberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances;\nand(e)all available sanctions other than\nimprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for\nall offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal\noffenders.[32]The principle of parity of sentences is set\nout above in section 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code.In R. v. Mann,\n2010 ONCA 342 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 1924 (C.A.), MacPherson J.A. states at para. 17 as\nfollows:17While parity is a guiding principle of sentencing, it\nis not, as stated by this court in R. v. Miller (J.) (2002), 2002 CanLII 45072 (ON CA), 163 O.A.C.\n63, at para. 9, to be applied in an absolute fashion: \"parity is only one\nof a number of principles that must be taken into consideration in imposing an\nappropriate sentence, and it cannot in and of itself dictate the result in all\ncases involving similar offenders committing similar crimes\". In R. v.\nL.M., 2008 SCC 31 (CanLII), [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, at para. 36, the Supreme Court of Canada\nexpressed a similar view: \"Owing to the very nature of an individualized\nsentencing process, sentences imposed for offences of the same type will not\nalways be identical. The principle of parity does not preclude disparity where\nwarranted by the circumstances, because of the principle of\nproportionality\" (emphasis in original).[33]One of the factors that may be considered in\nassessing sentence parity between co‑accused is a plea of guilt.Indeed\nin R. v. Mann, supra, the co-accused’s early guilty plea together\nwith the more serious criminal record of the appellant were considered relevant\nin justifying the substantially different sentences imposed by the trial judge\nin that case.In upholding a 12-year sentence, the Court of Appeal referenced\nthe range of sentence earlier set out by the Court in R. v. Wright, supra,\nas four to five years at the low end and up to 11 to 13 years at the high\nend, recognizing again that priority should be given to the sentencing\nobjectives of deterrence and denunciation in cases of home invasion.[34]In R. v. Jacko, 2010 ONCA 452 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 2583 (Ont.\nC.A.), the defendants who were youthful aboriginal offenders, appealed their\nsentences of four years imprisonment imposed following convictions involving a\nhome invasion.A sentencing circle had recommended that their sentences be\nserved in the community.Both offenders had criminal records.One of the\noffenders who was not before the court, used a weapon.On appeal, the appeals\nwere allowed and the appellant Jacko was sentenced to a conditional sentence of\ntwo years less one day and Manitowabi was sentenced to two years less one day\nas his efforts at rehabilitation had not been persistent or consistent.The\nCourt of Appeal was concerned that the trial judge did not accord sufficient\nweight to the defendant’s aboriginal heritage and the sentencing objectives of\nrestorative justice.The trial judge also made an error in principle in\nexcluding the conditional sentence regime because of the paramount sentencing\nobjectives being those of deterrence and denunciation.Watt J.A. writing for\nthe Court states at paras. 82 and 89-90 as follows:82And finally, the trial judge appears to have treated\nthe range of sentence discussed in R. v. Wright (2006), 2006 CanLII 40975 (ON CA), 216 C.C.C. (3d)\n54 (Ont. C.A.) as imposing a de facto minimum sentence for these\noffences, despite the prosecutor's apparent acknowledgement of the adequacy of\na two-year sentence. To consider guidelines as constituting a de facto\nminimum sentence is inconsistent with the fundamental principle of\nproportionality, and amounts to either judicial creation of a category of\nexcluded offences or a presumption that conditional sentences are inappropriate\nfor certain offences. Both are wrong.. . . . .89Third, while our decision in Wright and cases\nfollowing its lead describe a range of sentence for \"home invasion\"\ncases, it is clear from Wright itself that these cases require an\nespecially nuanced approach to sentencing that involves a careful examination\nof the circumstances of the case at hand, of the nature and severity of the\noffenders' conduct and the circumstances of each offender involved in the offences:\nWright at para. 24.90Sentencing \"ranges\", such as that described\nin Wright, are not immovable or immutable. They are and represent\nguidelines, of greater or lesser utility depending upon the breadth of the\nrange. Individual cases may fall within or outside the range. To consider a\nrange of sentence as creating a de facto minimum sentence misses the\npoint, ignores the fundamental principle of proportionality and is not faithful\nto the teachings of Wright itself. Individual circumstances matter.[35]In submitting that the appropriate range of\nsentence is one of three to five years custody, counsel for the defendant\nplaces particular emphasis on case law regarding the sentencing of youthful\nfirst offenders and the first sentence of imprisonment.[6]Clearly the absence of a\ncriminal record is a significant factor which must be considered not only with\nrespect to issues of parity but also concerning the defendant’s prospects for\nrehabilitation.The absence of any record, noting that the defendant has been\nresiding in Canada for many years, is a factor favouring his prospects for\nrehabilitation.The defendant’s co-accused has a lengthy and serious criminal\nrecord which includes a prior conviction for armed robbery.Disparity in\nsentencing is clearly justified.[36]Counsel for the defendant referred the court\nto the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in R. v. Q.B., 2003 CanLII 4187 (ON CA), [2003] O.J. No.\n354.In this case the appellant was sentenced in totality to five years and\ntwo months custody (in addition to 31 months of pre-trial custody) following\nhis plea of guilt to offences of possession of a loaded restricted weapon,\naggravated assault and using a firearm in the commission of an offence.The\nappellant was only 18 years old when he committed the offences and was\nsentenced when he was 19.He had a substantial youth court record including\ncrimes of violence.The Court of Appeal reduced the sentence imposed because\nhe was only 18 at the time the offences were committed to four years and two\nmonths (in addition to the pre-trial custody).Rosenberg J.A. writing for the\nCourt states at para. 36 as follows:36Aside from the gravity of the appellant's crimes, the\noverwhelming factor is his youth. In my view, the trial judge erred in\nprinciple in focusing almost exclusively on the objectives of denunciation and\ngeneral deterrence, given the appellant's age and that this was his first adult\nprison sentence and his first penitentiary sentence. The length of a first\npenitentiary sentence for a youthful offender should rarely be determined\nsolely by the objectives of denunciation and general deterrence. Where, as\nhere, the offender has not previously been to penitentiary or served a long\nadult sentence, the courts ought to proceed on the basis that the shortest\npossible sentence will achieve the relevant objectives. The trial judge's\nrepeated references to the need to send a message and his statement that the\nsentence was meant to deter others who resort to guns make it clear that\ngeneral deterrence and to a less extent denunciation determined the length of\nthe sentence. In my view, this error led the trial judge to impose an excessive\nsentence for the aggravated assault.[37]The pre-sentence report does not however\nsupport a finding that the defendant is immature for his age.It is not just\nthe chronological age of an offender but also an offender’s level of maturity\nthat should be considered when assessing an appropriate sentence for a youthful\noffender.[7]Although the defendant is chronologically youthful, there is nothing in the\npre-sentence report to suggest that he is immature for his chronological age.In other words, having regard to the principles of sentencing involving\nyouthfuloffenders, had the defendant been an immature 18 year old at the time\nthat this offence was committed, instead of a mature 24 year old, my view of\nthe appropriate sentence might have been different from the sentence that will\nbe imposed on the defendant.[38]Counsel for the defendant has referenced the\nOntario Court of Appeal decision in R. v. Tran, 2010 ONCA 471 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 2785,\nwherein three appellants appealed their convictions and sentences for findings\nof guilt after trial of two counts of conspiracy to commit armed robbery.The\narmed robberies that did occur were described as violent home invasions.They\nwere committed because the perpetrators believed the victims were drug dealers\nwho owed them money.Wearing masks and armed with guns and knives, they forced\ntheir way into the homes in the early hours of the morning.They used plastic\ntie wraps to bind the residents by their wrists and ankles.It was noted as\nfollows at para. 13 of the judgment:13.The perpetrators inflicted significant abuse\nupon some of the victims, including:1.confining an elderly\nwoman and telling her she would be shot if something went wrong;2.using a knife to carve\na dollar sign into a man's back and to try to cut off his finger;3.beating a woman and\ncutting her clothing to force her to give up her diamond ring;4.grabbing an eight-year\nold, pushing her down, telling her to say goodbye to her parents, and\nthreatening the child's parents that they would take her unless all their money\nwas handed over; and5.sexually assaulting a\nwoman by placing a gun in her mouth while digitally penetrating her vagina, and\nby placing a gun in her vagina.[39]Tran had been subjected to a gratuitous\nbeating by the police which was described as horrendous police misconduct that\nbreached Tran’s sections 7 and 12 Charter rights.On appeal the charges\nagainst him were stayed.As to the sentence appeal that remained, one\nappellant having chosen not to pursue a sentence appeal, the sentence of four\nyears imposed on Dang was upheld.I note that the appellants in this case were\nfound guilty of conspiracy but were acquitted of the substantive charges.[40]I was also referred to a decision of the\nNewfoundland and Labrador Supreme Court, Trial Division-General Division in R.\nv. Manuel, [2010] N.J. No. 360.Whalen J. sentenced the offender to six\nand one-half years less pre-trial custody of two years, therefore the sentence\nwas one of four and one-half years’ imprisonment which had been submitted by\nway of a joint submission.The defendant Manuel had pled guilty to breaking\nand entering a private dwelling-home, assault and robbery charges.The\ndefendant was 28 years old with no criminal record.The victim, an 88 year old\nman, was assaulted with a telephone and $90.00 was taken from him in the\ncontext of a home invasion.[41]I have considered the principles of\nsentencing set our earlier in sections 348.1 and 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal\nCode.I have given significant weight to the youthful age of the\ndefendant, his lack of criminal record, and that this will be his first\ncustodial sentence.I have considered the pre-sentence report and the\ndefendant’s prospects for rehabilitation. I have also considered the gravity of\nthe offence and the terrifying experience that was endured by the victims in\nthis case.I have considered society’s interest in the deterrence of the\ncommission of violent home invasions in the drug subculture in this community.I have considered the pre-sentence custody credit that is appropriate and am mindful\nof the principles of parity of sentencing as it relates to the co‑accused\nRider Guerrero. I have considered that the offence to which Rider Guerrero pled\nguilty was robbery while armed with a shotgun, that is a firearm as defined by\nthe Criminal Code, and that at the trial of the defendant, the Crown was\nunable to prove that the gun used was a firearm as so defined. I have\nconsidered the overall totality of the sentence, given that the sentences for\nthe breach of recognizance charges will be consecutive to the other charges.[42]The sentence in totality imposed will be one\nof five and one-half years in custody less pre-sentence custody credited\nconcurrently on counts 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 at three years and five\nmonths.The defendant will be sentenced to an additional 19 months\nconcurrent on these counts.The defendant will be further sentenced to six\nmonths on counts 12 and 13 concurrent to each other but consecutive to all\nother counts.[43]Pursuant to section 109 of the Criminal\nCode the defendant is prohibited from possessing any firearm, cross-bow,\nprohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited\nammunition and explosive substance for life.Pursuant to\nsection 487.05(1) of the Criminal Code I further order the taking\nof bodily substances from the defendant for DNA analysis.Released:November 2, 2011Signed:“Justice A.J.

and(c)the Offender's Criminal Record (Ex.3).[10]The offender is an Ojibway status Indian and is\nregistered with the Wausauksing Ojibway First Nation.[11]The offender grew up as an only child but is\nactually one of nine children of his biological father.He has had no contact\nwith his biological father since birth and was adopted by his step-father who\nwas involved in the offender's life from approximately age 4 until age 10.Both the offender's father and step-father are non-Aboriginal.[12]The offender's step-father was reportedly\nphysically and emotionally abusive; however, the offender indicated that he did\nnot wish to use this as an excuse for his own conduct.[13]The offender's mother is Aboriginal and\noriginally from the Wausauksing Ojibway Reserve near Parry Sound.The\noffender's maternal grandparents both resided on Ojibway Reserves.[14]The offender's mother reported that he had never\nlived on a Reserve.Her own upbringing was characterized by alcoholism and\nabuse.[15]The offender's mother reported having a\ndifficult childhood which involved physical and sexual abuse by her father.She left the Reserve at age 11.[16]At age 19 she became pregnant with the offender\nand had only a brief relationship with his father.When he was approximately 3\nor 4 years old she entered into another relationship, however, the offender\nreported that this was a violent relationship.[17]The pre-sentence report indicates that the\noffender has led a transient lifestyle since an early age, starting at approximately\n12 years where he left his mother and hitchhiked throughout south-western\nOntario.He has never been married and has no children.[18]The offender was diagnosed with ADHD at age 9\nand took medication for this condition until approximately age 16.He was in\nand out of school.He first dropped out of school in grade 10 and returned to\ncomplete his high school in Wiarton at age 18.[19]The offender reported that he considered himself\na \"loser\" while in school and that he was beaten up.The offender's\nstepfather Greg Webber indicated that the offender suffered from low\nself-esteem.[20]The offender reported that on dropping out of\nhigh school he hitchhiked to various cities including Toronto, London, Sarnia\nand Windsor.While in Sarnia he became more acquainted with members of the Aboriginal\ncommunity.Although the offender did not grow up on a Reserve, he did have\nexposure to his Aboriginal background through his uncle David King.[21]Throughout his youth, the offender was in\ncustody from time to time.While residing in Sarnia he began experimenting\nwith drugs including crystal meth, LSD, marijuana and ecstasy.[22]The offender’s mother notes that he engaged in\nabuse of alcohol and drugs as a youth and the offender indicated to the\ninvestigating probation officer that alcohol was a feature of his condition at\nthe time he committed prior offences.[23]According to the author of the Gladue\nreport, the offender became involved with the law while he was located in\nSarnia.As a youth he was admitted to the Bluewater Youth Center in Goderich\nand following his release, he resided with his mother and stepfather for\napproximately a year, during which time he re-enrolled in high school. Following\na further brief stay in Sarnia, he returned to reside with his mother and\ncomplete high school at approximately age 18.[24]Upon resuming high school the offender reported\nthat he was not comfortable with his Aboriginal peers, as he believed that they\nviewed him as an \"apple,” a term used by some members of the Aboriginal\ncommunity to describe other Aboriginal persons who are no less Aboriginal but\nwho have adopted both traditional and mainstream principles into their belief\nsystems and daily living.[25]The offender also reported being involved in\nfights with non-Aboriginal youth and not being comfortable with his Aboriginal\nyouth peers.[26]He has a very limited employment history and has\nbeen supported primarily through Ontario Works over the past three years.[27]The offender acknowledged his long criminal\nrecord, commencing as a youth in 2003 as set out in Exhibit 3 and in the\npre-sentence report.[28]His adult criminal record commenced in Sarnia in\nOctober 2006 at which time he was convicted of attempt theft and was sentenced\nto time served followed by 12 months probation.He was subsequently convicted\nof theft under $5,000.00 at Owen Sound, fined, and given a further probationary\nperiod of 12 months.[29]In 2007, the offender was convicted of failing\nto comply with a probationary order and of failing to comply with a\nrecognizance at Owen Sound.Further, in that year he was convicted of assault\nand failing to comply with a probationary order in Sarnia.[30]On November 26, 2008 the offender was convicted\nof robbery at Owen Sound and was given a suspended sentence followed by 12\nmonths probation.He was subsequently convicted at Walkerton on February 25,\n2009 of theft under $5,000.00 and of disobeying a lawful order. Following a 30\nday custodial sentence, he was placed on 12 months probation.[31]The offender was subject to the probationary\norder at the time of the offences giving rise to his present appearance before\nthe court.[32]According to the author of the Gladue\nreport, the offender did not report any health issues other than to indicate a\nhistory of depression and suicide attempts.He advised the author of the report\nthat he contemplated taking his life while in grade 8, as a result of being\nbullied by his peers.He also reported that he overdosed on prescription\nmedication and at age 17 attempted to shoot himself.[33]His most recent attempt at suicide occurred in\n2010 while residing with his surety when he tried to hang himself, fortunately,\nthe surety intervened.[34]While currently he does not report experiencing\nany suicidal ideations, he reports that he could benefit from counselling for\nsymptoms of depression and he has agreed to participate in counselling at a\nCanadian Mental Health Association facility.[35]As to his present circumstances, the offender\nadvised the author of the Gladue report that he has not had any drug or\nalcohol issues since 2009 and he does not feel he requires a long-term\nresidential drug or alcohol treatment program, however, he agrees that he would\nattend addiction counselling as a preventative measure for possible relapse.[36]The offender has also indicated an interest in\nparticipating in counselling and rehabilitation programs to address substance\nabuse and personal life issues, following his release from custody.[37]The author of the Gladue report\nrecommends that, in the event a custodial sentence is ordered, the offender\ntake part in the Turning Full Circle Program offered at the Thunder Bay\nCorrectional Center.This is an Aboriginal-specific drug and alcohol addiction\nprogram.Impact on the Victim[38]It is clear, from her evidence at trial, that\nLinda Lipka found this home invasion to be a most terrifying experience.In\nhis submissions on behalf of the offender, his counsel readily acknowledged that\nthe offender's conduct involving Linda Lipka was violent and most serious.Legal Parameters[39]In addition to the general purpose and\nprinciples of sentencing as enunciated in s. 718 of the Criminal Code,\ns. 718.2 provides other sentencing principles that must be taken into account\nand reads as follows:Other sentencing principles718.2 A court that imposes a\nsentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:(a)a sentence should be\nincreased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating\ncircumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting\nthe generality of the foregoing,(i)evidence that the\noffence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or\nethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical\ndisability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor,(ii)evidence that the\noffender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s spouse or common-law\npartner,(ii.1)evidence that the\noffender, in committing the offence, abused a person under the age of eighteen\nyears,(iii)evidence that the\noffender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in\nrelation to the victim,(iv)evidence that the\noffence was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association\nwith a criminal organization, or(v)evidence that the\noffence was a terrorism offenceshall be deemed to be aggravating\ncircumstances;(b)a sentence should be\nsimilar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences\ncommitted in similar circumstances;(c)where consecutive\nsentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or\nharsh;(d)an offender should not be\ndeprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the\ncircumstances; and(e)all available sanctions\nother than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be\nconsidered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of\naboriginal offenders.[40]The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Gladue,\n[1999] 1 S.C.R. confirmed that s. 718.2 (e) imposed a duty on the sentencing\njudge to approach the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders differently and to\nconsider reasonable alternatives to imprisonment for all offenders.Special\nconsideration must be given to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders.[41]While s. 718.2 (e) requires a different\nmethodology for assessing a fit sentence for an Aboriginal offender, it does\nnot necessarily mandate a different result.This subsection does not alter the\nfundamental duty of the sentencing judge to impose a sentence that is fit for\nthe offence and the offender: R. v. Kakekagamick, 2006 CanLII 28549 (ON\nCA) at paras. 34 - 36; R. v. Wells, 2000 SCC 10 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 207.[42]Gladue\nestablished a framework by which a sentencing judge is to carry out his or her\nduty when determining a truly fit and proper sentence for Aboriginal offenders.The background considerations underlying the unique circumstances of Aboriginal\noffenders, which will direct the sentencing judge’s analysis are:(a)the unique systemic or background factors which\nmay have played a part in bringing the particular Aboriginal offender before\nthe courts; and(b)the types of sentencing procedures and\nsanctions, which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender\nbecause of his or her particular Aboriginal heritage or connection: Kakekagamick\nat para.40.[43]As was noted by Rosenberg JA in R. v. Collins,\n[2011] O.J. No. 978 at para. 32, there is nothing in the governing authorities\nthat places the burden of persuasion on an Aboriginal offender to establish a\ncausal link between the systemic and background factors and the commission of\nthe offence.Further, he noted that s. 718.2 (e) and the Gladue\napproach to sentencing Aboriginal offenders is not about shifting blame or\nfailing to take responsibility; it is a recognition of the devastating impact\nthat Canada's treatment of its Aboriginal population has wreaked on the members\nof that society.[44]Rosenberg JA further noted at para. 33:[33]As expressed in Gladue,\nWells and Kakekagamick, s. 718.2(e) requires the sentencing judge\nto “give attention to the unique background and systemic factors which may have\nplayed a part in bringing the particular offender before the courts”: Gladue\nat para. 69.This is a much more modest requirement than the causal link\nsuggested by the trial judge.As counsel for the appellant submitted in this\ncase, it would be almost impossible for most Aboriginal offenders to establish\na direct causal link between systemic factors and any particular offence.Commission of offences are affected by a host of circumstances, the systemic\nfactors of the particular Aboriginal community may, as the name suggests, be\nnothing more than the background or the setting for commission of the offence.However, the Gladue principles require those factors to be taken into\naccount.In cases where those factors are shown to have played a significant\nrole, it may be that imprisonment will utterly fail to vindicate the objectives\nof deterrence or denunciation:Gladue at para. 69.In other cases,\nwhere the impact is not as dramatic, those systemic and background factors must\nnevertheless be taken into account in shaping the appropriate penal response.[45]As to the principle of restorative justice,\nLaForme JA noted in Kakekagamick, at para. 42:[42]To be clear, s.\n718.2(e) does not require, nor is there a general rule, that Aboriginal\noffenders must be sentenced in a way that gives the most weight to the\nprinciple of restorative justice.It may be that in certain cases the\nobjectives of restorative justice articulated in s. 718.2(e) and Gladue\nwill not weigh as favourably as those of separation, denunciation and\ndeterrence.As was noted in Gladue, Aboriginal people also believe in\nthe importance of those latter objectives.Those principles will always be\nrelevant and may predominate for more serious offenders or where the offence is\nserious enough that imprisonment is necessary.[46]As to the offences in question which form the\nhome invasion, it has been noted that home invasion offences are serious,\nincreasingly prevalent, and are particularly troubling \"because they\nrepresent a violation of the sanctity of the home and of the sense of security\npeople feel when in their homes -- highly cherished values in our society --\nand because they are frequently perpetrated against vulnerable\nindividuals\" and as such they must be dealt with sternly by the courts: R.\nv. Wright, 2006 CanLII 40975 (ON CA), [2006] O.J. No.4870 (Ont. C.A.) at para 12 to 14.[47]As to the appropriate guidelines or range for an\nappropriate sentence for home invasion offences, it was noted by Blair JA in Wright,\nat para. 23 that there is a gamut of sentencing dispositions in \"home\ninvasion\" cases from as low as 4 or 5 years to as high as 11 to 13 years.In considering the difficulty in establishing a proper range of sentencing for\n\"home invasion\" Blair JA stated:The downside of attempting to\narticulate a range for a type of crime that can manifest itself in such a wide\nvariety of ways, and be committed by such a wide variety of individuals, is\nthat the “range” becomes so broad, it is virtually meaningless.Nonetheless,\nto the extent there can be said to be a range in home invasion cases, it would\nappear that the one that currently exists is the expansive one outlined above.[48]Blair JA stated further atpara.24:[24] In my view, however, “home\ninvasion” cases call for a particularly nuanced approach to sentencing.They\nrequire a careful examination of the circumstances of the particular case in\nquestion, of the nature and severity of the criminal acts perpetrated in the\ncourse of the home invasion, and of the situation of the individual offender.Whether a case falls within the existing guidelines or range – or, indeed,\nwhether it may be one of those exceptional cases that falls outside the range\nand results in a moving of the yardsticks – will depend upon the results of such\nan examination.I agree with the British Columbia Court of Appeal in A.J.C.\n(at para. 29), however, that in cases of this nature the objectives of\nprotection of the public, general deterrence and denunciation should be given\npriority, although of course the prospects of the offender’s rehabilitation and\nthe other factors pertaining to sentencing must also be considered.Certainly,\na stiff penitentiary sentence is generally called for.Position of the Crown and Defence[49]Counsel on behalf of the Crown sought a custodial\nsentence of four years on a global basis with respect to both offences less\ntime served on a one for one basis along with certain ancillary orders.[50]As to credit for time served in pre-sentence\ncustody, the offender was in custody during the period November 27 to December\n8, 2009, namely for a period of 12 days.He was subsequently in pre-sentence\ncustody for the period March 10 to 24, 2010, namely for 15 days.[51]It was urged on behalf of the Crown that a 2 for\n1 credit for pre-sentence custody should not be considered with respect to the\nfirst period of pre-sentence custody given that the offender was on probation\nat the time of the offence and as such, the credit should be 1 for 1.[52]Further, as the second period of pre-sentence\ncustody occurred after the amendments to the Criminal Code, in s. 719,\nwhich came into force on February 22, 2010 which eliminated the discretion to\nallow a 2 for 1 credit for pre-sentence custody, that period of custody should\nbe credited on a 1 for 1 basis as well.[53]Counsel on behalf of the offender submitted that\nthe appropriate sentence in these circumstances was a custodial sentence of 25\nmonths with respect to the conviction for break and enter with intent to rob,\nless 39 days credit for pre-sentence custody resulting in a net custodial\nsentence of 23 months and 21 days.Concurrent with that sentence there should\nbe an additional 12 months sentence with respect to the offence of unlawful\nconfinement.[54]As to the credit for pre-sentence custody, it\nwas urged on behalf of the offender that the first period of pre-sentence\ncustody namely from November 27 to December 8, 2009 should be treated on a 2\nfor 1 basis, and that although the accused was on probation at the time of the\noffences, that should not cause the court to depart from the rule of thumb of a\n2 for 1 credit.[55]It was acknowledged that credit for the second\nperiod of pre-sentence custody must be on a 1 for 1 basis.Analysis[56]As to the considerations that are to be examined\nunder s. 718.2, the following represent aggravating circumstances so far as\nthis offender is concerned:(a)the offender has a significant youth and adult\ncriminal record, part of which includes offences involving violence;(b)the offender broke into a private dwelling;(d)the home invasion appears to have been planned;(e)there was violence involved in the unlawful\nconfinement of the victims, which was readily acknowledged by the offender; and(e)the\noffences were committed at a time when the offender was on probation.[57]As to mitigating factors that must be\nconsidered, they include:(a)the offender's relatively young age at the time\nof the offences, he is currently 24 years old;(b)his history of alcohol and drug abuse;(c)his ADHD diagnosis;(d)the offender has had several years of counselling;(e)his disconnection from his family at a very\nyoung age and his transient lifestyle where he was fending for himself on the\nstreets of several cities over a number of years as a youth;(f)the offender's expression of remorse to the\nvictim Linda Lipka in his letter of apology, which formed part of his police\ninterview following his arrest and his reported acceptance of responsibility\nfor these offences;(g)the offender's self-reported mental health\nhistory including attempts at suicide; and(h)the offender's recent progress in\nre-establishing an affiliation with his family and the Church of Alliance, as\nreported by the author of the Gladue report.[58]S. 718 of the Criminal Code sets out the\nfundamental purposes of sentencing which include, in addition to separating\noffenders from society, where necessary:(a)denunciation;(b)deterrence;(c)assistance and rehabilitation;(d)reparation for harm done;(e)promotion of offender responsibility; and(f)acknowledgment of harm.[59]The last of four purposes of sentencing, listed\nabove, demonstrate the influence of the restorative justice components in the\nsentencing decision: R. v. Jacko, 2010 ONCA 452 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 2583 at\npara. 50.[60]As was noted by Watt JA in Jacko, at\npara. 51:Restorative objectives are of\nparticular importance in determining the sentence to impose on youthful\noffenders, including immature recidivists.Restorative justice, which\nunderpins ss. 718 (d)-(f), involves some form of restitution and reintegration\ninto the community.Central to the sentencing process is the need for\noffenders to take responsibility for and acknowledged the harm caused by their\nconduct: Gladue, at para. 43.[61]In my view, this statement is most apt in the\ncircumstances of this case.[62]While s. 718.2 (e) requires a sentencing judge\nto consider alternatives to the use of a prison sentence as a penal sanction, I\nam of the view that a custodial sentence of imprisonment is appropriate in\nthese circumstances.This was acknowledged by counsel for the offender in his\nsubmissions.A conditional sentence was not sought.[63]I have concluded that a custodial sentence is\nappropriate weighing all considerations, and due to the offender’s lengthy\ncriminal record and the offences occurred while he was on probation.The\noffender has demonstrated that he is not presently amenable to control and\nsupervision in a non-custodial setting.[64]Further, the offences of this home invasion\ninvolved violence which was also a feature of his prior offences.As such, the\noffender must be separated from society.[65]As to the setting of a proper sentence in the\ncircumstances of an Aboriginal offender involved in a home invasion, it was\nnoted by Watt JA in Jacko, at paras. 89 and 90:[89.]Third, while our decision\nin Wright and cases following its lead describe a range of sentence for\n\"home invasion\" cases, it is clear from Wright itself that\nthese cases require an especially nuanced approach to sentencing that involves\na careful examination of the circumstances of the case at hand, of the nature\nand severity of the offenders' conduct and the circumstances of each offender\ninvolved in the offences: Wright, at para. 24.[90.] Sentencing\n\"ranges\", such as that described in Wright, are not immovable\nor immutable.They are and represent guidelines, of greater or lesser utility\ndepending upon the breadth of the range.Individual cases may fall within or\noutside the range.To consider a range of sentence as creating a de facto\nminimum sentence misses the point, ignores the fundamental principle of\nproportionality and is not faithful to the teachings of Wright itself.Individual circumstances matter.[66]As to the offender's profile as a young Aboriginal,\nas noted by Rosenberg JA in Collins, there is no burden on the offender,\nat the time of sentencing, to establish a causal link between the systemic and\nbackground factors considered in Gladue, and the offender and the\noffences he has committed.[67]While the offender and Lecuyer are both Aboriginal\npersons, I understand that no Gladue report was obtained with respect to\nthe sentencing of Lecuyer. I have considered the sentence imposed on Lecuyer as\nthe offender's co-accused in determining a fit sentence.[68]While restorative justice objectives do not\ntrump other sentencing objectives in every case involving Aboriginal offenders\nand separation, denunciation and deterrence retain their fundamental relevance\nfor some offenders who commit serious offences, as a general rule, the more\nserious and violent the offence, the more likely it is that the terms of\nimprisonment imposed on similarly-circumstanced Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal\noffenders will not differ significantly and indeed may be the same.However,\nin some circumstances of serious and violent crime, the length of the sentence\nof an Aboriginal offender may be less than that imposed on a non-Aboriginal\noffender.Serious crime and the objectives of restorative justice are not\nincompatible in the sentencing process -- restorative justice objectives may\npredominate in the sentencing decision for Aboriginal offenders convicted of\nserious crimes: Jacko at para. 64.[69]Weighing the seriousness of the offences, the\ncircumstances of the offender and the sentencing objectives of denunciation,\ndeterrence and restorative justice, and after examining the aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances discussed, I am of the view that a reformatory\nsentence at the upper end would be appropriate.[70]Exceptions to the range of sentences for\n\"home invasion\" offences do exist and I have concluded that this is a\nproper case for the setting of a sentence outside the range described in Wright.The fundamental sentencing objectives considered in Wright were\ndeterrence and denunciation.Restorative justice objectives were not at stake\nin Wright: Jacko, at paras. 96 - 98.[71]In addition to the sentencing objectives of\ndeterrence and denunciation, I have also considered the influence of the\nobjective of restorative justice.[72]While there is no evidence of a nexus connecting\nthe offender’s Aboriginal background directly with the offences he has\ncommitted, and none is required, it is clear that the offender has come from a\ndisadvantaged family and social background which is directly connected with his\nAboriginal heritage and as such, the Gladue considerations are clearly\nengaged in this case.[73]I understand that at the time of the sentencing\nhearing, the offender was in custody on other matters.The particulars as to\nwhy he was in custody at that time were not disclosed.[74]I have concluded that in all of these circumstances,\na fit and appropriate sentence is a term of imprisonment of 25 months for the\noffence of break and enter with intent to commit robbery less, 39 days credit\nfor pre-sentence time served for a net custodial sentence of 23 months and 21\ndays.There shall be a further sentence of 12 months for the conviction on the\noffence of unlawful confinement which shall be served concurrently. These\nconcurrent sentences shall be served in a provincial reformatory.[75]It has been recommended by Jillian Collins, the Gladue\ncaseworker from Aboriginal Legal Services of Toronto, that in the event a custodial\nsentence is imposed the offender be allowed to take part in the Turning Full\nCircle Program offered at the Thunder Bay Correctional Center.This is a 10\nweek program which deals with Aboriginal-specific alcohol and drug addiction.[76]Although the offender has advised that alcohol\nand drug use have not been a prominent feature of his life recently, I support\nthe recommendation of Ms. Collins, that the offender be enrolled in an alcohol\nand drug addiction program, as suggested, primarily to minimize the risk of\nrelapse.[77]In the circumstances, having regard to the\ncustodial sentence imposed, it would be preferable that the offender serve the\ntime in custody at the Thunder Bay Correctional Center where he would be able\nto participate in the Turning Full Circle Program.[78]In addition to the custodial sentence ancillary\norders shall issue as follows:(a)a lifetime firearm and ammunition prohibition\nunder s. 109 of the Criminal Code; and(b)the offender shall provide DNA samples for\nanalysis in accordance with s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code.Probation[79]Upon the release of these reasons as to\nsentence, counsel shall make such submissions as to the probationary terms to\nfollow the offender’s custodial sentence.___________________________Daley J.Released:January\n24, 2012CITATION: R. v.

The sentencing judge declined to make an order\nunder the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, S.C. 2004, c. 10 (“SOIRA”).[3]The appeal of sentence was dealt with by this\nCourt at 2013 SKCA 101 (CanLII). This judgment deals solely with the Crown’s appeal of\nthe sentencing judge’s decision not to impose an order under SOIRA.[4]The appeal is purportedly brought under s.\n676(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.[5]The background facts leading to the charge are\nset out in 2013 SKCA 101 (CanLII).II.Decision of the Sentencing\nJudge[6]The decision of the sentencing judge with\nrespect to the SOIRA order is as follows:THE COURT:Thank\nyou for that. One of the other decisions that was quoted to me -- that was R.J.B.,\nat paragraph 42, His Honour Judge Semenuk, a Judge of the Provincial Court of\nAlberta, in the decision which was provided to me, made the following comments.\nAnd that was a 2007 decision. At paragraph 42, he says -- His Honour says: (as\nread)“Pursuant to Section\n490.012(4) of the Criminal Code, I do not make an order under Section\n490.012(1) of the Criminal Code. I am satisfied that the impact of\nmaking a 20 year order under the Sexual Offender Information Registration\nAct would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest in protecting\nsociety through the effective investigation of crimes of a sexual nature to be\nachieved by such registration, considering the exceptional circumstances of the\naccused, already stated above in this case.”I’ve concluded that\nin this instance, there are exceptional circumstances here. Mr. Whiting is not\nthe stereotypical sexual offender. He is a sexual offender, as his guilty plea\nadmits, but he is not the stereotypical one. I have no doubt he will not be\nback in front of this court or any other court dealing with a sexual matter. I\nhave a feeling he won’t be back before this court or any other court for any\nmatter in that particular regard. [R. v. R.J.B., 2007 ABPC 61 (CanLII)]III.Issues1.Did the Sentencing Judge err in\ndeclining to make a SOIRA order pursuant to s. 490.012 of the Code?2.Is there a right of appeal from\nthe sentencing judge’s decision declining to make an order under the SOIRA?IV.Standard of Review[7]As stated above, this is an appeal under s.\n676(1)(b) of the Criminal Code which states:676. (1)The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for\nthe purpose may appeal to the court of appeal. . .(b)against an\norder of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction that quashes an indictment\nor in any manner refuses or fails to exercise jurisdiction on an indictment;[8]A question of the jurisdiction of the sentencing\njudge is a question of law.[9]In R. v. T.C., 2009 SKCA 124 (CanLII), 249 C.C.C.\n(3d) 1 this Court held at para. 28:As to the standard of appellate\nreview, I observe that some appellate decisions, for example, R. v. Redhead,\n2006 ABCA 84 (CanLII), (2006), 206 C.C.C. (3rd) 315 (Alta. C.A.) (leave to appeal to\nS.C.C. refused, [2006] 2 S.C.R. x), have held that the standard is the same for\nboth SOIRA and DNA decisions. I note, however, that the right of appeal with\nrespect to decisions made in relation to SOIRA orders (s. 490.014) is different\nthan that for matters in relation to DNA orders (s. 487.054). Be that as it\nmay, the impact of this difference need not be explored on this appeal as Crown\ncounsel has not called into question the reasonableness of the decision. He has\nraised questions of law only, which attract the standard of review of\ncorrectness.[10]Thus, in this case whether the judge erred in declining to make an\norder under SOIRA and whether there is a right of appeal from his\ndecision are questions of law reviewable on the standard of correctness.VI.Analysis1.Did the Sentencing Judge err in in declining to make a SOIRA\norder pursuant to s. 490.012 of the Code?(a)The\nAmendments to the Criminal Code[11]Section 490.012 of the Criminal Code confers authority upon a\nsentencing judge to impose a SOIRA order on a person convicted of a\ndesignated offence.[12]In the case before this Court, the sentencing judge referred to R.J.B.\na 2007 case, and appeared to rely on it as seeming authority to exercise\ndiscretion in imposing an order under SOIRA. At the time that R. v. R.J.B.\n2007 ABPC 61 (CanLII), 423 A.R. 131, was decided s. 490.012(4) of the Code read\nas follows:The court is not required to make\nan order under this section if it is satisfied that the person has established\nthat, if the order were made, the impact on them, including on their privacy or\nliberty, would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest in protecting\nsociety through the effective investigation of crimes of a sexual nature, to be\nachieved by the registration of information relating to sex offenders under the\nSex offender Information Registration Act.[13]However, with the coming into force of the Protecting Victims\nFrom Sex Offenders Act, S.C. 2010, c. 17, on April 15, 2011, s. 490.012 was\namended to read as follows:490.012 (1) When a court imposes a sentence on\na person for an offence referred to in paragraph (a), (c), (c.1), (d) or (e) of\nthe definition “designated offence” in subsection 490.011(1) or renders a\nverdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder for such an\noffence, it shall make an order in Form 52 requiring the person to\ncomply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for the\napplicable period specified in section 490.013.[emphasis\nadded][14]As s. 271 of the Criminal Code is a “designated” offence as\ndefined under s. 490.011(1)(a), the sentencing judge is required to\nmake an order under SOIRA under the amended provisions of the Code.(b)Is\nSOIRA Prospective or Retrospective?[15]It is then necessary to determine whether the SOIRA amendments\nare prospective or retrospective in their application.[16]If the SOIRA amendments to s. 490.012 are prospective, they\ncan only apply to alter the future consequences of future events. As the\namendments came into force after the accused committed the offence with which\nhe was charged, the amendments would not affect the accused.[17]If, however, the SOIRA amendments are retrospective, they\nalter the future consequences of past events. Thus, they would take effect\nimmediately upon their coming into force and the future consequences of events\nthat occurred before the amendments came into effect would be altered. Accordingly,\nin the case before this Court, despite the fact that the accused committed the\noffence prior to the amendments making a SOIRA order mandatory came into\neffect, the amendments will apply and a SOIRA order would be mandatory\nfor this accused because he was not sentenced until after the amendments came\ninto effect.[18]In R. v. Morin, 2009 QCCA 187 (CanLII), the Quebec Court of Appeal\nheld that the SOIRA amendments are retrospective not retroactive because\nthey do not modify the past consequences of a conviction.Doyon J.A. said at\npara. 38:The\nappellants claim that the SOIRA has retroactive effect and is therefore\ncontrary to the principles of fundamental justice. In reality, however, its\neffect is retrospective, which is quite different. Retroactivity must be\ndistinguished from retrospectivity and, even more, from prospectivity.\nRetroactivity modifies the past legal consequences of situations that are\nthemselves in the past. Retrospectivity, for its part, modifies the future\nlegal consequences of past situations, while respecting past consequences.\nProspectivity modifies the future legal consequences of current or future\nsituations. The SOIRA, therefore, is in no way retroactive, since it\ndoes not modify the past consequences of the conviction (there were no\nconsequences before December 15, 2004, with respect to registration, and the\nnew Act did not create consequences applicable prior to its coming into force).\nRather, the SOIRA changes the future consequences of a past conviction\nas of the date of its coming into force, pursuant to ss. 490.019 to 490.023 Cr.\nC. (retrospective effect) and the future consequences of a present or future\nconviction, pursuant to s. 490.012 Cr. C. (prospective effect). Consequently,\nthe effects of the Act are applicable only to the future, contrary to\nwhat a retroactive act would do.[19]The retrospective application of ss. 490.019 to 490.029 was upheld\nas constitutional in R. v. Morin, based on the fact that there is no\nprinciple of fundamental justice against retrospective legislation and that in\nany case, because registration under SOIRA does not constitute a\nsentence, the argument is misplaced.A similar analysis was undertaken by the\nCourt of Appeal for Alberta in R. v. Warren in the context of a s. 7 Charter\napplication based on the retrospective application of SOIRA.[20]I conclude that Parliament intended that the April 15, 2011\namendments have immediate effect. Therefore the sentencing judge had no\ndiscretion as to whether or not to make a SOIRA order. It is mandatory.The sentencing judge therefore erred in failing to make such an order.2.Is there a right of appeal under the former version of s.\n490.014 from the sentencing judge’s decision declining to make an order under\nthe SOIRA?[21]Prior to the coming into force of the Protecting Victims From Sex\nOffenders Act on April 15, 2011, the appeal provisions of s. 490 read as\nfollows:490.014The prosecutor, or a person\nwho is subject to an order under section 490.012, may appeal from a decision of\nthe court under that section on any ground of appeal that raises a question of\nlaw or of mixed law and fact. The appeal court may dismiss the appeal, or allow\nit and order a new hearing, quash the order or make an order that may be made\nunder that section.[22]With those amendments, however, the appeal provisions were also\namended such that s. 490.014 now reads as follows:The prosecutor, or a person who is\nsubject to an order under subsection 490.012(2), may appeal from a decision of\nthe court under that subsection on any ground of appeal that raises a question\nof law or of mixed law and fact. The appeal court may dismiss the appeal, or\nallow it and order a new hearing, quash the order or make an order that may be\nmade under that subsection.[23]The accused committed the offence in March 2009, prior to the coming\ninto force of the Protecting Victims from Sex Offenders Act, but was not\ncharged until July 1, 2011, after that Act came into effect, amending\nthe SOIRA provisions of the Code.[24]The April 15, 2011 amendments to the SOIRA provisions of the Code\nchanged the appeal provision in s. 490.014 from the one that included a right\nto appeal from orders made under both subsections (1) and (2) of s. 490.012 to\none that only provided for a right of appeal from orders made under subsection\n(2) of s. 490.012. By expressly providing for the appeal from subsection (2)\norders it can be said that the legislature impliedly excluded any others.[25]As the order that the sentencing judge declined to make ought to\nhave been made under s. 490.012(1), s. 490.014 does not provide an appeal.[26]During argument before this Court, the question was raised whether\ns. 11(i) of the Charter might have any application to the\namendments to the Criminal Code removing the accused’s right to appeal\nthe SOIRA order. Section 11(i) directs that an accused found guilty of\nan offence is entitled to the benefit of the lesser punishment where punishment\nfor the offence has been varied between the time of commission and the time of\nsentencing.[27]Section 11(i) of the Charter only applies to punishments. It\nis well established that an order such as an order under SOIRA, is not a\npunishment. See: R. v. Cross, 2006 NSCA 30 (CanLII), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 289.[28]Therefore even assuming that s. 11(i) of the Charter might\napply to a change in a right of appeal from a punishment as opposed to a change\nin the substance of the punishment, it has no application to the removal of the\nright to appeal an order under SOIRA.[29]The question then becomes does the right of appeal provided by the\nearlier version of s. 490.014 survive the amendments?[30]The extinguishment of the right to appeal from s. 490.012(1) orders\nis a significant and substantive amendment to the Code. The existence of\na right to bring an appeal is considered substantive (see: Ruth Sullivan, Sullivan\non the Construction of Statutes, 5th ed. (Markham: LexisNexis\nInc., 2008) at p. 699).[31]Further, the extinguishment of the right to appeal from SOIRA\norders modified the Court’s jurisdiction with regard to such orders and\njurisdiction is not a procedural matter. “A statute which modifies a right of\nappeal cannot be applied to cases pending when it comes into force”\n(Pierre-Andre Cote, The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada (4th\ned.) (Toronto: Thomson Reuters Canada Ltd., 2011) at p. 194.[32]Therefore, it is necessary to determine when a case is “pending”.[33]The Supreme Court has held that a right of appeal accrues on the day\nproceedings are instituted in the lower courts such that pending cases do not\nlose or gain a right of appeal by way of statutory amendments that occur while\ntheir case is pending. (See: Williams v. Irvine (1893), 1893 CanLII 37 (SCC), 22 S.C.R. 108; Hyde\nv. Lindsay (1898), 1898 CanLII 12 (SCC), 29 S.C.R. 99; Doran v. Jewell (1913-14), 1914 CanLII 1 (SCC), 49\nS.C.R. 88.)[34]However, this position was brought into question in R. v. Puskas,\n1998 CanLII 784 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1207, where the Supreme Court ruled that a modification which\nchanged the right of appeal to the Supreme Court to an appeal only with leave\nwas applicable to proceedings before the Court of Appeal of Ontario at the\ncommencement of the legislative amendment. The Court considered the federal Interpretation\nAct, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21 in its analysis, in particular, s. 43 which\nstates:43. Where an enactment is repealed in whole or in part, the repeal\ndoes not. . .(c)affect any\nright, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, accruing or\nincurred under the enactment so repealed,[35]For a right to be “accruing”, the Court held at para. 14, its\neventual accrual must be certain, and not conditional on future events. Thus, a\nright to appeal a decision can only be acquired, accrued, or be accruing, when\nall of the conditions precedent to the exercise of the right have been\nfulfilled.[36]That said, the Supreme Court specifically distinguished the facts in\nPuskas from its own previous line of cases, including Williams, Hyde,\netc. At para. 10 of Puskas, Lamer C.J., for the Court, stated that the\nprevious cases did not apply because they were almost all about the creation of\nnew appeal rights. The concern in such cases, he stated, is that cases that had\nappeared to be finally decided would be “revived” by the new rights of appeal.[37]Also, at para. 12, he noted that when appeals from Canadian cases to\nthe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council were abolished in 1949, appeals\nwere still permitted for all cases which were in process at the time of the\namendment. Lamer C.J. distinguished the facts in Puskas by noting that\nin Puskas what was being changed was the mechanism whereby appeals\nreached the Supreme Court, whereas in the previous line of cases and in the\nPrivy Council appeals, the legal question was the jurisdiction of the Court to\nhear the appeal.[38]In the case presently before this Court, at issue is the Court’s jurisdiction\nto hear the appeal. By the reasoning in Puskas, therefore, it might\nappear that the applicable line of cases is the previous Supreme Court line of\ncases, (Williams v. Irvine, supra; Cowen v. Evans (1893), 1893 CanLII 44 (SCC), 22\nS.C.R. 331; Mitchell v. Trenholme (1893), 22 S.C.R. 333; Doran v.\nJewell, supra and Hyde v. Lindsay, supra, and taken up again\nin Singer v. The King, 1931 CanLII 13 (SCC), [1932] S.C.R. 70, Boyer v. The King,\n1948 CanLII 51 (SCC), [1949] S.C.R. 89, and Marcotte v. The King, 1950 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1950] S.C.R. 352).[39]However, the Court’s analysis at para. 14 in Puskas is\ndifficult to ignore:Since the usefulness of the\njurisprudence is limited, it falls to the Court to determine the matter on the\nbasis of statutory interpretation and principle. In our view, there are\nnumerous reasons for deciding that the ability to appeal as of right to this\nCourt is only \"acquired,\" \"accrued\" or \"accruing\"\nwhen the court of appeal renders its judgment. The first is a common-sense\nunderstanding of what it means to \"acquire\" a right or have it\n\"accrue\" to you. A right can only be said to have been\n\"acquired\" when the right-holder can actually exercise it. The term\n\"accrue\" is simply a passive way of stating the same concept (a\nperson \"acquires\" a right; a right \"accrues\" to a person). Similarly,\nsomething can only be said to be \"accruing\" if its eventual accrual\nis certain, and not conditional on future events (Scott v. College of\nPhysicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan (1992), 1992 CanLII 2751 (SK CA), 95 D.L.R. (4th) 706 (Sask.\nC.A.), at p. 719). In other words, a right cannot accrue, be acquired, or be\naccruing until all conditions precedent to the exercise of the right have been\nfulfilled.[40]In Scott v. College of Physicians \u0026 Surgeons of Saskatchewan\n(1992), 1992 CanLII 2751 (SK CA), 95 D.L.R. (4th) 706, Justice Cameron of this Court concluded\nat p. 719 that “before a right…may be said to be ‘accruing’, the events giving\nrise to it or the conditions upon which it depends for its existence, must have\nbeen so set in train or engaged as inevitably to give rise in due course to the\nright”.This interpretation was cited with approval by the Supreme Court in Puskas.[41]In Scott, the right in question was the right of a physician\npreviously struck from the register of the College of Physicians \u0026 Surgeons\nof Saskatchewan to be re-entered on the register upon payment of a fee. That\nright was affected by a change in the legislation which occurred during Scott’s\napplication process for readmission. The interest affected in Scott is\ntherefore similar to the present case as they both remove a right, in the\npresent case, being a right of appeal. Further, the same provisions of the Interpretation\nAct were considered by this Court in Scott, albeit their equivalent\nin the provincial Interpretation Act.[42]Thus, this Court, and the Supreme Court, have held that a right does\nnot vest until all of the conditions precedent for its existence are in place.\nFollowing thatreasoning in relation to the facts of this case, the right to\nappeal from a SOIRA order would not have vested until after sentencing\nat Queen’s Bench, which occurred on February 27, 2013, long after the Protecting\nVictims from Sex Offenders Act came into force.[43]This analysis is bolstered by taking a purposive approach to\ninterpreting the legislation.Sullivan, supra, said at p. 725 “when a\nprimary purpose of legislation is to abolish a right of which the legislature\ndisapproves, a court may readily conclude that the legislature intended to\ntarget existing as well as future examples of that right.” Hansard debates\nindicate that Parliament disapproved of the number of sex offenders not being\nregistered under SOIRA.[44]Under the amended legislation judges are required to make SOIRA\norders for offenders under s. 490.012(1) and there is no right to appeal from\nsuch an order. A purposive analysis would suggest that this intended to include\nall orders existing at the time of coming into force of the amendments as well\nas future s. 490.012(1) orders.(a)Is There a Right to Appeal\nby Virtue of s. 676(1)(b) of the Criminal Code?[45]Section 676(1)(b) of the Code states:676(1)The Attorney General or\ncounsel instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal. . .(b)against\nan order of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction that quashes an\nindictment or in any manner refuses or fails to exercise jurisdiction on an\nindictment;[46]Section 676(1)(b) does not appear to have been used to appeal in\nthis type of situation, to my knowledge but it has been used in a number of\ncases to appeal from the quashing of an indictment. See: R. v. Czarnecki\n(2000), 2000 CanLII 6835 (MB CA), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 179 (Man. C.A.). It has also been successfully used to\nappeal from a judge’s refusal to permit the Crown to argue that the accused was\nnot criminally responsible on account of mental disorder (R. v. Wells,\n2004 ABCA 371 (CanLII), 193 C.C.C. (3d) 43).[47]In R. v. Taylor (1996), 1995 CanLII 4059 (SK CA), 132 D.L.R. (4th) 323, the\nCrown appealed an adjournment of one year which was granted on the\nrecommendation of members of a sentencing circle in order to facilitate the\ncarrying out of their recommended sentence of banishment to a private island\nfor one year. This Court held that the adjournment was not for a purpose\ncontemplated by law and, having convicted the accused, the trial judge was\nbound to proceed in accordance with s. 570(1) of the Code and sentence\nthe accused. Section 676(1)(b) was accepted as grounds for appeal of the\njudge’s adjournment.[48]Although the use of s. 676(1)(b) was successful in R. v. Wells, the\nCourt of Appeal of Alberta cautioned that this route to a Crown appeal is\nrarely appropriate, but it was in Wells because the trial judge was\nrequired to exercise his jurisdiction, but failed to do so. That jurisdiction\nwas to hear the Crown’s submissions on the accused being not criminally\nresponsible due to mental disorder despite the defendant’s failure to bring his\nsanity into issue.[49]Although the use of s. 676(1)(b) to allow an appeal of the\nsentencing judge’s failure to make a SOIRA order appears on the surface to\nignore the clear legislative intent to abolish a right to appeal from a s.\n490.012(1) order, it is in line with the deeper underlying purpose of the April\n15, 2011 amendments. These amendments were made in order to ensure all sex\noffenders are put on the registry. The order became mandatory and the right to\nappeal from the order was extinguished. In this case the sentencing judge erred\nin not making the order which he was required to make and which Parliament\nclearly intended for him to make. Therefore, an appeal through s. 676(1)(b)\nsimply gives effect to the intention of Parliament. In these circumstances I am\nof the view that it is an appropriate use of s. 676(1)(b) and find that an\nappeal does lie through s. 676(1)(b) of the Code in circumstances such\nas this.(b)Is There a Right to Appeal\nby Virtue of s. 676(1)(d) of the Criminal Code?[50]Section 676(1)(d) states:676. (1) The Attorney General or\ncounsel instructed by him for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal. . .(d) with\nleave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof, against the sentence passed by\na trial court in proceedings by indictment, unless that sentence is one fixed\nby law.[51]Section 676(1)(d) is available to the Attorney General to appeal\nwith leave of the Court of Appeal or a judge thereof against the sentence\npassed by a trial court in proceedings by indictment, unless the sentence is\none fixed by law.The New Brunswick Court of Appeal in R. v. Chisholm,\n2012 NBCA 79 (CanLII), 292 C.C.C. (3d) 132, held that a SOIRA order issued\npursuant to s. 490.012(1) is not a sentence within the meaning of the section.[52]In R. v. J.J.W., 2012 NSCA 96 (CanLII), 292 C.C.C. (3d) 292, the Nova\nScotia Court of Appeal held that R. v. Chisholm is applicable where a\nsentencing judge declines to make an order under SOIRA, and therefore\nthere is no right of appeal pursuant to s. 676(1)(d) where a sentencing judge\ndeclines or fails to make said order pursuant to s. 490.012(1).[53]I am in agreement with the Chisholm and J.J.W.\ndecisions and the reasons expressed therein. Accordingly, there is no right to\nappeal the sentencing judge’s order by virtue of s. 676(1)(d) of the Code.VII.Conclusion[54]I conclude that an appeal does lie through s. 676(1)(b) and that the\nappeal should be allowed with respect to the SOIRA order.The\nsentencing judge’s order must be set aside.As a conviction under s. 271 has a\nmaximum term of imprisonment of ten years by virtue of s. 490.013(2)(b), an\nappropriateorder is a 20 year order.Therefore,\nthe sentencing judge’s order is set aside and is replaced with a 20 year SOIRA\ncompliance order.DATED at the City of Regina, in\nthe Province of Saskatchewan, this 3rd day of December, A.D. 2013.Whitmore J.A.________________________Whitmore J.A.I concur.RichardsC.J.S.Richards C.J.S.I concur.OttenbreitJ.A.Ottenbreit J.A."}

On December 22, 2011, I found Mr. Thomas not guilty of the full\noffence of aggravated sexual assault but guilty instead of the included offence\nof attempted aggravated sexual assault. He is before the court today for\nsentencing.I. The Offence[2]The facts underlying the verdict can be briefly summarized. Over the\ncourse of a five-year period beginning in 2002, Mr. Thomas was engaged in an\nintimate sexual relationship with M.C. In March 2006, as part of a physical\nexamination in support of his immigration application, Mr. Thomas was tested\nfor the presence of HIV. The test was positive. Mr. Thomas was notified of the\nresult, as was the Toronto Public Health Department. On April 5, 2006, a\nToronto Public Health nurse visited Mr. Thomas in his home and counseled him\nwith respect to the nature of HIV, the necessity of advising any future sexual\npartners of his infection, and the need to use condoms when engaging in any\npenetrative sexual activity. The nurse also asked him to disclose all of his\nsexual contacts for the previous 10 years and he agreed to do so.[3]Notwithstanding that agreement, Mr. Thomas never provided the Public\nHealth nurse with any information that would enable her to locate M.C. Worse, he\nnot only never himself revealed to M.C. that he had tested positive, he\ncontinued to engage in unprotected sexual intercourse with her for some 14\nmonths.[4]In May 2007, Mr. Thomas finally revealed M.C.’s name to the doctor who\nwas treating him for HIV. The doctor passed the information along to the Public\nHealth nurse, who was then able to track down M.C. and arrange for her to be\ntested. Unfortunately, not only was her test positive, she had by that point\ndeveloped full blown AIDS.[5]M.C. would not have consented to unprotected sexual intercourse with Mr.\nThomas had she known that he was HIV positive. By hiding that fact from her, Mr.\nThomas obtained M.C.’s agreement to engage in intercourse by fraud within the\nmeaning of s. 265(3)(c) of the Criminal Code. Accordingly the\nintercourse was without her consent and Mr. Thomas’s conduct constituted an\nassault. There is no doubt that Mr. Thomas was the source of M.C.’s HIV infection,\nbut the Crown acknowledged that it cannot be determined whether she became\ninfected before or after he learned that he was HIV positive. Thus, the Crown\nconceded that Mr. Thomas could not be found guilty of the full offence of\naggravated sexual assault. In the result, he was found guilty of an attempt to\ncommit aggravated sexual assault: see R. v. Williams, 2003 SCC 41 (CanLII).II. The Offender[6]Mr. Thomas is now 50 years of age. He was born and raised in Grenada,\nand came to Canada in 1990. In 1992 he began a romantic relationship with Singa\nDuffy. Within months, he and Ms. Duffy were living together. Apart from a\nyear-long separation in 2004 and 2005, they have continued to live together.\nThey were legally married on February 28, 2006. Ms. Duffy was unaware, while she\nwas living with Mr. Thomas, that he was carrying on an intimate affair with\nM.C.[7]Mr. Thomas’s relationship with M.C. produced a daughter, who is now 8\nyears of age. He supports her, he has access to her every second weekend and he\nhas a close bond with her.[8]A number of letters have been filed attesting to the high regard that\nMr. Thomas’s friends have for him and to the many kindnesses he has extended to\nothers. He has no prior criminal record. He has been on bail for 4½ years\nwithout incident.III. The Impact on the Victim[9]M.C. provided a Victim Impact statement to the court. It comes as no\nsurprise that the discovery that she is infected with HIV has been devastating\nfor her. It is important to bear in mind, however, that although there is no\ndoubt that Mr. Thomas was the source of M.C.’s infection, he may have infected\nher before he became aware of his HIV status.IV. The Positions of the Parties[10]On behalf of the Crown, Ms. How submits that the appropriate sentence is\none of imprisonment for three to five years. On behalf of Mr. Thomas, Mr.\nMiglin submits that the court should consider a conditional sentence, but that\nif a term of institutional custody must be imposed, it should be in the range\nof 18 months.V. Discussion[11]In determining a fit and appropriate sentence in this case, Mr. Thomas’s\nunblemished background is necessarily an important consideration. He has no\nprior involvement with the criminal justice system, he is well thought of in\nhis community, and apart from his involvement in the offence before the court\nhe has been of good character.[12]However, there are also a number of circumstances that significantly\naggravate what is an inherently serious offence. First, while Mr. Thomas may\nhave infected M.C. before he became aware of his infection, he repeatedly had\nunprotected intercourse with her after he became aware, not knowing, and in my\nview not caring, whether or not she too was infected. That is, on every\noccasion on which he had intercourse with her in the 14-month period after he\nlearned of his infection and before she was located by the Public Health nurse,\nhe was aware that he might be infecting her with an incurable and potentially\ndeadly virus. This callous course of conduct was a shocking breach of trust.\nFurther, even on Mr. Thomas’s version of events – which I have largely rejected\n– his conduct was appalling. At no point did he do anything to bring to M.C.’s\nattention the danger that she might be in or the need for her to seek the kind\nof medical attention that he was receiving. By the time she learned that she\nwas infected, she had developed AIDS. At that point, bewildered, she spoke to\nhim about her diagnosis. He denied knowing anything about it.[13]In support of their conflicting positions with respect to sentence, counsel\nhave referred me to a number of decisions in cases involving failures to\ndisclose HIV infections. The two that I find to be of the greatest assistance\nare two relatively recent decisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal, R. v.\nMcGregor, 2008 ONCA 831 (CanLII) and R. v. Iamkhong, 2009 ONCA 478 (CanLII).[14]In McGregor, the offender was diagnosed with HIV when he was 19\nyears of age. He received medical treatment for the infection and he was\nadvised of his obligation to inform prospective sexual partners of his status\nand of the need to always use condoms when engaging in sexual intercourse. Some\nyears later, he began a relationship with the complainant. He did not tell her\nof his infection, and while he was usually careful to employ a condom during\nsexual intercourse there were two instances when he failed to do so. By\nhappenstance, the complainant found out about his HIV status. Fortunately, she had\nnot been infected. The offender had no prior criminal record. He was found\nguilty after a trial. The trial judge imposed a conditional sentence of 12\nmonths. In the opinion of the Court of Appeal, a conditional sentence was\ndemonstrably unfit and a custodial term of 18 months ought to have been imposed.\nAfter allowing a credit of 6 months for the portion of the conditional sentence\nthat had already been served, the sentence was varied to one of 12 months\nimprisonment.[15]In Iamkhong, the offender regularly had unprotected sexual\nintercourse with her husband throughout the course of their 7 to 8 year\nrelationship knowing, but not disclosing, that before meeting him she had tested\npositive for HIV. On occasion, when they had discussions about sexually\ntransmitted diseases, she told him that she did not have HIV. Only after she\ndeveloped AIDS did she reveal the truth. Her husband was then tested and\nlearned that he too was infected with HIV. After a trial, the offender was\nconvicted of criminal negligence causing bodily harm and aggravated assault.\nThe trial judge allowed a credit of 12 months for the offender’s strict\npre-trial bail conditions and imposed a sentence of two years imprisonment. The\nCourt of Appeal affirmed the fitness of the sentence but reduced it by one day\nin order to preserve the offender’s right, under the Immigration and Refugee\nProtection Act, to appeal against her deportation order.[16]Although neither of those cases is on all fours with the case at bar,\nthere are similarities that make them of assistance in identifying the range\nwithin which the sentence for Mr. Thomas should fall. In McGregor, the\neffective sentence was a term of imprisonment of 18 months. However, unlike the\noffender in McGregor, who had unprotected intercourse with the\ncomplainant only twice over the course of an 18-month sexual relationship, Mr.\nThomas repeatedly engaged in unprotected intercourse with M.C. after he learned\nthat he was infected. Further, while both he and the offender in McGregor\nfailed to disclose their infections, Mr. Thomas failed to do so notwithstanding\nthat he was himself undergoing treatment for the infection. In my view, the moral\nblameworthiness of Mr. Thomas’s behaviour is greater than that that of the\noffender in McGregor.[17]In Iamkhong, the effective sentence was three years imprisonment.\nHowever, the offence of which the offender was convicted in that case was\ncriminal negligence causing bodily harm, whereas Mr. Thomas has been found\nguilty of attempted aggravated sexual assault. In Iamkhong, it was\nestablished that the offender infected the complainant at a time when she knew\nof her HIV status, whereas in this case sentencing must proceed on the basis\nthat Mr. Thomas infected M.C. before he knew that he was HIV positive. In\naddition, while Mr. Thomas’s non-disclosure was fundamentally dishonest, the offender\nin Iamkhong repeatedly and positively lied about the fact that she had\ntested negative for HIV. In the circumstances, I am of the view that a sentence\nsomewhat below the sentence imposed in Iamkhong is called for in the\ncase at bar.VI. Disposition[18]A proper balancing of the principles of sentencing requires a sentence for\nMr. Thomas that emphasizes deterrence and denunciation. To achieve those\nobjectives a term of imprisonment in a custodial facility is required. Giving\nthe matter my best consideration, I am of the view that the appropriate\nsentence would two years incarceration.[19]Like the offender in Iamkhong, the verdict in this case renders Mr.\nThomas subject to deportation. Pursuant to the provision of the Immigration\nand Refugee Protection Act, he will not have a right of appeal against\ndeportation if his sentence exceeds two years less one day. In the\ncircumstances, I will make the same order as was made in Iamkhong and\nreduce the sentence of two years to two years less one day.MacDonnell, J.Released: February 21, 2012R. v.

On December 21, 2010, the Crown provided the court with\nsome updated information.[6]What follows is the court’s decision as to\nwhether or not M.O. should be sentenced as an adult with respect to an\naggravated assault he committed on February 9, 2009, and/or with respect to his\npossession of a weapon, contrary to a weapons prohibition, on February 21,\n2009.M.O. pleaded guilty to both offences on July 8, 2010.[7]The other offences that M.O. awaits sentencing\non are:•A sexual assault that occurred on September 6,\n2009, while he was in custody at the Manitoba Youth Centre.He was convicted\nof this offence after trial.•An assault that occurred on September 1, 2009,\nwhile he was in custody at the Manitoba Youth Centre. M.O. pleaded guilty to\nthis offence.•A careless use of firearm that occurred on February\n21, 2009, arising out of the same incident as the possess weapon contrary to a\nweapons prohibition for which the Crown is seeking an adult sentence. M.O.\npleaded guilty to this offence.Requirements\non an adult sentence application[8]The Crown’s application for an adult sentence is\nmade pursuant to section 64(1) of the Y.C.J.A.[9]The aggravated assault and the possession of\nweapon offence are both “non presumptive” offences.They are offences for\nwhich an adult sentence may be considered, as each is one for which an adult is\nliable to imprisonment for a term of more than two years, and was committed\nafter the young person was fourteen years of age.M.O. was 17 years old at the\ntime each of the two offences was committed.Accordingly, the eligibility\nrequirements for consideration of an adult sentence for M.O. for these two\noffences pursuant to section 62(b) Y.C.J.A. are met.[10]The Attorney General gave notice to the court\nand to M.O. on June 26, 2010 of its intention to seek an adult sentence on\nthese two offences, that being prior to M.O.’s pleas on those two offences\nbeing entered.Accordingly, the notice requirements prescribed by section\n64(2) of the Y.C.J.A. have been met.[11]A pre-sentence report must be considered by the\ncourt in its decision as to whether to impose a youth or adult sentence\n(section 72(3) Y.C.J.A.).A pre-sentence report, prepared by probation\nofficer W. Cameron and dated August 26, 2010, was included in sentencing\nmaterials filed by the Crown.[12]A medical or psychological assessment of the\nyoung person may be ordered for the purpose of making a decision to impose a\nyouth or adult sentence (section 34 Y.C.J.A.).Such a report was\nordered.The report of psychologist Dr. Garry Fisher, of Youth Forensic\nServices, assessing M.O. on July 14, 2010, and an earlier report by Dr. Kent\nSomers, also a psychologist with Youth Forensic Services, dated September 3,\n2008, were included in the sentencing materials filed by the Crown.[13]Section 71 of the Y.C.J.A. requires that\ncertain persons be given an opportunity to be heard at the hearing of an\napplication for an adult sentence.Crown and defence counsel both made\nsubmissions. M.O.’s mother addressed the court, and urged the court to sentence\nM.O. as a young person on all offences.M.O. chose not to make any comments to\nthe court, although he was given the opportunity to do so.The Issue[14]The issue for the court to decide is whether an\nadult sentence is to be imposed on M.O. for committing the aggravated assault\non February 9, 2009, contrary to section 268 of the Criminal Code and/or\nfor committing the offence of possessing a weapon contrary to a weapons\nprohibition, contrary to section 117.01(1) of the Criminal Code.The Facts\nof the OffencesThe\naggravated assault[15]The aggravated assault happened on February 9,\n2009.On that date, the victim was physically beaten by M.O. and three\nco-accused. As a result of that beating, the victim sustained a subdural\nhaemorrhage to the left side of his brain.[16]The victim had driven his vehicle into the\nparking lot of an apartment complex, in Winnipeg, for the purpose of visiting\nrelatives who lived in the apartment complex.As soon as he got out of his\nvehicle, he was attacked by M.O. and his three co accused.The victim, who was\nalone, used his cell phone to call relatives inside the apartment building.They attended to the parking lot and found the victim severely beaten about the\nhead.By the time authorities arrived, all accused had fled the scene.[17]The reason for the attack was gang motivated. M.O.\nand his co accused were members of the B Side street gang.They were looking\nto find any member of the African Mafia, a rival street gang, who might happen\nto be in “territory” claimed by the B Side gang, to beat up.They saw the\nvictim, and based solely on the colour of his skin, which was dark, assumed,\nentirely mistakenly as it turned out, that he was a member of the African Mafia\nstreet gang.They attacked him, without any provocation whatsoever.The four\nmembers of the B Side gang hit the victim in the face, punched and kicked him,\nand one of them hit him with a bat that was wrestled away from the victim, who\nhad grabbed the bat from his car and was holding it in order to protect\nhimself.[18]In fact, the victim was not a member of any\nstreet gang at all.The attack was entirely unprovoked.This is a horrific\ncase of a victim being in the wrong place at the wrong time, with tragic and\npermanent, life altering results.[19]The victim was 19 years old.I heard a victim\nimpact statement read by the victim’s father.The impact of the offence on the\nvictim and on his family has been horrendous.The victim sustained a severe\nbrain injury from which he will never recover.He was hospitalized for 15\nmonths. He will never talk, walk, or be able to care for himself.It is not\nknown whether the victim is able to understand the condition he is in. He will\nrequire around the clock care for the rest of his life, which is, and will\ncontinue to be, a huge financial and physical strain on his family indefinitely.Both of his parents had to leave their jobs.His uncle had to give up\nuniversity. They have used all their savings, and have had to resort to social\nassistance and food banks.The victim’s family is a hardworking family that\ncame to Canada from Sudan looking for a peaceful life.The life of the young\nvictim and his family was, by the violent actions of M.O. and his associates,\nforever horrifically changed.[20]In terms of the Crown’s case against M.O., there\nwas an eyewitness who described that M.O. was punching and stomping on the\nvictim and said that M.O. was the last one to run away from the scene.A\nwitness who talked to M.O. the next day said M.O. had described how much “fun”\nthey had had beating up the victim.[21]M.O. says that after the punching and kicking\nstopped, he left, and that it was after that that one of the adult co-accused\nhit the victim with the baseball bat in the head.M.O. says he was not there\nwhen the victim was hit with the bat.The Crown has not called evidence to\nprove that he was.[22]For the purpose of sentencing, I accept that\nM.O.’s direct involvement was punching and kicking the victim, as part of an\noverall group attack, and then leaving the scene.[23]M.O.’s counsel says that if the victim had not\nbeen hit with the bat, his injuries may not have been as extensive as they\nwere.That may be.But even if M.O. left before the victim was hit with the\nbat, he did not go for help or do anything to assist the victim.He cannot now\nsay he is not responsible for the victim’s injuries that occurred as part and\nparcel of the overall attack.M.O. is responsible for the results of the full\nattack and the devastating injuries caused to the victim.The\nweapons offence[24]On February 21, 2009, just 12 days after the\naggravated assault, M.O. and another known gang member, one of his co-accused\non the aggravated assault in fact, were involved in a second incident.It was\nfrom this incident which arose the offence of possession of weapon in\ncontravention of a weapons prohibition that was imposed as part of a sentence\non a prior offence.On that date M.O., with another gang member, went to a\nresidence with a loaded sawed off shotgun.One of them knocked on the door.\nThen one of them fired the loaded shotgun into the home through a window, both\nof them knowing there were people inside the home.It is not determined\nwhether it was M.O. or his co-accused who had the gun, and which of them fired\nthe shot.M.O. says it was the co-accused who fired the gun and that he was\nrecruited by that co-accused to go along.The law on\nan adult sentence application[25]The sentencing of young persons is governed by\nthe Y.C.J.A.The test\nto be applied on the application for adult sentence[26]The relevant test for determining an application\nfor an adult sentence is set out in section 72(1) of the Y.C.J.A.It\nreads as follows:“72(1)In making its decision on an\napplication heard in accordance with section 71, the youth justice court shall\nconsider the seriousness and circumstances of the offence, and the age, maturity,\ncharacter, background and previous record of the young person and any other\nfactors that the court considers relevant, and(a)if it is of the opinion\nthat a youth sentence imposed in accordance with the purpose and principles set\nout in subparagraph 3(1)(b)(ii) and section 38 would have sufficient length to\nhold the young person accountable for his or her offendingbehaviour, it shall\norder that the young person is not liable to an adult sentence and thata\nyouth sentence just be imposed; and(b)if it is of the opinion\nthat a youth sentence imposed in accordance with the purpose and principles set\nout in subparagraph 3(1)(b)(ii) and section 38 would not have sufficient length\nto hold the young person accountable for his or her offending behaviour, it shall\norder that an adult sentence be imposed.”Y.C.J.A.\npurpose and principles[27]The primary focus of the section 72(1) test is\non the adequacy of the Y.C.J.A. to hold the young person “accountable”.An assessment of the adequacy of the Y.C.J.A.’s accountability regime\nhas to specifically, according to section 72(1), be considered according to the\npurpose and principles for sentencing young persons contained in the\ndeclaration of principle set out in section 3(1)(b)(ii) and in section 38 of\nthe Y.C.J.A.[28]Section 3(1)(b)(ii) requires the court to\nconsider the principle that accountability of adolescent offenders is limited,\nin comparison to that of adults.Specifically section 3(1)(b)(ii) reads:“thecriminal justice system for young\npersons must be separate from that of adults and emphasize…fair and\nproportionate accountability that is consistent with the greater dependency of\nyoung persons and their reduced level of maturity.”[29]By incorporating a consideration of section 38\ninto the section 72 test, the court, in deciding whether to impose an adult\nsentence, must consider the following principles:38(1) Purpose – The purpose of sentencing\nunder section 42(youth sentence) is to hold a young person accountable for an\noffence through the imposition of just sanctions that have meaningful\nconsequences for the young person and that promote his or her rehabilitation\nand reintegration into society, thereby contributing to the long-term\nprotection of the public.38(2) Sentencing principles – A youth\njustice court that imposes a youth sentence on a young person shall determine\nthe sentence in accordance with the principles set out in section 3 and the\nfollowing principles:(a)the sentence must not\nresult in a punishment that is greater than the punishment that would be\nappropriate for an adult who has been convicted of the same offence committed\nin similar circumstances;(b)the sentence must be\nsimilar to the sentences imposed in the region on similar young persons found\nguilty of the same offence committed in similar circumstances;(c)the sentence must be\nproportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the young person for that offence;(d)all available sanctions\nother than custody that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered\nfor all young persons…; and(e)subject to paragraph\n(c), the sentence must(i)be the least\nrestrictive sentence that is capable of achieving the purpose set out in\nsubsection(1),(ii)be the one that\nis most likely to rehabilitate the young person and reintegrate him or her into\nsociety, and(iii)promote a sense\nof responsibility in the young person, and an acknowledgment of the harm done\nto victims and the community.38(3) Factors to be considered - in\ndetermining a youth sentence, the youth justice court shall take into account(a)the degree of\nparticipation by the young person in the commission of the offence;(b)the harm done to\nvictims and whether it was intentional or reasonably foreseeable;(c)any reparation made by\nthe young person to the victim or the community;(d)the time spent in\ndetention by the young person as a result of the offence;(e)the previous findings\nof guilt of the young person; and(f)any other aggravating\nand mitigating circumstances related to the young person or the offence that\nare relevant to the purpose and principles set out in this section.[30]By specifically incorporating the purpose and\nprinciples of sections 3(1)(b)(ii) and 38 into the section 72 test, the court\nis required to actually weigh and balance all of the factors that it does when\nactually sentencing a young person.So, even though the court is not, on this\napplication, deciding what sentence is appropriate, the court needs to consider\nthe same factors that it would on a sentencing hearing, and then decide whether\na youth sentence will be sufficient to hold M.O. accountable for the aggravated\nassault and possession of weapon offences.The onus\non the application for adult sentence[31]The onus is on the Crown to satisfy the court\nthat a youth sentence would not have sufficient length to hold M.O.\naccountable(section 72(2) Y.C.J.A.).While in applying that onus, the\ncourt must bear in mind the very serious consequences of an adult sentence for\na young person, such that an adult sentence is to be ordered only when necessary\nto fulfil the objectives of the Y.C.J.A., the onus is not one of beyond\na reasonable doubt, or anything other than “to satisfy” as stated in section 72\n(R. v. A.O. (2007), 2007 ONCA 144 (CanLII), 84 O.R. (3d) 561(C.A.).What does\n“accountability” mean in the context of the section 72 test?[32]In R. v. A.O. the Ontario Court of\nAppeal said:“The combined effect of ss. 72, 3 and 38 is\nto identify accountability as the purpose that the youth court judge must\nconsider when deciding an application to impose an adult sentence on a young\nperson.Accountability is achieved through the imposition of meaningful\nconsequences for the offender and sanctions that promote his or her\nrehabilitation and reintegration into society.The purpose of accountability\nin this context would seem to exclude accountability to society in any larger\nsense or any notion of deterrence.” (paragraph 42)[33]Accordingly, “accountability” in the Y.C.J.A.\nand for the purposes of the court’s consideration in this case, must be\n“offender –centric” rather than “society – centric”. (R. v. A.O.; R. v. P.\n(B.W.); R. v. N. (B.V.) 2006 SCC 27 (CanLII).[34]In R. v. A.O., at paragraphs 45 through47, the Ontario Court of Appeal makes the following statement, which has been\nadopted in a number of Manitoba court decisions (for example R. v. B.K.S.,\n2009 MBQB 236 and R. v. B.K.T.S. 2009 MBQB 56 (CanLII)):“Thus, the question in this case is what is\nmeant by the terms accountability, meaningful consequences, rehabilitation and\nreintegration.One obvious point is that meaningful consequences cannot be\nsynonymous with rehabilitation and reintegration.Parliament has used the\ndifferent terms and is presumed to have intended different meanings.See for\nexample, R. v. Barnier, 1980 CanLII 184 (SCC), 1980 CanLII 184 (SC.C.), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1124 at\n1135-36; Winko v. British Columbia (forensic Psychiatric Institute),\n1999 CanLII 694 (SCC), 1999 CanLII 694 (S.C.C.), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625 at para 134.In our view, accountability in this context\nis the equivalent of the adult sentencing principle of retribution as explained\nby Lamer C.J.C. in R. v. M. (C.A.) 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), 1996 CanLII 230 (S.C.C.), (1996), 105\nC.C.C. (3d) 327 (S.C.C.) at paras 80 and 81:“Retribution in a criminal context, by\ncontrast , represents an objective, reasoned and measured determination of an\nappropriate punishment which properly reflects the moral culpability of\nthe offender, having regard to the intentional risk-taking of the offender, the\nconsequential harm caused by the offender, and the normative character of the\noffender’s conduct.Furthermore, unlike vengeance, retribution\nincorporates a principle of restraint; retribution requires the imposition of a\njust and appropriate punishment, and nothing more.…Retribution, as well, should be\nconceptually distinguished from its legitimate sibling, denunciation.Retribution requires that a judicial sentence properly reflect the moral\nblame-worthiness of that particular offender.The objective of\ndenunciation mandates that a sentence should also communicate society’s\ncondemnation of that particular offender’s conduct.In short, a sentence\nwith a denunciatory element represents a symbolic, collective statement that\nthe offender’s conduct should be punished for encroaching on our society’s\nbasic code of values as enshrined within our substantive criminal laws.\n[Underlining in original, italics added].”In our view, for a sentence to hold a young\nperson accountable in the sense of being meaningful it must reflect, as does a\nretributive sentence, “the moral culpability of the offender, having regard to\nthe intentional risk-taking of the offender, the consequential harm caused by\nthe offender, and the normative character of the offender’s conduct”.\n[Underlining omitted.]We see no other rational way for measuring\naccountability. ”[35]A consideration of the normative character of an\noffender’s behaviour must be decided in the context of societal values.But in\ndoing so, the court cannot add on to a youth sentence an element of general\ndeterrence or denunciation.(R. v. A.O., paragraph 48).[36]I do note the comments of Judge Nordheimer in the\nOntario Superior Court of Justice of Ontario in R. v Simpson- Rowe, at\nparagraphs 71 to 73.He says that to be included in “any other factor that the\ncourt considers relevant” is the interests of society.He says that while the\nfocus of the Y.C.J.A. is “offender-centric” it is not “offender-\nexclusive”, and points to the preamble of the Y.C.J.A., which refers to\na youth criminal justice system that commands respect, which must mean respect\nof the public.Judge Nordheimer says that he is not invoking denunciation\n(which has no application under the Y.C.J.A.) but he is just recognizing\nthat there is a legitimate public interest in the sentencing process involving\nyoung persons, and that such sentencing must reflect an expectation of an\nappropriate degree of accountability and responsibility from young persons.What\nconsiderations as to rehabilitation need to be addressed on an application for\nadult sentence?[37]In A.O., the Ontario Court of Appeal made\nsome important points as to how a court should consider the issue of possible\nrehabilitation of a young person.These include:•A sentencing judge should consider the evidence\nand evaluate a young person’s prospects for rehabilitation in the context of\nassessing whether a youth sentence would be sufficient to hold him accountable\nfor his offences (paragraph 57).•It is not necessary for a court to find that a\nyouth sentence must be sufficient to secure rehabilitation in order to preclude\nimposing an adult sentence, since it is just not possible to predict that\nrehabilitation will certainly occur (paragraph 58).•To succeed on an adult sentence application the\nCrown is not required to establish that the young person cannot be\nrehabilitated by a youth sentence (paragraph 59).Length of\nyouth sentence available vs. length of adult sentence[38]An important issue to consider is the length of\na youth sentence as opposed to what could be imposed on an adult for the same\noffence.[39]For the offence of aggravated assault, the Criminal\nCode imposes an adult sentence of a maximum of 14 years imprisonment.For\nthe offence of possession of a weapon while prohibited the Criminal Code\nimposes an adult sentence of a maximum of 10 years.[40]Section 42(2)(n) of the Y.C.J.A. sets out\nthe maximum length of a youth sentence for each of the offences in issue here,\nthe aggravated assault and the possession of a weapon in violation of a weapons\nprohibition, as beingan order of custody and supervision not to exceed two\nyears.Any term of probation imposed as an additional sanction to a custody\nand supervision sentence must be included in that two year total (section\n42(14)).[41]Further, section 42(15) of the Y.C.J.A.\nmandates that if more than one youth sentence is imposed with respect to\ndifferent offences, the continuous combined total duration of those youth\nsentences shall not exceed three years.Concurrent\nvs. consecutive sentences[42]The two offences for which the Crown seeks an\nadult sentence for M.O. were entirely separate from each other.They occurred\nat different times, involved different victims and took place in different\ncircumstances.The sentences for these two offences will need to be\nconsecutive to each other.The assault and sexual assault offences for which\nM.O. will be sentenced as a youth will also need to be consecutive to each\nother, and to the aggravated assault and weapons offences.The careless use of\nfirearm offence arose from the same incident as the possession of weapon in\nviolation of a weapons prohibition so it may be appropriate for concurrent\nsentences to be imposed for those offences.There are\nstill three youth offences for which M.O. remains to be sentenced[43]The fact that M.O. remains to be sentenced as a\nyouth on three other offences is relevant.[44]If M.O. is sentenced as a youth on the\naggravated assault and the possession of a firearm contrary to a weapons\nprohibition, as well as on the other three offences, the total maximum sentence\nfor all of those offences cannot exceed three years, inclusive of probation.If M.O. were given the total maximum sentence of three years for the two\noffences at issue on this application, that would leave three other offences,\nnamely a careless use of firearm, an assault and a sexual assault, all to be\nsomehow incorporated into the youth sentence, with no separate consequences for\nthose offences imposed on M.O.The effect\nof pre-sentence custody[45]M.O. has been in custody since March 3, 2009.He used four months of pre sentence custody for his September 2009 sentencing.That means he has spent 18 and a half months in custody pre-sentence that could\nbe applied toward the sexual assault, the assault and the other weapons offence\nhe remains to be sentenced on, and/or to either or both of the two offences now\nthe subject of the adult sentence application.[46]In R.\nv. P. (N.W.), 2008 MBCA 101 (CanLII), Mr. Justice Monnin of the Manitoba Court of\nAppeal made it clear that while a judge may give an accused a credit against\nany sentence that it may order for the time he has spent in custody that is not\ncredited to another sentence, the judge is not bound to do so, especially in\ncases where the maximum sentence or near maximum sentence is imposed, as long\nas the judge takes that time into consideration in determining an appropriate\nsentence.[47]Taking all of the above into account, this means\nthat the total maximum length of time that the court must consider as to\nwhether it is sufficient to hold M.O. accountable for the aggravated assault\nand the possession of weapon offence under the youth sentencing regime is as\nfollows:•three further years as a sentence (which would\nbe two years of custody and one year of community supervision), and•taking into account, but not noting as part of\nthe sentence, up to 18 and a half months in pre-sentence custody.[48]On the other hand, the court must also take into\naccount that there are still the sexual assault, the assault and the other\nweapons offence with respect to which some or all of that 18 and a half months\npre-sentence custody may be noted, or not noted but taken into account, and/or\nsome or all of the three years of potential sentencing time going forward will\nbe attributed.[49]In order that the sentences for the sexual\nassault, the assault and the other weapons offence not be offences for which no\nmeaningful sanction can be imposed upon M.O., it is really only the difference\nbetween the maximum of a three year sentence for the aggravated assault and\npossession of weapon, plus the taking into account of the time in pre-sentence\ncustody, and what the total combined sentences are for the sexual assault, assault\nand other weapons offence, that should be properly considered by the court.That is the amount of time with respect to which it should be determined\nwhether it is sufficient to hold M.O. accountable under the youth sentencing\nregime.THE\nANALYSISApplication\nof the Law to the Facts of this Case[50]Section 72 specifically says the court is to\nconsider the seriousness and circumstances of the offences and the age,\nmaturity, character, background and previous record of M.O. and any other\nfactors the court may consider relevant.Seriousness\nand circumstances of the offences[51]The aggravated assault carries a maximum adult\nsentence of 14 years in prison.It was a gang motivated attack by 4\nindividuals on a lone, unsuspecting individual, who had no gang affiliations\nand did not know his attackers. M.O. was part of the group that formulated the\nplan to attack a rival gang member, and this victim was chosen purely on the\nbasis of the colour of his skin.M.O. kicked and punched the victim\nrepeatedly.Although M.O. was not the one who hit the victim in the head with\nthe bat, he was present and participated in the attack until at least before\nthe hit with the bat, and did nothing to stop the attack or help the victim. It\nwas a horrific attack and involved the victim being beaten to the extent he\nsustained a brain injury, from which he will never recover.On a scale of\nseriousness, this offence is near the top of the scale.[52]The possession of a weapon in breach of a\nweapons prohibition is also serious. It carries a ten year maximum adult\nsentence.This is not just a situation where M.O. was found with a weapon. It\nwas a firearm and the firearm was actually used in the carrying out of a gang\nplan to intimidate someone in order to collect a gang related debt. Further the\nweapon was not just possessed. Its possession facilitated the commission of the\nfurther offence of careless use of the firearm by it being shot into a\nresidence where M.O. knew there were people inside. Again, on a seriousness\nscale, this is near the top.Age[53]M.O. is now 19 years old. At the time of both of\nthese offences he was 17 years and 2 months old.Maturity[54]The forensic reports make it clear that M.O. has\nsignificant impairments in intellectual functioning.His IQ is below 70.[55]Dr. Fisher says there is no evidence of mental\nhealth problems.[56]The Crown says the fact M.O. was willing to\nengage in adult behaviours such as using alcohol and drugs, not attending\nschool, living a transient lifestyle and belonging to a street gang and participating\nin gang activities, reflects some level of maturity.Basically, the argument\nis that if he is going to be involved in adult behaviours, he should be treated\nas an adult.[57]Dr. Fisher links M.O.’s behavioural difficulties\nto his cognitive challenges, at least in part.Academically, he functions far\nbelow grade level.Dr. Fisher opines that M.O.’s learning limitations likely\nhave played a role in M.O. becoming involved in criminal behaviour, due to\nnegative peer association, poor problem solving and emotional over-reactivity\nto feelings of frustration.[58]Dr. Somers says that these cognitive limitations\nmean that, although M.O. presents as having been socialized in a way that would\nbe regarded as being “street smart”, he in fact is likely to have limited\njudgment and to be naive in some aspects.He has limited problem solving\nabilities, limited capacity for inference, and limited ability to anticipate\nconsequences of current actions or to anticipate future events generally.[59]Dr. Somers says that M.O.’s limited remorse for\nhis actions, or limited empathy for others, is also partly explained by his\nlimited cognitive functioning.He is likely to be egocentric in viewing the\nworld.[60]So although in some ways M.O.’sbehaviour seems\nvery “adult-like”, Dr. Fisher and Dr. Somers’ reports, make it clear that M.O.\nis easily influenced by peers, is naive and tends to be a follower of others,\nand that these qualities are at least partly linked to his diminished\nintellectual functioning.Background\nand Character[61]M.O.’s parents separated when he was 12 years\nold.M.O. reports that both parents had assaulted him.His relationship with\nhis mother has improved.There has been some involvement with Child and Family\nServices.[62]Dr. Fisher, in the forensic assessment, states\nthat M.O.’s childhood“is replete with instability, including\nincidents of physical and sexual abuse, multiple residential moves,\ndifficulties in sustaining school placements, patterns of substance usage\nproblems and association with negative peers, all of which has resulted in a\ncycle of recurrent criminalized difficulties and periods of incarceration.”\n(p.1)[63]M.O. was last in regular school in January,\n2007, in grade 9 at Gordon Bell.His attendance was very poor.There were\nincidents of his defacing school property, there was an incident when M.O.\nbrought a knife to school, and there were journal entries M.O. wrote about\ncommitting violent acts.[64]According to M.O. himself, all of his friends\nand acquaintances are involved in criminal activity and most are gang members.He said he joined the B Side street gang in 2008 but says he quit in July 2010,\nalthough he has not told people in the community about this.[65]M.O. has used both drugs and alcohol, stating he\nbelieves he is addicted to marijuana.[66]M.O. expressed remorse about committing the\noffences.He wants to change his life, but says he does not think he needs any\ntype of counselling or programs to do so.[67]Dr. Fisher says that M.O.’s behaviour seems\nsituation specific.He has a low tolerance to cope with being upset so he\ncopes poorly and acts out in an aggressive way.He has significant limitations\nin his ability to use problem solving strategies.It is likely his history of\nabuse and early life experiences contributed to this pattern of internalized\nanger and resentment.Previous\nrecord[68]M.O. does have a prior youth criminal record.This record is as follows:On May 2, 2007 he was convicted of:•Theft over $5000•Occupant of motor vehicle taken without owner’s\nconsent•Mischief under $5000 x6•Theft under $5000 x2•Fail to appear•Fail to comply with undertaking x2•Possession of a weapon for dangerous purposeHe was sentenced to 18\nmonths probation on each charge, all concurrent.On October 26, 2007, he was convicted of:•Fail to comply with undertaking•Fail to comply with disposition x2He was sentenced\nto 30 hours community service work on each charge concurrent.On February 8, 2008, he was convicted of:•Fail to comply with disposition x 4•Possession of a ScheduleII substance (CDSA) x2•Fail to comply with undertaking x 3He was sentenced\nto 12 months probation on each charge, concurrent.On July 2, 2008 he was convicted of:•Assault with a weapon•Unauthorized possession of a prohibited or\nrestricted weaponHe was sentenced\nto 90 days custody and 45 days under supervision in community (and 85 days\npre-sentence custody), 6 months probation and a mandatory weapons prohibition.On June 23, 2008, he was convicted of•Fail to comply with sentence x5His sentence on\nthese offences was concurrent to the immediately previous convictions (85 days\npre-sentence custody, 90 days custody and 45 days under supervision in\ncommunity, and 6 months probation).On September 29, 2009, he was convicted of offences committed March\n3, 2009:•Possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose•Public mischiefHe was sentenced\nto pre-sentence custody of 4 months, and custody of 1 day, as well as a\nfirearms prohibition for 10 years.Other\nrelevant factors(A) Progress\nwhile in custody:Behaviour[69]M.O. has been in custody since March 3, 2009.He was at the Manitoba Youth Centre (“MYC”), but was moved to the Lakewood\nfacility.He returned to MYC on September 30, 2010 but was sent back to\nLakewood in October, 2010 due to his behaviour.He remained at Lakewood until\nrecently, when he was sent to Headingly Correctional Centre due to an incident\nat Lakewood which resulted in a criminal charge that is pending.[70]The pre-sentence report says M.O. has been\ninvolved in 31 incidents while in custody.[71]The sentencing materials filed by the Crown\ninclude incident reports about ten different incidents in which M.O. has had\nsome involvement while in custody, and oral submissions were made about another\nthree.A review of the reports that were provided makes it clear that M.O.’s\nbehaviour described in the reports generally falls into one of two categories:1.Incidents during which M.O. has expressedverbal and/or physical aggression toward staff; and,2.Incidents when he is provoked, usually by a\nverbal comment (being called a name, or being threatened) by another resident,\nand M.O. reacts aggressively, verbally and/or physically toward that other\nresident.[72]One of the reports references M.O. being\nthreatened by another resident, though M.O. did nothing to provoke him. There\nwas no retaliation.[73]Three of the incidents involved M.O. physically\nfighting or hitting another resident.In each of these incidents, M.O.’s\nactions were provoked by another resident calling him names.In two of these\nthree incidents, M.O. ended up being the one being the most physically\ninjured.In one incident, another resident made a derogatory comment to M.O.M.O. responded by punching that individual, and the resident who had made the\ncomment and another resident then beat M.O. to the point of unconsciousness, as\na result of which M.O. required hospital attention.[74]Another incident was initiated when another\nresident charged into M.O.’s room and M.O. reacted by punching him.[75]Three incidents demonstrated aggression toward\nstaff. One involved M.O. writing threatening things in a notebook about staff.When confronted, he took responsibility and apologized to staff.In another,\nwhen a staff member was restraining him, he threatened to spit at him.In the\nfinal incident, he was asked to return to his room.He refused and started\nthreatening staff, and advising he had a weapon in his room.The staff note\nthat his comments were “bizarre and random” and that “M.O.’s comments were\nextremely out of context to the situation and he became more confused as the\nincident went on.”[76]One incident report referenced a sexual assault\nby M.O. of another resident.A criminal charge was laid. M.O. has been tried,\nand convicted of that offence.[77]One incident was that M.O. got his restraints\noff and was waving them around.He calmed down and followed direction.[78]Since the initial submissions were made by\ncounsel on the Crown’s application, there were three further incidents in\ncustody. One of these involvedM.O. physically lunging at another resident,\none of the same individuals with whom he has had trouble before during previous\nincidents.A second incident involved M.O. threatening staff when he was told\nto remove gang related graffiti in his room, and when told he could be charged,\nsaid he “didn’t care”.The third incident involved M.O. allegedly threatening\nstaff physically with a broom to the extent that staff had to deploy pepper\nspray to disarm M.O.M.O. was criminally charged in relation to this last\nincident, and that charge is pending.As a result of that charge, M.O. has\nbeen moved to Headingly Correctional Institute, an adult facility.[79]M.O. himself told the author of the pre-sentence\nreport that he often becomes angry and, when he does, he swears, threatens,\ncauses damage and sometimes gets involved in physical fights. He acknowledges\nbecoming easily frustrated.Clearly, M.O. recognizes his difficulty\ncontrolling his anger, and his impulsivity.Educational\nprogress while in custody[80]The pre-sentence report stated that according to\nthe teacher at MYC, M.O. had made a satisfactory effort on his school\nassignments, had a good attitude toward school, got along with most of his\npeers in school, but had issues getting along with certain classmates, and\ncould be antagonistic and disrespectful at times to classmates.Social\nprogress while in custody[81]The pre-sentence report says that M.O. says he\nquit the B Side gang in July 2010, and that he has told people in custody about\nthis but not in the community.However corrections records and incidents in\ncustody suggest recent gang activity on the part of M.O.[82]M.O. says he had anger management counselling at\nMYC in 2009 but it did not help him better control his anger.[83]The pre-sentence report says M.O. does seem to\nbe trying harder to make a change.He has good days when he follows directions\nwell and interacts well with peers.[84]The incidents that M.O. has been involved in\nwhile in custody, though, confirm that M.O. continues to have difficulties\ngetting along with at least certain peers.(B) Prospects\nfor rehabilitation[85]It is critical to consider any evidence about\nthis, in determining whether a youth sentence could be long enough to\nrehabilitate M.O. so he could be reintegrated into society.[86]M.O. is assessed by the psychologists who met\nwith him as a very high risk individual with respect to recidivism.[87]As previously indicated, Dr. Fisher links M.O.’s\nbehaviour in terms of his lack of impulse control and anger management\nproblems, which in turn have led to criminal behaviour, to his intellectual\ndeficits.Dr. Fisher says that given M.O.’s significant cognitive limitations,\nit is difficult to reassure the court he will be easily supervised in the\ncommunity.He says that it is questionable as to the extent to which he could\nbenefit from traditional correctional programs and learn from those programs to\neffect change at a community level.He needs counselling to help learn better\nanger management and impulse controls.But when he does return to the\ncommunity he will need a high degree of structure in his daily routine, and\nshould be referred to the supported living program.[88]Dr. Somers says that medication is not the\nanswer to deal with M.O.’s problematic behaviours.His behaviours are related\nto his cognitive impairment, and it is accommodations made by those in his\nenvironment that are required.[89]Dr. Somers says that long term treatment, in\nboth scope and delivery will be required for M.O. to address his issues, but it\nis also important to modify his surroundings and experiences.In other words,\nM.O.’ssuccessful management in the community depends not just on M.O. getting\ntreatment, but also on accommodations being made by those around him.[90]Dr. Fisher says that attempts have been made\nwith M.O. at counselling while in custody, but with little success.[91]M.O. has stated that he wants to change his\nlife, but does not think he needs programming or counselling to do so.[92]M.O. needs counselling and treatment to address\nhis issues long term.He has been in custody for over 18 months.The fact he\ndoes not seem to recognize that he needs this counselling and assistance, and\nthat he continues to exhibit the behaviours that are of concern, namely\nimpulsive and sometimes violent or threatening actions toward peers or people\nin authority, suggest he has not advanced very far, if at all, in his\nrehabilitation to date, and that much more needs to be done before M.O. can\nsuccessfully reintegrate into the community.Application\nof the section 72 test:[93]The court must specifically look at the factors\nset out in sections 38(2) and (3) of the Y.C.J.A.:“s. 38(2)…(a)the sentence must not result in a punishment that is greater than the\npunishment that would be appropriate for an adult who has been convicted of the\nsame offence committed in similar circumstances”An adult co-accused involved in the same aggravated assault as M.O.\nhas already pleaded guilty to the aggravated assault and has been sentenced.Mr. Kirstein was 19 years old at the time of the incident. He was sentenced to\nhis time in custody of 13 months and 25 days at double credit and his one day\ncourt appearance. His sentence was the equivalent of nearly 28 months. (R.\nv. Kirstein, June 29, 2010 Martin, J.).So, we have a situation in which an adult was sentenced not for “the\nsame offence committed in similar circumstances”, but in fact, for exactly the\nsame offence.But the “circumstances” of M.O. and of Mr. Kirstein are not the\nsame. The Crown’s case against Mr. Kirstein had difficulties.Also, very\nimportantly, Mr. Kirstein cooperated with the Crown in its prosecution of other\naccused in this matter. The 28 month sentence was for Mr. Kirstein’s\nparticipation in the aggravated assault only, and not for any other offences.Accordingly, I conclude that s. 38(2)(a) does not mandate that M.O. be given a\nsentence of 28 months or less.(b)the sentence must be similar to the sentences imposed in the region on\nsimilar young persons found guilty of the same offence committed in similar\ncircumstances.I will review below a number of authorities which canvass sentences\nfor aggravated assaults for young persons and for adults.(c)the sentence must be proportional to the seriousness of the offence and\nthe degree of responsibility of the young person for that offence.Other than an offence from which death of the victim resulted, the\naggravated assault committed by M.O. is the most serious of offences.(d)all\navailable sanctions other than custody that are reasonable in the circumstances\nshould be considered for all young persons.Given the violent nature of the offence and M.O.’s record, there is\nno sanction other than custody that could reasonably be considered.(e)subject to paragraph (c), the sentence must:a.be the least\nrestrictive sentence that is capable of achieving the purpose set out in\nsubsection (1),b.be the one that is most\nlikely to rehabilitate the young person and reintegrate him or her into\nsociety, andc.promote a sense of\nresponsibility in the young person, and an acknowledgement of the harm done to\nvictims and the community.[94]Under section 38(3) the factors to be\nconsidered are:(a)the degree of\nparticipation by the young person in the commission of the offence.M.O. fully participated in both offences.(b)the harm done to the victims and whether it was intentional or\nreasonably foreseeableThe\nharm done to the victim was extreme and irreparable.Short of being killed,\nthe harm done was of the worst type.He has been forever robbed of his quality\nof life, of control over his own thoughts and movements and of his ability to\nmake choices.His family members have been robbed of the son, brother, nephew\nand cousin that they knew, and have had imposed on them a lifetime\nresponsibility of providing full time care.The harm caused was intentional.The whole purpose of the attack\nwas to beat a member of a rival gang.The harm that resulted was reasonably\nforeseeable.(c)any\nreparation made by the young person to the victim or the community.M.O. has made no reparation(d)the time\nspent in detention by the young person as a result of the offence.M.O. has spent 18 months in pre sentence custody(e)the\nprevious findings of guilt of the young person.M.O. has a significant record, set out earlier(f))relevant\naggravating and mitigating factors related to the young person or the offence.The only mitigating factor is that M.O. entered guilty pleas to\nthese offences, thereby ensuring convictions were secured.By entering such\npleas, M.O. takes responsibility for the offences.[95]As to the aggravated assault there are the\nfollowing aggravating factors:•it was perpetrated on an unsuspecting victim,\nwho was entitled to be where he was;•it was entirely unprovoked;•the attack was planned by those perpetrating it,\nincluding M.O. The plan was to find a member of a rival gang in their gang’s\nterritory and beat him;•it was a group attack on a lone victim, targeted\nbased on the colour of his skin;•it was gang motivated;•a weapon was used by one of the co-accused;•the attack was relentless and repeated;•even after the victim was on the ground and not\nmoving, he was further assaulted;•the victim was left lying on the ground, beaten;\nM.O. did nothing to get help for the victim;•at no time did M.O. cease the attack;•the harm done to the victim is irreparable,\nlifelong and has robbed him, and his family, of quality of life; and•M.O.’s level of moral blameworthiness is very\nhigh.His actions were one step away from manslaughter.[96]As to the weapons offence, the aggravating\nfactors are:•The firearm was actually used•He knew there were people inside the house when\nthe firearm was discharged•The offence was gang motivatedAlso, at the time of both offences, M.O. was on probation.Consideration\nof the authorities:Cases\nprovided by the CrownAppropriateness\nofyouth sentence[97]In the R. v. A.O. case, two 16 year\nolds pleaded guilty to 6 armed robberies.Each had a significant youth record\nfor offences including violence.Each was on multiple probation orders.The\nrobberies were of convenience stores, involved the use of disguises and in some\ncases a knife, and in one an imitation firearm. Several of the clerks were\nbeaten and had permanent injuries.Both offenders had been involved in a\ncouple of institutional incidents while in custody. Each had spent two and a\nhalf years in pre-sentence custody.The Crown’s application to have both\nsentenced as adults was granted.The offenders were given pre-sentence credit\nfor three years and sentences going forward of eight years. These sentences\nwere upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal.[98]In The Queen v. R.L.2009 MBQB 137 (CanLII),\nMcKelvey, J.ordered an adult sentence be imposed on a young person for four\ncounts of robbery with a firearm.These were robberies of convenience stores,\ndone with co-accused.All wore disguises. The adult co-accused brandished an\nunloaded rifle at all four locations.The accused was 16 and had no criminal\nrecord.His involvement in the robberies was putting the stolen goods into a\nbag and carrying the bag from the scene, but he was also responsible for the\noffences as a whole.No physical injuries at all were suffered by any of the\nclerks involved in these incidents, and there was no overt physical violence.\nThe harm to the victims was psychological. This decision is currently under\nappeal.[99]In R. v. Bird, 2008 ABQB 327 (CanLII),an adult\nsentence was imposed on a young person.She was found guilty, as a party, of\nmanslaughter, aggravated sexual assault and kidnapping.She was 17 years old\nat the time and had no record. She ceased being a willing participant in the\noffences at some point but had been involved in the planning. She came from an\nunfortunate background, and had a substance abuse problem.She had been in\npre-sentence custody for 3 years.The court held, even taking into account\nthat 3 years, that a further sentence of three years would not be sufficient to\nhold her accountable and ordered an adult sentence.[100]In R. v. B.K.T.S. 2009 MBQB 56 (CanLII), the Crown applied for an\nadult sentence for a young person on one count of armed robbery of a gas\nstation, wearing a disguise while committing an indictable offence and failing\nto comply with a condition of an undertaking. He was 15 at the time of the\noffences, and was 19 years old at the time of the Crown application.He had no\nrecord, though had been bound by two release orders at the time of the offences.He was subsequently convicted of offences that had pre-dated the armed robbery,\nincluding manslaughter, for which he was sentenced as an adult. An adult\nsentence was imposed.[101]In R. v. Simpson-Rowe (2009) Ont. S.C., the Crown applied for\nan adult sentence for an offender found guilty of one count of second degree\nmurder, two counts of aggravated assault and five counts relating to a firearm.\nHe was 17 years old at the time. He had spent more than three years in\npre-sentence custody. He has a number of other convictions.He had a troubled\nupbringing.He had ADHD.There were incidents in custody. While in custody\nhe did work on his education and there had been some positive behaviour\nchanges, and a noticeable improvement in his attitude. He had the cognitive\nabilities to be successful. An adult sentence was ordered.[102]In R. v. Smith 2009 MBQB 54 (CanLII), the Crown sought an adult\nsentence for a young person who pleaded guilty to manslaughter.The incident\nwas a beating that resulted in the victim’s death. He was 17 at the time of the\noffence and was 21 at the time of the hearing of the application. An adult\nsentence was imposed.[103]In R. v. J.J.T. 2010 MBQB 216 (CanLII), Suche J. held an adult\nsentence was required for an offender for three counts of first degree murder and\nthree counts of attempted murder. He was 15 at the time.He was a high ranking\ngang member and continued his gang activities in custody. In this case, the\ncourt did comment that the offender’s activity was a case of a younger boy\nfollowing older males.The court pointed to the offender’s vulnerabilities and\nthe “welcoming arms of gangs” turned the scenario “into a recipe for the most\ndeadly silence”.There was evidence that the offender could eventually safely\nbe reintegrated into society. But the court specifically pointed to his\nentrenchment in gang life, and said the real and dangerous presence of gangs in\nand out of institutions mean that such reintegration can only happen with years\nof intense therapy and programming and a dedication to change.The court held\na youth sentence would not provide a meaningful consequence and may well not\nallow enough time for the treatment necessary to permit his safe reintegration\ninto society.[104]In R. v. Lights, 2007 ONCJ 173 (CanLII), the Crown sought an adult\nsentence for an offender for his involvement in two serious offences. The first\nwas a home invasion type of robbery during which a victim was shot and nearly\ndied. A group of four committed the offence, and the group beat the victim and\none shot him.The offender’s precise role could not be determined.The\nCrown could not prove he was the one who fired the gun, and the evidence\nsuggested he was not.The second incident was a robbery with firearm and\nrelated offences again committed with a group of people.Again the Crown could\nnot prove the offender’s precise role in this group of offences.He\nparticipated in the robbery and attack, but it could not be proved that he\ncarried the weapon or was personally involved in the assault. The fact his\nexact participation could not be proved was not a reason not to impose an adult\nsentence. He was fully responsible for the offences.The offender was 17 at\nthe time and was 18 at the time of the hearing.He had a youth record for some\nserious offences. Both offences were “missions” carried out by a street gang\nthat he was a member of. Adult sentences were ordered.[105]In R. v. M.K. (J. Meyers, June 27, 2002), a young person was\nsentenced as an adult. The offender, who was on a temporary pass from the youth\ndetention centre while serving open custody, with a co accused, beat a 69 year\nold man.After a number of punches, the man crumpled to the ground,\nunconscious.But the offender and his co-accused continued to kick him about\nhis body and head.They then beat him with a baseball bat they took from him\nand with pickets from the victim’s fence. They beat him beyond recognition.The offender was 17 at the time.The victim suffered serious injuries.He had\nto have extensive reconstructive surgery.He struggled every day with pain to\nhis head and body and he will never fully recover.The offender had a\nsignificant record.The pre-sentence report showed an explosive temper, and\nthat the offender was easily agitated. He was abused as a child.He was doing\nwell in custody and working on his GED.He had ended his gang involvement.But he had a drug and alcohol problem and he had not embraced anger management\nprogramming.He was hard to manage in custody.He was given a sentence\nequivalent to 5 years.Cases\nprovided by defenceAppropriateness\nof youth sentence[106]R. v N.(P.) [2008] B.C.W.L.D. 5739,\nBCPC.Two youth offenders punched and kicked a victim in the face and head,\nand abandoned him unconscious on the ground.The victim was in a coma for five\nweeks and had traumatic brain injury resulting in memory impairment.Accused\npleaded guilty to aggravated assault. Crown applied for adult sentences.\nAccused had no record and were low to moderate risk to reoffend.They pursued\ntheir education while in custody and had supportive families.Accused were\nsentenced under the Y.C.J.A. because principles allowed a sentence of\nsufficient length to hold them accountable for their offending behaviour.They\nreceived credit of 8 months pre-sentence custody, and a custody and supervision\norder of 6 months, and probation of 11 months.One of the accused was 15 at\nthe time and the other was 17. Neither had a criminal record.In deciding a\nyouth sentence was sufficient, the court relied on the fact these youths had no\nprior record; they had no established pattern of aggressive or violent\nbehaviour; the incident was isolated in the sense it was not part of an ongoing\ngang war; neither accused had any psychological disorder nor any intellectual\ndeficits; there was no evidence of a substance abuse problem; they had\nsupportive families; they both did well in custody with one exception, ; they\nhad pursued their education and were respectful to staff and peers; and prior\nto this incident they were not living an antisocial lifestyles – they were not involved\nwith gangs, and their risk to reoffend was low to moderate.Also the court\nfound that the actual prison sentence that would be imposed if sentenced as\nadults would almost certainly be within the range that could be imposed in a\nyouth sentence.[107]In R. v. D.B. 2008 SCC 25 (CanLII), [2008] 2 S.C.R. 3, the SCC held the onus\nprovision for a presumptive offence is unconstitutional.A young person got\ninto a fight with another and knocked him to the ground and punched him.The\nvictim died.The young person pleaded guilty to manslaughter.He was 17 years\nold, and was given a 3 year youth sentence. The Supreme Court of Canada\nconfirmed that a number of the provisions of the Y.C.J.A. recognize the\npresumption of reduced moral blameworthiness of young persons.Sentences for\naggravated assault generally - adults[108]In R. v. Besaw 2004 MBCA 196 (CanLII), [2005] 7 W.W.R. 618, the Manitoba Court of\nAppeal, reduced the sentence of anadult convicted of aggravated assaultto\n16 months incarceration.The accused had no prior record, expressed remorse\nand had good prospects for rehabilitation.The incident arose as a\nspontaneous fight.[109]In R. v. Taylor 2008 MBPC 21 (CanLII), an adult was sentenced to a\nconditional sentence order of 2 years less a day for an aggravated assault.The victim actually struck the offender in the head first; the response of the\noffender was to punch the victim, who fell backwards and the offender fell on\ntop of him; the offender then took hold of the victim by his upper body or head\nand caused the back of the victim’s head to hit the pavement.The result was\npermanent damage to the victim.He sustained head injuries that resulted in\nhim being on life support with no prospect for rehabilitation.The offender\nhad no record.Sentences for\naggravated assault – young persons (no application for adult sentence)[110]In R. v. C.(K.), 2007 MBCA 117 (CanLII), a young person pleaded guilty\nto aggravated assault.The accused had no prior record.The accused was\nsentenced to 12 months.On appeal the time in custody of 4.5 months was noted,\nand a sentence of 7.5 months custody and supervision was made.The accused had\nbeen involved in a fight with several other female youths and stabbed the\nvictim in the back.[111]In R. v. C. (W.K.) 2004 CarswellBC 575, the BC Provincial Court dealt with sentencing of a\nyouth , 17, involved in a senseless and tragic beating of a victim.The\naccused had spent 5 months in pre-sentence custody, and was found guilty of\naggravated assault after trial. Another of the co-accused received three months\ncustody and supervision plus a six month ISSP order and one year probation.He\nsuffered a head injury and long term disability.He needed assistance with all\naspects of daily living.The accused did take steps to help the victim after\nthe beating.This accused had little or no insight into his conduct. He denied\nhis involvement and had been reluctant to participate in programming.He was\n14 at the time. He had a chaotic upbringing.He had some record but it was not\nsignificant.The Crown did not seek an adult sentence.The sentence was\nequivalent to ten months custody and supervision to be followed by an ISSP\norder and then one year of probation.[112]InR. v. M. (T.)) 2005 ABPC 157 (CanLII), 2005 CarswellAlta865, a 17 year old, along\nwith a 16 year old co-accused, engaged in an unprovoked, vicious assault on the\nvictim.He pleaded guilty to aggravated assault.The victim told the accused\nto pick up his litter. In response, the offender assisted the co-accused in\nstriking the victim. The two young persons hit the victim about 50 times.This young person broke off the assault and left while the co-accused continued\nthe assault.The victim was rendered unconscious.He sustained lacerations\nrequiring sutures, and a severe concussion. He missed work. He sustained\nphysical effects including a brain injury and emotional trauma.The offender\nhad no record. A sentence of 333 days custody and supervision was imposed.[113]In R. v. T. (L.) 2007 CarswellOnt 9586, a number of young\npersons were charged with aggravated assault.The group physically beat up the\nvictim, kicking him and punching him in the face. An adult accused held a knife\nto the throat of the victim.He was knocked unconscious and had serious\ninjuries to his face.The young person was not the main perpetrator and was a\nfollower.He did kick the complainant three or four times. Each was sentenced\nto the equivalent of 24 months for the aggravated assault.The sentence was\nadjusted on appeal due to the sentencing judge’s failure to properly deal with\npre-sentence custody.[114]In R. v. C.N. 2006 CanLII 32902 (ON CA), 2006CanLII 32902, the Ontario Court of Appeal\nsentenced a young person who, with three others, stalked another young person,\ncaught him and, while his friends pinned the victim to the ground, the young\nperson took a box cutter and repeatedly slashed and stabbed the victim.He pleaded\nguilty to aggravated assault.The youth court judge imposed a sentence of two\nyears probation.The appeal court replaced that sentence with a custody and\nsupervision order of nine months, and six months probation. The offender was\n17.He was very remorseful.He had been attending counselling. He had\ninsight. He was pursuing college.Decision[115]In applying the test in section 72(1) of the Y.C.J.A., I have\nconsidered the purpose and principles set out in section 3(1)(b)(ii) and\nsection 38, and applied all of the information received by the court regarding\nM.O. and the offences.The two offences in question were most serious and were\ncommitted in the context of many aggravating factors.M.O. has significant\ncognitive deficits which mean that he will require long term and significant\ncounselling and treatment to get him to a point where he can successfully and\nsafely reintegrate into the community, and even then, major accommodations will\nneed to be made for him.He has already spent significant time in custody and\nhis behaviour in custody indicates that rehabilitative efforts have had little\nsuccess to date and that in fact M.O. does not yet recognize that he requires\nassistance to improve his behavioural functioning.[116]In this case, and bearing in mind the other offences for which M.O.\nremains to be sentenced as a youth, the length of time he has spent in\npre-sentence custody, and the maximum sentences that are available under the Y.C.J.A.,\nI find that a youth sentence will not be of sufficient length to hold M.O.\naccountable for the aggravated assault and the possession of a weapon contrary\nto a weapons prohibition. Specifically, the maximum sentence available of two\nyears custody and one year community supervision, even taking into account all\nof the time M.O. has spent in custody pre-sentence, is not sufficient to hold\nhim accountable for his offending behaviour.[117]I find that the Crown has satisfied me that an adult sentence should\nbe imposed on M.O. for these offences. Accordingly, I grant the Crown’s\napplication and order that M.O. be sentenced as an adult for the offences of\naggravated assault and possession of a weapon contrary to a weapons\nprohibition, for which he was convicted on July 8, 2010.CARLSON,\nP.J.Catherine Carlson, P.J.E R R A T U MThere is one correction in the above\njudgement, as follows:In paragraph 50, page 13, ending at Seriousness\nand circumstances of the offences, the paragraph should read:THE\nANALYSISApplication\nof the Law to the Facts of this Case[50]Section 72\nspecifically says the court is to consider the seriousness and circumstances of\nthe offences and the age, maturity, character, background and previous record\nof M.O. and any other factors the court may consider relevant.Dated this 10th day of February,\n2011.___Catherine\nCarlson"}

SangJ.\nRosenCounsel for YiuwahChanTUESDAY,\nOCTOBER 3, 2006R E A S O N SO NS E N T E N C I N GARMSTRONG, J.\n(Orally):Mr. Chan has pleaded guilty to the offence of\nmanslaughter.A detailed agreed statement of facts was filed as an exhibit.Based on his guilty plea and admissions, I have found him guilty of\nmanslaughter in the death of his wife Caroline Lee-Chan.In considering the sentence I should impose, I have\nreviewed my notes of the sentencing submissions of counsel, the authorities to\nwhich I have been referred, the agreed statement of facts, and the post-mortem\nexamination report.The taking of a human life is clearly a terrible\ntragedy and a most serious offence.To determine the appropriate sentence in\ncases of manslaughter, courts have viewed the offence in the context in which\nit occurred, including the relationship between the deceased and the offender,\nand the personal characteristics of the offender.My task is to impose a sentence that reflects the\npurpose and principles of sentencing contained in sections 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal\nCode.The sentence must contain a strong denunciatory element to express\nsociety's abhorrence at the killing of a human being by another.It must deter\nMr. Chan from re-offending, and deter others from committing offences.It must\npromote a sense of responsibility in Mr. Chan for the serious nature of his\ncrime, and acknowledge the harm done to his family and the community.It must\nalso provide him with a measure of assistance with his rehabilitation.However, the sentence must be both proportionate to\nthe gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.As I have said, killing a human being is a most serious offence.In assessing\nhis moral culpability, I have examined Mr. Chan's circumstances as well as\nthose surrounding the offence.I have weighed the aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances and reviewed the authorities for guidance in order to arrive at a\nsentence that I believe reflects the purpose and principles of sentencing.Turning first to Mr. Chan's circumstances, Mr. Chan\nwas 61 years old at the time of this offence.He was born and raised in Hong\nKong, and became a Canadian citizen.He was married to Caroline Lee-Chan for\n35 years.She was ten years older, and was also born and raised in Hong Kong.They have one daughter who resides in Hong Kong, but who is in court today with\nher husband.They were married for 35 years.He worked\nfull-time as the sole supporter until his health no longer enabled him to do\nso, and then he worked part-time as a salesman with two cemetery companies.He\nthen returned to school, trained as a support worker for the elderly, and\nworked part-time in two long term care facilities.Apart from this offence, Mr. Chan appears to be a\ndecent, honest, hardworking man, a good father and husband.As for the background to the offence, some time\nafter his daughter went back to Hong Kong, Mr. Chan and his wife became empty\nnesters and drifted apart.Caroline Lee-Chan was religious, much more so than\nMr. Chan, and became more devout as time went on.She built a shrine in her\nhouse.She thought she suffered from various physical ailments and used\nChinese medicines to remedy them, but in reality she was a 72 year old healthy\nwoman.It is fair to say that in recent years the difference in their\nlifestyles, interests, and age created a strain on the marriage between Mr.\nChan and his wife.They began to live increasingly separate lives while living\nin the same house.After the death of her older sister in 2004, Ms.\nChan spent more time in Hong Kong.She left Mr. Chan alone in Canada and met\noften and for long periods of time with her Buddha master.This added further\nstrain to the marriage.It is true that as a result of the failing marriage\nMr. Chan began a relationship with another woman who he had met in 2001, and to\nwhom he had been providing assistance.However, that relationship did not\nadvance until 2004.It is significant that there was no history of\nmarital conflict between Mr. Chan and his wife, and, in particular, no\nincidents of actual or threatened domestic abuse.This incident stands as an\nunusual event which was out of character for both Mr. Chan and his wife.Turning now then to the circumstances of the\nhomicide of August 2nd, 2005, I note that the details of the day leading up to\nthe homicide were provided by Mr. Chan.He spent most of the day together with\nhis wife, but in the early evening she began to prepare herbal medicines which\nemitted a strong smell.Mr. Chan voiced his displeasure, and a verbal argument\nensued.Later that evening, around midnight, when Mr. Chan was retiring to his\nown bedroom to get ready for bed, Ms. Chan was in her prayer room burning\nincense and heating herbal medicines, resulting, again, in a strong smell.Mr. Chan again voiced his displeasure, and another\nargument ensued which carried over into the deceased's bedroom.Mr. Chan lost\nhis temper and became progressively more angry.He grabbed his wife by the\narms and shook her.She tried to break free, a scuffle ensued, and the couple\nended up on the bed, Mr. Chan on top of the deceased.They thrashed around on\nthe bed.The bed frame moved forward, and Ms. Chan's head and shoulders went\ndown between the bed and the wall.Mr. Chan left her in that position, where\nher breathing was compromised.A short time later, when he did not hear her moving\naround, and after he had time to calm down, Mr. Chan returned to the bedroom\nand checked for signs of life.He did not find any.He found Ms. Chan dead.He panicked and began to think how he could avoid responsibility.He delayed calling 9-1-1 for assistance until the\nnext morning.In the meantime, he changed the scene, he got rid of the\nbedding, and he lied to the 9-1-1 operator, as well as his daughter and his\nsister-in-law, about what happened.He denied responsibility for the offence in police\ninterviews in October, 2005 and March, 2006.It was not until March, 2006,\nwhen Dr. Polanen's report was prepared, that the cause of death became known.It is significant that there was an absence of\ntrauma to any other part of the body but the neck of Ms. Chan.There was no\nevidence of brutality.Dr. Polanen concluded that the death resulted from\npressure on the neck in a woman with upper posterior neck trauma.He\nsubsequently clarified that he ruled out manual strangulation.In his opinion,\nthe injuries suffered by the deceased were consistent with positional asphyxia,\nconsistent with the deceased having slipped between the bed and the wall during\nthe assault by Mr. Chan, which caused her head to wedge forward, putting\npressure on her neck and stopping her breathing.It is clear that there was no punching, no direct\ntrauma to the face as is commonly seen.In fact, the deceased's necklace was\nintact.There were no marks of scratching, ligatures, or abrasion from the\nchain moving.Turning to the range of sentence for manslaughter\noffences, I note that while the maximum penalty is life imprisonment, the range\nof fit sentences for manslaughter is very broad.It includes suspended\nsentences at one end of the range, through reformatory sentences, to long\npenitentiary sentences.The Court of Appeal has countenanced conditional\nsentences, and, although it has found longer penitentiary sentences to be\nappropriate, the court has referred to a sentence of ten years' imprisonment as\nin the high end of the range of sentences for manslaughter:R. v. Simcoe\n[2002] O.J. No. 884 (Ont.C.A.), R. v. Craig (2003), 2003 CanLII 12866 (ON CA), 177 C.C.C. (3d) 321\n(Ont.C.A.).In this case there are several serious aggravating\nfactors.The offence was one of domestic violence.Mr. Chan\nabused his wife by assaulting her.This is an aggravating factor under section\n718.2(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code.His failure to seek immediate assistance for his\nwife is also an aggravating factor.Waiting until the next morning to call\n9-1-1 showed that he place his interests ahead of his wife's.Finally, Mr. Chan's post-offence conduct is\naggravating.He rearranged the scene to hide the assault, he lied to the 9-1-1\noperator, he went through the charade of performing CPR when he knew his wife\nwas not breathing, he got rid of the bed sheets, and lied to his daughter and\nhis sister-in-law as to what had happened.On the other hand, there are mitigating factors.They include the following:This was an uncharacteristic incident.There was\nno history of violence and Mr. Chan is, in my estimation, unlikely to be a\ndanger to the community.Mr. Chan has no criminal record.He entered a guilty plea which shows remorse and\nacceptance of responsibility shortly after he retained counsel, although he\nmade earlier denials to the police.He cooperated in the preparation of the\nagreed statement of facts.This was an early guilty plea, arranged after a\njudicial pretrial conference, and well in advance of the preliminary hearing.There was no weapon used.The degree of violence is at the lower end of the\nscale in comparison to other cases.The cause of death was unintentional, although\nforeseeable.It was an involuntary manslaughter, to coin the phrase used by\nJustice Watt in R. v. Norman [2005] O.J. No. 1073.Grace Chan, his daughter, is supportive of her\nfather.While she grieves the death of her mother, she does not want to lose\nboth parents through this tragedy, especially considering his age and the state\nof his health.I note also that, while not a factor of great\nweight in mitigation, it cannot be said that there was a total absence of\nprovocation, as contended by the Crown.Caroline Lee-Chan knew the herbal\nmedicine and incense had caused great annoyance, and led to an argument with\nher husband early in the evening, yet she persisted in preparing it again later\nthat evening.The defendant then lost his temper, and the argument and tragic\nassault ensued.What is the appropriate sentence?The Crown seeks a sentence of ten years'\nimprisonment, based largely on cases from the trial courts of other provinces.Although of some assistance, these cases are somewhat distinguishable on their\nfacts.Generally, they involve offences committed with firearms and weapons,\nor offenders with criminal records and/or on court orders at the time of the\noffence.I note that manslaughter committed with a firearm carries a minimum\nsentence of four years imprisonment under section 236 of the Criminal Code.Defence counsel seeks a sentence of three years'\nimprisonment based on the decisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal and the\nSuperior Court of Justice.In this case, while there are serious aggravating\nfactors that call for a substantial prison term, there are significant\nmitigating factors.Everything considered, I place this case at the lower end\nof the range.In my opinion, the appropriate sentence is in the range of four\nto five years' imprisonment.Mr. Chan, you have spent seven months in pretrial\ncustody, which I regard as the equivalent of 14 months, allowing the usual\ndouble credit.I sentence you to a term of three years'\nimprisonment in a federal penitentiary.The information will be marked time served seven\nmonths, plus three years' imprisonment.There will also be three orders on consent:There will be an order prohibiting you from\npossessing any firearms, weapons, ammunition, or explosive substance, or any\nother items listed in section 109 of the Criminal Code for the balance\nof your life;There will be an order under section 487.051 of the\nCriminal Code requiring you to provide such samples of bodily substances\nas may be required for forensic DNA analysis and inclusion in the national\ndatabank;There will also be an order requiring you to\nforfeit the items listed in Appendix A, although these items did not play any\npart in this offence.I wish to thank Mr. Kasko, the Crown, and Mr. Rosen\nfor their assistance.**********I, Kathy Pinfold,\ncertify that thisdocument is a true and\naccurate transcriptof the recording of R.\nv.

Crown counsel appeals that sentence.Factual Overview[2]I will now give a very brief overview of the facts.[3]On April 14, 2014, Luigi Aceto was charged with two counts of domestic\nassault.In September 2014, the victim swore an affidavit recanting the\nstatement she had provided to the police and the charges were withdrawn.The\nrespondent and victim moved back in together and resumed their relationship.[4]On November 13, 2014, the respondent was charged with criminal harassment\nand assault.On December 4, 2014, the respondent was charged with failing to\ncomply with recognizance. On December 7, 2014, the accused entered into a\nrecognizance with conditions not to communicate with the complainant.[5]In January 2015, the complainant gave birth to a child. The respondent\nis the father of that child.On February 16, 2015, the victim swore an\naffidavit recanting her three prior sworn videotaped statements to the police.[6]The matter went to trial. During the trial, the respondent pleaded\nguilty to two counts of domestic assault and six counts of breach of\nrecognizance. A nine day Gardiner hearing followed the guilty plea.[7]The two counts of assault consisted of the respondent pulling on the\ncomplainant’s arm in an effort to have her return to their apartment. The\ncomplainant did not sustain any injuries, and she did not require any medical\ntreatment.The complainant was pregnant at the time.[8]Without context, the six breach charges are potentially misleading\nbecause five of the six counts pertain to an extended period where the\nrespondent engaged in the same prohibited conduct.[9]The first count is in relation to “love” notes left by the respondent in\nthe complainant’s personal items. She disclosed the notes when the items were\ndelivered back to her.These notes are contained in Tab 6 of the respondent’s\nFresh Evidence Appeal Book.[10]The remaining five breach counts are in relation to a five month period\nfollowing the respondent’s release from custody during which he and the\ncomplainant consensually lived together.Each count relates to a different day\nduring that five month period. I suppose the police could have charged the\nrespondent with upwards of 300 breaches for each day of cohabitation.Alternatively,\nthey could have charged the respondent with only one breach, covering the\nentire time period.[11]The Crown sought a jail sentence of 32 days in addition to the 268 days\nof pre-sentence custody already served, to be followed by three years of\nprobation, a section 110 order for ten years and a DNA order.[12]Defence argued for a conditional discharge with probation in light of\nthe significant pre-trial custody that the respondent had served and the fact\nthat the respondent had no criminal record.[13]On May 16, 2016, the sentencing judge sentenced the respondent to a\nconditional discharge followed by three years of probation and a five year section\n110 order.At sentencing, it was agreed that the respondent had served 276\ndays in pretrial custody.The sentencing judge allotted 60 days to each\nassault, consecutively, 60 days for each fail to comply concurrent to each\nother but consecutive to each assault, to be noted on the record.The\nsentencing judge, found that the period of pretrial custody had been so lengthy\nand onerous, and ordered that the respondent also be granted an unused 96 day\ncredit.The sentencing judge explained that this credit was to be applied\ntowards other outstanding charges.Ultimately, those charges were withdrawn by\nthe Crown.Fresh Evidence[14]In this appeal, the respondent seeks an order to admit fresh evidence.The\nrespondent seeks to admit the following five items of fresh evidence:(1)A separate four count information that was withdrawn by the Crown following\nthe guilty plea;(2)Two affidavits from the complainant dated September 5, 2014 and February\n16, 2015, recanting her statements to police;(3)A lease agreement that the respondent and complainant entered into in\nJune 2015;(4)Handwritten notes from the respondent to the complainant;(5)A letter from CAS to the respondent dated September 8, 2016.[15]The information contained in items (1), (2) and (3) was, in a general\nway, conveyed to the sentencing judge in the course of the proceedings.The\nfresh evidence is simply an expansion of that information.While the proposed\nfresh evidence could have been admitted at trial, I see R v. Palmer, 1979 CanLII 8 (SCC), [1980]\n1 S.C.R. 759, as endorsing its admission especially since a balancing of\nall the other considerations favor admission.[16]The handwritten notes (item 4), were made exhibits at trial, and, as\nsuch, they do not fall under the umbrella of fresh evidence.[17]Item (5) is a letter to from CAS to the respondent.The content is\nconfusing and is not relevant to these proceedings.In my view, it fails to\nmeet the test set out in Palmer.[18]I am satisfied that items (1) to (3) meet the test set out in Palmer\nand, as such, will be admitted as fresh evidence for the purposes of the this\nappeal.Crown Position[19]Crown counsel takes the position that the sentencing judge made errors\nin principle and that the sentence was demonstrably unfit.[20]Crown counsel submits that the sentencing judge made the following four\nerrors in the granting of the conditional discharge:(1)He erred in law on the appropriate test for a conditional discharge;(2)He erred in imposing a conditional discharge that was contrary to the\npublic interest;(3)He erred in principle in failing to consider or give sufficient weight\nto the principles of denunciation as well as specific and general deterrence;\nand(4)He erred in principle in failing to give sufficient weight to the\nrelevant aggravating factors and in overemphasizing rehabilitation.[21]Crown counsel further argues that the sentencing judge erred by imposing\na demonstrably unfit sentence in the circumstances of these offences and this offender.[22]The Crown also argues that the sentencing judge erred in failing to\nimpose an ancillary order for DNA pursuant to s.487.051(3) of the Criminal\nCode. The Crown argues that the sentencing judge failed to apply the\nappropriate test and failed to give reasons for refusing the order.[23]Ultimately, Crown counsel is seeking an order setting aside the conditional\ndischarge and requests that a suspended sentence be imposed.AnalysisConditional Discharge[24]Sentencing is highly discretionary.Absent an error in principle or law,\na sentencing judge’s sentencing disposition is entitled to substantial\ndeference unless it is found to be demonstrably unfit.R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4\nSCR 227 at para. 46R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII),\n[2015] 3 SCR 1089 at para 11[25]In certain circumstances, the Criminal Code allows for the\ngranting of a conditional discharge in lieu of a criminal conviction if two\nconditions are met:the judge must be satisfied (1) that the discharge is in\nthe best interests of the offender; and (2) that the discharge is not contrary\nto the public interest.[26]In this case, there was nothing prohibiting the sentencing judge from\nexercising his discretion and granting the respondent a conditional discharge.[27]While I agree that the sentencing judge did not explicitly set out the\ntest for a conditional discharge, in my view, he did not have to.During their\nextensive submissions, both counsel focused on and set out the test for a\nconditional discharge. The sentencing judge referenced and relied upon several\nconditional discharge cases in his oral judgment. In my view, a review of the\njudgment, combined with the submissions of counsel, demonstrate that this\nexperienced sentencing judge was well aware of the test for granting a\nconditional discharge.[28]In granting the discharge, the sentencing judge explicitly considered\nthe following factors:•The respondent pled guilty;•The respondent was remorseful;•The respondent was a first offender;•The respondent had spent an inordinate amount of time in pretrial\ncustody – 276 days;•A conviction would negatively impact the respondent’s prospects\nfor employment and thereby his ability to financially support his family; and•The complainant was, to some degree, complicit in five of the six\nbreaches.[29]Following the nine day Gardiner hearing, the sentencing judge\nfound the Crown had proven only two aggravating factors:(1)The respondent had breached court orders; and(2)The assaults were domestic in nature and the complainant’s medical\ncondition at the time, the inference being that she was pregnant.[30]Of equal importance were the unique facts attached to this case. All\nacts of domestic violence and subsequent breaches of court orders are serious.Where an offence falls on the gravity spectrum however depends on the specific\nfacts of each particular case.In this case, there is no dispute that the assaults\nwere limited to an arm pull that caused no injury.At least one arm pull was\ncaptured on a video surveillance camera.I reviewed the video and was unable\nto detect the assault until it was specifically pointed out to me by Crown counsel.In my view, these assaults fall at the lower end of the gravity spectrum.The\nbreaches fall into a similar category.On its face, the sheer number of breach\ncounts sparks concern and, without context, is disturbingly misleading. An\nexamination of the facts, however, reveals a compliant victim and otherwise non-threatening\ncommunication. After a nine day Gardiner hearing, I am confident that\nthe sentencing judge was intimately familiar with the particular facts of this\ncase and that they factored significantly intohis decision to grant the\nconditional discharge.[31]It is not uncommon for offences of domestic assault combined with\nbreaches of a court order to attract a conviction.While I agree that this\nsentence appears to have fallen outside what one might ordinarily deem\nappropriate, trial judges, are not bound to customary sentencing ranges where\nthere is no mandatory minimum.Quite the opposite.Parliament has explicitly\ngiven sentencing judges the discretion to determine the appropriate punishment\nunder the Criminal Code based on the fundamental principle of proportionality\nin s.718.1 which requires that a sentence be “proportionate to the gravity of the\noffence and the degree of responsibility of the offender”.[32]Sentencing is a highly individualistic task and tailored to the\nindividual circumstances. No two cases or circumstances are ever identical.Sentencing is highly tailored to individual circumstances are ever identical.In this case, the respondent had no prior record, pled guilty, and served such\nsignificant pre-trial custody that the sentencing judge allotted him an unused\n96 days of credit.[33]In my view, the sentence imposed was responsive to the unique facts\nattached this case and the principles of sentencing.I find no error in his\nanalysis.DNA[34]The sentencing judge refused to make a DNA order pursuant to s.487.05(3)\nof the Criminal Code. The choice of whether or not to make the order was\nentirely discretionary, as the convictions were for secondary designated\noffences.The choice of whether or not to make an order required a\nconsideration of the criminal record of the offender, the nature of the offence,\nand the circumstances surrounding the offence. In R. v. Hendry, 2001 CanLII 21168 (ON CA), 57\nO.R. (3d) 475, at para. 24 the Court of Appeal provided the following guidance:The court is also directed to consider the offender’s\ncriminal record. If the offender has no prior record and the circumstances of\nthe secondary designated offence are relatively minor, they may be justified in\nnot making the order.[35]I am mindful that in the vast majority of domestic assault cases, it is\nin the best interests of the administration of justice to make such an order.However,\ngiven the unique factors that are attached to this case, including that the\nrespondent was a first offender, I can find no error in the sentencing judge’s\ndecision not to make a DNA order.[36]Crown counsel further submits that the sentencing judge was required to\nprovide reasons and erred by failing to do so.I disagree. At the conclusion\nof his oral reasons, the sentencing judge succinctly stated that he was not\ngoing to make a DNA order given the context of the proceedings. It is clear to me\nthat the sentencing judge applied his findings on sentence to his DNA assessment.\nThis makes sense, given that all the factors required for the DNA assessment\nwere encompassed in his sentencing analysis. There was no need or requirement\nto repeat them.[37]Crown counsel argues that the sentencing judge failed to apply the\nappropriate test in not making the DNA order.Again, I disagree. Given that\nthe test was explicitly stated by counsel in the course of their extensive\nsubmissions, it was not necessary for this experienced sentencing judge to\nrepeat the test.Such an omission, in my view, does not justify intervention.[38]I find that the sentencing judge did not err in refusing to make a DNA\norder.Conclusion[39]Appeal dismissed.Byrne J.Released: December 7, 2017CITATION:\nR. v.

Dunphy J.COUNSEL:Rachel\nFurey, for Her Majesty the QueenAnthony\nDeMarco, for Nelson SanchezHEARD at Toronto:February 21, 2018REASONS FOR\nDECISION – SENTENCING[1]On November 9, 2017, I convicted Mr. Nelson Sanchez of four counts of\npossession of narcotics for purposes of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled\nDrugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19.The four narcotics involved\nwere cocaine, oxycodone, psilocybin and cannabis.He is before me today for\nsentencing.Circumstances of the Offences[2]On September 15, 2013, police searched a condominium in the Etobicoke\narea of Toronto.A large quantity of narcotics and related paraphernalia (zip\nlock bags of various sizes, a counting machine, a digital scale, latex gloves\nand other items) were also found, some in plain sight, some stored in cabinets,\ncupboards or the like.[3]I found that Mr. Sanchez was in possession for the purposes of\ntrafficking of the following narcotics found during the search of the\ncondominium:a.Cocaine:total\nof 1.043kg in four different locations inside the unit (excluding the cocaine\nfound in the locked strongbox);b.Marijuana:total of 1.8kg in two different locations inside the unit;c.Psilocybin:total of 577.59g in two different locations inside the unit; andd.Oxycodone:112\ntablets (marked 80 mg) weighing 36.66g (excluding the oxycodone tablets found\nin the locked strongbox).[4]When police entered the condominium, Mr. Sanchez was found in the\ncondominium seated at the dining room table before a clear jar found to contain\npsilocybin.He proceeded to dump into the planter behind him an object that was\nlater identified as a digital scale and a business card containing residue of\nwhite powder resembling cocaine.[5]The identification of this condominium unit as a stash house and\ntrafficking hub was unmistakable.In my reasons for convicting Mr. Sanchez I\nwrote:The narcotics in the Etobicoke Condominium were\nfound stored in such a fashion that any sighted person present in the unit for\nmore than a very brief period of time could not fail to notice some or all of\nthem and be quite aware of their nature. The narcotics and related\nparaphernalia were in plain sight, spilling out of shelves and drawers, stored\nin the refrigerator and freezer etc.Scales and money counters were visible or\nin a common area closet. Ziploc bags – including tiny ones used to fill “dime\nbags” - were stored here and there in numbers and types that even the most avid\nhome cook or canner would be hard pressed to use in years. In the living room,\na monitor was tuned to the closed circuit video images of nine security cameras\nin the building. This condominium unit was, in a phrase, a dedicated drug den and\nonly the most wilfully blind could have failed to notice it.[6]Mr. Sanchez was clearly living in the condominium unit.He had the key\nto the unit in his possession.One of the bedrooms – not the master suite –\ncontained a chest of drawers in which a modest quantity of cash and his\n(expired) passport were found.In the same bedroom was also found a box of zip\nlock bags and a box of latex gloves of the same type as a latex glove found\nwith one of the bags of cocaine located in another room.Applicable principles of sentencing[7]Section 718 of the Criminal Code establishes that the fundamental\npurpose of sentencingis to \"contribute, along with crime prevention\nmeasures, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and\nsafe society\" by imposing just sanctions with one or more of the following\nobjectives:a.denouncing\nunlawful conduct;b.deterring the\noffender and others from committing crimes;c.separating\noffenders from society where necessary;d.assisting in the\nrehabilitation of the offender;e.providing\nreparations for harm done to the victim or to the community;f.promoting\na sense of responsibility in the offender; andg.acknowledging\nthe harm done to victims and the community.[8]Any sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the\nresponsibility of the offender: s. 718.1 of the Criminal Code[9]I am also required by s. 718.2 to bear a number of principles in mind\nwhen imposing sentence including considering:(i) any relevant aggravating or\nmitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, (ii) the\ndesirability of imposing similar sentences for offenders in similar\ncircumstances, and (iii) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that\nare reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders.Position of the parties[10]The Crown submits that a global sentence of six years is appropriate in\nall of the circumstances.The defence submits that a reformatory sentence of\ntwo years less a day would be appropriate.Circumstances of the offender[11]Mr. Sanchez is 32 years old.He was 28 years old at the time of\narrest.He has no prior criminal record.[12]Mr. Sanchez has lived almost his entire life in Canada, arriving in\nToronto at the age of seven.He went to grade school and high school in\nToronto and is engaged to be married to a woman from Toronto.[13]Mr. Sanchez is not, however, a Canadian citizen.That fact means that\nit is a near certainty that Mr. Sanchez will be the object of a removal order\nas soon as he has completed whatever sentence I might impose.[14]Mr. Sanchez is currently working in the construction industry.He was\nuniversally described by friends and colleagues as a dedicated, hard worker and\na good team player.He is very active in his community and is an avid\norganizer and participant in adult soccer teams.[15]The large number of very supportive letters provided to me speak very\nhighly of Mr. Sanchez’ positive role in his community and with friends,\nfamilies and colleagues.He is very well-liked and has been very supportive of\nhis family.His fiancée has come to rely on him to help her aging parents.The situation Mr. Sanchez finds himself in as a result of these offences has\nbroken a lot of hearts besides his own.[16]A pre-sentence report was ordered by me.His social network was found\nto be very pro-social.He was described as benefitting from “immense support\nfrom his friends”.He has no significant problems with alcohol or substance\nabuse.He has been complying with his bail conditions for more than four years\nwith no reported issues.All of the indications are that his rehabilitation\nprospects are very good.[17]It must also be noted that Mr. Sanchez continues to maintain his\ninnocence and is quoted in the pre-sentence report as saying that he was only\nrenting a room in the condominium unit and did not know Mr. Hobeika.If this\nis an accurate quote from him, Mr. Sanchez would unfortunately be showing\nhimself to be in denial.The apartment was very obviously given over to the\nnarcotics business and Mr. Sanchez was clearly playing a role in that business\nbeyond that of a mere bystander.[18]While Mr. Sanchez was found to be possession of narcotics for the\npurposes of trafficking, it is fair to observe that I did not find him to be playing\na leading role in that enterprise.He was not the one occupying the master\nsuite in the apartment, for example.Mr. Hobeika was the listed owner and\noccupant of the unit, not Mr. Sanchez.Mr. Sanchez was not found to be in\npossession of or connected to any material amount of seized money.He was not\nassociated with the Liberty Village location at all.There was a locked\nstrongbox in the Etobicoke Condominium to which Mr. Hobeika had the only\nidentified key (and which contained cash as well as narcotics).All of these\nfactors tend to point to Mr. Sanchez’ role within the operation as being at a\nrelatively subordinate level.Aggravating and mitigating circumstances[19]The aggravating factors may be summarized as follows:a.Gravity of\nthe Offences:the widespread harm done to users and the community at large\nby the trade in narcotics generally and oxycodone and cocaine in particular has\nbeen well documented in prior cases;b.The\nquantities of narcotics seized:the volumes of narcotics seized establish\nthat the operation Mr. Sanchez was involved in was a very substantial one.The\nquantities of narcotics seized and the related items make it clear that this\nwas a sophisticated although likely retail operation; andc.The variety\nof narcotics seized; four different types of narcotics were stored in\nsignificant volume in the condominium along with the tools necessary to\ndispense them.This variety established this operation as something of a\none-stop shopping destination that potentially exposed its customers to more\nserious narcotics than they might previously have known;[20]The mitigating factors may be summarized as follows:a.Prior record:Mr. Sanchez’ has no prior record;b.Rehabilitation\nprospects:The pre-sentence report and the numerous support letters\nestablish that Mr. Sanchez enjoys very favourable levels of community and\nfamily support.There is no sign that his circle of social contacts has\ncontributed to his offending in this case.To the contrary, the offence seems\nquite out of character for him.He has shown himself to friends, colleagues\nand employers to be a diligent, hard-working and reliable person.He has a\nmother and fiancé and sisters who provide him with emotional support and who\nhave also come to rely on his support and assistance.He has no history of\naddiction.It is in this context that his relatively young age plays a role.He is approaching an age where the prospect of settling down to a stable family\nlife would certainly favour helping to rehabilitate this individual.I\nconsider that his prospects of rehabilitation are excellent;c.Degree of\nresponsibility of the offender:The law enables and indeed requires me to\nconsider the particular degree of responsibility of the offender before me.Mr.\nSanchez was not found by me to be anything like a partner in the trafficking\nenterprise shut down by police on September 15, 2013.He has not been found\nlinked to any significant amount of money.There was a strongbox in the unit\nthat he was not found to possess the key to.His role was a subordinate one\nrelatively speaking.[21]Mr. DeMarco suggested I should also consider Mr. Sanchez’ relative youth\nas a mitigating factor.He was 28 years old at the time of the offence and 32\nyears today.He was and is an adult in every sense of the word.He is\ncertainly younger than some offenders and older than others.The acquisition\nof wisdom and maturity are both life-long projects.This offence cannot be\nascribed to the immaturity or impetuousness of youth.Sentences imposed in similar cases[22]The starting point by the general agreement of both\nparties must be the short, succinct decision of Weiler J. A. in R. v. Bajada,\n2003 CanLII 15687 (ON CA).In Bajada, Weiler J.A. found (at para. 13) that\n“[i]t would appear that sentences of five to five and one half years are not\nuncommon for possession of a substantial amount of cocaine for the purposes of\ntrafficking following an accused’s plea of guilty or where the accused has\nno prior record” (emphasis added).In R. v. Bryan, 2011 ONCA 273 (CanLII)\nthe Court of Appeal noted (at para. 1) that “normally, in cases of this nature,\nsentences of 5 to 8 years would reflect the proper range for someone without a\nrecord, convicted of possession for the purposes of trafficking in slightly\nmore than a pound of cocaine”.The volumes in the present case were more than\none kilogram of cocaine plus significant volumes of other narcotics.[23]Bajada, Bryan, R. v.\nNero, 2008 ONCA 622 (CanLII), R. v. Feeney, 2015 ONSC 3218 (CanLII)\nand R. v. Wawrykeiwicz, 2017 ONSC 3527 (CanLII), 2017 ONSC 3527(CanLII) all support the\nproposition that the applicable range for possession for purposes of\ntrafficking of a similar volume of cocaine tends towards six to eight years.The variety of narcotics possessed also pushes towards the upper end of that\nrange if concurrent sentences are imposed:R. v. Oraha , 2012 ONSC 1439\n(CanLII) at paras. 53-54; affirmed 2014 ONCA 359 (CanLII).In considering such\nranges, I must be careful to avoid a mechanical approach that might overweight\nthe parity principle to the exclusion of all else.[24]Mr. DeMarco urged upon me a number of cases dealing\nwith much younger offenders than Mr. Sanchez where more lenient sentences were\nfashioned to give greater weight to the hope of rehabilitating a young offender.I found these cases (R. v. Priest, 1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA), R. v.\nBorde, 2003 CanLII 4187 (ON CA)) to be of very little assistance to the\ntask before me.A barely-adult offender with a clean record presents very\ndifferent considerations than a fully grown, 28 year-old offender.He also\nurged me to consider decision of J. E. Kelly J. in R. v. Williams, 2015\n[O.J.] No. 366 (S.C.J.) as an example of a case where this court has found it\nappropriate to depart from the Bajada ranges in order to respond to the\nparticular circumstances of the case.I found Williams to be a more\nhelpful guide although there are of course a number of distinctions to be drawn\n(as there always are).[25]I have not recited here the authorities relied upon in\narriving at sentences for the other three counts (oxycodone, psilocybin and\nmarijuana).Each of these three narcotics were present in important volume.None of these authorities were the object of serious contest in oral argument\nwhich focussed, appropriately, on the global sentence.Since the sentence for\nthe most serious of these (cocaine) is aggravated to some degree by the\npresence of the other three, it is clearly appropriate that the sentences\ndetermined should be concurrent.Fit sentence in this case[26]Sentencing is an imprecise science and requires the balancing of a\nnumber of factors that often pull in opposite directions.Every case does\nindeed depend upon its unique facts.Cookie cutters are neither welcome nor\nuseful.Precedents establish guidelines but guidelines are not be applied to\nthe point where they become a straightjacket: R. v. Lacasse, [2015] 3 SCR 1089, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII).[27]While I agree with the Crown that the precedents would\ntend to suggest an appropriate sentence at or near the six year level suggested\nby the Crown, that figure gives insufficient account of many of the mitigating\nfactors that I must also bear in mind.On the other hand, the suggested\nreformatory sentence proposed by the defence would be manifestly inappropriate\nto the severity of the crime and the circumstances of the offender.[28]Mr. Sanchez has been found guilty.I cannot sentence him as if he were\nthe mere bystander that he appears to claim to be (he did not testify at\ntrial).He was living in a condominium unit where he played an active, even if\napparently subordinate, role in a narcotics trafficking enterprise that\ninvolved the volumes of narcotics and related paraphernalia I have described.[29]This is a crime where denunciation and deterrence must be front of mind\nobjectives in sentencing.The crime is a serious one and contributes to\ncausing immeasurable harm to the community.[30]Denunciation and deterrence must be given their proper and appropriate\nweight but not to the exclusion of other considerations unique to the offender including\nrehabilitation:R. v. Oraha, 2012 ONSC 1439 (CanLII) at para. 14-15.[31]I must recognize the clean record of Mr. Sanchez, his strong work ethic,\nhis excellent prospects for rehabilitation and the tremendous family and\ncommunity support evidenced in the pre-sentence report and the support letters\nfiled. I must also recognize his relatively lower level of responsibility in\nthe trafficking enterprise shut down by police on September 15, 2013.I must\nalso recognize that the six year sentence advocated for by the Crown already\naccounts to a degree for Mr. Sanchez’ relatively lower level of individual responsibility\nby placing him in the lower end of the six to eight year range suggested by the\njurisprudence.[32]Mr. Sanchez has been paying his debt to society to a degree at least these\npast four years.Mr. Sanchez was initially released under conditions of house\narrest (just under 23 months) and thereafter under curfew conditions (from\nDecember 2015 until the present time).Clearly bail is not jail.However,\nhouse arrest is a form of punishment, even if of a different character than\nactual incarceration: R. v. Downes, 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA) at para.\n29.I view Downes as requiring me to consider the pre-sentencing\ndeprivation of liberty experienced by Mr. Sanchez as a mitigating factor.This\nis often done by way of a allowing a specific credit similar to the credit for pre-sentence\ncustody but it can also be done as part of the overall balancing of factors.In\nthis case at least, I prefer the latter approach.There are a number of\nmitigating factors that I am required to weigh.I don’t find it helpful to\nascribe an artificial air of mathematical certainty to the process with x\nmonths ascribed to this factor and y months to that any more than it would be\nhelpful to do the same with aggravating factors.The law requires me to give\nfull consideration to all of the factors and to prescribe a fit and just\nsentence in the result.[33]In the present case, I consider that an overall sentence of 4.5 years is\nappropriate having regard to all of the circumstances of this case including\nthe mitigating circumstances of the conditions of house arrest and curfew that\nhave governed Mr. Sanchez’ release since his arrest.[34]Mr. Sanchez is entitled to specific credit for his time spent in custody\nbefore his release.The time was a short one and will be calculated and\nincluded in his final sentence after I have read these reasons.Disposition[35]Accordingly, Mr. Sanchez will be sentenced as follows:a.Possession of\nNarcotics for purpose of trafficking:i.Count\n1 (Cocaine):4 years and six months;ii.Count\n2 (Oxycodone):one year (served concurrently with Count 1);iii.Count\n3 (Psilocybin):nine months (served concurrently with Count 1);iv.Count\n4 (Marijuana): six months (served concurrently with Count 1);b.Credit for\npre-sentence custody (to be determined following reading of these reasons); andc.Ancillary\norders: DNA order as requested and 10 years prohibition s. 109 Criminal Code.___________________________S.F.

(Orally):OVERVIEW[1]On March 23,\n2016, Mr. Kennedy-Money was found guilty, after trial by jury, of sexually\nassaulting M.A..He was found not guilty of touching her with his penis for a\nsexual purpose.THE\nFACTSCircumstances\nof the Offence[2]As the\nsentencing judge, I am bound by the express and implied factual implications of the jury's verdict.Crown and\ndefence have agreed, and I found, that those implications were that the jury\nwas not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Kennedy-Money had sexual\nintercourse with the victim (to use the words of the Indictment that he touched\nher with his penis), but was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was\nother sexual touching.[3]On an earlier\ndate, I heard submissions as to the facts I should find to have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to decide the\nproper sentence.I was satisfied of the following.[4]The offender initiated\ncontact with the victim through Facebook by adding her as a friend.At the\ntime she was 11 or 12 years old. They started talking by texting.She told him\nher age.They talked \"basically daily.\"He would ask her how her\nday was.He would \"keep her company\" and she would do the same.She\nand the offender discussed Spotlight, the dance club where he worked as a disc\njockey.She thought he was really nice.[5]After talking\nabout Spotlight with other friends, the victim and her girlfriends decided to\ngo there on the night in question.The victim texted the offender and asked\nhim to drop by.He did.While at the club they kissed while she sat on his\nlap.They played pool.He again asked her age and she told him she was 12.\nWhen the ride home for the girls fell through, the offender suggested they go\nto his place.On the walk there he told the victim he was not going to make\nher to do anything with him, but he was going to make her have a shower.[6]When they got\nto the offender's place, they went into the bathroom.She felt very nervous\nand awkward and did not know what to do.He undressed her.She got in the\nshower first and started showering normally, washing her hair.The offender\ngot in the shower and started showering too.The victim was feeling \"pretty\nawkward and very uncomfortable.\"He touched her breasts and her vagina.While\nin the bathroom, the offender digitally penetrated her.She got dressed and\nthey then went into the bedroom and lay on the bed.At one point he told her\ngirlfriend to leave the room and it was just the two of them.The offender put\nhis hands inside the victim's pants and again digitally penetrated her.He was\naware that she was 12 years old.[7]I found that\nthe regularity of their online contact led to a connection between them such\nthat, despite not having met in person, the victim felt sufficiently\ncomfortable to invite the offender to Spotlight, to kiss him there and to go to\nhis home when her ride fell through.[8]Although this\nwas not a traditional trust relationship and the offender was not in a position\nof trust to the victim, I found that she did come to trust him in light of the\nnature and frequency of the online contact that he initiated.His \"basically\ndaily\" chats with this 12 year old girl were a type of grooming behaviour\nwhere he gained her trust, such that he was able to ultimately sexually touch\nher.Circumstances\nof the Offender[9]The offender\nwas 21 years old at the time of the offence.He is now 24.He has no criminal\nrecord.A lengthy and thorough Gladue report was prepared.The author\ninterviewed the offender, his biological parents and his fiance. The report set\nout the following information.[10]His biological father, Bill Money,\nidentified as Metis; Mr. Money's mother was 50 percent native.Mr. Money was\nadopted by his mother's friends when was eight years old after his mother had\nrepeatedly left him with them. Mr. Money reported that he was sexually abused\nas a child.[11]The offender is the eldest of\neight children.When he was six months old, his mother separated from Mr.\nMoney.[12]The offender advised that he met\nMr. Money for the first time when he was six years old.He reported that he\nwas sexually abused by his father from the age of 8 until 10, although the\nfrequency of the abuse that he reported to the author of the Gladue\nreport was significantly different than that reported to the author of the pre-sentence\nreport.After the offender disclosed the abuse to CAS, visits between he and\nhis father were supervised for a period of time.The visits eventually became\nunsupervised and then stopped.He did not see his father from the time he was\napproximately 10 until 18, and they have limited contact now.When Mr. Money\nwas interviewed by the author of the Gladue report, he denied sexually\nabusing his son.The offender reported that his father has had problems with\nsubstance abuse.[13]The offender's mother remarried.\nHer husband was diagnosed approximately four years ago with schizophrenia.The\noffender refers to his stepfather as his father.[14]The offender reported difficulty\nsleeping.He said he was bullied at school.He started working part-time at\nthe age of 12, moved out of home at 16 and quit school.He has worked at\nvarious jobs including as a disc jockey at the Spotlight club.He does not use\ndrugs and is only a social drinker.He has a child who is now six years old\nwhom he has not seen since 2012.He reported that he has not and will not pay\nchild support until the child's mother lets him see his child.[15]The offender attempted suicide in\n2011 after his son was born.He advised the author of the pre-sentence report\nthat the attempt came after he found out the mother of his child, his then\ngirlfriend, had cheated on him.[16]He has been in a relationship\nsince May 2014, and has recently obtained his Grade 12 equivalency through the\nAdult Learning Centre in Barrie.He has not been formally diagnosed with any\nmental health issues.[17]The offender advised that he has\nalways known that he was Metis.He knows little about his heritage but has\nexpressed an interest in learning more.[18]Mr. Money advised that he\ncontinues to support the offender but that his son \"has to step up and\nrecognize his issues.\"The offender's mother stated that he has a lot\ngoing for him and that he has a lot of support.His fiance is supportive, as\nare her parents.[19]The author of the Gladue report\nmade recommendations with respect to programming available in both the federal\nand provincial custodial systems.[20]As mentioned, a pre-sentence report\nwas also prepared.In it, the offender's mother described him as a \"normal\"\nchild. He described his relationship with his mother and stepfather, who has\nbeen in his life since he was six, as \"really good.\"The author\nnoted that the offender presented as polite and cooperative.He maintains his\ninnocence.He reported that he suffered from a number of mental health issues\nbut, as noted in the Gladue report, there are no formal diagnoses.[21]Three reference letters were filed\non the offender's behalf.His fiance's parents, who have known him for two\nyears, stated that he has always been courteous and respectful.He has been\nsupportive and encouraging to their daughter and plans to continue to work and\neventually start college.They describe him as \"genuinely a good person\nwho cares about others.\"A friend, who has known the offender for roughly\n10 years, describes him as a \"kind generous person willing to help out anyone\nhe knows that is in need.\"A former work supervisor, who has known him since\n2014, spoke positively of the offender's conduct at work and his kind and\ninclusive nature.Impact\non the Victim[22]The victim filed a victim impact statement.She noted that she has been impacted in many ways.She does not trust many\npeople, thinks the worst about situations and is frightened to make new\nfriends.She described the offender as the man that ruined her childhood.The\nevents have affected her family.She stated that she wishes she could go back\nto the day this took place and make smarter choices.LEGAL PARAMETERS[23]Sexual assault when prosecuted by\nindictment, if the complainant is under the age of 16 years, carries with it a\nmaximum term of imprisonment of 14 years and a minimum punishment of 1 year.Certain\nancillary orders are also mandatory or discretionary.POSITIONS OF CROWN AND\nDEFENCE[24]The Crown's position is that a\ncustodial term of three years is appropriate.[25]The Crown seeks a primary DNA\norder, a SOIRRA order for 20 years, a weapons prohibition and an order under Section\n161(b) for 10 years, and an order under Section 743.21 prohibiting\ncommunication with the victim while in custody.[26]The defence position is that a\ncustodial sentence of 15 to 18 months is appropriate.The ancillary orders are\non consent.The defence agrees that a conditional sentence is not available in\nthe circumstances.CASELAW[27]The Crown filed a number of\nsentencing authorities to set out both the general principles of sentencing in\ncases of child sexual abuse and the principles relevant to sentencing an\nAboriginal offender.The defence relied on the cases filed by the Crown.[28]The Ontario Court of Appeal has\nemphasized that in cases of child sexual abuse, absent exceptional\ncircumstances, denunciation, general and specific deterrence and the need to\nseparate offenders from society must take precedence over the other recognized\nobjectives of sentencing. As the court stated:\"The overall message however,\nis meant to be clear.Adult sexual predators who would put the lives of\ninnocent children at risk to satisfy their deviant sexual needs must know that\nthey will pay a heavy price.\"R. v. D.(D.), 2002 CanLII 44915 (ON CA), 2002 CarswellOnt 881\nat para. 34.[29]D.(D.), which has been referred to with favour by\nthe Court of Appeal on many occasions, held that:\"...as\na general rule, when adult offenders, in a position of trust, sexually abuse\ninnocent young children on a regular and persistent basis over substantial\nperiods of time, they can expect to receive mid to upper single digit\npenitentiary terms\".Where\naggravating factors are present, the range is even higher:see para. 44.[30]As our Court of Appeal confirmed\nin R. v. Woodward, [2011] ONCA 610 at para. 76, in cases such as this,\nthe focus of the sentencing hearing should be on the harm caused to the victim\nby the offender's conduct.While the effects of a conviction on the offender\nand the offender's prospects for rehabilitation will always warrant\nconsideration, the objectives of denunciation, deterrence and the need to\nseparate sexual predators from society for society's well-being and the\nwell-being of our children must take precedence.[31]Section 718.2(e) is a:\"remedial\nprovision designed to ameliorate the serious problems of overrepresentation of\nAboriginal people in Canadian prisons, and to encourage sentencing judges to\nhave recourse to a restorative approach to sentencing.\"R. v. Ipeelee,\n2012 SCC 13 (CanLII), 2012 CarswellOnt 4375 at para. 59.[32]In that case, the Supreme Courtwent on to state:\"When sentencing an Aboriginal offender,\nthe judge must consider:(a) the unique systemic or background factors which\nmay have played a part in bringing the particular Aboriginal offender before\nthe courts; and (b) the types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may\nbe appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because of his or her\nparticular Aboriginal heritage or connection.Judges may take judicial notice\nof the broad systemic and background factors affecting Aboriginal people\ngenerally, but additional case-specific information will have to come from\ncounsel and from the pre-sentence report.\"R. v. Ipeelee, supra, para.\n59.[33]Although Section 718.2(e) requires\na different methodology for assessing a fit sentence for an Aboriginal\noffender, it does not necessarily mandate a different result.The court must\nimpose a sentence that is fit for the offence and the offender.In certain\ncases the greatest weight will not be given to the principles of restorative\njustice, and less weight to goals such as deterrence, denunciation and\nseparation.There are some serious offences and some offenders for which and\nwhom these latter principles are fundamentally relevant.In such cases, the\nlength of imprisonment must be considered:see R. v. Kakegamick,\n(2006), 2006 CanLII 28549 (ON CA), 81 O.R. (3d) 664 at paras. 36, 42, 73, leave to appeal to S.C.C.\ndismissed; R. v. Wells, 2000 SCC 10 (CanLII) at para. 44; R. v. Gladue,\n1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 SCR 688 at para. 78.[34]The Court of Appeal in R. v.\nBauer, 2013 ONCA 691 (CanLII), reminded sentencing judges that although an\nAboriginal offender need not establish a direct causal link between his\ncircumstances and the offence, the Gladue factors need to be tied in\nsome way to the offender and the offence.The Court of Appeal noted the\nrationale for Gladue as follows:\"...many Aboriginal offenders come from\nsituations of social and economic deprivation with few opportunities for\npositive development and these circumstances may diminish their moral\nculpability [cites omitted].\"MITIGATING AND\nAGGRAVATING FACTORS[35]Mitigating is the fact that the\noffender has no previous record.He is youthful.He has the support of his\nfamily, his fiance and her family, friends and a former work supervisor. For\nthe most part he has had a positive history of employment.[36]He has had some challenges in his\nlife.He has reportedly suffered sexual abuse at the hands of his father.[37]The offender does not have the\nbenefit of the mitigating factor of remorse.He has no insight into his\nactions and has taken no steps towards treatment.As in R. v. M.(D.), 2012\nONCA 529 (CanLII) at para. 18, his lack of remorse, the fact that the victim was forced\nto testify twice, and his failure to accept responsibility for the offence\nspeak against mitigation.[38]There are a number of aggravating\nfactors. The victim was only 11 or 12 years old when the Facebook interaction\nstarted by the offender began.He was 21 at the time, significantly older than\nher.Through their frequent internet contact, he groomed the victim by gaining\nher trust through their conversations about the minutia of daily life.The\nevidence supports that the victim was enamoured of his position as a disc\njockey at an all ages' club.After nurturing her confidence in him, the\noffender used the fact that the victim now trusted him to take advantage of her\nsexually.He knew she was only 12 years old when he digitally penetrated her.He\npenetrated her twice:first in the bathroom and then in the bedroom.The\nvictim was in a vulnerable position:she was at his home because her ride fell\nthrough.She was in an enclosed bathroom alone with him when he first began\nhis assault of her.Later, she was alone in the bedroom with him after he had\ntold her girlfriend to leave.[39]There has been a significant\nimpact on the victim.She does not trust many people or let herself get close\nenough to them.She thinks the worst about situations and is frightened to\nmake new friends.She considers her childhood to have been ruined.I am\nsatisfied by what the victim stated in her victim impact statement that she\nblames herself for the events of the evening in question.PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[40]The objectives of sentencing long\nrecognized at common law have been codified in Section 718 of the Criminal\nCode.They are the denunciation of unlawful conduct, deterrence both\ngeneral and specific, the separation of the offender from society where\nnecessary, rehabilitation, reparation for harm done to the victims or the\ncommunity, and promotion of a sense of responsibility in offenders and\nacknowledgment of the harm done.[41]Section 718.01 statutorily\nmandates what has been well established:when a court imposes a sentence for\nan offence that involved the abuse of a person under the age of 18 years, it\nshall give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and\ndeterrence of such conduct.Section 718.1 requires that the sentence must be\nproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of\nthe offender.Section 718.2 provides that a sentence should be increased or\ndecreased to account for any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.Aggravating factors include that the offender abused a person under the age of 18\nyears.The section also requires that the sentence be similar to those imposed\non similar offenders in similar circumstances, that the combined duration of\nconsecutive sentences not be unduly long, that an offender not be deprived of\nliberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate, and that all\navailable sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the\ncircumstances be considered, with particular attention to the circumstances of\nAboriginal offenders.ABORIGINAL\nHERITAGE[42]That brings me to a consideration\nof the offender's Aboriginal heritage.According to the comprehensive Gladue\nreport, neither the offender nor his biological father grew up on a reserve.There\nwas no suggestion of any residential school history within his father's family\nof origin.The offender has not had any involvement with the Aboriginal\ncommunity or its teachings.[43]There has been substance abuse,\nfamily instability and a history of child sexual abuse in the offender's\nfamily.The offender reported he was subjected to sexual abuse by his\nalcoholic father.He has attempted suicide.As noted in Gladue, these\nsystemic background factors figure prominently in the causation of crime by\nAboriginal offenders.They may have played a part in bringing this particular\noffender before the courts.[44]Here, there is no alternative to\nincarceration.In considering the length of imprisonment, I have considered\nthe Gladue principles and the programming options available if the\noffender is sentenced to either a reformatory or penitentiary sentence.As set\nout in the Gladue report, both systems provide rehabilitative\nprogramming that would assist an Aboriginal offender.[45]The comments of the Court of\nAppeal in D.(D.), considered in light of the Gladue principles,\noffer guidance in determining a fit sentence for this offence and this\noffender.This is a case where the greatest weight cannot be given to the\nprinciples of restorative justice.I am satisfied that a penitentiary sentence\nis necessary in the circumstances to give effect to the principles of\ndenunciation, deterrence and separation of offenders from society, and accords\nwith the principles set out in Section 718.2(e) and Gladue.[46]Mr. Kennedy-Money, please stand\nup.SENTENCE[47]Having considered all of the\nrelevant factors, including your Aboriginal heritage, I sentence you to a\nperiod of custody of three years.I recommend that you be placed in an\ninstitution with an Aboriginal Pathways Unit, with access to Aboriginal\nprogramming and a Native Inmate Liaison Officer, and that the recommendation\nportion of the Gladue report follow you to the penitentiary so that it\ncan be reviewed in assisting with your classification.[48]Pursuant to Section 743.21 of the Criminal\nCode you are prohibited from communicating, directly or indirectly with M.A.\nduring the custodial period of your sentence.[49]You are prohibited from possessing\nweapons pursuant to Section 109(a) of the Criminal Code for a period of 10\nyears and pursuant to Section 109(b) for life.[50]The offence of sexual assault is a\nprimary DNA offence.I am ordering that you provide such samples of your\nbodily substances that are reasonably required for the purpose of forensic DNA\nanalysis for the DNA databank.[51]There shall be an order that your\nname shall be published on the Sexual Abuse Registry for a period of 20 years.[52]In addition, there shall be an\norder under Section 161(b) prohibiting you from seeking, obtaining or\ncontinuing any employment, whether or not it is remunerated, or being a\nvolunteer in any capacity, that involves being in a position of trust or\nauthority towards persons under the age of 16 years for a period of ten years.**********Transcript\nOrder Received:October 21, 2016Draft\nReasons Sent for Review:October 22, 2016Reasons\nApproved for Release:November 14,

The trial judge\ncharged the jury on the care they were required to take respecting credibility.\nIt cannot be said that she erred in the exercise of her discretion on this\nquestion in light of neither defence counsel requesting a direction of this\nkind.[3]There was no prejudice respecting\nthe instruction relating to the Albanian criminal conviction, the evidence of\nwhich had been adduced by the defence. The trial judge instructed the jury that\nthe criminal record would be of very little assistance in judging the\nappellant's credibility. There was no objection to the charge in this regard.[4]When the trial judge's charge\nbearing on the point is examined in its context, we do not think that there was\nany error respecting improper use of a prior consistent statement. There was no\nobjection to the charge on this issue either.[5]The conviction on the charge for\nattempted anal intercourse is set aside.

Having regard to the\nappellant's age and health, we recommend that the sentence be served in the\nGuelph Correctional Institution.[7]Subject to setting aside the\nconviction on the count for attempted anal intercourse, the appeal from convictions\nis set aside.

Colford for Her Majesty the Queen.Mr. G. Kearney for Mr. Butt.DECISION OF GORMAN, P.C.J.INTRODUCTION:[1]Those who\nrepeatedly drink and drive constitute a significant danger to the public.In\nsuch cases, the Court’s primary emphasis must be on protecting the public from\nsuch individuals.The Court’s primary goal must be an attempt to prevent such\nindividuals from eventually killing someone.[2]In this case,\nMr. Butt, who has a long record for committing such offences, has entered pleas\nof guilty to the offences of failing to comply with a breathalyzer demand,\nthreatening to kill a police officer and two counts of breach of undertaking,\ncontrary to sections 145(3), 254(5) and 264.1(2) of the Criminal Code of\nCanada, R.S.C. 1985.The Crown proceeded by way of indictment in relation\nto each of these charges.For the reasons that will follow, I have concluded\nthat a period of incarceration of twenty-two months and fifteen days, plus a\ndriving prohibition of fifteen years, constitutes an appropriate, fit and\nproportionate sentence in this case.THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE\nOFFENCES[3]On May 29th\n2004, Mr. Butt was operating a motor vehicle in Corner Brook while under the\ninfluence of alcohol.He drove into a parking sign.At the time, he was\nsubject to an undertaking which prohibited him from operating “a motor vehicle\nat anytime in any place” and from “the possession or use of alcoholic\nbeverages.”This undertaking was entered into by Mr. Butt on April 4th\n2003, in relation to charges under sections 253(a) and 254(5) of the Code.Mr. Butt has been in custody since his arrest on May 29th 2004.[4]When the\npolice responded, Mr. Butt refused to get out of the car and he became very\nabusive.Eventually, he was handcuffed and he subsequently threatened to kill\nthe arresting officer.[5]At the police station,\nhe refused to comply with a demand that he provide samples of his breath for\nblood-alcohol analysis.THE OFFENDER[6]Mr.\nButt is fifty-one years of age.His father was a heavy drinker.He was also\nphysically and emotionally abusive.[7]Mr. Butt began\ndrinking alcohol when he was approximately twelve to thirteen years ofage.He\nhas been enrolled in substance abuse programs, but has not completed oneof\nthem.He is presently unemployed and in receipt of socialassistance.[8]Mr. Butt has a\nlengthy and related criminal record.His criminal record commences in 1970.His latest conviction was in 1999.He has been convicted of such offences as\ntheft, break and entry, possession of stolen goods, fraud, trafficking in a\nnarcotic, uttering threats, assault and operating a motor vehicle while\nprohibited from doing so.In addition, he has twelve previous convictions for\ndrinking and driving related offences and thirteen previous convictions\nrelating to breaching undertakings, probation orders and other similar court\norders.[9]In R.\nv. O'Flaherty (1997), 1997 CanLII 14649 (NL CA), 155 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 150, the Newfoundland and\nLabrador Court of Appeal considered a case in which the offender also had a\nlengthy criminal record.At page 158, Mr. Justice Steele stated:... The\nrespondent long ago exhausted any claim for leniency or further indulgence and\nassuming imprisonment is still the only real deterrent (or option) for this\noffender, a recidivist who refuses to conform or try to rehabilitate himself,\nhis term of incarceration must be at the higher end of the range of sentence.In the circumstances a sentence of two years was not tenable or rational;I\nwould consider four years to be a fit and proper sentence.[10]In R. v. H.J.P. (1995), 133 Nfld.\n\u0026 P.E.I.R. 348 (N.L.C.A.), Mr. Justice Steele commented upon the effect\nthat a related criminal record has upon the application of the sentencing\nprinciples of proportionality, rehabilitation and deterrence.At paragraph 14,\nhe wrote:A criminal record surely indicates diminished prospects for\nrehabilitation.Furthermore, a criminal record, and particularly where the\noffences are similar, is the omen that immediately alerts the sentencing judge\nto the reality that the offender has become a serious threat to the community.How great the risk ofcourse, depends on the nature of the offences and the\ncircumstances...[1][11]Mr. Justice\nSteele also cautioned trial judges, however, that the sentence imposed must be\nproportionate to the offence committed, even with respect to “a repeat,\npotentially dangerous offender.”[2]THE CRIMINAL CODE’S SENTENCING\nPROVISIONS[12]Section 718\nofthe Criminal Code states that the fundamental purpose of sentencing\n“is to contribute...to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just,\npeaceful, and safe society.”This is to be achieved by imposing sentences\nwhich have, among others, the following objectives:- separating offenders\nfrom society, where necessary;- denouncing unlawful\nconduct;- general deterrence;- rehabilitation; and- the promoting of a\n“sense of responsibility in offenders, andacknowledgement of the\nharm done to victims and the community.”[13]Section\n718.2(d) states that “an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less\nrestrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances” and section\n718.2(e) states that “all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are\nreasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with\nparticular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.”[14]Section 718.1 of the Criminal\nCode states that any sentence imposed must be “proportionate to the gravity\nof the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.”The heading\nto this section describes it as the “fundamental principle” of sentencing in\nCanada.THE POSITIONS OF THE\nPARTIESTHE CROWN:[15]The Crown submits that the\nCourt should impose a period of incarceration in the range of three years and\nthat it should also impose a lifetime driving prohibition.Ms. Colford\nreferred to Mr. Butt’s long and related criminal record and submitted that he\nconstitutes a present and ongoing danger to the public.After referring to the\nfailure of previous sentences to have deterred him, she suggests that the time\nhas come for the Court to consider the protection of the public through the use\nof incarceration as a means of separating Mr. Butt from society.MR. BUTT:[16]Mr. Butt\nsubmits that considering the time he has spent in pre-sentence custody, that a\nperiod of nine moths incarceration would be appropriate.Mr. Kearney\nacknowledges Mr. Butt’s related criminal record but points out that his last\nconviction for a drinking and driving offence was in 1990.Finally, Mr.\nKearney submits that a driving prohibition of a maximum of ten years in\nduration would be sufficient.PRE-SENTENCE CUSTODY[17]As pointed\nout earlier, Mr. Butt has been in custody since his arrest on May 29th\n2004, a period of one hundred and three days.Section 719(3) of the Code\nallows the Court to consider this time period in determining an appropriate\nsentence.Though pre-sentence custody is normally credited at a rate of\ntwo-for-one, no absolute rule applies (see R. v. Caza, [2002] O.J. No.\n2625 (C.A.) and R. v. Mason (2002), 166 Man. R. (2d) 166 (C.A.), at\nparagraph 11).In United States of America v. Adam (2003), 2003 CanLII 31874 (ON CA), 174 C.C.C.\n(3d) 445 (Ont. C.A.), it was noted that there is no “guarantee” that double\ncredit will be granted and in R. v. Vermette (2001), 2001 MBCA 64 (CanLII), 156 Man. R. (2d)\n120 (C.A.), many of the numerous exceptions to the general rule were described,\nat paragraph 66, as follows:There\nhave been many cases where credit for pre-sentencing custody has been denied or\ngiven on a ratio less than 2:1. For example, where the offenders did in fact\nreceive a full range of educational, vocational or rehabilitation programs,\nless than double time credit was given. (See R. v. Schoenhalz (M.M.) (1999),\n1999 BCCA 77 (CanLII), 121 B.C.A.C. 138; 198 W.A.C. 138 (C.A.) and R. v. Brownlie, [1997]\nB.C.J. No. 1972 (S.C.), at para. 37 [summarized 35 W.C.B. (2d) 504].)\nAlternatively, where the previous incarceration history suggests that the\naccused person would be unlikely to obtain early release, the individual was in\ncustody because he repeatedly breached the conditions of his release or the\naccused is seen to pose a serious danger to society, courts have either\ndeparted from the standard 2:1 ratio or denied credit for pre-sentencing\ncustody altogether: R. v. Mills at para. 48; R. v. Warren (G.)\n(1999), 1999 CanLII 2205 (ON CA), 127 O.A.C. 193 (C.A.); and R. v. C.A.M., 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500;\n194 N.R. 321; 73 B.C.A.C. 81; 120 W.A.C. 81, at paras. 95-96.[3][18]The\ndifficulty with adopting an absolute rule of always providing double credit for\ntime spent in pre-sentence custody is illustrated by the judgement of the\nManitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Young, 2004 MBCA 69 (CanLII), [2004] M.J. No. 188.In Young,\nthe Court of Appeal proposed that a one and one-half credit should be granted\nwhen the “harshness of the\npre-sentence custody is not a factor” (at paragraphs 18-19):There is no question that pre-sentence custody is harsher\nthan the conditions a detained person enjoyed in the community before his\ndetention. But that is not the proper comparator. The harshness of pre-custody\ndetention must be measured against the conditions that apply to a sentenced\nprisoner. In this case, the agreed facts are that the accused served his\npre-sentence custody at the Brandon Correctional Institution in conditions\nidentical to inmates serving sentences at the Institution and had access to a\nfull range of programming and educational opportunities.In my view, a credit of one and one-half for one is an\nappropriate and useful guideline for the sentencing judge in circumstances\nwhere, as in this case, the harshness of the pre-sentence custody is not a\nfactor. The 1.5:1 formula, however, is not a rigid or precise mathematical one.\nAs explained in Wust, the sentencing judge \"remains in the best\nposition to carefully weigh all the factors which go toward the determination\nof the appropriate sentence\" (at para. 45).[19]In R. v.\nSeaward, [2003] N.J. No. 307, I had the opportunity to consider section 719(3) of the Code\n(at paragraphs 19-20):For\nreasons that in my view, are far from compelling or convincing, this provision\nhas routinely been applied by judges so as to turn such periods of time\n(referred to as \"pre-sentence custody\") into extra\n\"credits.\"What occurs, is that a judge imposes a period of\nimprisonment that he or she deems appropriate for the offence committed.Then,\nthe period of time served prior to sentence being imposed is multiplied by the\nsentencing judge by a factor of two and even sometimes three.Then, that\ninflated and completely artificial period of time is subtracted from the\nsentence imposed.In this particular case,\nMr. Seaward is in custody because of his numerous breaches of court orders.In\nmy view, it would be inappropriate therefore to multiply his pre-sentence\ncustody by any numerical figure.However, it is appropriate to reduce the\nsentence I would have otherwise imposed in this case by a period of thirty days\nso as to reflect the exact number of days that Mr. Seaward has spent in\npre-sentence custody (see R. v. Passarelli, [2001] O.J. No. 5830\n(S.C.J.), at paragraph 25 and R. v. Duchominsky, [2003] M.J. No. 26,\n2003 MBCA 19 (CanLII), at paragraph 29).[20]In this\nparticular case, I conclude that Mr. Butt should not receive double credit for\nthe period of pre-sentence custody he has served.Mr. Butt was held in custody\nbecause of his failure to comply with two of his release conditions and he has\na long history of ignoring court orders.In addition, after his first\nappearance on May 31st 2004, Mr. Butt was remanded into custody from\ntime to time by consent and there is no evidence that he was held in harsh\nconditions nor that he missed out on any rehabilitative programs that he would\nhave been otherwise inclined to take advantage of.However, I do conclude that\nit is appropriate to reduce any period of imprisonment imposed upon Mr. Butt by\na period of one hundred and three days so as to reflect the period of time he\nhas been in custody since his arrest.For ease of sentence computation, I will\ncredit Mr. Butt with a period of three and one-half months.DRINKING AND DRIVING\nOFFENCES[21]Drinking and\ndriving is a societal problem of gigantic proportions.Every year countless\nCanadians suffer unimaginable losses as a result of these offences.What often\nmakes these losses so tragic is the senselessness of it all.The Supreme Court\nof Canada, in R. v. Bernshaw, 1995 CanLII 150 (SCC), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 254, has pointed out that\nthese offences have a “far greater impact on Canadian society than any other\ncrime.In terms of the deaths and serious injuries resulting in\nhospitalization, drunk driving is clearly the crime which causes the most\nsignificant social loss to the country.”[22]In R. v.\nWoodward (1993), 198 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 240, the Newfoundland and\nLabrador Court of Appeal cautioned trial judges not to impose sentences that\nare disproportionate to the actual offence for which the accused has been\nconvicted.[4]OTHER SENTENCING\nJUDGEMENTS[23]\nIn R. v. Squires (1995), 1995 CanLII 9848 (NL CA), 130 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 84 (N.L.C.A.), the\noffender was convicted of public mischief, driving while prohibited from doing\nso and operation of a motor vehicle with more than eighty milligrams of alcohol\nper one hundred millilitres of blood, contrary to the provisions of the\nCriminal Code of Canada.Mr. Squires had nine previous convictions for drinking and\ndriving related offences and six previous convictions for operating a motor\nvehicle while prohibited from doing so.The trial judge sentenced him to a\nperiod of twelve months imprisonment, including six months for the section\n253(a) offence.The circumstances of the offences were described as follows:Constable Standford, who is a member of the Royal\nNewfoundland Constabulary,...states that on the 12th day of March, 1994, at\n3:10 a.m., he observed Mr. Squires travelling north from Bates Hill and then\nturning right onto Queen's Road in St. John's, Newfoundland. The vehicle\noperated by Mr. Squires, windows were frozen; and also the operator's vision\nwas obscured by this. As well, the vehicle did not have any lights on. The\nvehicle continued east on Queen's Road and stopped on Queen's Road... The\noperator of the vehicle identified himself to the police officer as being Russ\nMcMartin, D.O.B. 45-10-26, of 9 Farrell Drive. The operator who was later\nidentified as being Mr. Squires showed extreme signs of impairment to the\nofficer, being the strong odour of alcohol on his breath, bloodshot eyes,\nslurred speech and a flushed face. As a result of these observations, the\npolice officer at 3:16 read Mr. Squires his rights and caution and the\nbreathalyzer demand, and also advised him of the availability of Legal Aid\nservices.Mr. Squires stated he understood and admitted to the\nofficer to consuming four beers. At 3:25 in the morning he was conveyed to the\nRoyal Newfoundland Constabulary Headquarters; and at 3:35 he was passed over to\nConstable Mitchell, who was the qualified breathalyser technician on duty.\nAnother police officer also on duty that night, Constable F.F. Roche,\nidentified this gentleman as being Lawrence Squires. That was 3:38. At 3:40 Mr.\nSquires stated he gave a false name and identified himself as being Lawrence\nSquires, D.O.B. 48-10-26, of 234 Frecker Drive. Two breath tests were taken on\nMr. Squires. The first at 3:50 produced a reading of 230 milligrams of alcohol\nper 100 millilitres of blood. The second test taken at 4:10 a.m. produced a\nsample of 220 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. At 4:14 a.m.\nthe officers did a check and noticed that Mr. Squires was, in fact, prohibited\nfrom driving. At 4:15 a.m. a Notice of Intention to Seek Writ of Punishment\n(sic) and also a Certificate of a Qualified Breathalyser Technician was served\non Mr. Squires. He was then conveyed to the lockup at 4:25 in the morning.[24]On appeal,\nthe Court of Appeal increased the sentence for the section 253(a) offence to a\nperiod of eighteen months imprisonment.In doing so, the Court, at page 86,\nstated:The minimum sentence which may be imposed on Mr. Squires is 90 days,\nthe conviction being at least a second one for impaired driving or failing the\nbreathalyzer.If Mr. Squires is going to be diverted from his anti-social\ncourse of conduct, it seems clear that an attempt must be made to deter him\nfrom continuing such behaviour by a much higher term of imprisonment.Further,\ngeneral deterrence and protection of the public are also relevant factors.The\npublic must be protected from persons such as Mr. Squires, and members of the\ngeneral public who might be inclined to drink and drive must also be made aware\nthat such will not be tolerated.Thus, the term of imprisonment for the\nsection 253 offence must be substantially increased and we would do so by varying\nit to 18 months imprisonment...[25]In R. v.\nRiley (1996), 21 M.V.R. (3d) 169 (N.S.C.A.), the offender was convicted of\ntwo counts of impaired driving contrary to section 253(b) of the Code\nand breach of undertaking.The Court of Appeal summarized the circumstances of\nthe offences as follows:On August 3, 1995 at about 7:00 p.m. the Berwick Town\nPolice acting on a complaint encountered the respondent pulling his car into a\nparking lot. He was observed to be unsteady on his feet and smelling of liquor.\nFollowing a \"fail\" on an approved screening device, the respondent\ntook the breathalyzer test and registered two readings of 230 milligrams of\nalcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. He was charged with operating a motor\nvehicle with a concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeding 80 milligrams\nper 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code and\nimpaired driving contrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. He was\nreleased on an undertaking given to a Justice of the Peace to keep the peace,\nrefrain from using alcohol or drugs, refrain from driving a motor vehicle and\nto appear at Provincial Court in Kentville on August 8, 1995. On that date, the\nmatter was adjourned until August 28th and on August 28th it was further\nadjourned to September 5th.In the meantime on September 1, 1995, as a result of a\ncomplaint from a citizen, Constable Barry of the R.C.M.P. Kingston Detachment\nencountered the respondent driving a truck on the Victoria Harbour Road. The\npolice followed the respondent for approximately one kilometre and noticed that\nhis vehicle swerved on three different occasions into the lane of oncoming\ntraffic forcing cars on to the shoulder of the road. Constable Barry activated\nhis emergency equipment, but he was not successful in stopping the respondent\nbefore he had driven another kilometre. When the officer approached the\nrespondent he noticed that he was extremely intoxicated with a strong odor of\nliquor on his breath. He was transported to the Kingston Detachment where two\nsamples of his breath were obtained on the breathalyzer. The first sample\nrevealed 340 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood and the second,\n330 milligrams per 100 millilitres.The respondent was charged in an information sworn\nSeptember 1, 1995 with operating a motor vehicle with a concentration of\nalcohol in his blood exceeding 80 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood\ncontrary to s. 253(b) of the Criminal Code and with impaired driving\ncontrary to s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code. He was also charged with\nfailing without legal excuse to comply with a condition in an undertaking given\nto a Justice of the Peace, namely to refrain from the use or possession of\nalcohol and non-medically prescribed drugs and refrain from the operation of a\nmotor vehicle, contrary to s. 145(3)(a) of the Criminal Code.The respondent\nappeared in Provincial Court at Kentville on September 5th to respond to the\ntwo charges arising out of the events of August 3, 1995 and the three charges\narising out of the events of September 1, 1995. With respect to the drinking\nand driving charges, the Crown proceeded by way of indictment. The respondent\nelected trial in Provincial Court and entered pleas of guilty to the two charges\ncontrary to s. 253(b) and to the charge contrary to s. 145(3)(a) of the Criminal\nCode. The Crown offered no evidence on the s. 253(a) charges.[26]The accused had nine\nprevious drinking and driving convictions.The trial judge suspended sentence and\nplaced Mr. Riley on probation.The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal increased the\nsentence imposed by the trial judge to a period of one year imprisonment.At\nparagraphs 27-29 of their judgement, they explained their reasons for doing so\nby stating:We must, as this Court did in MacEachern and Nickerson,\nsupra, recognize that general deterrence is the major consideration in\ndealing with drinking and driving offences. Our responsibility for the public\nsafety demands nothing less. This is not to say that appropriate cases may\ndictate emphasis on the principle of rehabilitation. This, however, is not in\nmy view, one of them. The trial judge erred in failing to take into account the\nconsiderations mandated by the decisions in MacEachern and Nickerson.Moreover, the respondent's breach of the undertaking\nbetween the first and the second of these last two driving offences was an\negregious disregard of the law and of public safety. Keeping in mind his\nbackground, it is the strongest indication that he has not yet demonstrated any\ninclination to rehabilitate himself. His counsel emphasized that he has\nappeared to be alcohol free since his sentencing in September. Even if that is\nso, in the face of his previous lack of effective effort to control his\ndrinking, it is insufficient to warrant a departure from the usual approach in\nsuch cases as this. Unfortunately, he must be deterred in a way that assures\nthe public that this behaviour is not treated lightly.I would substitute\nfor the sentence imposed a period of incarceration for one year on each of the\ns. 253(b) convictions and six months on the s. 145(3)(a) conviction. In the\nparticular circumstances of this case, I would order that these sentences be\nserved concurrently. I would also impose the driving prohibition of three years\nwhich, regrettably, is the maximum option open to the Court in this case.[27]In R. v.\nDesjarlais (1998), 34 M.V.R. (3d) 139 (Man. C.A.), the offender was\nconvicted of impaired driving, driving while suspended and failure to appear in\ncourt.The circumstances of the offences were described as follows:The circumstances of the offence are that the accused was\ndetected speeding in a residential area late at night. He was impaired and was\nsuspended from driving. Subsequently, he failed to appear in court on three\nseparate occasions. According to the facts presented by way of explanation to\nthe sentencing judge, the accused's teenaged daughter found herself in a\npersonal predicament. Fearing for her safety, she phoned the accused. Unable to\nobtain assistance from his friends, he departed alone and was on his way to\npick her up when he was apprehended.[28]The accused had what the\nCourt described as a “horrendous record.”The trial judge imposed a fine of\n$2,000.00.The Manitoba Court of Appeal increased the sentence to one of fifteen\nmonths imprisonment.In doing so, the Court ofAppeal, at paragraph 10,\nstated:In my opinion, the facts and circumstances of this\ncase mandate appellate interference. The sentencing judge committed an error in\nlaw when he simply threw up his hands and, based on his assessment that earlier\nperiods of incarceration did not seem to have worked, concluded: \"I don't\nsee much point in sending you off to jail again.\" In doing so, he ignored\nthe gravity of the offences, the risk to the public's safety, the accused's\npast record which disentitled him to leniency, and the sentencing principles\njust adverted to. In my opinion, a fit and proper sentence in all of the\ncircumstances is one of 15 months in jail. There will be a driving disqualification\nfor a period of three years.[29]In R. v.\nHartery (2001), 2001 NBCA 79 (CanLII), 240 N.B.R. (2d) 236 (C.A.), the accused was convicted of an\noffence contrary to section 253(b) of the Criminal Code.“On Christmas Eve\nof 1999, the respondent was observed driving a vehicle at night in a populated\narea in the City of Miramichi, wandering from side to side and, at one point,\ncompletely on the wrong side of the road. He was arrested and eventually\npleaded guilty.”The accused, like Mr. Butt,\nhad a lengthy and related record.The trial judge sentenced him to a period of\neighteen months imprisonment and imposed a driving prohibition of four and\none-half years.[30]On appeal, the New Brunswick Court of\nAppeal concluded that the “sentence of 18 months is demonstrably unfit because it\ndoes not place sufficient emphasis on the protection of the public.”The Court adopted, as correct, the followingcomments made in R. v.\nAlexson (1987), 1987 CanLII 4900 (SK CA), 7 M.V.R. (2d) 95 (Sask. C.A.):With his propensity to drink and drive the respondent is a clear menace\nto society...Under the circumstances our paramount concern must be the\nprotection of the public.There is little point in talking about deterrence or\nreformation and rehabilitation of the respondent.He has not responded to the\nleniency extended to him on earlier occasions and his present conduct\ndemonstrates a flagrant disregard for the law and other motorists and\npedestrians.Since he chooses to defy any prohibition against driving, we must\ndo what we can to prevent what will inevitably happen if he is able to drive-he\nwill kill or maim an innocent victim on the road.[31]The Court of\nAppeal increased the sentence imposed to one of three years imprisonment and a\ndriving prohibition of ten years.[32]In\nR. v. Jones (2001), 2001 BCCA 680 (CanLII), 158 B.C.A.C. 317, the accused was convicted of impaired\ndriving.The Court of Appeal described the circumstances of the offence, at\nparagraph 3 of their judgement, as follows:On 24 May 2000 the car driven by the appellant veered\nacross the Trans Canada Highway where that highway approaches Victoria and\ncrossed the median, the northbound lanes of the highway and Carey Road and went\nover a bank where it landed on top of a parked car injuring an occupant of the\ncar.The appellant had a blood alcohol level of .14.[33]The appellant had\na lengthy record for drinking and driving offences.The trial judge sentenced\nhim to a period of thirty months imprisonment.The British Columbia Court of\nAppeal upheld the sentence.The Court of Appeal held that there \"is no\nsentence structure in this case other than imprisonment that could be employed\nto protect the motoring public and pedestrians from this man.\"The Court\nconcluded:It\nis apparent that previous short jail terms, fines, prohibitions have not\ndeterred the appellant. There is a strong need here to protect the public and\nthat cannot be accomplished other than by a strong deterrent sentence. Federal\ntime is necessary to expose the appellant to programs most likely to be\nbeneficial both to him and to the public interest.In my opinion, the sentence\nwas fit.[34]In R.\nv. Lacourse, [2001] O.J. No. 5940 (S.C.J.), the accused was convicted of\nthe offences of impaired driving and driving while disqualified.He had ten\nprevious convictions for drinking and driving offences, dating back to 1970.He also had four previous convictions for driving while disqualified, dating\nback to 1976.However, there was a gap from 1985 to 1997 in which he had no\nconvictions.The trial judge imposed a sentence of two and a half years\nimprisonment for the impaired driving offence and six months consecutive for\nthe offence of driving while disqualified.[35]In R. v. Hunt\n(2001), 2001 CanLII 33789 (NL SCTD), 207 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 104 (N.L.S.C.), the accused was convicted of\nan offence contrary to section 253(a) of the Criminal Code.He was\nfound in his vehicle on the side of the road.His blood alcohol readings were\n210 and 220 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.Since 1985, he\nhad five previous drinking and driving related convictions.While awaiting the\noutcome of this charge, he committed the offence of impaired driving and was\nsentenced to eighteen months imprisonment.Taking this sentence into account,\nMr. Justice LeBlanc sentenced Mr. Hunt to a period of eight months\nimprisonment.He also prohibited him from operating a motor vehicle for a\nperiod of fifteen years.[5][36]In R.\nv. Connolly (2002), 21 M.V.R. (4th ) 272, I imposed a period of\nsixteen months imprisonment and a fifteen year driving prohibition.The\naccused had been convicted of impaired driving and breach of probation.He had\nfive previous drinking and driving related convictions and ten previous\nconvictions for breaching court orders.[37]In R.\nv. Dunne, [2002] N.J. No. 383 (C.A.),the Court reduced the driving\nprohibition that had been imposed by the trial judge from ten to fouryears.However, neither the circumstances of the offence nor the offender arereferred\nto in the brief oral judgement rendered.[38]In R.\nv. Bordula (2003), 2004 ABCA 8 (CanLII), 181 C.C.C. (3d) 104 (Alta. C.A.), the accused was\ncharged with refusing to comply with a breathalyzer demand contrary to section\n254(5) of the Code.He had eleven previous convictions for drinking and\ndriving offences.The Court of Appeal described the circumstances of the\noffence as follows:On July 28, 2002, a witness observed the respondent\noperating his motor vehicle and telephoned the local police to report the respondent's\npoor driving. Upon arrival at the scene, the respondent was found in the\ndriver's seat of his vehicle, exhibiting signs of impairment. The attending\nofficer requested that the respondent accompany him back to the detachment to\nprovide a breath sample. The respondent refused, ultimately stating: \"Give\nme the charge because I ain't going to blow.\"[39]The\ntrial judge imposed a period of imprisonment of two years less a day, to be\nserved on a conditional basis.On appeal, the Court ofAppeal set aside the\nconditional period of imprisonment and imposed a period of 18 months\nincarceration.[40]In R. v. Williams,\n[2004] N.J. No. 77 (C.A.), the accused was “convicted, under section 255 of the Criminal\nCode, of refusing a breathalyzer demand and under section 259 of driving\nwhile under a court ordered prohibition against driving.That prohibition had\nbeen imposed in the preceding year as a result of his conviction on a similar\nalcohol related driving charge.Altogether, the appellant had six prior\nconvictions for alcohol related driving offences between 1983 and 2000, and two\nprior convictions for driving while court ordered prohibitions were in effect.The appellant had also been convicted in 1990 of dangerous driving causing death\nbut the record did not indicate that alcohol was related to that conviction.”The trial judge imposed a period of\ntwelve months incarceration for the section 255 offence and an additional four\nmonths, to be served on a consecutive basis, for the section 259 offence.A\nten year driving prohibition was also imposed.The accused sought leave to\nappeal in relation to the length of the driving prohibition imposed.In\ndismissing the appeal, Chief Justice Wells stated:The Court noted the significant increase in both the\nminimum and maximum penalties, for breach of section 255 and for breach of\nsection 259, which resulted from amendment to the Criminal Code in\n1999.It must be concluded that Parliament was expressing its deep concern\nabout the frequency and consequences of persons operating motor vehicles while\ntheir ability to do so is impaired by alcohol or a drug and, as a result,\nmandated more severe penalties and prohibitions.The Court must take those\nincreased penalties into account in addressing the appellant's argument that\nthe 10 year prohibition is excessive, when compared with similar prohibitions\nagainst driving, imposed in earlier decisions where the convicted person had a\nsimilar driving offences record.The Court is satisfied that the trial judge properly\nconsidered all of the appropriate factors. While a 10 year prohibition is on\nthe higher end, it is not demonstrably unfit in light of the appellant's record\nof driving offences and in light of the increased penalties provided for in the\n1999 amendments of sections 255 and 259 of the Criminal Code.[41]In\nR. v. Power, [2004] N.J. No. 229 (C.A.), the accused was convicted of an\noffence contrary to section 253(b) of the Code.He had nine previous\nconvictions for related offences.The circumstance of the present offence were\ndescribed by the trial judge as follows:On the date of the\noffence James Power received a call from his common-law partner to babysit\ntheir two children because the regular baby sitter did not turn up.At the\ntime, they were living separate and apart, but still kept in contact. Mr. Power\nhad been drinking the evening before, but assumed that he was okay to drive\nand, in fact, did so.He was stopped by the police, not because of erratic\ndriving, but because they wanted to check the vehicle which had darkened\nwindows and was going a little fast.A subsequent investigation led to Mr.\nPower being given the Breathalyzer demand. His readings were 120 and 110.[42]The\ntrial judge imposed a period of six months imprisonment and an eight year\ndriving prohibition.In upholding the sentence imposed, the Court of Appeal\nconcluded (at paragraph 7):Having considered the\nsubmissions of counsel, we are satisfied that the trial judge made no error in\nprinciple, nor did he fail to consider relevant factors or overemphasize any:\nsee R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500. In the circumstances, we do not\nfind the sentence of 6 months imprisonment and the 8 year driving prohibition,\nwhen viewed together, as they must be, to be demonstrably unfit: see R. v.\nDye (1997), 32 M.V.R. (3d) 80 (Ont. S.C., Gen. Div.). The appeal and the\ncross-appeal are, therefore, dismissed.[6]ANALYSIS[43]A\nconsideration of the precedents cited in this judgement clearly indicates that\nin imposing sentence upon offenders such as Mr. Butt, for these type of\noffences, the primary principle of sentencing to be applied is protection of\nthe public through specific and general deterrence.This is to be achieved\nthrough the imposition of lengthy periods of imprisonment and significant\ndriving prohibitions.It is important to keep in mind in these type of cases\nthat though the offence committed did not result in death or injury, such\noffences are inherently dangerous and it is often only a matter of luck that no\none was killed or seriously harmed by the offender.When dealing with repeat\noffenders, such as Mr. Butt, a Court need not wait until such an offender kills\nsomeone before acting to attempt to prevent it.As pointed out earlier, the\nOntarioCourt of Appeal held in Taylor, that this element of\ndangerousness is a valid factor to be considered in determining a fit sentence.[7][44]As\ncan be seen, however, from a review of these precedents, it is not easy to\ndetermine the exact length of the period of imprisonment that should be imposed\nfor repeat drinking and driving offenders that have committed an offence\ncontrary to sections 253(a) or (b)-255(1) of the Code.The periods of\nimprisonment imposed in the cases referred to, range from six months to three\nyears.Driving prohibitions of ten to fifteen years have also been commonly\nimposed.For most repeat offenders, like Mr. Butt, periods of incarceration of\nvarious lengths will normally have been imposed over a number of years and\nfound to have failed to deter the offender and failed to protect the public\nfrom him or her.With such offenders, a waiting game ensues.When will he or\nshe eventually manage to kill someone?Thus, it would be a rare case that a\nsentence as low as six months imprisonment would be imposed for such a repeat\nand dangerous offender.Sentences in the range of twelve to thirty-six months\nimprisonment will normally be imposed.[45]When\na Court has tried to deter a specific individual and when it has attempted to\npromote her or his rehabilitation, without success, then the Court must turn to\nthe use of incarceration as a means of protecting the public, at least for the\nperiod of time in which the offender is incarcerated.In this case, placing\nMr. Butt on probation serves little purpose.He has consistently failed to\ncomply with court orders and has shown little inclination to deal with his\naddiction problem.Unfortunately, he presently constitutes a significant\ndanger to the public and he is likely to continue to do so for an indeterminate\nperiod of time.THE BREACH OF UNDERTAKING[46]As\npointed out earlier, Mr. Butt has a long history of ignoring court orders.In\nthis case, the order he breached was designed to protect the public from him by\na means other than his incarceration and its language could hardly have been\nmore explicit or clearer.Thus, this offence causes the Court great concern,\nnot only because it involves an open and public defiance of the Court’s authority, but it illustrates the\nfutility of attempting to protect the public from Mr. Butt through\nnon-custodial measures.As a result, the Court must concentrate on the\nprinciple of general deterrence.Those who continually breach court orders\nmust understand that significant periods of incarceration will be the result.[47]I\nhave had many opportunities to consider the sentencing principles to be applied\nto this type of offence (see for instance, R. v. Seaward and R. v.\nBennett, [2004] N.J. No. 296).Breaches of undertaking are separate and\ndistinct offences.Normally, they should result in the imposition of consecutive\nsentences (see Mascarenhas, at paragraph 32).[48]In\nR. v. Crocker (1991), 1991 CanLII 2737 (NL CA), 93 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 222 the Newfoundland and\nLabrador Court of Appeal indicated that \"... all sentences should be\nconsecutive unless there is a valid reason for making them concurrent.\"There is no valid reason in this case for making any sentences imposed for the\nbreach of undertaking offences concurrent to the other offences committed by\nMr. Butt.To do so would effectively make the breach of undertaking charges a\nmeaningless one.As pointed out by the Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v.\nDurocher (1992), 131 A.R. 239, the sentence should be consecutive \"to\nmark the added seriousness of the accused's disregard for the order of the\ncourt...\"This is particularly important in this case for two reasons.Firstly, Mr. Butt has a lengthy record for disobeying court orders, and\nsecondly, the undertaking specifically prohibited him from possessing or\nconsuming alcohol and from operating a motor vehicle.CONCLUSION[49]Considering the\nprinciples set out earlier, I conclude that the following individual sentences\nfor the offences committed by Mr. Butt are appropriate:1. for the section\n254(5) offence, a period of eighteen months incarcerationand a fifteen year\ndriving prohibition;2. for the section\n264.1(2) offence, a period of two months incarceration;3. for the section\n145(3) offence, in relation to the condition prohibiting him from operating a\nmotor vehicle, a period of six months incarceration; and4. for the section\n145(3) offence, in relation to the condition prohibiting him from possessing or\nusing alcoholic beverages, a period of three months incarceration.[50]Though all of these\noffences were committed at the same time, they constitute clearly separate and\ndistinct offences.Subject to the totality principle of sentencing, any\nperiods of imprisonment imposed for them should be ordered to be served on a\nconsecutive basis.For instance, Mr. Butt’s threat to kill the investigating\nofficer is completely unrelated to his refusal to comply with the breathalyzer\ndemand.Any period of imprisonment imposed for it should normally be served\nconsecutively, otherwise, no penalty is attached to it.It is often suggested\nthat this is not an offence that the Court should take seriously.That being\nthreatened is part of a police officer’s lot in life.I reject this\nproposition.Police officers, like the rest of us, have a right to be free\nfrom such attempts at intimidation.To believe that such threats are of no\nconcern to police officers is to ignore the reality of the type of work they\nperform and the type of individuals they deal with on a daily basis.[51]The two breaches of\nsection 145(3) of the Code that were committed by Mr. Butt, both relate\nto distinct conditions, though those two conditions are contained in the same\norder.As these both relate to the same order and as they both were committed\nat the same time, any periods of imprisonment imposed in relation to them\nshould be ordered to be served concurrently to each other but consecutively to\nthe sentences imposed for the other offences.[52]This formulation results\nin a sentence of incarceration of twenty-six months and a fifteen year driving\nprohibition being imposed.Considering the circumstances of the offences and\nthe offender, as well as the totality principle of sentencing, I conclude that\nthis period of imprisonment, in combination with the driving prohibition\nimposed, constitutes a proportionate and appropriate sentence (see R. v.\nSpellacy (1995), 1995 CanLII 9898 (NL CA), 131 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 127 (N.L.C.A.)).However, the\nperiod of imprisonment imposed for the section 254(5) offence is reduced by\nthree and one-half months so as to reflect the period of time served by Mr.\nButt in pre-sentence custody.Thus, the total period of imprisonment imposed\nis one of twenty-two months and fifteen days.[53]Considering Mr. Butt’s\nfinancial situation, the victim fine surcharge is waived in relation to each\noffence.[54]Judgement accordingly.[1]In R. v. Taylor, 2004 CanLII 7199 (ON CA), [2004] O.J.\nNo. 3439, the Ontario Court of Appeal, at paragraph 39, similarly concluded\nthat “...a criminal record, depending on its nature, may be an ‘aggravating’ factor in the sentencing context\nin the sense that it renders a stiffer sentence ‘fit’ in the circumstances because it rebuts good character and because of\nwhat it tells the trial judge and society about the need for specific\ndeterrence, the chances of successful rehabilitation, and the likelihood of\nrecidivism.”[2]Also see R. v. Oliver (1996), 1996 CanLII 11050 (NL CA), 146 Nfld. \u0026\nP.E.I.R. 244 (N.L.C.A.), R. v. McCarthy (1997), Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 222\n(N.L.C.A.), R. v. Desjarlais (1998), 34 M.V.R. (3d) 139 (Man. C.A.) and\nR. v. Mascarenhas (2002), 29 M.V.R. (4th ) 1 (Ont. C.A.).[3]Also see R. v. T.J.N., 2004 BCCA 374 (CanLII), [2004] B.C.J. No. 1341\n(C.A.), at paragraphs 38-49 and R. v. A.S.G. (2004), N.S.R. (2d) 318\n(C.A.), at paragraphs 20-23.[4]In Woodward, the Court of Appeal\nreduced the sentence imposed for the offence of impaired driving causing death\nfrom four to two years.It upheld the seven year driving prohibition that had\nbeen imposed by the trial judge.[5]A probation order that was imposed by the other trial\njudge was subsequently set aside.See 2001 CanLII 33789 (NL SCTD), [2002] N.J. No. 378 (C.A.).[6]Also see R. v. Harvey, [2004] N.J. No. 125\n(C.A.).[7]In R. v. McVeigh (1985), 1985 CanLII 115 (ON CA), 22 C.C.C. (3d) 145,\nthe Ontario Court of Appeal points out that “every drinking driver is a\npotential killer.”Also see R. v. Burke (1988), 5 M.V.R. (2d) 170 (Ont.\nC.A.)."}

Dunn, 2011 NBCA 19 (CanLII).STATUTES CONSIDERED: The Criminal\nCode of Canada, RSC 1985.JUDGMENT OF GORMAN, P.C. J.(SENTENCE)INTRODUCTION:[1]Mr. Lyver has been convicted of the offences\nof uttering a threat to kill Mr. Martell Pennell and his dog, contrary to\nsections 264.1(1)(a) and (c) of the Criminal Code of Canada, RSC\n1985 (the Criminal Code). In addition, he pleaded guilty to having\nfailed to appear for the purposes of the Identification of Criminals Act,\ncontrary to section 145(5) of the Criminal Code.The Crown proceeded by\nway of summary conviction in relation to all counts. The sole issue for\ndetermination is the imposition of an appropriate sentence for these offences. For\nthe reasons that will follow herein, I have concluded that this is an\nappropriate case for sentence to be suspended and for a period of 12 months\nprobation to be imposed.Let me explain my reasons for this conclusion by\ncommencing with a review of the evidence presented at the trial.THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT THE TRIAL[2]In my reasons for convicting Mr.\nLyver of the two offences contrary to sections 264.1(1)(a) and (c) of the Criminal\nCode ([2011] N.J. No. 262 (P.C.)), I concluded as follows:I am satisfied that in early October, 2009, out of\nfrustration caused by dogs defecating on his mother’s lawn and Mr. Pennell’s\nwords and actions, Mr. Lyver threatened to kill Mr. Pennell and his dog. I am\nsatisfied that he intended for these threats to be taken seriously and to\nintimidate Mr. Pennell.THE GUILTY PLEA[3]Mr. Lyver pleaded guilty to\nhaving breached section 145(5) of the Criminal Code.Mr. Lyver was\nreleased on a promise to appear in relation to the section 264.1(1)(a) and (c)\noffences.It required him to appear on January 25, 2010 at the Royal\nNewfoundland Constabulary for the purposes of the Identification of\nCriminals Act, RSC 1985.Mr. Lyver failed to appear on that date, but did\nsubsequently do so.THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER[4]Mr. Lyver is 45\nyears of age.He was convicted in 1984 of causing a disturbance.Mr. Lyver completed the Correctional\nOfficer Training Program at the College of the North Atlantic campus at\nStephenville, in 2000.The pre-sentence report notes that Mr. Lyver “has worked within all the adult\ncorrectional institutions in the Province and most recently at the West Coast\nCorrectional Centre at Stephenville, NL and HMP Lock-up at Corner Brook, NL.Mr. Lyver is\ncurrently under suspension without pay.”Mr. Lyver told the author of the\npre-sentence report that he “did not anticipate a favourable review from his\nsupervisors.He related that he does not have a good history of working with\nAdult Corrections.Mr. Lyver related that he is more trusting of the detained\npersons than he is of the staff\\ management.He has stated that whatever the\noutcome of his grievance, he will not return to work as a correctional officer.\nHe is researching available positions in other governmental departments.”[5]The\npre-sentence report indicates that given the nature of Mr. Lyver’s offences and\n“feedback from some of the sources contacted for this report, an anger\nmanagement assessment would be appropriate.”THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIESTHE CROWN:[6]Mr. Khaladkar submits that a\nsuspended sentence should be imposed for the two uttering threats offences and\na fine for the failure to appear for the purposes of the Identification of\nCriminals Act offence.The Crown did not seek the issuing of any ancillary\norders.MR. LYVER:[7]Mr. Burden submits that this\nis an appropriate case for the granting of a discharge.THE CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADA’S\nSENTENCINGPROVISIONS[8]Section 718 of\nthe Criminal Code states that the fundamental purpose of sentencing “is\nto contribute…to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful,\nand safe society.” This is to be achieved by imposing sentences which have,\namong others, the objectives of separating offenders from society, where\nnecessary; denouncing unlawful conduct; general and specific deterrence; rehabilitation;\nand the promoting of a “sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement\nof the harm done to victims and the community.”[9]Section 718.2(d)\nstates that “an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive\nsanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances” and section 718.2(e) states\nthat “all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in\nthe circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular\nattention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.”[10]Section 718.1 of the Criminal\nCode states that any sentence imposed must be “proportionate to the gravity\nof the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.”In R.\nv. Muthoka, 2011 MBCA 40 (CanLII), the Manitoba Court of Appeal considered section\n718.1 and indicated that it “requires an examination\nof the accused’s degree of guilt or moral blameworthiness\nwith respect to the offence committed and the harm done to the victim to ensure\nthat the sentence is in line with her ‘moral culpability, and not greater than\nit...’”In R. v. Dunn, 2011 NBCA 19 (CanLII), at paragraph 17, the\nNew Brunswick Court of indicated that “...where denunciation and general\ndeterrence are predominant objectives in the sentencing process and where the\noffence is very serious and the moral blameworthiness of the offender very\nhigh, the removal of conditional sentences from the array of punishment\npossibilities significantly points the sentencing judge in the direction of a\ncustodial sentence. “[11]Section 718.2(a) of the Criminal\nCode indicates that a “sentence should be increased or reduced to account\nfor any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the\noffence or the offender.” In R. v. Briand, 2010 NLCA 67 (CanLII), [2010] N.J. No. 339\n(C.A.), the Court of Appeal stressed the importance of considering an\noffender’s personal circumstances in applying section 718.2(a) of the Criminal\nCode.[12]Section 718.2(c) indicates\nthat “where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not\nbe unduly long or harsh.”In R. v. Naugle, 2011 NSCA 33 (CanLII), it was\npointed out that there “are no specific provisions in the Criminal Code to\nguide a sentencing judge on when to select a consecutive as opposed to a\nconcurrent sentence.”The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal concluded that “where\nmultiple offences arise out of the same transaction, the Court must ensure that\nthe selection of consecutive, as opposed to concurrent sentences, does not give\nrise to a sentence out of proportion to the overall gravity of the conduct, or\notherwise create a sentence that is unduly long or harsh.”[13]In R. v. B.S.M.,\n2011 ABCA 105 (CanLII), the Alberta Court of Appeal concluded that “all one can\nordinarily produce is a Frankenstein’s monster, by trying to graft two or more\nprecedents together”:...In theory, trying to set some outer limits for a\nsentence range by examining precedents has some utility, but in practice it is\noften unsatisfactory. Typically the outer limits are too far apart to be\nmeaningful, and the facts are all over the map. Few if any cases reallymatch on their facts; so all one can ordinarily\nproduce is a Frankenstein’s monster, by trying to graft two or more precedents\ntogether. Use of precedent for factual questions, especially for numbers for sentences\nor damages, is not usually a useful exercise: R. v. Arcand, 2010\nABCA 363 (CanLII) (para. 216) and R. v. Hennessey, 2010 ABCA 274 (CanLII), 260\nC.C.C. (3d) 499 (para. 80). Both are reserved judgments. Cf. Bagby v.\nGustavson Int. Drilling (1980) 1980 ABCA 227 (CanLII), 24 A.R. 181 (C.A.) (para.\n20). Instead, the value of sentencing precedent lies in its principles and\n(where given) its starting points.[14]In R. v. Johnston,\n2011 NLCA 56 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal indicated that “while the range of sentence\nreferred to in an appellate judgment, whether used in the descriptive or\nprescriptive sense, may be departed from in appropriate subsequent cases, there\nis a difference as to when the deviation can occur. Where the phrase is used as\na descriptive term, the usage is based on a distillation of previous precedents\ncited to or analyzed by the court – the raw data, so to speak – to determine\nwhat has been done in the past. While a prescriptive sentencing range will tend\nto be fixed until it is varied by the appellate court, a descriptive range\n(even when identified by the appellate court) will evolve as sentencing\ndecisions accumulate, especially should new trends manifest themselves. The\n12-24 month range used in R. v. W.E. should be seen in this latter\nlight.”THE CRIMINAL CODE'S DISCHARGE PROVISION[15]The Court's authority to\ngrant an offender a discharge is found in section 730(1) of the Criminal\nCode.It states as follows:Where an accused, other than an organization, pleads\nguilty to or is found guilty of an offence, other than an offence for which a minimum\npunishment is prescribed by law or an offence punishable by imprisonment for\nfourteen years or for life, the court before which the accused appears may, if\nit considers it to be in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to\nthe public interest, instead of convicting the accused, by order direct that\nthe accused be discharged absolutely or on the conditions prescribed in a\nprobation order made under subsection 731(2).[16]Thus, this provision allows\nthe Court to refrain from entering a conviction, despite proof that an offence\nhas been committed, if satisfied two prerequisites exist.The Court must be\nsatisfied that a discharge is (1) in the best interests of the offender; and\n(2) not contrary to the public interest.In R. v. Elsharawy (1997),\n1997 CanLII 14708 (NL CA), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 565 (N.L.C.A.), the Court of Appeal, at paragraph 3 indicated\nthat the “first condition presupposes that the accused is a person of good\ncharacter, usually without previous conviction or discharge, that he does not\nrequire personal deterrence or rehabilitation and that a criminal conviction\nmay have significant adverse repercussions.”SENTENCING PRECEDENTS-DISCHARGES[17]In R. v. Burke,\n1996 CanLII 11083 (NL CA), [1996] N.J. No. 179 (C.A.), the accused, a former Christian Brother, was\nconvicted of assault causing bodily harm in relation to a child at the Mount\nCashel Orphanage in 1975 and sentenced to a period of one month imprisonment by\nthe trial judge.On appeal, an absolute discharge was substituted.[18]In R. v. Morgan,\n[2003] N.J. No. 341 (S.C.), the offender assaulted his spouse by dragging her\nacross the floor of their residence.He had no previous convictions. The trial\njudge accepted a joint submission and imposed a conditional discharge.However, in Johnston the Court of Appeal indicated that “that\nsentences resulting from an accepted joint submission are considered to have\nlittle or no precedential value.”[19]In R. v. L.H.B.,\n2006 NLTD 87 (CanLII), [2006] N.J. No. 149 (S.C.), the accused was convicted of the offences of\nuttering threats and attempting to obstruct the course of justice.A conditional\ndischarge was granted.[20]In R. v. Koc,\n[2008] N.J. No. 161 (S.C.), the accused was convicted of the offence of assault\nand sentenced to a 14 day conditional period of imprisonment. He appealed from\nthe sentence imposed and sought to have a discharge granted.The appeal was\nallowed and a discharge was granted. The appeal court judge concluded:In this case, the trial judge erred in his assertion\nthat the different circumstances of the Appellant, that is, the immigration\nstatus of the Appellant, could not or should not be considered by the court in\nits determination of the sentence. This error resulted in a relevant factor\nbeing ignored or at the very least, underemphasized, which led to a\ndemonstrably unfit sentence being imposed. The sentence resulted in excessive\nconsequences for the Appellant who is now ordered deported from Canada. His\nspouse and young child, who are Canadian citizens, face either the break-up of\nthe family and loss of the Appellant's financial support or relocation to Turkey with the\nAppellant.[21]In R. v. Carrigan,\n[2009] N.J. No. 305 (P.C.), the accused, a correctional officer, was convicted\nof the offence of assault causing bodily harm in relation to an inmate.In\nrejecting the request for a discharge to be granted, Pike, C.J.P.C., indicated\n“that given the circumstances not only of the individual offender and his criminal\nrecord but also the serious breach of public trust and the need to\nemphasize the principles of deterrence and denunciation that a discharge in\nthese circumstances would be contrary to the public interest and therefore\ninappropriate.” [my emphaisi][22]In R. v. Batt,\n[2010] N.J. No. 137 (P.C.), the offender pleaded guilty to assaulting his\nspouse by pushing her as she was tying her shoe.I accepted a joint submission\nand imposed a conditional discharge.[23]In R. v. Fong, [2011]\nN.J. No. 66 (P.C.), the offender pleaded guilty to assaulting his spouse by\nstriking her in the face with the back of his hand. I endorsed a joint\nsubmission that had requested that an absolute discharge being granted.[24]In R. v. Lavallee,\n[2011] N.J. No. 54 (P.C.), the offender pleaded guilty to obstructing a peace\nofficer. I imposed an absolute discharge.[25]In R. v. Pottle,\n2009 NLTD 192 (CanLII), the accused was convicted of the offence of assault with a\nweapon.She had raised an axe in her daughter’s presence.She appealed from\nboth conviction and sentence, in the latter instance seeking the imposition of\na discharge.Both appeals were dismissed.As regards the appeal from\nsentence, the appeal court judge concluded (at paragraph 25):The sentence imposed is at the low end of the range\nfor this crime. It is rare that a conditional discharge is given for assault\nwith a weapon. The trial judge was alive to the serious consequences of the\nsentence that he chose (resulting in loss of employment) but felt that in the\ncircumstances it was warranted. It is speculation on my part, but it seems\nlikely that the trial judge focused on the need for deterrence and denunciation\nbecause a weapon was involved. That would not be unreasonable...[26]In R. v. Bottineau,\n2011 ONCA 194 (CanLII), it was held that sentencing “is a fact-sensitive process.\nImposing a sentence depends very much on the facts of a particular case and the\ncircumstances and culpability of the particular offender. That said, the\nsentence imposed must be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for\nsimilar offences committed in similar circumstances.”SENTENCING PRECEDENTS-FAILURE TO\nAPPEAR FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF CRIMINALS ACT[27]In R. v.\nGiovanninni, [2005] N.J. No. 94\n(P.C.), a period of sixty days imprisonment was imposed upon the offender for\nfailing to appear for the purposes of the Identification of\nCriminals Act.[28]In R. v. O'Keefe,\n[2006] N.J. No. 290\n(P.C.), the offender pleaded guilty to the offences of mischief and failure to\nappear for the purposes of the Identification of Criminals\nAct.I accepted a joint submission requesting that a conditional\ndischarge be imposed.[29]In R. v. Pardy,\n[2009] N.J. No. 321\n(P.C.), I noted that the \"purpose of the Identification\nof Criminals Act is to identify through fingerprints and photographs\nthose charged with offences.This is an objective which has a significant\nsocietal benefit; which is achieved through very non-intrusive measures; and\nwhich is authorized by sections 501(3) and 509(5) of the Criminal\nCode. In sentencing for this offence, the Court is attempting to\nencourage compliance with a valid legislative goal.\"In Pardy, I imposed a period of one month imprisonment.[30]In R.\nv. Whiteway, [2010] N.J. No. 141 (P.C.), I suspended sentence and\nplaced the offender on probation for a period of 12 months for breaching\nsection 145(5) of the Criminal Code by failing to appear for the\npurposes of the Identification of Criminals Act.These precedents do\nnot suggest that a prescriptive range of sentence has been established.SENTENCING\nPRECEDENTS-UTTERING THREATS[31]In R. v. Crocker,\n(1991), 1991 CanLII 2737 (NL CA), 93 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 222 (N.L.C.A.), the Newfoundland and Labrador\nCourt of Appeal indicted that sentences “for threats to cause bodily harm range\nup to one year although frequently it has been ordered that the sentence be\nserved concurrently with sentences imposed for other crimes committed in\nconjunction with the threat.”[32]In R. v. Rowe (1995),\n1995 CanLII 9875 (NL CA), 133 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 20 (N.L.S.C.), the accused was convicted of a number\nof offences including the offence of uttering a threat.The accused became\nupset with the victim as a result of the victim having had a couple of dates\nwith his former spouse. The accused went to the victim's store and, while wielding an axe, threatened to kill him.The\ntrial judge imposed a period of four months imprisonment for this offence.[33]In R. v.\nSheppard, 201I NLPC 0811A00044, the accused was convicted of assaulting\nand threatening to kill Gertrude Martin (see [2011] N.J. No. 255 (P.C.)). The\ntrial judge imposed periods of 90 days imprisonment on both offences to be\nserved on a concurrent basis.[34]In R. v. Philpott,\n[2011] N.J. No. 71 (S.C.), the accused was convicted of the offences of assault\nwith a weapon and uttering a threat to cause death or bodily harm involving his\nbrother.The facts were described as follows:Gilbert Philpott, in response to his brother\nunplugging his stereo while he was trying to listen to it, picked up a bread\nknife and, in an attempt to get his brother to leave his apartment, swung the\nknife at him cutting both of his brother’s hands. His brother was holding up\nhis hands by his face at the time attempting to fend off any assault. The\nbrother required stitches to his hands and had surgery for an injury to his\nleft hand thumb. While medical treatment for injuries was required, there was\nminimal time spent at the hospital totaling approximately one day.[35]Justice\nLeBlanc imposed a period of 15 months incarceration, which included a period of\n1 month incarceration for the uttering a threat offence.Judge LeBlanc agreed\nwith the proposition that the range of sentence for threats uttered in\nnon-intimate relationships extended from a discharge to six months\nimprisonment. These precedents do not suggest that a prescriptive range of\nsentence has been established for the offence of uttering threats.ANALYSIS[36]Mr. Lyver has one previous\nconviction though it is dated.He pleaded guilty to breaching section 145(5)\nof the Criminal Code.His not guilty pleas to the section 264.1(a) and\n(c) offences is not an aggravating factor, but for those offences he does not\nreceive the mitigation that a guilty plea engenders.[37]Mr. Lyver reacted violently\nin a situation which he easily became very upset.Mr. Lyver requires\ncounseling in relation to anger management.[38]I have concluded that this is\nnot an appropriate case for resort to the discharge provisions.Mr. Lyver has\nbeen convicted of three offences and already has a criminal record.Two of his\npresent offences involved public expressions of violence and one ignored a\nlegal requirement to appear for identification. These identification procedures\nare of significant value to the administration of justice.I conclude that\nconsidering the number of offences committed by Mr. Lyver and the circumstances\ninvolved that a discharge would be contrary to the public interest.A\ndischarge would fail to reflect the seriousness of the offences committed by\nMr. Lyver.[39]I conclude that this is an\nappropriate case for sentence to be suspended and for Mr. Lyver to be placed on\nprobation for a period of 12 months in relation to each count.In addition to the\nstatutory conditions the following additional conditions are imposed:-Mr. Lyver must report to a probation\nofficer in person as required;-Mr. Lyver must attend all counseling or\ntreatment sessions arranged by his probation officer, including any in relation\nto anger management, and strictly abide by all directions and arrangements as\nspecified by his probation officer; and-Mr. Lyver must refrain\nfrom having any contact or communication with Martell Pennell except that he\nmust write a letter of apology to Mr. Pennell.This letter must be provided to\nhis probation officer within 14 days of today’s date.A VICTIM SURCHARGE[40]The imposition of victim\nsurcharges would not constitute an undue hardship for Mr. Lyver.Thus a victim\nsurcharge of $50.00 is imposed in relation to each count.Mr. Lyver has 30\ndays to pay the victim surcharges to the Provincial Court.CONCLUSION[41]For the reasons\nprovided herein, sentence is suspended and Mr. Lyver is placed on probation for\na period of 12 months.[42]Judgment\naccordingly."}

Harry, 2009 ONCJ\n645ONTARIOCOURTOFJUSTICEBETWEEN:HERMAJESTYTHEQUEEN—AND—KELBORN HARRYBefore Justice Peter C. WestReasons for Sentence\nreleased on December 10, 2009Ms. Jennifer Gleitman...............................................................................................for\nthe CrownMr. James J. Grossberg .....................................................................for\nthe accused Kelborn HarryWEST J.:1.Introduction:[1]On November 24, 2009 I found Kelborn Harry guilty\nof several charges alleging a pattern of behaviour involving domestic violence in\nrespect of the complainant, Tina Rees and her three children, Tyler, Travis and\nTyson Cashmore. My findings of fact are set out in that judgment and I will not\nrepeat them here, except where it is required for the purpose of explaining my\nreasons for sentence. Mr. Harry was arrested on April 4, 2009 and was held in\ncustody under a detention order which was made on May 11, 2009. He has been in\ncustody a total of 250 days up until today’s date, approximately eight and one\nthird months.[2]I found Mr. Harry guilty of assaulting Ms.\nRees with a weapon relating to an incident where he threatened to kill her with\na knife sharpening tool. Ms. Rees sustained no injuries as a result of this\nincident. Her son Tyler intervened and was assaulted by Mr. Harry striking and\npunching him in the chest and arm. I found Mr. Harry guilty of simple assault.\nNo evidence was led as to any injuries caused by this incident.[3]I further found Mr. Harry guilty of\nrepeatedly threatening to kill Ms. Rees during the course of their\nrelationship. These threats were made to Ms. Rees and to her sons and were\noverheard by a tenant living in the house.[4]Mr. Harry was also found guilty of\nassaulting Ms. Rees by threatening her with a knife during an argument where he\ninitially was threatening to cut a sofa cushion with the knife. Finally, I\nfound Mr. Harry guilty of assault causing bodily harm where he whipped Ms. Rees\nwith an electrical cord causing bruising on her left side and further causing\nan injury to her right wrist which became severely swollen and required a cast.\nThe evidence disclosed that although it was originally thought that Ms. Rees’\nwrist had sustained a hair line fracture, this was not born out by x-rays which\nwere taken subsequently.Position of the Parties:[5]The Crown is seeking a total sentence of 4\nyears less pre-trial custody, together with a DNA order and a s. 109 order for\nlife. No submissions were made as to a term of probation.[6]The defence suggests that the time spent in\npre-trial custody by Mr. Harry, which is equal to 16 months and 20 days on a 2\nfor 1 basis may be sufficient to reflect the principles of deterrence and\ndenunciation; although, Mr. Grosberg concedes a further period of jail may be\nnecessary to adequately reflect those sentencing principles but he submits the\nmaximum should not be greater than 2 years less a day.Analysis:[7]Courts have long struggled with the\nappropriate sentences to be imposed for those who inflict violence in domestic\nsettings. In R. v. Inwood (1989),\n1989 CanLII 263 (ON CA), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 173 a five member panel of the Ontario\nCourt of Appeal considered the fitness of a suspended sentence for an assault\ncausing bodily harm by a husband on his wife where she received bruising to her\narm, a bump and swelling to her nose and a swollen and cut lip. The Court held\nthat the trial judge erred in not imposing a custodial sentence and that a\nthree month custodial sentence was warranted. However, because of the passage\nof time they declined to incarcerate Mr. Inwood. The Court made these comments\nconcerning domestic violence, which are equally applicable today:This court has acted on the principle that where there\nis a serious offence involving violence to the person, then general and\nindividual deterrence must be the paramount considerations in sentencing in\norder to protect the public. In my opinion, this principle is applicable not\nonly to violence between strangers but also to domestic violence. Domestic assaults\nare not private matters, and spouses are entitled to protection from violence\njust as strangers are. This does not mean in every instance of domestic\nviolence a custodial sentence should be imposed, but that it should be normal\nwhere significant bodily harm has been inflicted, in order to repudiate and denounce\nsuch conduct. I am pointing out later that battered wives, where there are\npersistent or prolonged assaults, may require special consideration in\ndetermining the appropriate punishment. [emphasis added][8]The cases which have followed Inwood\nhave clearly established that the paramount sentencing considerations when\nsentencing offenders for crimes of domestic violence aregeneral and specific\ndeterrence and denunciation. see Regina v.\nPitkeathly (1994), 1994 CanLII 222 (ON CA), 29 C.R. (4th) 182 (Ont. C.A.), Regina v. Boucher\n(2004), 2004 CanLII 17719 (ON CA), 186 C.C.C. (3d) 479 (Ont. C.A.), Regina v. Edwards and Levo\n(1996), 1996 CanLII 1522 (ON CA), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 21 (Ont. C.A.), Regina v. Campbell (2003), 2003 CanLII 48403 (ON CA), 170\nO.A.C. 282 (C.A.), Regina v. Denkers (1994), 1994 CanLII 2660 (ON CA), 69 O.A.C. 391 (C.A.), R.\nv. Bates (2000), 2000 CanLII 5759 (ON CA), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (Ont. C.A.).[9]In Bates the Court said at p. 330:The\ncourts have been made increasingly aware of the escalation of domestic violence\nand predatory criminal harassment in our society. Crimes involving abuse in\ndomestic relationships are particularly heinous because they are not isolated events\nin the life of the victim. Rather, the victim is often subjected not only to\ncontinuing abuse, both physical and emotional, but also experiences perpetual\nfear of the offender.[10]The principles established in these\ndecisions are now statutorily recognized in s. 718.2(a)(ii) of the Criminal\nCode, which deems it an aggravating factor when there is \"evidence\nthat the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender's spouse or\ncommon-law partner.\"[11]There is no doubt that over a period of a\nnumber of years Mr. Harry engaged in a pattern of abusive and threatening\nbehaviour towards Ms. Rees and her three sons. I found that his conduct created\nan environment of fear which both controlled Ms. Rees and prevented her and her\nsons from reporting these numerous incidents to the police. In my view, this is\na serious aggravating factor. Although the physical injuries suffered by Ms.\nRees were relatively minor and transitory, Mr. Harry subjected her to\nassaultive behaviour that left bruises, scratch marks and swelling. What is\nperhaps more significant is the continuingemotional turmoil and upset that is\nreflected in the Victim Impact Statements, Exhibits 2-5 from Ms. Rees and her\nsons. These are the long term effects of Mr. Harry’s abusive behaviour.[12]Mr. Harry has only 1 prior conviction in Canada for Fail to Comply with Bail for\nwhich he received a suspended sentence and probation. He also admitted a\nconviction for possession of an unlicensed firearm for which he received a\n$750.00 fine in St. Vincent. He has never received a sentence of imprisonment.[13]What is of some significance is the fact\nthat after Mr. Harry ended his relationship with Ms. Rees in February 2007 and\nbegan living with Ms. Thompson, he has not had any contact with Ms. Rees or her\nsons. There have been no threats or incidents of assaultive or abusive\nbehaviour by Mr. Harry towards Ms. Rees or her children. Even after the\nremaining charge facing Mr. Harry in relation to Ms. Rees was stayed by the\nCrown in June 2008, Mr. Harry made no attempt to contact Ms. Rees or her sons.\nMr. Harry’s lawyer advises me that Mr. Harry has no intention of ever\ncontacting Ms. Rees or her sons in the future and his contact from February\n2007 until today certainly supports that contention.[14]The cases provided by the Crown were not\nparticularly helpful because of differences in the severity of the assaultive\nbehaviour or the extensive criminal records for similar behaviour. Two cases\nthat were not provided to me by either counsel are the recent decisions of R.\nv. Chirimar 2007 ONCJ 385 (CanLII), [2007] O.J. No. 3323, a decision of\nTrotter, J. (as he then was) and R. v. Shunmuganathan [2008] O.J. No. 991, a decision of Reinhardt, J. In Chirimar the\ndefendant pled guilty to two counts of assault causing bodily harm which\ninvolved him engaging in a repeated course of assaultive behaviour in relation\nto his wife, resulting in serious injuries which Justice Trotter found to be\nparticularly aggravating. Mr. Chirimar had taken extensive steps to address the\nroot cause of his behaviour by attending for counselling and by taking an anger\nmanagement course. He had no previous criminal record and had also expressed\nremorse for his conduct.[15]InShunmuganathan the defendant had\na criminal record which reflected assaultive behaviour towards other partners\nover a ten year period. The injuries were not as serious as in the Chirimar\ncase. After a trial Justice Reinhardt found him guilty of two counts of assault,\none count of assault causing bodily harm and two counts of breach of probation\nin respect of assault convictions relating to his previous spouse. There was\nevidence of rehabilitative prospects and the current girlfriend/complainant had\nforgiven the defendant and was supportive.[16]In Chirimar Justice Trotter sentenced\nthe defendant to six months in jail. He did not take into account the\ndefendant’s immigration status, i.e. the effect the sentence would have on the\ndefendant being deported. In Shunmuganathan Justice Reinhardt imposed a 24 month sentence less credit for 15\nmonths of pre-trial custody. As can be seen by both of these cases, there are\nalso differences in the circumstances surrounding the offender and the offence.[17]Mr. Grosberg and Ms. Gleitman have advised\nme of what Mr. Harry’s immigration status is respecting his deportation from Canada. In Regina v. Hamilton\n(2004), 2004 CanLII 5549 (ON CA), 186 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (Ont. C.A.), Doherty J.A. addressed the most common scenarios involving deportation\nat p. 177:The case\nlaw referable to the relevance of deportation in fixing an appropriate sentence\naddresses two very different situations. In the first situation, it is acknowledged\nthat imprisonment is the only appropriate sentence and that deportation from Canada will inevitably follow upon\ncompletion of sentence. In the second situation, it is argued that a certain\nkind of sentence should be imposed to avoid the risk of deportation from Canada. In the first situation, the\ncertainty of deportation may justify some reduction in the term of imprisonment\nfor purely pragmatic reasons: Regina v. Critton, [2002] O.J. No. 2594\n(S.C.J.), at paras. 77-86. In the second situation, the risk of deportation\ncannot justify a sentence which is inconsistent with the fundamental purpose\nand the principles of sentencing identified in the Criminal Code. The sentencing\nprocess cannot be used to circumvent the provisions and policies of the Immigration\nand Refugee Protection Act. As indicated above, however, there is\nseldom only one correct sentencing response. The risk of deportation can\nbe a factor to be taken into consideration in choosing among the\nappropriate sentencing responses and tailoring the sentence to best fit the\ncrime and the offender: Regina v. Melo (1975), 26 C.C.C. (2d) 510 (Ont.\nC.A.) at p. 516. [emphasis added][18]In Mr. Harry’s case, I have been advised\nthat deportation will inevitably follow upon completion of the sentence. Mr.\nHarry is in Canada illegally.\nHe has no status in this country. In my view, I must therefore consider the\ncomments of Justice Doherty that the certainty of\ndeportation will justify some reduction in the term of imprisonment for purely\npragmatic reasons.[19]In deciding what the appropriate sentence\nshould be, I have concluded that the facts before me on which I made my\nfindings of guilt, where not as \"deplorable and despicable\" as those\ndescribed in Chirimar where the accused, as a first offender, was\nsentenced to six months in jail. Further, Mr. Harry does not have the lengthy\nrecord reflected in the Shunmuganathan case. The Crown's submission that\nthe sentence should be four years is, in my view, well outside of the\nappropriate range of sentence on the facts before me. In my view, the principle\nof totality requires an assessment of the total impact of the sentence being imposed\nin relation to the seriousness of Mr. Harry’s conduct. I must also be cognizant\nthat this sentence will be the first time that Mr. Harry receives a custodial\nsentence.[20]There is also the practical reality that\nupon completion of whatever sentence is imposed on Mr. Harry he will be\ndeported to St. Vincent.[21]In my view an appropriate global sentence,\nwhich will address the need for general and specific deterrence as well as\nexpress society’s denunciation for offences involving domestic violence is a\ncustodial sentence of eighteen months. I will give Mr. Harry credit for the\neight months and ten days in pre-trial custody he has served and on a 2 for 1\nbasis I give him credit for a total of sixteen months and 20 days. He will\ntherefore be sentenced to a further term of one month and 10 days. This will\nalso provide the immigration authorities sufficient time to prepare the\nnecessary paperwork to effect Mr. Harry’s deportation from Canada.[22]Finally, Mr. Harry will be subject to a\nthree year probation order with the only terms that he is not to have any\ncontact directly or indirectly with Tina Rees, Tyler, Travis or Tyson Cashmore\nwith no exceptions. And he is not to be within one kilometre of any place of\nresidence, occupation or education of those four named persons, again there\nwill be no exceptions.Released:December 10, 2009Signed: “Justice Peter C.

Jensen, Esqe. for the AppellantHélène L. Beaulieu, Esqe. for the RespondentBY THE COURTThe\nappeal is allowed.BY THE COURTThis\nis an appeal from a decision of Landry, J. in the Court of Queen's Bench in\nwhich he refused an application by the appellant Wallace Ferris. By his\napplication, Mr. Ferris sought by way of judicial review utilizing habeas corpus with certiorari in aid to quash an Order made by\nClendening, P.C.J., as she then was, on March 9, 1993 restricting his\neligibility for parole until one-half of his five year sentence for sexual\nassault was served. Landry, J. refused to grant the relief on the basis that\nbecause Mr. Ferris had a right of appeal, s.776 of the Criminal Code of\nCanada precluded the requested\nrelief.The\noffence to which Mr. Ferris pleaded guilty and for which he was sentenced\noccurred between January 1, 1987 and August 20, 1992. Section 741.2 of the Criminal Code, the\nso-called \"half-time\" provision used by the Judge to restrict his\neligibility for parole, became effective on November 1, 1992. It has been held\nby the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Boone (S.J.) (1993), 88 Man.R. (2d) 110 and in R. v. C.(T.J.) (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 181 and by the Ontario Court\nof Appeal in R. v. Steel,\n[1993] O.J. No. 2563 (QL) that the\nsection cannot apply retroactively to offences committed prior to November 1,\n1992. Both courts based their decisions on s.11(i) of the Charter of Rights\nand Freedoms, which provides:11. Any\nperson charged with an offence has the right(i)if found guilty of the offence and if the\npunishment for the offence has been varied between the time of commission and\nthe time of sentencing, to the benefit of the lesser punishment.There\nis a contrary view. In R. v. Barbeau and Comtois, an\nunreported decision in the Quebec Superior Court dated June 11, 1993, Boilard,\nJ. expressed the view that s.11(i)[Page 2]of the Charter relates\nonly to sentence and does not encompass an order made under s.741.2. We prefer,\nhowever, the view expressed in Boone, C.(T.J.) and Steel that parole ineligibility is \"punishment\" as contemplated by\ns.11(i) of the Charter. For this reason, the transitional provision in s.\n741.2 is inoperative as it potentially provides for a greater punishment for\noffences committed before November 1, 1992. The order is made by the sentencing\njudge at the time of sentencing and is not a consequence that flows routinely\nfrom the conviction. It is part of the punishment imposed by the sentencing\njudge.There\nwas discussion during argument about the decision of this Court in R. v. Watson (R.A.) (1993), 1993 CanLII 5409 (NB CA), 142 N.B.R. (2d) 327 where it was held that\nthere was no appeal from a s.741.2 order. The Court did not have to consider\nand left open the two questions of whether such an order could be questioned on\nappeal if, one, the substantive sentence was also under appeal or, two, an\norder was made without jurisdiction, which could arise when, as here, the\nsection was not in force at the time the offence occurred or when the offence\nwas not one set out in Schedules I and II of the Corrections and\nConditional Release Act, S.C. 1992,\nc.20.In\nR. v. Gamble, 1988 CanLII 15 (SCC), [1988] 2\nS.C.R. 595, a case that also involved parole ineligibility and which dealt\nsolely with the issue of jurisdiction and not the conviction or term of\nimprisonment, Wilson, J. pointed out that it is a fundamental rule of law that\nan accused must be tried and punished under the law in force at the time the\noffence is committed. She found that Ms. Gamble had a liberty interest in\nhaving her parole eligibility commence in accordance with the law in force at\nthe time of the offence and ascribed a s.7 Charter value to\nthis interest.[Page 3]As\nnoted, the reviewing Judge denied the application because, in his view, the\nredress should have been by way of appeal. In Gamble, Wilson,\nJ. said at p. 635 that \"procedural road-blocks\" should not be placed\nin the way of a person \"who is seeking to vindicate one of the citizens'\nmost fundamental rights in the traditional and appropriate form\".While\nit may be that an appeal could have been one route to take, it is our view that\nthe s. 7 and 11(i) Charter violations are sufficiently substantial for this\nCourt to grant the requested remedy. For that reason, we bring into this Court\nand quash the Order made under s.741.2."}

(2), 20, 23(2)(f), 24(1),\n24.1(1), 28(1), (3).Appellant was\nconvicted of three counts of break, enter and theft and one count of breach of\nprobation.He had already acquired a significant record and was subject to a\nprobation order requiring him to undertake community service.Very little of\nit had been completed at the time of appellant's arrest because of appellant's\nbeing uncooperative.Appellant's home\nlife was depressing.His parents were prone to alcohol abuse and incidents of\nviolence occurred, not only between the parents themselves but also by the\nparents against the children.On some of these occasions, appellant tried to\nstop the fighting.Eight of the nine children in the family had been, or were\nat the time of sentencing, subject to probation orders and three of the five\nyounger children still living at home were in custody at the Manitoba Youth\nCentre.Appellant was a good student but became rebellious when his siblings\nwere released from custody and returned to school.On several occasions he and\nhis siblings were placed in foster homes but were returned to their parents\nwhen they proved to be uncontrollable.The trial judge\ntook careful note of the prior record and the depressing family history and\nordered appellant be placed in open custody for two years.The disposition was\nfound on appeal to be fit and proper, although the dissent, concerned that it\nwas an attempt to provide appellant with welfare assistance rather than\nassessing the appropriate sentence, would have reduced the period of open\ncustody to one year.This appeal deals with the sentencing of young offenders.Held:The appeal should be\ndismissed.The Young\nOffenders Act is part of a spectrum of legislation running from those\nstatutes providing welfare care for children through to the strict sentencing\nprovisions of the Criminal Code.Section 3 sets out a number of\nprinciples.This section is not merely a preamble but is to be given the force\nnormally attributed to substantive provisions.The references in s. 3(1)\nto responsibility and to the protection of society suggest that a traditional\ncriminal law approach should be taken into account in the sentencing of young\noffenders.Yet dispositions must be imposed on young offenders differently\nbecause the needs and requirements of the young are distinct from those of\nadults.Section 24(1)\nrequires judges to consider the protection of society, the seriousness of the\noffence and the needs and circumstances of the young person before imposing a\ncustodial term.The judge can also decide, where custody is required, whether\nit should be open or closed.Open custody facilities have been defined and,\nalthough they will restrict the liberty of the young offender, they do not and\nshould not resemble penitentiaries.These facilities must be dedicated to the\nlong term welfare and reformation of the young offender.Proportionality has\ngreater significance in the sentencing of adults than the sentencing of young\noffenders.For the young, a proper disposition must take into account not only\nthe seriousness of the crime but also all the other relevant factors.The home situation\nshould always be taken into account because it is relevant in complying with\nthe Act's requirement that an assessment must be made of the special needs and\nrequirements for guidance of the young offender.The home situation, however,\nshould not be made the predominant factor in sentencing.The principle of\ngeneral deterrence must be considered but has diminished importance in\ndetermining the appropriate disposition in the case of a youthful offender as\nopposed to that of an adult.Sections 3, 20 and 24 all indicate that\ngeneral deterrence must be taken into account.Dispositions can have an effective\ndeterrent effect.Since crimes committed by the young tend to be a group\nactivity, the disposition imposed on an individual member of the group should\nbe such that it will deter other members of the group.General deterrence\nshould not be unduly emphasized.The annual review\nprocedure provided in s. 28 is an integral part of the disposition and is\none factor ‑‑ and not a major one ‑‑ to be considered\nin determining the appropriate disposition.The annual review of disposition\nprovides an incentive to young offenders to perform well and to improve their\nbehaviour significantly as quickly as possible.As well, it gives the court an\nopportunity to assess the offenders again and to make certain that the\nappropriate treatment or assistance has been made available to them.It\nintroduces an aspect of review and flexibility into the sentencing procedure,\nwith the result that any marked improvement in the behaviour, outlook and\nperformance of the offender can be rewarded and any deterioration assessed.The disposition of\ntwo years in open custody was appropriate here in light of the offences\ncommitted and the needs and requirements of the young offender.Cases CitedApproved:R. v.

J.Appeal\ndismissed.Michael O.\nWalker, for the\nappellant.Don Slough, for the respondent.//Cory J.//The judgment of the\nCourt was delivered byCory\nJ. -- Neither great\nconstitutional questions nor vexing Charter problems are raised on this\nappeal.Yet since it deals with the sentencing of young offenders it is\nconcerned with a subject of some importance that may affect the safety and\nfuture of our society.Factual BackgroundOn January 18, 1991\nJ.J.M. and another young offender broke into premises occupied by a local radio\nstation.An expensive camera and six audio cassettes were stolen together with\n$120 cash.On January 28, they broke into an office and stole some $1,200 to\n$1,700 from an office cabinet.On April 26, J.J.M. and his co-accused broke\ninto premises, which they severely damaged, and stole a camera and $324.On June 17, 1991\nJ.J.M. was convicted of three counts of break, enter and theft and one count of\nbreach of probation.Prior to that date he had already acquired a significant\nrecord.He had been found guilty of three counts of break, enter and theft\nbetween February and April 1990, and two separate counts of taking an automobile\nwithout consent in the months of January and February of that same year.He\nwas, as well, subject to a probation order when the offences were committed in\n1991.The probation order required him to undertake community service.However he had not cooperated with the authorities and had completed very\nlittle of it at the time of arrest.J.J.M. is one of\nnine children.The family history is depressing.The parents appear to be\nprone to alcohol abuse.What is worse, there are reported incidents of\nviolence not only between the parents themselves but also of violence by the\nparents directed against the children.On some of these occasions, J.J.M.\nattempted to stop the fighting.Of the nine children, no less than eight of\nthem had been, or were at the time of sentencing, subject to probation orders.Indeed at the time J.J.M. was sentenced, one of his sisters was sentenced in\nconnection with an unrelated offence.Of the five younger children, still\nliving at home, three were in custody at the Manitoba Youth Centre.His school\nprincipal observed that the appellant was a good student until his siblings\nwere released from custody and returned to school.As soon as that happened,\nhe became rebellious.On several occasions J.J.M. and his siblings had been\napprehended by the Awasis Agency and placed in foster homes.However, they\nwere returned to their parents when they proved to be uncontrollable.Courts BelowAt the trial, Gyles\nProv. Ct. J. took careful note of the prior record and the depressing family\nhistory and ordered the appellant be placed in open custody for two years.In the Court of\nAppeal (1991), 75 Man. R. (2d) 296, Huband J.A., with Lyon J.A. concurring,\nfound the disposition to be a fit and proper one.He found that it was appropriate\nfor the trial judge to take into account the mandatory judicial review of the\nsentence after a year.Helper J.A. in dissent would have reduced the period of\nopen custody to one year.She expressed the concern that in reality the\ndisposition attempted to provide welfare assistance for the appellant rather\nthan assessing the appropriate sentence.AnalysisGeneral Approach to Young Offenders\nDispositionsThe approach the\ncourt should take when sentencing young offenders, is to be ascertained from\ns. 3 of the Young Offenders Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. Y-1.That\nsection is entitled \"Declaration of Principle\" and sets out a\ndeclaration of principle in subs. (1).A quick reading of\nthat section indicates that there is a marked ambivalence in its approach to\nthe sentencing of young offenders.Yet that ambivalence should not be\nsurprising when it is remembered that the Act reflects a courageous attempt to\nbalance concepts and interests that are frequently conflicting.Society must be\nconcerned with the illegal acts of young people.The wanton destruction of the\ncontents of a home by young offenders is just as keenly felt by the victims as\nwould be a ransacking by adult burglars.\"Swarmings\" by young gangs,\nwhere the victims are surrounded and their clothing or money torn from them,\nare a serious cause for concern since they can be the forerunner of even more\nviolent mob action by the same offenders as adults.Yet there must be\nsome flexibility in the dispositions imposed on young offenders.It is not\nunreasonable to expect that in many cases carefully crafted dispositions will\nresult in the reform and rehabilitation of the young person.That must be the\nultimate aim of all dispositions.They may often achieve this goal if the\ndisposition is carefully tailored to meet both the need to protect society and\nto reform the offender.Let us consider once again the provisions of\ns. 3(1).It provides:3. (1)It is hereby\nrecognized and declared that(a)while\nyoung persons should not in all instances be held accountable in the same\nmanner or suffer the same consequences for their behaviour as adults, young\npersons who commit offences should nonetheless bear responsibility for their\ncontraventions;(b)society\nmust, although it has the responsibility to take reasonable measures to prevent\ncriminal conduct by young persons, be afforded the necessary protection from\nillegal behaviour;(c)young\npersons who commit offences require supervision, discipline and control, but,\nbecause of their state of dependency and level of development and maturity,\nthey also have special needs and require guidance and assistance;(d)where\nit is not inconsistent with the protection of society, taking no measures or\ntaking measures other than judicial proceedings under this Act should be\nconsidered for dealing with young persons who have committed offences;(e)young\npersons have rights and freedoms in their own right, including those stated in\nthe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms or in the Canadian Bill\nof Rights, and in particular a right to be heard in the course of, and to\nparticipate in, the processes that lead to decisions that affect them, and young\npersons should have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms;(f)in\nthe application of this Act, the rights and freedoms of young persons include a\nright to the least possible interference with freedom that is consistent with\nthe protection of society, having regard to the needs of young persons and the\ninterests of their families;(g)young\npersons have the right, in every instance where they have rights or freedoms\nthat may be affected by this Act, to be informed as to what those rights and\nfreedoms are; and(h)parents\nhave responsibility for the care and supervision of their children, and, for\nthat reason, young persons should be removed from parental supervision either\npartly or entirely only when measures that provide for continuing parental\nsupervision are inappropriate.(2)This\nAct shall be liberally construed to the end that young persons will be dealt\nwith in accordance with the principles set out in subsection (1).This court has\nrecognized the importance of this statement of principle.In R. v. T. (V.),\n1992 CanLII 88 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 749, L'Heureux-Dubé J. writing for the Court noted that the\nsection should not be considered as merely a preamble.Rather it should be\ngiven the force normally attributed to substantive provisions.Section 3(1)\nattempts to balance the need to make the young offenders responsible for their\ncrimes while recognizing their vulnerability and special needs.It seeks to\nchart a course that avoids both the harshness of a pure criminal law approach\napplied to minors and the paternalistic welfare approach that was emphasized in\nthe old Juvenile Delinquents Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. J-3.Society\nmust be protected from the violent and criminal acts committed by the young\njust as much as from those committed by adults.The references to\nresponsibility contained in s. 3(1)(a) and to the protection of\nsociety in paras. (b), (d) and (f) suggest that a\ntraditional criminal law approach should be taken into account in the\nsentencing of young offenders.Yet we must approach dispositions imposed on\nyoung offenders differently because the needs and requirements of the young are\ndistinct from those of adults.For instance, the\ndeclaration in s. 3(1)(a) and (c) notes that young offenders\ncannot be held accountable in the same way as adult criminals because of their\ndependency on others and their obvious lack of maturity.There are other\nelements in the declaration which suggest that there should be a departure from\nthe strict criminal justice model in imposing penalties on young offenders.Section 3(1)(d) for example, suggests that in some circumstances, no\njudicial measure should be taken against the child.Paragraph (f)\nconfirms the offender's right to the least possible interference with his or\nher liberty.As well, s. 3(1)(h) establishes that young people\ncoming within the provisions of the Act are, wherever possible, to remain under\nparental supervision.Further, while the wardship provisions that were set out\nin the Juvenile Delinquents Act have been abolished, it is significant\nthat s. 23(2)(f) of the Young Offenders Act provides for\nprobation orders which will contain residence requirements.These probation\norders may be used by correctional authorities to place children with\nprovincial welfare agencies.Thus the Act does\nspecifically recognize that young offenders have special needs and require\ncareful guidance.Each disposition should strive to recognize and balance the\ninterests of society and young offenders.The very fact that these are young\noffenders indicates that they may become long term adult offenders unless they\ncan be reformed to become useful and productive members of society.Thus the\ndisposition imposed on a young offender must seek to have a beneficial and\nsignificant effect on both the offender and the community.Senior Judge\nBeaulieu (as he then was), in \" From `Challenges and Choices' to `A\nClimate for Change'\", Y.O.A. Dispositions:Challenges and Choices\n(1988), aptly described the Act's approach to sentencing at p. 4:The Y.O.A.\ndoes not do away with looking at who the offender is; it specifically\ndirects the judge to do so, but the youth's needs must be seen in the context\nof his accountability and the protection of society....The Y.O.A.\ntoo, contains some \"blend\" of criminal law and protection\nphilosophies.However, here the scales are weighted, at least at the\npre-adjudicative and adjudicative stage, toward the criminal law process.The\npaternalistic character of the J.D.A. is replaced by the concept of\naccountability of the individual, coupled with the need to ensure that\nindividual rights are protected by proper procedure....The Y.O.A.\nattempts to balance the protection of society and the young offender's needs.It attempts to balance the due process and treatment approaches. [Italics in\noriginal.]I agree with the\nacademic writers who have observed that the Act should be seen as part of a\nspectrum of legislation that runs from those statutes that provide welfare care\nfor children at one end to the strict sentencing provisions of the Criminal\nCode.Factors To Be Considered When Imposing\nCustodial SentencesSection 24(1) of\nthe Act requires judges to consider three elements before imposing a custodial\nterm:(1)\nthe protection of society;(2)\nthe seriousness of the offence;(3)\nthe needs and circumstances of the young person.The Act empowers\nthe judge, in those situations where it is decided that custody is required, to\ndetermine whether it should be open or closed.Section 24.1(1) defines\n\"open custody\" as \"a community residential centre, group home,\nchild care institution, or forest or wilderness camp\" or other similar\nfacilities.Certainly, places which come within the definition of \"open\ncustody\" will restrict the liberty of the young offender.Yet those\nfacilities are not simply to be jails for young people.Rather they are\nfacilities dedicated to the long term welfare and reformation of the young\noffender.Open custody facilities do not and should not resemble\npenitentiaries.Indeed the courts have very properly resisted attempts to\ndefine as open those facilities which provide nothing but secure confinement.See for example Re D.B. and the Queen (1986), 1986 CanLII 117 (NS SC), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 468\n(N.S.S.C.T.D.), and Re L.H.F. and the Queen (1985), 1985 CanLII 176 (PE SCAD), 24 C.C.C. (3d) 152\n(P.E.I.S.C.).The Young\nOffenders Act thus provides the sentencing judge with a wide latitude as to\nhow the disposition is to be served so as to better deal with the difficult and\ncomplex problems presented by young offenders.With that\nbackground, it may now be appropriate to consider the specific objections that\nwere raised by the appellant to the custodial disposition imposed on J.J.M.Child Welfare Concerns and the Proportionality\nPrincipleThe appellant\ncontended that the trial judge erred in imposing a lengthy disposition that\ncould only be justified as proportional on welfare grounds.It was his\nsubmission that the dreadful conditions existing in the appellant's home should\nnot have been a factor in assessing the length of the term of open custody.It\nwas said that this disposition was a throw back to a type of sentence which\nwould have been imposed under the paternalistic scheme of theJuvenile\nDelinquents Act.The appellant argued that pursuant to the provisions of\nthe Young Offenders Act the disposition had to be proportional to the\noffence committed.It is true that for\nboth adults and minors the sentence must be proportional to the offence\ncommitted.But in the sentencing of adult offenders, the principle of\nproportionality will have a greater significance than it will in the\ndisposition of young offenders.For the young, a proper disposition must take\ninto account not only the seriousness of the crime but also all the other\nrelevant factors.For example, two\nyears of closed custody could never be imposed on a young offender with no\nprior record who had stolen a pair of gloves, no matter how intolerable or how\nunsavoury the conditions were in the offender's home.Nonetheless the home\nsituation is a factor that should always be taken into account in fashioning\nthe appropriate disposition.It is relevant in complying with the Act's\nrequirement that an assessment must be made of the special needs and\nrequirements for guidance of the young offender.Intolerable conditions in the\nhome indicate both a special need for care and the absence of any guidance\nwithin the home.The situation in\nthe home of a young offender should neither be ignored nor made the predominant\nfactor in sentencing.Nonetheless, it is a factor that can properly be taken\ninto account in fashioning the disposition.This was very ably\nexpressed by Thorson J.A. in R. v. R. I. (1985), 17 C.C.C. (3d) 523\n(Ont. C.A.).At pp. 530-31 he wrote:...\nI would sound a note of caution.It does not follow, in my opinion, that\nthe relativity principle referred to by counsel must now be applied to young\noffenders in exactly the same way as it is to adult offenders.The close\ncorrelation which is generally looked to as appropriate in the case of an adult\noffender, between the seriousness of the offence and the length of the sentence\nimposed for it, may or may not be equally as appropriate in the case of a young\noffender, where the task of arriving at the \"right\" disposition may\nbe a considerably more difficult and complex one, given the special needs of\nyoung persons and the kind of guidance and assistance they may require.Any\nuncritical application of the principle to young offenders could thus run\ncounter to the larger objectives of the new legislation.On the other hand, as\na factor to be taken into account in the disposition process, the principle is\none which the new legislation must be taken to implicitly recognize....Moreover,\nthe reasoning which has led our courts to favour, wherever possible, a short\nfirst custodial sentence for a youthful adult offender may lose some of its\nforce when sought to be applied to someone of lesser maturity, as, for example,\nwhere a young offender's committal to custody reflects an adjudged need to\nremove him from an unhappy or hostile home environment.[Emphasis added.]The aim must be both to protect\nsociety and at the same time to provide the young offender with the necessary\nguidance and assistance that he or she may not be getting at home.Those goals\nare not necessarily mutually exclusive.In the long run, society is best\nprotected by the reformation and rehabilitation of a young offender.In turn,\nthe young offenders are best served when they are provided with the necessary\nguidance and assistance to enable them to learn the skills required to become\nfully integrated, useful members of society.General DeterrenceThe appellant\nsubmitted that it was improper for the Court of Appeal to take into account the\nneed for general deterrence when it assessed the dispositions.Reliance was\nplaced on the decisions of the Courts of Appeal in both Alberta and New\nBrunswick.In R. v. G.K. (1986), 1986 ABCA 217 (CanLII), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 81 (Alta. C.A.), it was\nheld that general deterrence did not have any place in the sentencing of young\noffenders.This view was adopted by a special five member panel of the Alberta\nCourt of Appeal in R. v. C.W.W. (1986), 1986 ABCA 47 (CanLII), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 355.The same\nposition was adopted by the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in R. v. R.C.S.\n(1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 239.This approach was\nspecifically disapproved by the Courts of Appeal of Ontario and Quebec.See R.\nv. O. (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 376 (Ont. C.A.), and R. v. L.(S.)\n(1990), 1990 CanLII 3289 (QC CA), 75 C.R. (3d) 94 (Que. C.A.).In R. v. O.,\nsupra, Brooke J.A. writing for the Ontario Court of Appeal expressed the\nopinion that although the principle of general deterrence must be considered,\nit had diminished importance in determining the appropriate disposition in the\ncase of a youthful offender.This, I believe, is the correct approach.This\nis apparent from a consideration of some of the provisions of the Young\nOffenders Act.Section 3 in emphasizing the need for the protection of\nsociety, s. 20 by its observation that dispositions should have regard to\nthe best interest of the young person and the public, and s. 24 which\nprovides for a disposition imposing custody if it is in the best interest of\nthe young person and for the protection of the society, all indicate\nthat general deterrence must be taken into count.There is reason to\nbelieve that Young Offenders Act dispositions can have an effective deterrent\neffect.The crimes committed by the young tend to be a group activity.The\ngroup lends support and assistance to the prime offenders.The criminological\nliterature is clear that about 80 percent of juvenile delinquency is a group\nactivity, whether as part of an organized gang or with an informal group of\naccomplices.See Maurice Cusson in Why delinquency? (1983), at pp.\n138-39, and Franklin E. Zimring \"Kids, Groups and Crime\" (1981), 72 J.\nCrim. L. \u0026 Criminology 867.If the activity of the group is criminal\nthen the disposition imposed on an individual member of the group should be\nsuch that it will deter other members of the group.For example the sentence\nimposed on one member of a \"swarming group\" should serve to deter\nothers in the gang.Having said that, I\nwould underline that general deterrence should not, through undue emphasis,\nhave the same importance in fashioning the disposition for a youthful offender\nas it would in the case of an adult.One youthful offender should not be obliged\nto accept the responsibility for all the young offenders of his or her\ngeneration.The Availability of a Yearly ReviewThe appellant\nargued that the Court of Appeal was in error when it assessed the disposition\nin light of the mandatory review provided for by s. 28(1) of the Young\nOffenders Act.Section 28(1) and\n(3) provide:28. (1)Where a young person\nis committed to custody pursuant to a disposition made in respect of an offence\nfor a period exceeding one year, the provincial director of the province in\nwhich the young person is held in custody shall cause the young person to be\nbrought before the youth court forthwith at the end of one year from the date\nof the most recent disposition made in respect of the offence, and the youth\ncourt shall review the disposition....(3)Where\na young person is committed to custody pursuant to a disposition made in\nrespect of an offence, the provincial director may, on his own initiative, and\nshall, on the request of the young person, his parent or the Attorney General\nor his agent, on any of the grounds set out in subsection (4), cause the young\nperson to be brought before the youth court at any time after six months from\nthe date of the most recent disposition made in respect of the offence or, with\nleave of a youth court judge, at any earlier time, and, where the youth court\nis satisfied that there are grounds for the review under subsection (4), the\ncourt shall review the disposition.The section is obviously salutary.It\nprovides an incentive to young offenders to perform well and to improve their\nbehaviour significantly as quickly as possible.As well, it gives an\nopportunity to the court to assess the offenders again and to make certain that\nthe appropriate treatment or assistance has been made available to them.It\nintroduces an aspect of review and flexibility into the sentencing procedure,\nwith the result that any marked improvement in the behaviour, outlook and\nperformance of the offender can be rewarded and any deterioration assessed.The Act provides a system that it is akin to, yet broader than, the probation\nreview provided for adult offenders.The appellant\nsought to rely upon R. v. S. (H.S.), Nfld. C.A., June 2, 1990,\nunreported.In that case the trial judge had imposed a sentence based, in\npart, on the fact that it would be reviewed before it had expired.The Court\nof Appeal disagreed and expressed the view that a disposition must be made on\nthe basis of the facts and law as they existed at the time it was made.They held\nthat the review of a disposition for a young offender could not be considered\nwhen a sentence is imposed any more than could be the possibility of parole for\nan adult.I cannot accept that position.The Young\nOffenders Act provides for a mandatory system of review.In the case of\nadult offenders, the court controls neither the parole nor remission\nprovisions.In the Young Offenders Act the review procedure is an\nintegral part of the disposition.It is therefore appropriate to take it into\naccount as a factor, albeit not a major one, in assessing the appropriateness\nof a disposition.Assessment of the Disposition in This\nCaseThe disposition of\ntwo years in open custody was appropriate.The trial judge was faced with a\nyoung offender with a significant prior record.It was obvious that he was not\ncooperating with the probation authorities or fulfilling his obligations with\nregard to community service.The offences themselves were serious.The\nsituation in the home was intolerable.Yet, in the absence of other family\nmembers, his good work at school indicated that there was real hope for him and\nthat there was a pressing need to provide guidance and assistance for him.The\naspect of the need for general deterrence could not be overlooked since these\noffences had been committed with the help and assistance of others.Further it\nwas appropriate to consider as a factor that there would be a review of the\ndisposition.The disposition of two years open custody was, in all the\ncircumstances, a fit sentence in light of the offences committed and the needs\nand requirements of the young offender.In the result, as\nthis Court directed at the conclusion of the hearing, the appeal is dismissed.Appeal dismissed.Solicitor for the\nappellant:Legal Aid Manitoba, Winnipeg.Solicitor for the\nrespondent:Manitoba Justice, Winnipeg."}

The accused is liable to a maximum term of\nimprisonment of fourteen years for each of these offences.A-THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF\nTHE OFFENCES[2]On July 24, 2005, around 10:30 p.m., Frédéric Garneau, aged 18, drove an\nautomobile with passengers X, aged 16, Annie Lachapelle, who had turned 18 the\nday before, and Y, aged 17. The car struck a lamppost and then a large tree\n(approximately 15 inches in diameter, according to the photos) before stopping\nin the middle of the road. Annie Lachapelle and X perished as the result of the\nimpact, while the accused and Y suffered minor injuries.[3]To relate the circumstances of the offences, I\nreproduce the joint statement of facts as admitted by the accused, in extenso;[translation]That evening, Frédéric Garneau\ndrove his mother’s car, a 1996 Hyundai Accent, to visit friends living in Repentigny. He reached their home around 6:30\nor 7:00 p.m. He left almost\nimmediately to buy six (6) cans of beer at the convenience store and then\nreturned to his friends’ home. Over the course of the evening, his friends Z,\nA, and B, as well as C, D, and E, were present.Y arrived a little later on, around\n8:00 p.m. X and Annie Lachapelle arrived around 8:30 p.m.This group of friends met regularly\nat this location, at the home of A and Z.The accused consumed approximately\nfive (5) beers between his arrival and his departure around 10:00 p.m. Annie\nLachapelle and X drank a mixture of Crush soda and rum in a bottle of Crush\nsoda brought by Annie Lachapelle. B drank one beer, and the others present did\nnot drink any alcohol.Annie Lachapelle had celebrated her\n18th birthday the day before. At some point during the evening, she asked\nFrédéric Garneau if he would like to go out, since he had a car. C explains\nthat Annie Lachapelle wanted to go to an “after-hours” club but that Frédéric\nGarneau did not want to go out all night. They agreed to drive into Montreal. X hesitated because she was\nsupposed to see her boyfriend later. Annie Lachapelle insisted and X decided to\ngo along. Y joined them.As they were leaving A and Z’s\nhouse, the people there talked about the fact that the accused had been drinking\nalcohol. A said to be careful because Frédéric Garneau had been drinking but,\nas C reports, he said that he would do nothing crazy and that there were three\n(3) people with him. Y states that the accused said, [translation] ”Don’t worry, I’m the best driver.”Y told the police that the accused\nwas slightly intoxicated by the alcohol and did not appear to be too drunk. C\nstated that the accused did not appear to be drunk: [translation] “He was walking straight, he could talk totally\nfine!”They left A and Z’s home around 10:00 p.m. in the car driven by the accused.\nAnnie Lachapelle sat in the front passenger seat and Y and X sat in the back,\nwith Y on the driver’s side and X on the passenger side.When they reached Montreal, Frédéric Garneau took Dickson Blvd. south. At the intersection\nwith Notre-Dame St., he stopped\nhis car at the red light in the lane where cars are allowed to take a right\nturn onto Notre-Dame St to go\nwest. Another car was also stopped at this intersection, to the left of the car\ndriven by the accused, in a lane where cars can take a left turn onto Notre-Dame St. to go east. Y described this\nother vehicle as a black Chrysler CrossFire convertible.There was a verbal exchange between\nthe occupants of the Hyundai and the occupant of the CrossFire. According to Y,\nthe accused complimented the driver of the CrossFire on his vehicle. According\nto the driver of the Crossfire, the accused challenged him to a race. The\ndriver of the CrossFire has been identified as Daniel Dupuis, who must answer to\ncharges of dangerous driving causing death and leaving the scene of a fatal\naccident, relating to the same.When the traffic light turned\ngreen, the accused started to move his car, turning right onto Notre-Dame.Between Dickson and Létourneux,\nNotre-Dame is a two-way street going east and west. The speed limit is\n60 km/h.About two hundred feet further on,\nthe CrossFire caught up with and then passed the accused, travelling in the\nleft lane, at a speed that Y estimates to be 160 km/h. The accused was driving\nin the right lane at the time.The CrossFire slowed down. Frédéric\nGarneau accelerated. He caught up with the CrossFire, and followed it closely\nin the right lane. According to Y, the accused was driving at 140-150 km/h at\nthat point. They did not go through any red lights. Y describes what happened\nnext to the police:[translation]Notre-DameStreet is full of bumps, the girls were moving, they\nwere being bounced up and down. Fred caught up with him. We were moving at\nabout 140 km/h - 150 km/h. The girls were not really being bumped\naround, but we were moving a lot on our seats, we were bouncing up and down.All of the occupants of the Hyundai\nwere wearing their seat belts.A white minivan, driven by Leonard\nCoull, was in the left lane ahead of the two cars. He states that he saw the\ntwo cars behind him, racing in his direction at very high speed. He estimated\nthat the two cars were travelling at more than 100 km/h. He himself was\nmoving at approximately 65 km/h. He pointed out the two cars to his spouse, who\nwas a passenger in his car. To be safe, he moved his van into the right lane\nand slowed down.The accused was then behind the\nminivan. He swerved abruptly into the left lane, very narrowly passing the\nCrossfire by moving between it (to the left) and the minivan (to the right).\nThe accused’s car passed so close to the CrossFire that the rear bumper of the\nHyundai probably scraped the front of the CrossFire. Scrapings matching the\npaint from the Hyundai were found on the front of the CrossFire.Y told the police:[translation]There\nwas a white van ahead of us. Then Fred decided to pass between the CrossFire\nand the white van. It was really dangerous. I would never have done that\nmyself. Then the tires began to skid. I held on tight—we were going at least\n140 km/h—to the front seat and the armrest. As soon as he turned the wheel to\npass between the CrossFire and the van, we started to skid. We came really\nclose to the CrossFire, we may have hit him, but I didn’t feel any impact. We\ncontinued to skid. We hit the lamppost, and we stopped in the middle of the\nstreet.Statement\nof July 26, 2005Way\nahead we saw a white minivan in the right lane. We shifted a bit to the left,\nand then moved into the right lane to try to pass the Crossfire and then pass\nbetween the minivan and the other car. We moved between the two cars, but that\nis when we began to skid. We were going about 150 km/h. I looked at the\nspeedometer. Frédéric tried to get control by giving little jerks to the wheel,\nbut it didn’t work. We hit a pole on the right side of the road.Statement\nof July 25, 2005Y also stated: [translation] “I had been in the car\nwith Fred many times and I had never been afraid. He had always been fine but I\ndon’t know what happened.”When they skidded, the accused lost\ncontrol of his vehicle. The car moved toward the right lane, moved abruptly\nahead of the minivan, hit a lamppost on the right side of the road, hit a tree,\nand then continued to move to the left toward the middle of Notre-Dame St., where it came to rest. It\nwas approximately 10:30 p.m.Officer Sylvain Fafard, a\nspecialist in crash reconstructions, was able to determine from the scene that\nthe speed of the Hyundai when it began to skid was approximately 119 km/h.Richard Lévesque, who was driving\nin the opposite direction, saw the Hyundai driven by the accused ahead of\nLeonard Coull’s minivan. He described the manoeuvre as [translation] “crazy”.The impact of the car with the\nlamppost and the tree was such that the passenger side of the car was\npractically torn off and the right rear wheel was pulled off.Y\nleft the car on his own. His seat belt had broken from the impact. The accused\nwas also able to get out of the car, with the help of Y, who states that the\naccused was stunned. They lay down in the grass beside the road.Annie Lachapelle and X had been\nejected from the car and were lying on the ground near the wreck with debris\naround and on top of them. X was dead when emergency assistance arrived. Annie\nLachapelle died on the way to hospital.Frédéric Garneau and Y were taken\nto hospital.The accident occurred between two\nintersections that are far away from each other (Létourneux and Sicard). It\ntook place near the intersection of Notre-Dame St. and Létourneux, a few kilometres from where the cars had first\nencountered each other. The light was dim because the lampposts were on either\nside of the road at intervals of approximately 50 meters. The road was dry and\nin poor condition.An analysis of the blood sample\ntaken from the accused at the hospital at 1:00 a.m. on July 25, 2005 revealed a blood-alcohol level of 81 mg per 100 ml\nof blood at that time.The accused had a probationary\ndriver’s license at the time of the events. He is charged with having driven\nthat evening with alcohol present in his body as a holder of a probationary\nlicense, contrary to section 202.2 of the Highway Safety Code. He\nentered a plea of guilty to the charge in the notice of offence that was served\non him.[4]At the hearing, it was adduced that there was a\ndistance of 1.5 kilometres between the intersection of Dickson and Notre-Dame\nSts. and the location of the accident.[5]It was also adduced that, while the white van\nbelonging to Mr. Coull was moving into the right lane, the two passengers Annie\nLachapelle and X asked the accused to slow down. The accused then turned the\nsteering wheel to the left to pass the white vehicle and lost control of his\nown vehicle just before passing the CrossFire.[6]In the ambulance taking him to the hospital, the\naccused denied that he had been racing with Daniel Dupuis, the driver of the\nCrossFire. He continues to make this claim, although he does admit to driving\nfaster than the speed limit.B-THE VICTIMS[7]X was 16 years old when she died. She was the\nonly child of G.E. and his wife L.L. Mr. E. also has another daughter from a\nprior union.[8]In his testimony, Mr. E. expressed, with much\nemotion but also with courage and dignity, the pain that he felt after the\ndeath of their daughter X and the consequences that this tragedy has had on his\nlife and that of his wife. The psychological trauma caused by his daughter’s\ndeath has kept him from resuming his work as a director, despite many\nconsultations with psychologists.[9]The mother, L.L., is deeply depressed and seeks\nto isolate herself from the rest of the world. She was unable to appear in\nCourt and had the prosecutor read a letter in which she expressed her immense\ndistress caused by the death of her only daughter.[10]Annie Lachapelle had turned 18 on the day before\nthe accident and, like X, died just as her adult life was about to begin.[11]Annie’s parents, Mr. Lachapelle and Ms. Belley,\ndid not wish to testify before the Court, preferring to grieve in private.\nTheir decision is completely understandable and in no way prevents the Court\nfrom supposing that their pain is as intense and profound as that of any\nparents suffering the death of their child under such tragic circumstances.[12]The parents of the accused insisted on\nexpressing their sympathy to the parents of X and Annie Lachapelle, both orally\nand in writing.[13]The accused asked his lawyer to read a message\naddressed to the parents of Annie and X, in which he expressed his sadness and\nshame at having caused the death of their respective daughters and apologized\nfor the great pain that he had caused them.C-THE ACCUSED[14]Frédéric Garneau was born on June 29, 1987. He was about 18 years and\n1 month old at the time of the offence. He is now 20 years and 4 months\nold.[15]The accused has no prior criminal record.[16]After his arrest on July 24, 2005, the accused\nwas held for five days and then granted interim released on July 28, 2005 on a\nrecognizance with specific terms prohibiting him from operating any motor\nvehicle whatsoever and imposing a curfew from 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., unless\naccompanied by his father or mother or godmother.[1] The father of the accused testifies that\nhis son has complied with the terms of his recognizance.[17]The accused continued his studies and in the\nsummer of 2006 obtained a vocational school diploma in landscaping. Since May\n3, 2006, he has worked as a landscaper and his employers state that they are\nvery satisfied with his work and his involvement with the company.[18]Stéphan Gélinas, psychologist, met with Frédéric\nGarneau five times between August 12, 2005 and November 24, 2005. He has adduced a summary of the meetings in\nwhich concept of mourning, the sense of guilt felt after the accident, and the\nimpact of the accident on the life of the accused were discussed.[19]Finally, the pre-sentencing report requested by\nthe defence contains certain statements that are disputed by the accused. Under\nthese circumstances, the Court will not take it into account, especially since\nthe report does not mention any information that is not already the subject of\nadmissions in the joint statement of facts or has not been established by the\ntestimonies and documentary evidence before the Court.[20]At the time of the accident, Frédéric Garneau\nhad had a probationary license for one month. Under the terms of Section 202.2\nof the Highway Safety Code,[2] as\nholder of a probationary licence, he was prohibited from driving a motor\nvehicle or having care or control of such a vehicle if any alcohol was present\nin his body.[21]Benoit Garneau, the father of the accused,\nstates that his son Frédéric had no major behavioural problems, although he\noccasionally drank alcoholic beverages and had also tried cannabis at irregular\nintervals for a period of approximately one year but had stopped using it two\nor three weeks before the accident. The father had reminded his son on several\noccasions that he should not drive a vehicle if he had been drinking alcoholic\nbeverages.D-THE POSITIONS OF THE\nPARTIES[22]In light of the seriousness of the offences and\ntheir tragic consequences, as well as the heavy responsibility of the accused\nand the aggravating circumstances, the Crown prosecutor seeks a three-year\nsentence of imprisonment combined with an order to prohibit him from operating\na motor vehicle for four years plus the period to which he is sentenced to\nimprisonment. The primary objectives of this sentence are denunciation and\ndeterrence.[23]Counsel for the accused emphasizes the\nattenuating circumstances favourable to her client and submits that a suspended\nterm of imprisonment of less than two years with strict conditions would\nachieve the objectives of denunciation and deterrence and promote the\nrehabilitation of the accused.[24]Counsel on both sides cite a number of judgments\non sentencing for dangerous driving causing death, a list of which is appended.[25]I do not find it necessary to undertake an\nexhaustive review of these cases, since each sentence is personalized and\nadapted to the particular circumstances of the offence and the situation of the\noffender.[26]It is worth pointing out, however, that this\ntype of offence generally receives a sentence of imprisonment between one and\nthree years and that several decisions have allowed for the sentence of\nimprisonment to be served in the community, while other required incarceration.E-OBJECTIVES AND\nPRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[27]Sentencing under the criminal law has specific\nobjectives and is based on the principles set out in sections 718, 718.1, and\n718.2 of the Criminal Code. The provisions relevant to the present case\nread as follows:718. Purpose - The\nfundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention\ninitiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and\nsafe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following\nobjectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other\npersons from committing offences;(c) to separate offenders from\nsociety, where necessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating\noffenders;(e) to provide reparations for harm\ndone to victims or to the community; and(f) to promote a sense of\nresponsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and\nto the community.718.1 Fundamental principle - A sentence must be proportionate to\nthe gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.718.2 Other sentencing\nprinciples - A court that imposes a sentence shall\nalso take into consideration the following principles:(a) a sentence\nshould be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or\nmitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender;…(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar\noffenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;…(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive\nsanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; ande) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable\nin the circumstances should be considered ….[28]In the present case, given the circumstances of\nthe offences, the prosecution asks the Court to assign the greatest weight to\nthe objectives of denunciation and deterrence and to impose a punishment that\nis a just and appropriate sentence, in light of the circumstances.[29]In R. v. M (C.A.), Lamer C.J. states the following regarding retribution as an\nobjective of sentencing:79Retribution, as an objective of sentencing, represents nothing less than the\nhallowed principle that criminal punishment, in addition to advancing\nutilitarian considerations related to deterrence and rehabilitation, should\nalso be imposed to sanction the moral culpability of the offender. In my view,\nretribution is integrally woven into the existing principles of sentencing in\nCanadian law through the fundamental requirement that a sentence imposed be\n\"just and appropriate\" under the circumstances. Indeed, it is my\nprofound belief that retribution represents an important unifying principle of\nour penal law by offering an essential conceptual link between the attribution\nof criminal liability and the imposition of criminal sanctions.[3][30]To distinguish retribution from vengeance, Lamer\nJ. adds:80… Vengeance, as I\nunderstand it, represents an uncalibrated act of harm upon another, frequently\nmotivated by emotion and anger, as a reprisal for harm inflicted upon oneself\nby that person. Retribution in a criminal context, by contrast, represents an\nobjective, reasoned and measured determination of an appropriate punishment\nwhich properly reflects the moral culpability of the offender, having\nregard to the intentional risk-taking of the offender, the consequential harm\ncaused by the offender, and the normative character of the offender's conduct.[4][31]Lamer J. also explains the distinction between\nretribution and denunciation:81 Retribution, as well, should be\nconceptually distinguished from its legitimate sibling, denunciation.\nRetribution requires that a judicial sentence properly reflect the moral\nblameworthiness of that particular offender. The objective of denunciation\nmandates that a sentence should also communicate society's condemnation of that\nparticular offender's conduct. In short, a sentence with a denunciatory element\nrepresents a symbolic, collective statement that the offender's conduct should\nbe punished for encroaching on our society's basic code of values as enshrined\nwithin our substantive criminal law. As Lord Justice Lawton stated in R. v.\nSargeant (1974), 60 Cr. App. R. 74, at p. 77: \"society, through the\ncourts, must show its abhorrence of particular types of crime, and the only way\nin which the courts can show this is by the sentences they pass.\" [5]F-ANALYSIS[32]The prosecution and the defence agreed to submit\na joint statement of fact, but their respective counsel have a divergence of\nopinion with respect to whether the accused participated in a street race.[33]From the outset, when he was being taken to the\nhospital, Frédéric Garneau insisted that he did not take part in a race;\nindeed, he continues to deny it, even after submitting his guilty plea. He\nacknowledges only that he was travelling at an excessive speed, having regard\nto all the circumstances, before he lost control of his vehicle.[34]An analysis of the evidence as a whole, however,\nleads me to conclude that the accused Garneau spontaneously, with no prior\nplanning or organization, took part in a speed contest with the CrossFire\ndriven by Daniel Dupuis on Notre-Dame St. Initiated by a verbal exchange\nbetween the drivers at the intersection of Dickson and Notre-Dame Sts., the\nrace actually began when the CrossFire, travelling at a very high speed,\nreached the accused’s vehicle approximately 200 feet from the intersection, at\nwhich point the accused accelerated to catch up with the car driven by Dupuis.[35]Both drivers continued the race. They were very\nclose to each other, with Garneau driving in the right lane and Dupuis in the\nleft lane, and according to all witnesses, moving very quickly. Passenger Y\nnoted a speed of 150 km/h on the speedometer of the accused’s vehicle as the\ntwo cars approached Mr. Coull’s white minivan, which had moved over to the\nright lane.[36]Rather than stop the race when they drew nearer\nto the obstacle that was Mr. Coull’s vehicle, which was complying with the\nspeed limit at this location, the accused tried to pass Dupuis’s CrossFire by\ngoing between it on his left and Mr. Coull’s vehicle on his right.[37]The conduct of the accused and Daniel Dupuis at\nthe wheels of their respective vehicles corresponds exactly to the definition\nof a race in the French-language dictionary the Grand Robert de la langue\nfrançaise, which reads as follows:[translation]Race: contest of speed; competition over a distance, a given route.[38]We may also refer to the definition of the term\n“street racing” added by Parliament to section 2 of the Criminal Code,\nwhich reads as follows:“street racing” means operating a motor vehicle in a race with at\nleast one other motor vehicle on a street, road, highway or other public place.[6][39]For the foregoing reasons, the Court is\npersuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused Garneau took part in a\nrace that also involved the vehicle driven by Daniel Dupuis and that ended when\nthe accused lost control of his vehicle, which violently hit a lamppost and a\ntree, causing the death of Annie Lachapelle and X.[40]The Court also considers the fact that the\naccused, the holder of a probationary license, operated a motor vehicle after\nhaving consumed alcoholic beverages to be an aggravating circumstance in\nrelation to the offence.[41]As soon as he arrived at his friends’ house\naround 6:30 or 7:00 p.m.,\nFrédéric Garneau left to purchase six cans of beer. Upon his return, he\nconsumed five beers between 7:00 and 10:00 p.m. before leaving, taking the wheel of his car to go to\nMontreal.[42]An analysis of a blood sample from the accused\nat 1:00 a.m. on July 25, 2005,\napproximately 2½ hours after the accident, revealed a blood-alcohol level of 81\nmg per 100 ml of blood.[43]The accused voluntarily and knowingly decided to\nconsume a large quantity of beer and then drive his car, ignoring the warnings\nof his father and friends and the absolute prohibition associated with the\nprobationary license that he had held for barely one month.[44]Likewise, the accused failed to pay attention to\nthe pleas of his passengers, Annie and X, who asked him to slow down as his car\nrapidly approached Mr. Coull’s minivan. The accused continued to be rash and\nreckless, trying to complete the passing manoeuvre by driving between the cars\ndriven by Dupuis and Coull. This also constitutes an aggravating circumstance\nin relation to the offence.[45]In light of the fundamental principle of\nproportionality, the Court is compelled to find that the offences committed by\nthe accused are very serious since they caused the death of two young girls\naged 16 and 18.[46]The degree of responsibility of the accused is\nvery high, given the aggravating circumstances noted above, namely:a)driving a motor vehicle after having\nconsumed a large number of alcoholic beverages, despite the prohibition\nassociated with his probationary licence;b)participating in street racing at a very\nhigh speed in a city and on a busy street;c)refusing to slow down\ndespite the pleas of his passengers and continuing a high-speed race that ended\nin a violent impact, causing the death of two passengers.[47]As an attenuating circumstance relating to the\nsituation of the accused, the Court accepts his very young age, which was 18\nyears and 1 month at the time of the offences. The age of the accused does not\naffect his degree of responsibility or the severity of the offence, but must be\nconsidered as an element favourable to his reintegration into society.[48]In addition, the accused has no prior criminal\nrecord and enjoys a stable family and occupational situation that are\nfavourable to his rehabilitation.[49]Finally, the accused pleaded guilty before the\npreliminary inquiry and acknowledged his responsibility for the offences\ncharged. The accused is aware of his responsibility for the harm caused to his\nvictims.[50]However, the Court notes that while the accused\nadmits his responsibility for the offences committed, he continues to deny\ntaking part in a street race and seeks to minimize his responsibility in this\nway.[51]In the present case, after having considered the\nseverity of the offences that caused the death of two young women and the\ndegree of responsibility of the accused, which is very high, the Court shall\nassign the greatest weight to the objectives of denunciation and general deterrence.[52]Society strongly condemns the attitude of\ndrivers of motor vehicles who knowingly and intentionally contravene the law,\nnot hesitating to take part in high-speed races on city streets and displaying\nno concern for the safety of their passengers, other users of the roads, or the\npeople walking on the sidewalks or standing near the street. The sentence must\ndenounce this behaviour and clearly express society’s condemnation.[53]It appears to be highly improbable that the\naccused Garneau will reoffend. The objective of general deterrence, however,\ntargets all drivers who might be tempted to drive their vehicle as dangerously\nas the accused did.[54]A document adduced in evidence by the\nprosecution from the Web site of the Société de l'assurance automobile du\nQuébec demonstrates that speeding, like drinking and driving, is one of the\nprimary causes of accidents in Quebec.[55]The document adds that young drivers between the\nages of 16 and 24 are overrepresented in highway accidents. In 2006, they were\ninvolved in 24% of accidents causing bodily harm, even though they represented\nonly 10% of those with driver’s licenses. They are also much more likely to be\ninvolved in accidents in which speeding is involved. In addition, given the\nsame blood alcohol level, young drivers present a much higher risk of fatal\naccidents.[7][56]The sentence should send a clear and unambiguous\nmessage to delinquent drivers, regardless of their age. Operating a road\nvehicle dangerously and without concern for the safety of others, particularly\nby taking part in street racing, will be suppressed and, where appropriate,\nharshly punished, notwithstanding the young age of the offender.[57]After having analyzed all of the aggravating and\nattenuating circumstances relating to the offences and the situation of the\naccused, and after having established the seriousness of the offences and their\ntragic consequences, along with the high level of responsibility of the\naccused, the Court is of the opinion that the sentence of three years of\nimprisonment suggested by the prosecution is a just and appropriate sentence,\nhaving regard to all the circumstances.[58]In addition, I would issue an order prohibiting\nthe accused from driving for a total of six years, starting today.THEREFORE,\nTHE COURT:a)ORDERS the accused FRÉDÉRIC GARNEAU to\nserve a concurrent sentence of imprisonment of three years in a penitentiary\nfor charges 1 and 2 of the information, to which he has pleaded guilty;b)MAKES an order under section 259(2) of the Criminal\nCode prohibiting the accused from operating a motor vehicle on a street,\nroad, highway, or other public place, or from operating a vessel or an aircraft\nor railway equipment during a period of not more than three years plus the\nperiod to which the accused is sentenced to imprisonment;c)ORDERS the accused to pay the victim fine\nsurcharge within six months.__________________________________GILLES CADIEUX J.C.Q.Mtre Isabelle GélinasCounsel for theprosecutionMtre Carole BeaucageCounsel for theaccusedSCHEDULECase law cited by the prosecution:Lépine v.

Mr. Rile was in custody at the time of the trial\nand the sentencing hearing.[2]Mr. Rile was standing in the bedroom of a hotel suite. The police seized\nabout 554 grams of methamphetamine from a plastic container found in a\nnightstand where Mr. Rile was standing and $2,000 from a safe in the bedroom. Mr.\nRile has been in custody since his arrest on June 18, 2015.[3]It can be reasonably inferred from the fact that the jury found Mr. Rile\nin possession of the drugs and money that they accepted that Mr. Rile had\nrented the suite; that the name “Bon Rile” on the rental receipt refers to\nJeffrey Bon Rile.MR. RILE’S\nLIFE[4]Mr. Rile’s mother, Mila Rile, testified on her son’s behalf at the\nsentencing hearing.[5]Mr. Rile is currently 32 years of age. His mother testified that as a\nyouth he was a talented basketball player who travelled to various cities\nplaying that sport.She stated that he began dating a girl when he was 16\nyears old and continued a long-term relationship with her for nine years. During\nthose years he went to school and worked after school. He was able to buy his\nfirst car with his earnings. When he finished high school he joined his father\nas a construction worker with his father’s employer. The mother testified he\nperformed very well on that job.[6]The mother testified that when he and his girlfriend broke up when he\nwas 25 years old, Mr. Rile’s life began to fall apart. He\nstopped coming home at night. From 2010 to 2015 he began to come home\nirregularly. He started not going to work\nregularly. She began to realize he was doing drugs when her husband showed her\ndrug paraphernalia he found in the house. She testified she has never\nconfronted her son about his addiction.[7]The mother testified that she has realized for the past five years that he\nis addicted to methamphetamine. She said she suspected because he no longer had\na job that he sold drugs to buy more drugs. She testified that she believed he\nstarted using and became addicted to methamphetamine in about 2001 and has been\nan addict for about 15 years. The mother was aware of the criminal conviction\nher son received for possession of methamphetamine in September 2011.[8]The mother is an operation room nurse’s assistant and is familiar with\ndrugs and drug issues. She stated that on one occasion she attempted to talk to\nher son about his addiction but he never wanted to discuss it. The mother\nindicated that she would support him and ensure that he goes to treatment if he\nshould receive a sentence that requires this of him. She stated that her son\nhas never sought treatment since his arrest because he has been in custody. The\nmother testified that when he is released from custody she would be stricter\nwith him and make him comply with court orders.PRINCIPLES\nON SENTENCING[9]Section 718 of the Criminal Code sets down the objectives for\nsentencing: denunciation, deterrence and the separation of the offender from\nsociety.[10]The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime\nprevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just,\npeaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of\nthe following objectives: (a) to denounce unlawful conduct; (b) to deter the\noffender and other potential future offenders from committing offences; and (c)\nto separate offenders from society.[11]Proportionality is also a guiding principle for sentencing. A sentence\nmust be proportionate to the gravity of the offence, determined on the\nparticular facts of the case. The narrow focus of the sentencing process is\ndirected to imposing a sentence that reflects the circumstances of the specific\noffence and the attributes of the specific offender: [Criminal Code, s.\n718.1 and R. v. Hamilton (2004), 2004 CanLII 5549 (ON CA), 186 C.C.C. (3d) 129, 72 O.R. (3d) 1\n(Ont. C.A.)].[12]The parity principle requires a sentence be similar to sentences\nimposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed under similar\ncircumstances. Sentencing is however an individualized process which\nnecessarily means that sentences imposed for similar offences may not be\nidentical: [R. v. Cox, 2011 ONCA 58 (CanLII), 2011 ONCA 58 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. L.M, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, 2008 SCC 31 (S.C.C.) (CanLII)].[13]Section 718.2 addresses the totality principle and provides that\nwhere consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be\nunduly long or harsh.The principle applies with a sentence for multiple offences\nand requires the court to craft a global sentence of all offences that is not overly\nexcessive.AGGRAVATING AND MITIGATING\nFACTORS[14]Section 718.2(a) provides that “a sentence\nshould be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating\ncircumstances relating to the offence or the offender”.[15]Courts have made distinctions between levels of gravity of drug\noffences. Trafficking in drugs for a commercial purpose has attracted greater\ncondemnation. This type of activity has been viewed as an aggravating factor on\nsentencing.[16]Lower end trafficking, for instance, to support an\naddiction attracts less punitive measures on the view that the cause the commission of the offence is to support a drug addiction\nwhich is regarded as a type of disease: [R v Bui, 2004 CanLII 7201 (ON CA), 2004 CanLII 7201, at para. 2, (ON CA) and\nR v. Woolcock, [2002] O.J. No. 4927, at para. 5, (Ont.\nC.A.)].[17]Aggravating factors on sentencing must be proven beyond a\nreasonable doubt: [Criminal Code, s. 724 and R. v. Larche, 2006 SCC 56 (CanLII), [2006] 2 S.C.R.\n762, at paras. 43 - 44, (S.C.C.)].[18]The aggravating factors in this case are:•the substantial quantity of drugs seized;•the fact that methamphetamine is a Schedule I drug;•the evidence of the expert who testified at trial that possession\nof 554 kilograms of methamphetamine points to Mr. Rile being a mid-level dealer\nmeaning a commercial enterprise was involved;•the expert’s evidence that it is not uncommon for a mid-level\ndealer to also be a user and an addict;•the expert opinion that the drug appeared to be high quality by its\nshard-like consistency;•Mr. Rile’s minor criminal record for one methamphetamine\npossession offence, with a fine of $500;•he is unemployed and has been for several years;•there is no evidence that Mr. Rile, or his family, have at any\ntime sought assistance inthe community for rehabilitation and treatment for\nhis addiction.[19]While absence of a guilty plea is not to be considered an aggravating\nfactor, Mr. Rile does not have the benefit of a guilty plea as a mitigating\nfactor.[20]The mitigating factors are few:•Mr. Rile has family support;•he is 32 years of age and has been addicted to methamphetamine\nfor 15 years, almost half of his life;•he lost his employment due to addiction.THE\nPARTIES’ POSITIONS[21]The Crown seeks a penitentiary sentence of five years. Mr. Rile has been\nin custody since June 18, 2015. The Crown accepts that Mr. Rile should get\ncredit of 1.5 months to 1 month for pre-trial\ncustody which amounts to 831 days.[22]The Crown also seeks a mandatory Criminal\nCode s. 109 firearm prohibition\nfor ten years and the registration of a DNA sample. The Crown also seeks\nforfeiture of the $2,000 seized.[23]The defence seeks a lower sentence in view of\nMr. Rile’s minor criminal record, the fact he could not\nseek rehabilitation since he has been in custody. Defence counsel\nemphasized Mr. Rile’s drug addiction, his family support, the fact his mother\nhas undertaken to ensure he attends any treatment recommended and the fact Mr.\nRile lost his employment due to his addiction.CASE\nAUTHORITIES•R. v.

Although the fact he has an\nuncontrolled addiction to the drug is a mitigating factor, this is overwhelmed\nby the commercial nature of his crime. Having this type of drug in one’s\npossession for the purpose of propagating it to others deserves strong censure.\nThe further fact that over the 15 years of his addiction he has not sought\ntreatment cannot be overlooked.[25]After considering the authorities, I sentence Mr. Rile as follows:[26]I sentence him to 30 months (911 days) imprisonment\nin a federal penitentiary. Mr. Rile shall get 1.5 months to 1 month credit for pre-trial\ncustody.He has served 18 months and four days (554 days) of pre-trial custody\ncalculated from the date of his arrest on June 18, 2015 to the date of\nsentencing on December 22, 2016.[27]Mr. Rile shall therefore receive 27 months and twenty-one days’ (831\ndays) credit for pre-trial custody.He shall therefore serve two months and twenty\ndays (80 days) in the penitentiary and serve six months concurrent for possession\nof proceeds of crime. I also impose a period of probation of two years after\nrelease.[28]I find the sentence imposed to be a fit sentence that amply serves the\nobjectives of denunciation and deterrence.SENTENCE[29]I will now pronounce sentence. Jeffrey Bon Rile, will you please stand?[30]You have been convicted for possession of methamphetamine for the\npurpose of trafficking. You stand to be sentenced for that offence.[31]I sentence you to 30 months imprisonment in a federal penitentiary for possession\nof methamphetamine for the purpose of trafficking with credit for 27 months and\ntwenty-one days for pre-trial custody.[32]Therefore, your total time in prison will be two\nmonths and twenty days for possession of\nmethamphetamine for the purpose of trafficking.[33]You have also been convicted of possession of proceeds of crime. You\nstand to be sentenced for that offence.[34]I sentence you to six months for possession of proceeds of crime to run\nconcurrently with the sentence for possession of methamphetamine for the\npurpose of trafficking.[35]Therefore, your total sentence in prison shall be two months and twenty\ndays for both counts.[36]I also sentence you to a probationary period of two\nyears following release on the following conditions:(a)You will keep the peace and be of good behaviour.(b)You will appear before the court when required to do so by the court.(c)You will notify the court or the probation officer in advance of any\nchange of name or address, and promptly notify the court or the probation\nofficer of any change of employment or occupation.(d)You will report to a probation officer when and in the manner directed\nby the probation officer.(e)You will attend for and actively participate in, and to the satisfaction\nof your probation officer, any assessment, treatment or counselling as required\nby your probation officer, including for drug treatment, and you will sign\nwhatever consents or releases as may be required by your probation officer in\norder to monitor and verify compliance with said assessment, treatment or\ncounselling and you will provide written proof of completion of said\nassessment, treatment or counselling to your probation officer.(f)You will not own, possess or carry any weapons as defined by the Criminal Code.[37]I make the following ancillary orders:(a)There will be an order made under s. 109 of the Criminal Code\nwhich will prohibit you for ten years, commencing after release from custody,\nfrom owning, possessing or carrying any firearm, crossbow, prohibited weapon,\nrestricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition or\nexplosive substance.(b)There will be an order authorizing the taking of such bodily substances\nas are necessary for the purposes of a forensic DNA analysis.[38]There will be an order of forfeiture for the $2,000 seized.[39]You shall have one (1) year to pay the victim surcharge pursuant to s.\n737 of the Criminal Code.B.A. ALLEN J.Released: December 22, 2016CITATION:\nR. v.

Soldier)for the accused))JUDGMENT DELIVERED)ORALLY:September 5,2012Reasons for SentenceGREENBERG J.[1]Mr. Pearce was convicted by a jury of manslaughter in the death\nof Stuart Mark.These are my reasons with respect to sentence.The Crown\nseeks a term of incarceration of 12 years, less time spent by Mr. Pearce in\ncustody before he was released on judicial interim release.The defence agrees\nthat a term of incarceration is warranted but argues that a period of four to\nfive years is appropriate.The defence further argues that Mr. Pearce should\nbe given credit against that time not only for the period of time that he spent\nin custody but for the period on which he was on judicial interim release\nbecause of the stringency of the conditions imposed.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCE[2]Because Mr. Pearce was convicted by a jury, s. 724(2) of the Code\nrequires me to accept as proven those facts, express or implied, that are\nessential to the jury’s verdict and to make findings with respect to other\nfacts disclosed by the evidence.It was not disputed by the defence that Mr.\nMark was beaten to death.The contentious issue was who was responsible.[3]Mr. Mark was found dead in his home on January 17, 2007.He died\nas a result of multiple injuries.The pathologist who performed the autopsy\ntestified that Mr. Mark had at least 58 contusions, lacerations and abrasions\nincluding multiple fractures to the back of the skull and a stab wound to his\nleft flank that went through his liver and lung.The walls of both the front\nroom and living room of the house were covered in blood stains suggesting that\nthe beating started in the front room and ended in the living room where the\nbody was found.It is clear from the nature and extent of the injuries that\nthe attack that killed Mr. Mark was brutal and prolonged.[4]In July 2007, six months after Mr. Mark was killed, Mr. Pearce\ncontacted the police and met with them on three occasions.On the last\noccasion, he made a statement admitting responsibility for the crime.However,\nat trial, Mr. Pearce testified that he did not kill Stuart Mark.His evidence\nwas that he remembered arguing with Stuart the last time they were together,\nafter Mr. Mark told him that he had AIDS, but he did not remember killing him.It is clear from the fact that the jury found Mr. Pearce guilty that they\nrejected his denial of the crime and accepted the truth of his confession to\nthe police, that is to say, that he killed Mr. Mark.As Mr. Pearce\ncontinues to deny any recollection of the offence, the only explanation for the\noffence is in his police statement.In that statement, he told police that he\ntemporarily lost control and began to swing a golf club at Mr. Mark after\nMr. Mark told him that he had AIDS.[5]Mr. Pearce had had an intimate relationship with Stuart Mark for\nseveral months.He was worried that Mr. Mark may have transmitted the disease\nto him and he was angry that Mr. Mark did not seem to understand why he was\nangry.While Mr. Pearce was originally charged with murder, after the\npreliminary inquiry the Crown agreed that he should be committed to stand trial\non the lesser charge of manslaughter because they were satisfied that Mr.\nPearce had committed the offence as a result of provocation.PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ACCUSED[6]Mr. Pearce is 44 years old.The offence occurred when he was\n39.He is single with no dependants.He met Stuart Mark in a club and, as I\nsaid, had an intimate relationship with him.[7]Mr. Pearce was raised in a religious household.His family moved\nto Texas when he was young and he went to a private Christian academy there.As an adult, he went on tour with his family who performed as an evangelical\nmusical group.[8]When he spoke to the police in July 2007, Mr. Pearce expressed\nconcern about his family and friends finding out about his sexual orientation.He was greatly distressed by the fear of coming out.[9]Mr. Pearce has no prior criminal record.His background stands\nin marked contrast to many of the individuals who appear in the criminal courts\nof Manitoba.He has a grade 12 education and for most of his adult life has\nbeen gainfully employed.He was raised in a close knit and loving family who\ncontinue to be supportive of him.He has no history of alcohol or substance\nabuse.He is described as an artistic individual.He plays the drums and has\ntaught others to play the instrument.He is also a visual artist whose work\nhas been commissioned.[10]The defence filed numerous letters of reference from family,\nfriends, employers, pastors and congregants from Mr. Pearce’s church.All\ndescribed him as a gentle person who is eager to help others and all attest to\nthe fact that this offence is completely out of character for him.It appears\nthat Mr. Mark’s disclosure to him sent Mr. Pearce into an uncontrollable\nand uncharacteristic rage.The opinion expressed in the psychological\nassessment filed by the defence was that the offence was “anomalous”\nconsidering Mr. Pearce’s history and that he is a low risk to re-offend.PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[11]The overarching guiding principle in sentencing is that a\nsentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender.In arriving at an appropriate sentence, s. 718\nof the Code instructs me to consider one or more of the following\nobjectives:1.to denounce the conduct;2.to deter the offender and others;3.to separate the offender from society where necessary;4.to assist in rehabilitating the offender;5.to provide reparations for harm done to victims or the\ncommunity; and6.to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders and\nacknowledgment of the harm done.[12]Not all of these considerations will apply in every case.Because of the circumstances of the offence in the case at bar, that is to say,\nthat Mr. Pearce’s actions were provoked, spontaneous and out of character for\nhim, and in view of the psychological assessment, I do not believe specific\ndeterrence is a concern in this case.Nor is this the type of offence where\none would expect that general deterrence would have an impact.As for\nrehabilitation, because Mr. Pearce continues to deny responsibility for the\noffence, it is difficult to assess his rehabilitation or to consider the\nsentence as a means of promoting a sense of responsibility in him.As a\nresult, the paramount considerations in sentencing in this case are\ndenunciation and retribution.[13]In R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, the Supreme\nCourt confirmed the importance of both retribution and denunciation as\nprinciples of sentencing.Retribution is intended to reflect the moral\nblameworthiness of the offender while denunciation expresses society’s condemnation\nof his conduct.[14]The offence of manslaughter encompasses a broad range of conduct\nand a wide variety of circumstances and, as a result, the case law reflects a\nbroad range of sentences, from a suspended sentence to life imprisonment.As\nthe Supreme Court explained in R. v. Creighton, 1993 CanLII 61 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R.\n3, the flexibility in sentencing for manslaughter allows the court to impose a\nsentence that reflects the level of moral blameworthiness of the offender which\nmay range from little more than inadvertence to circumstances close to murder.[15]The Supreme Court also made it clear in R. v. Stone,\n1999 CanLII 688 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290, that provocation must be considered in assessing the\ndegree of moral blameworthiness.In the case at bar, the Crown has\nacknowledged the existence of provocation by requesting a committal for trial\non a charge of manslaughter only.Nevertheless, the Crown argues that the\nnature of the beating here, that it was a prolonged and vicious beating, makes\nthe offence one closer to the murder end of the manslaughter spectrum than to\ninadvertence and, therefore, one that requires significant condemnation.[16]Because the circumstances of the offence and the offender vary so\nmuch from case to case, other sentencing decisions do not create binding\nprecedents.Nevertheless, a review of cases with similar circumstances\nprovides assistance in gauging an appropriate range of sentences and, in my\nview, supports the submission of the defence in this case that the 12 year\nsentence proposed by the Crown falls well outside the appropriate range for the\ncircumstances here.[17]I start with the Supreme Court decision in R. v. Stone,\nas that is the case which clarifies the relevance of provocation in\nsentencing.In that case, the accused had been charged with murder in the death\nof his wife, but was convicted of manslaughter.He had stabbed his wife 47\ntimes.The accused claimed that his mind snapped, in fact, he claimed to have\nlost consciousness, as a result of his wife’s aggressive verbal attacks.The\ncourt upheld the sentence of seven years imposed by the trial judge.[18]In R. v. Clarke, 2003 CanLII 28199 (ON CA), 2003 CanLII 28199\n(Ont. C.A.), the accused stabbed the victim seven times after flying into a\nrange as a result of what the court described as “slight” provocation.He then\nwaited at least 20 minutes before making an anonymous 911 call for help for the\nvictim who had not immediately died from the stab wounds.The court reduced\nthe 14 year sentence imposed by the trial judge to one of nine years.[19]In R. v. M.(L.S.), (1994), 1994 CanLII 4015 (NS CA), 132\nN.S.R. (2d) 118 (C.A.), the accused pleaded guilty to manslaughter.He had\nbeaten the victim to death after the victim had raped him.The accused\noriginally left the scene, but called police the next day and told them what\nhad happened.Although the beating was described by the court as “merciless\nand protracted”, the court found there had been provocation in that the accused\nhad reacted to the extreme violation of his bodily integrity and that the\nseverity of the beating was a result of the period of time when the accused was\nout of control.The accused had cooperated with police and was remorseful.The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of five years.[20]In R. v. Chan, 2006 ONCJ 436 (CanLII), the\naccused pleaded guilty to killing his wife of 35 years.He had become angry\nwhen his wife was preparing herbal medicines as he did not like the smell.A\nverbal argument led to them wrestling in bed, in the course of which the wife’s\nhead got stuck between the bed and the wall.The accused left her there and\nshe suffocated.The accused attempted to cover up the event and did not admit\nthe offence until several months later.The court found the accused had been a\ndecent hard-working man and that the incident was uncharacteristic.The court\nalso found the degree of violence to be at the lower end of the scale and\nimposed a sentence of three years in addition to 14 months of pre-trial\ncustody.[21]In R. v. An, 2011 ABQB 217 (CanLII), the\naccused pleaded guilty to manslaughter.He killed his wife after finding out\nshe was having an affair.The accused had hit his wife repeatedly over a\nperiod of several hours and then pushed her forcefully, causing her to fall\nback and hit her head, and as a result she died.The accused’s two daughters\nwere in the house during the prolonged attack.The accused was described as an\naccomplished scientist with an exemplary character.The court sentenced him to\nfive years.[22]The above cases suggest a range of four to nine\nyears for manslaughter where provocation is involved and the accused is of\npreviously good character.[23]The following decisions of the Manitoba Court of\nAppeal, although not involving provocation, are also instructive.[24]In R. v. Sewap, 2000 MBCA 58 (CanLII),\n(2000), 148 Man.R. (2d) 132, the accused pleaded guilty to manslaughter after\nbeing involved in a vicious beating.She had been extremely intoxicated at the\ntime.Although the accused was only 20 years of age, she had a fairly\nsignificant criminal record.The court imposed a sentence of seven years.[25]In R. v. Hagen, 2003 MBCA 107 (CanLII),\n(2003), 177 Man.R. (2d) 209, the accused pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the\ndeath of her stepfather.She had gone to his home in the middle of the night\nand stabbed him during an altercation.She was extremely intoxicated at the\ntime and had no recollection of the events.Although the accused claimed that\nshe had been subject to verbal abuse by the victim over a period of time, she\ndid not rely on provocation.The court held that a sentence of three years was\nappropriate.[26]In R. v. Sinclair, 2009 MBCA 71 (CanLII),\n(2009), 240 Man.R. (2d) 135; reversed on other grounds 2011 SCC 40 (CanLII), [2011] 3\nS.C.R. 3, the accused and two others beat the victim and left him lying in the\nmiddle of the road where he was subsequently run over by a car.The trial\njudge found the fact that this was a random attack on a stranger, that it was a\nthree-on-one attack with a high level of violence, and that the accused were\nattempting to rob the victim, were aggravating factors.The accused was young\nwith no record and had expressed remorse for his actions.The Court of Appeal\nupheld the sentence of six years imposed by the trial judge.[27]In R. v. Abraham, 2011 MBQB 299 (CanLII),\n(2011), 272 Man.R. (2d) 216, the court sentenced the accused to five years for\nbeating the victim to death.The victim had apparently run towards the accused\nin a threatening manner in response to which the accused slammed him to the\nroad, punched and kicked him, and then left him to die.The court took into\naccount the fact that the accused had expressed remorse and entered a plea of guilty.[28]The Crown points out that pleas of guilty and\nexpressions of remorse, both of which are not present in the case at bar, are\nmitigating factors which distinguish a number of the cases to which I have\nreferred.On the other hand, these cases also illustrate that sentences well\nbelow the 12 years suggested by the Crown in this case are imposed where the\noffence involves a brutal beating, even where the accused has a criminal\nrecord.APPROPRIATE\nSENTENCE IN THIS CASE[29]I agree with the Crown that, in considering an\nappropriate sentence in this case, the brutality of the crime is a factor.In\nfact, considering the descriptions of Mr. Pearce by his friends and\nfamily, and the report of the psychologist, it is difficult to believe that he\ncould have committed an act of such violence.But Mr. Mark’s disclosure\nof the fact that he had AIDS, and the manner in which he responded to Mr.\nPearce’s concern about it, was obviously a tremendous shock to\nMr. Pearce.Mr. Pearce told the police that he remembers arguing with\nMr. Mark over the issue and that Mr. Mark was dismissive of his concern.While Mr. Pearce has not contracted the disease, I imagine that he\nenvisioned the possibility of facing a death sentence.[30]While the provocation in this case in no way\nexcuses the conduct, it helps to explain it.As I have said, this incident is\ndescribed as completely out of character for Mr. Pearce.In his statement to\nthe police, Mr. Pearce said that while he remembered arguing with Mr. Mark and\nremembers swinging something at him, he cannot remember the details.He said\nthat he could not remember ever being that angry.What he describes appears\nlike the circumstances in the Stone, supra, case where the\naccused said that he snapped and temporarily lost consciousness, realizing when\nhe came out of it that he had killed his wife.And as in M(L.S.),\nsupra, it appears that the severity of the beating in this case was a\nresult of the length of time that it took Mr. Pearce to snap out of his stupor.[31]In his statement to police, Mr. Pearce said that\nhe could not accept what he had done.He waited six months to tell the police\nthat he might have information about the crime.His response to passing a\npolygraph test which cleared him of any involvement in the offence was to\nattempt to commit suicide.It seems that it was guilt and remorse that\ncompelled him to confess.He went to police on July 15, 2007, assuming that he\nwould be going to jail and had arranged his affairs on that assumption.While\nhe claimed not to remember the details of the crime, he said that he felt\nbetter after admitting to it and was following through on the reason that he\ncame forward – to do the right thing and to help Mr. Mark’s family.[32]As I said, the jury obviously believed that Mr.\nPearce killed Mr. Mark.And because at trial he denied the offence in his\nevidence, the only explanation of it is in his statement and actions.I infer\nfrom that statement that he acted in reaction to the shock of hearing that his\nlife might have been put in danger and that that revelation produced such a\nrage in him that he cannot remember the details of what happened and still has\ndifficulty coming to terms with what he did.It may be that the assault was so\nout of character for Mr. Pearce that it took him a long time to appreciate what\nhe had done.I believe on the basis of his history and the report of Dr.\nSomers, filed by the defence, that the chance that he will re-offend is small.[33]However, that is not to say that his actions\nshould go unpunished. Stuart Mark’s mother and sister described to the\ncourt the impact the loss of their son and brother has had upon them.In spite\nof that loss they generously acknowledged that they are not the only family\naffected by this horrible event.I know that the Mark family must understand\nthat while the sentence I impose may bring closure to them, it is unlikely to\nprovide any solace.[34]Considering the sentences imposed for similar\noffences and similar offenders, some of which have been referred to above, in\nmy view, an appropriate sentence in this case is a period of incarceration of\nseven years.TIME IN\nCUSTODY[35]The Crown and defence agree that Mr. Pearce is\nentitled to credit for the time that he spent in custody before being released\non bail.The Crown indicates that he spent a total of 280 days in custody and\nconcedes that he is entitled to credit on a two-for-one basis.That is to say,\nhe is entitled to credit of approximately 18 months.The defence argues that\nin addition to the time in actual custody, Mr. Pearce should receive credit for\nthe time he spent on judicial interim release because of the strict bail\nconditions that were imposed.The defence relies on the decision in R.\nv. Fobister, 2009 O.J. No. 2576 (QL) (Sup.Ct.J.), where the court\ngranted credit on a one-for-one basis for a pre-sentence period of two years\nduring which time the accused was on release in an alcohol treatment program.[36]However, in R. v. Irvine, 2008\nMBCA 34 (CanLII), (2008), 225 Man.R. (2d) 281, [2008] M.J. No. 79 (QL), the Manitoba\nCourt of Appeal held that while time spent on stringent pre-sentence bail\nconditions may be a mitigating factor in sentence, it is not credited in the\nsame manner as pre-trial custody.Scott C.J.M. explained:27The impact of the bail conditions on an accused\nperson are to be \"put into the mix\" along with other potential\nmitigating factors such as the relative youth of the accused, the lack of a\nrecord, prospects for rehabilitation, remorse, family responsibilities and the\nlike. Unlike the \"credit\" to be given - after the fit and appropriate\nsentence has been determined - for time spent in pre-trial custody, any\nconsideration to be given for pre-trial bail occurs at the same time as the\nsentencing judge considers all of the other mitigating and aggravating factors.\nTime spent on pre-trial bail, in contrast to pre-trial custody, does not form\npart of the punishment itself; rather, it forms part of the initial analysis to\narrive at the fit and appropriate sentence. There is no potential\n\"credit\" to be given in calculating the sentence, as there is under\nsec. 719(3) of the Code for pre-trial custody. It is simply a potential\nmitigating factor.[37]Scott C.J.M. also explained that in order to be\nconsidered as a mitigating factor, the accused would have to show that the\nnature of the bail conditions were such that it occasioned substantial hardship\nto him.In Fobister, the accused had spent his time on bail in a\ntreatment program which the court described as “a structured, institutional\nenvironment, subject to internal rules, supervision, and a security system” (at\npar. 73).He was separated from his community and family.His wife was only\nable to see him once a week.His liberty was seriously affected.[38]In the case at bar, it has been a condition of\nMr. Pearce’s judicial interim release for the past four years that he live with\nhis parents in Moosomin, Saskatchewan.Although he was subject to a curfew, he\nwas allowed to leave his home to work, which he has done for most if not all of\nthe past four years, and at other times as long as he was in the company of one\nof his parents.While the fact that he had to be accompanied by a parent\ncreated some restrictions, it could hardly be called onerous.He has been with\nhis family, he has been able to work and he has been able to attend church.I\nam not satisfied that the bail conditions were such that they imposed undue\nhardship on him.CONCLUSION[39]As a result of the fact that I am allowing Mr.\nPearce credit for 18 months of pre-trial custody, he will be sentenced to a\nfurther term of incarceration of five years and six months.[40]As this is a primary designated offence under s.\n487.04 of the Criminal Code, Mr. Pearce will be required to\nsubmit a bodily sample for DNA analysis.[41]There will be a mandatory weapons prohibition\nunder s. 109 of the Criminal Code.[42]As Mr. Pearce will be incarcerated for a lengthy\nperiod of time, there will be no victim fine surcharge.J."}

She knew Mr. Leduc lived in a directly\nadjoining apartment to hers but she only knew him to see him and did not know\nhis name.[8]On the morning of November 1, 2012 she was alone\nin her apartment, sleeping.She awoke to hear her bedroom door open and heavy\nbreathing.She looked and saw her neighbor Mr. Leduc enter the bedroom.She\nasked him how he got there.[9]He closed the door and drew a knife.She tried\nto run for the door but he was in her way and said, “I’ll cut you with this”.He told her to take off her clothes or he would cut her. Again, she tried to\nleave but he blocked her.Fearing for her life, she removed her clothing.[10]He then unbuttoned and pulled down his pants and\nunderwear and told her to get on her knees.At first when she didn’t comply he\nsaid, “I’ll cut you, I’ll cut you”.He forced her to perform fellatio on him\nwhile he held the knife to her throat and told her “if you bite, I’ll cut\nyou”.[11]While being forced to perform fellatio Ms.\nDenobriga grabbed the knife Mr. Leduc was holding.As they struggled for it he\ncut both of her hands. She bled heavily from the cuts to her hands and let go\nof the knife.Mr. Leduc maintained control of it, grabbed her by the hair,\nheld the knife to her throat and said, “You’re going to co-operate or I’ll cut\nyou again”.He told her to lie down on her bed.[12]He then lay on top of her.He tried to put his\npenis inside her vagina but was unable to do so as he was having trouble\nmaintaining an erection.He then put his knife down on the bed beside her head\nand Ms. Denobriga grabbed it once more.[13]A second struggle ensued.They both fell off\nthe bed onto the floor but Mr. Leduc got behind Ms. Denobriga and placed her in\na chokehold with his arm around the front of her neck.He tightened his\nchokehold.As Ms. Denobriga began having difficulty breathing she struggled to\nfree herself and stabbed Mr. Leduc in the thigh, groin and back.She tried to\nscream for her roommates but Mr. Leduc tightened his chokehold.[14]Ms. Denobriga had greater difficulty breathing.She began to feel dizzy and light headed. She decided to stop fighting and play\ndead. When she did, Mr. Leduc released the pressure of his chokehold but kept\nhis arm around her neck.With that release of pressure Ms. Denobriga again\nfought to free herself.She struck Mr. Leduc in the head with the knife and\nthe struggle continued until she managed to break free of his chokehold, stand\nup and flee the bedroom.Mr. Leduc fell down or off her as she stood up.Both\nwere bleeding profusely.[15]Ms. Denobriga escaped.She frantically sought\nhelp from a neighbor.After the police arrived they found trails of blood\nleading them to Mr. Leduc hiding in one of the bedrooms of his own apartment.He also had wounds to his head.He told arresting officers he had used crack\ncocaine within the last day and claimed to also have had vodka and beer.He\nhad been on probation since October 17, 2011.[16]Ms. Denobriga suffered cuts to her fingers,\nabrasions to her face and neck and petechiae or small hemorrhages, to her face,\neyes, mouth, neck and upper chest.Mr. Leduc has agreed these were caused by\nhis chokehold on her that blocked her airway and that his choking was dangerous\nand potentially fatal.He acknowledges petechiae are a classic symptom of\nstrangulation and that his choking endangered her life.The Victim[17]Ms. Denobriga is a remarkable, and fortunate,\nperson to have been able to survive this attack.[18]She read her Victim Impact Statement to the\nCourt.As the facts reveal so terrifyingly, she awoke that day to find herself\nin a very real nightmare.She said everything felt so surreal, like she was\nthe victim in a scary movie.She said she thought that she was going to die\nright there in her bedroom, naked and covered in blood.She recalled her many\nbruises, mostly to her upper body, with black marks all around her throat, red\neyes, red spots all over her face and purple ear lobes from the strangulation.She said she almost became unconscious at one point and when taken to the\nambulance, she was dizzy and disoriented.[19]She has been afraid to be alone ever since.The\nattack has strongly impacted her sense of security, her sleeping patterns and\nher relationship with her boyfriend.It has also affected her mother’s health\nand that of her sister.The scars on her hands are a constant reminder of the\nterror she went through. Her recovery period from the trauma, both physical and\nemotional, has cost her financially.She is grateful for the immense amount of\nsupport from family, friends, neighbours and the community.She looks forward\nto a career as a police officer, something she has wanted her entire life and\nthat she feels is even more meaningful to her now as a victim of these crimes.[20]The Crown has commented on the tremendous\nbravery and determination exhibited by Ms. Denobriga and that she was\ninstrumental in bringing Mr. Leduc to justice in respect of the 2008 and 2011\nmurders for which he has now been convicted.Each of those deceased women’s\nbodies had been found naked from the waist down with evidence of their having\nbeen sexually assaulted, brutally beaten and strangled to death.DNA evidence\nwas collected from each of the deceased women in 2008 and again in 2011,\nindicating the same male profile.There was no match to a known person,\nhowever, until after the attack on Ms. Denobriga in 2012.When the DNA profile\nfrom Mr. Leduc’s blood samples collected from Ms. Denobriga’s apartment were\ncompared with the DNA samples collected and analyzed from the 2008 and 2011\ndeceased victim’s bodies, Mr. Leduc was identified as the match to the DNA from\neach of the murders.[21]With this chilling connection, the courage and\ndetermination exhibited by Ms. Denobriga in participating in the murder trial\nis underscored.Her journey away from that real life nightmare has been long\nand difficult.The Accused[22]Mr. Leduc was 56 years of age at the time of his\nattack on Ms. Denobriga.He is now 60.He has been hearing impaired since a\nteenager.He is separated from his wife.He has two daughters.He used to\nwork in the construction industry and at one time he was a maintenance worker for\nthe apartment building where his attack on Ms. Denobriga took place.He has\nhad problems with alcohol and drugs with the result that he has worked less and\nbegan receiving provincial disability support payments.[23]Mr. Leduc has a long criminal record dating back\nto 1973.It reveals 40 years of offending including eight previous break and\nenters, a robbery, an assault, criminal harassment, petty property offences,\nimpaired driving offences and breaching Court orders.There is a gap in his\nrecord between 1987 and 2005.[24]The only indication from Mr. Leduc of an\nexplanation for his actions is his statement to his arresting officer when\nasked why this happened.He said it was all a blur and “I was smoking too much\ncrack I guess” and “I can control it if I stop drinking and doing drugs.I’m\nfinished with all that stuff.”[25]Aside from Mr. Leduc’s guilty pleas, there is no\nindication from him of any remorse.While this is not an aggravating factor,\nit is part of Mr. Leduc’s decision to reveal almost nothing about himself to\nthe Court.Other than what has been stated above and as can be gleaned from\nhis criminal record, the facts of the two murders and the present offences,\nthere is an absence of information about Mr. Leduc to allow for a fuller\nassessment of his risk to reoffend and, critically, of the risk he poses to the\npublic.AnalysisSentencing\nObjectives[26]It is incontrovertible that in all of these\ncircumstances the primary objectives of sentencing are protection of society,\nseparation of Mr. Leduc from it, denunciation and deterrence both general and\nspecific.The other sentencing objectives of rehabilitation and promotion of a\nsense of responsibility in Mr. Leduc retreat into their shadow and, to use the\nCrown’s phrase, become vanishingly small in importance.[27]The only sentencing issue is the appropriate\nlength of incarceration so as to serve these primary and secondary sentencing\nobjectives, taking into consideration the aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances as well as the sentencing principles of proportionality, parity\nwith sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in\nsimilar circumstances, and restraint.[28]A more unique aspect to this sentencing is the\ninfluence that Mr. Leduc’s two first-degree murder convictions exert over the\noffences committed against Ms. Denobriga.The circumstances between those two\nearlier murders and his later attack on Ms. Denobriga are very similar, except,\nof course, Ms. Denobriga managed to survive.[29]The consequence is that Mr. Leduc’s murder\nconvictions operate to cast a darker, even more dangerous and sinister shadow\nover the facts of the present offences because when considered in light of his\nprior actions, Mr. Leduc’s actions can be viewed as amounting to a prelude to\nher later murder.The Crown’s submissions reflect this aggravating\ncircumstance. The Crown argues that Mr. Leduc would have had to kill Ms.\nDenobriga after he had finished with her because she knew him.[30]Mr. Leduc, however, was not charged with attempt\nmurder.As his counsel has submitted, he is not to be sentenced, in effect,\nfor this more serious offence for which he has not pled guilty.[31]His counsel has also submitted that because his\nmurder convictions are under appeal, to sentence him for his present offences\nas if they had been a prelude to murder would be inappropriate, and\nparticularly so if his convictions are overturned.His counsel asks,\ntherefore, that the murder convictions be accorded little weight as an\naggravating circumstance.Aggravating\nand Mitigating Circumstances[32]The only mitigating circumstances are Mr.\nLeduc’s pleas of guilt and saving Ms. Denobriga from having to testify at a\npreliminary inquiry and at trial.[33]The aggravating circumstances are numerous.They primarily arise from the facts of the 2012 offences as recounted above,\nfrom Mr. Leduc’s prior criminal record and from the little that is known about\nMr. Leduc.They are the following:(1)Mr. Leduc commenced his attack with a home\ninvasion, breaking into Ms. Denobriga’s apartment in the morning as she was\nsleeping;(2)Mr. Leduc’s actions were clearly premeditated as\nopposed to being impulsive acts.He had seen Ms. Denobriga’s roommates leave\nshortly before he somehow gained entry into her apartment;(3)Mr. Leduc armed himself with a knife and\nthreatened to use it against Ms. Denobriga to force her compliance with his\ndemands;(4)Mr. Leduc engaged in prolonged, terrorizing,\nviolent and degrading sexual assaults against Ms. Denobriga;(5)After Mr. Leduc’s knife cut Ms. Denobriga’s\nhands and she was bleeding profusely, he threatened to cut her again if she\ndidn’t lie down on the bed and then he continued his sexual assault against her;(6)Mr. Leduc endangered Ms. Denobriga’s life when\nhe deliberately administered a chokehold to subdue her in their struggle and\nthen tightened his chokehold as the struggle continued, causing her to have\ngreat difficulty breathing and to suffer petechiae.This intentional choking\nwith life-threatening consequences, when considered in this violent context,\noperates to increase the gravity of Mr. Leduc’s crimes;(7)Ms. Denobriga suffered serious physical injuries\nparticularly to her hands and the emotional trauma she suffered was severe;(8)Mr. Leduc’s actions have had a lasting impact on\nMs. Denobriga and her family;(9)Mr. Leduc has a long criminal record and was on\nprobation at the time of the offences; and(10)The crimes remain unexplained and there is no\nevidence of Mr. Leduc’s psychiatric status.This operates as an aggravating\ncircumstance because Mr. Leduc has engaged in extreme violence against Ms.\nDenobriga and I can only infer from the evidence before me namely, the facts of\nthe offences and Mr. Leduc’s prior criminal record including his ignoring his\nprobation order, that he continues to be a danger to the public.There is no\ninformation before me that Mr. Leduc might not repeat this kind of violence.[34]In R. v. Klair, 2004 CanLII 8965 (ON CA), [2004] O.J. No\n2320 (ONCA), at para. 32, Sharpe J.A. commented on the lack of psychiatric\nevidence in that case where a sentence of life imprisonment had been imposed\nand stated,…psychiatric evidence is not always\nrequired to sustain a sentence of life imprisonment in cases of this type.In\nsome cases, the offence is so bizarre and shocking that it is quite appropriate\nto infer from the circumstances of the offence itself that the appellant poses\nan ongoing danger to the public.[35]I recognize the role played by Mr. Leduc’s murder\nconvictions in assessing not only the seriousness of his attack against Ms. Denobriga\nbut also his future dangerousness.It would be artificial, however, to leave\nthem out of the assessment of dangerousness just because they are under\nappeal.His murder convictions now form part of the circumstances of his 2012\noffences and must be considered and given weight, notwithstanding that they are\nunder appeal.[36]While the aggravating circumstances referred to\nbefore exist independently of a consideration of the murder convictions, when\nthe facts behind those convictions are factored into those aggravating\ncircumstances for the 2012 offences, Mr. Leduc’s actions have to be regarded as\nbeing more dangerous, more life-threatening and advancing along the gravity of\nthe offence spectrum towards constituting a near attempt murder.[37]I conclude that Mr. Leduc is an ongoing danger\nto society and society needs to be protected from him by his incarceration.If\nrehabilitation can occur, it will have to take place in an institution.[38]Notwithstanding this conclusion, the sentencing\nprinciples of parity and restraint need consideration to decide the appropriate\nlength of incarceration.Length\nof Incarceration[39]Counsel have placed a number of cases before me\nnone of which, as they recognize is the situation more often than not, mirror\nexactly the circumstances of these offences and this offender.The\nCrown’s Cases[40]The Crown refers me in particular to cases of\nhome invasions accompanied by aggravated sexual assaults where the range of\nincarceration imposed has been between 12 and 18 years.[41]In R. v. Bellegarde, 2010 SKCA 15 (CanLII),\nthe Saskatchewan Court of Appeal reduced the sentence from 15 to 12 years’\nincarceration for pleas of guilt to break and enter of a dwelling house and\nsexual assault.Mr. Bellegarde was an aboriginal person so that Gladue\nprinciples were applicable; he did not use a weapon; he had a limited and\nunrelated criminal record; he had been a productive member of the community for\nmany years; he expressed shame and remorse and was assessed as a low to\nmoderate risk to reoffend.[42]None of these circumstances apply to Mr. Leduc.[43]In R. v. Nuvaqiq, 2009 NUCJ 11 (CanLII),\nthe Nunavut Court of Justice sentenced Mr. Nuvaqiq after his pleas of guilt to\n18 years’ incarceration for a home invasion and an aggravated sexual assault\nthat left the victim with permanent disabilities including a fractured skull\nand brain damage.Mr. Nuvaqiq was an aboriginal person.There was no\nsuggestion of a desire to change or of remorse aside from his guilty pleas.He\nhad a related criminal record spanning ten years.He was given increased\nparole ineligibility of one half of his sentence pursuant to s. 743.6(1) of the\nCriminal Code.[44]By way of contrast, Mr. Leduc is not an\naboriginal person, his record spans forty years, he was on probation in 2012\nwhen he attacked Ms. Denobriga and had already murdered two women by sexually\nassaulting them, beating them and strangling them to death.[45]In R. v. L.C.D., 2004 BCCA 405 (CanLII),\nthe British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld an 18 years sentence of\nincarceration as appropriate to denounce, deter and protect the public.The\naccused had pled guilty to break and enter of the victim’s home and aggravated\nsexual assault.He had raped the victim, an 88 year-old woman, at knifepoint.He had a criminal record but no record for sexual violence, a troubled life and\nwas assessed as intellectually impaired.[46]Mr. Leduc is not intellectually impaired and his\nmurder convictions significantly elevate concerns over his future\ndangerousness.[47]In R. v. Wheeler, 2011 BCCA 248 (CanLII),\nthe British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld a 15 years sentence imposed after\ntrial for aggravated sexual assault and overcoming resistance by choking.Mr.\nWheeler, then 50 years of age, was also found to be a long-term offender and\ngiven a ten-year supervision order.The attack occurred in the victim’s own\nhome but it was not a break and enter.Mr. Wheeler had a related criminal\nrecord with a record for assaulting women.He had abused both alcohol and\ndrugs.He had been assessed as a moderate to high risk of reoffending.The\nCourt remarked there was “almost nothing mitigating in Mr. Wheeler’s\ncircumstances.” (para. 18)[48]Mr. Leduc’s situation is similar except that he\nis a decade older, he has recently been convicted of two murders, and from\nthese circumstances and the similar circumstances involving Ms. Denobriga as\nstated before, I have concluded he is an ongoing danger to the safety of the\npublic.How much of a danger I cannot say.In Wheeler, the public\ngained some protection from Mr. Wheeler’s future risk for a total period of 25\nyears, through supervision by the criminal justice system while incarcerated\nand under a long-term offender order.There is no long-term offender\napplication before this Court for Mr. Leduc.[49]In R. v. Anderson, 2011 ONSC 5551 (CanLII),\nupheld in R. v. Anderson, 2012 ONCA 373 (CanLII), Mr. Anderson was a\nfirst-time offender convicted after trial of attempt murder, aggravated sexual\nassault, break and enter, unlawful confinement and threats of death.He was\nsentenced to life imprisonment for the first three offences.The Ontario Court\nof Appeal upheld the life sentence as a fit sentence.The victim was a 76\nyear-old woman.Mr. Anderson broke into her home brandishing a knife and told\nher he had come for sex.He threatened to kill her if she screamed.When she\ngrabbed the phone he cut the cord, hit her with the knife, pushed her onto the\nbed and had forcible vaginal intercourse with her.During the assault, he\nstabbed her in the abdomen three times and cut her face.She finally broke\nfree and escaped.Her injuries were severe and required surgery.Mr. Anderson\nwas a first-time offender with a supportive family.He refused to co-operate\nwith a psychiatric assessment.The trial judge remarked that there was little\nevidence before him to give insight into Mr. Anderson’s character or motivation\nfor the attack (para. 26) and concluded he could infer from the circumstances\nof the offence that Mr. Anderson posed an ongoing danger to the public despite\nthe lack of psychiatric evidence and that a life sentence was required to\nprotect society. (para 62)[50]By way of contrast to Mr. Anderson, Mr. Leduc is\nnot a first-time offender and Ms. Denobriga’s physical injuries from the knife\nwere less severe and bound up in the consequences of the struggle.However,\nthe chokehold was a severe resort to deliberate violence with life-threatening\nconsequences and when Mr. Leduc’s attack against Ms. Denobriga is considered in\nlight of his two previous murders, it can be characterized as similar in\nseverity to Mr. Anderson’s actions.Defence\nCases[51]Defence counsel has referred me to Ontario cases\nwith somewhat comparable though varying facts but none of which involve home\ninvasions, having a sentencing range of five to eighteen years’ incarceration.He submits an appropriate sentence is nine to ten years imprisonment after\naccording the murder convictions little weight because of their being under\nappeal.He submits the Anderson case imposing a life sentence is unique\nand involved more brutality than that inflicted by Mr. Leduc.He cautions\nagainst inferring that Mr. Leduc had a specific intent to kill, as was the\nsituation for Mr. Anderson.[52]I emphasize that Mr. Leduc has not been charged\nwith attempt murder.He cannot be found guilty of an offence with which he has\nnot been charged and in respect of which there has been no trial or plea of\nguilt.In my analysis, I make no finding as to whether Mr. Leduc had a\nspecific intent to kill Ms. Denobriga or that he was attempting to murder her.That would be speculative, I agree.[53]I only conclude, as explained before, that after\nan assessment of all of the circumstances, an appropriate characterization of\nMr. Leduc’s 2012 charges in terms of their gravity, moves them towards\namounting to a near attempt murder.[54]I also emphasize, as reviewed before, that the\nmurder convictions are a necessary consideration in determining a fit sentence\nregardless that they are under appeal.They exist as part of Mr. Leduc’s\ncircumstances and criminal record and must be factored into the issue of an\nappropriate sentence for his 2012 charges.[55]Defence counsel refers me to R. v. Cameron,\n[2002] O.J. No. 899, a decision of Watt J., as he was then, where Mr. Cameron\nwas sentenced for six convictions arising out of three separate incidents that\ntook place over about a one-year period and only given a life sentence for the\nmurder.As summarized in R. v. Assing, 2008 CanLII 58607 (ON SC), [2008] O.J. No. 4527, at\nparas. 37-40, Mr. Cameron had committed a series of three separate sexual\nassaults culminating in murder.He had no criminal record and had pled\nguilty.All the incidents involved planned home invasions, sexual assaults and\narming himself with a letter opener for the first and a knife for the next\ntwo.The crimes remained unexplained and there was no evidence of Mr.\nCameron’s psychiatric make-up (Cameron, at para. 72). Watt J. sentenced\nMr. Cameron to life imprisonment for the murder, 5 years for the first attack\nand 12 years for the second, both concurrent to the life sentence.[56]The Crown submits these five and twelve year\nsentences in Cameron could simply be the allocation of a number by Watt\nJ. while relying on the life sentence to provide the necessary protection to\nthe public. I agree.Protection of the public was of paramount concern to Watt\nJ.He commented that “considered together, these incidents represent a\ndisturbing escalation of physical violence.” (para. 56)In discussing the\napplicable sentencing objectives in relation to the first incident, he omitted\nthe sentencing objective of rehabilitation but stated it had a place as the\noffender was a first offender, “[b]ut he is also a first offender who will be\nsentenced to imprisonment for life, so the objective is somewhat less\ninfluential than it might otherwise have been had each conviction attracted a\nfixed-term sentence”. (para 62)Conclusion[57]Protection of the public is of paramount concern\nin relation to Mr. Leduc for all the reasons reviewed above.I cannot be\nsatisfied that anything less than a life sentence will achieve this objective,\nnotwithstanding Mr. Leduc’s age.There is a dearth of evidence before me about\nhim and this is concerning.[58]In considering the appropriateness of a life\nsentence for Mr. Leduc for his 2012 crimes, because of this concern for public\nsafety, I am guided by the words of Chief Justice McLachlin in R. v. Cheddesingh,\n2004 SCC 16 (CanLII), [2004] 1 S.C.R. 433 (SCC),A maximum penalty\nof any kind will by its very nature be imposed only rarely and is only\nappropriate if the offence is of sufficient gravity and the offender display\nsufficient blameworthiness.As is always the case with sentencing, the inquiry\nmust proceed on a case-by-case basis. (para. 1)[59]I conclude that as Mr. Leduc’s 2012 offences are\nextremely grave and his blameworthiness and dangerousness can only be regarded\nas high, the rare sentence of life imprisonment with increased parole\nineligibility must be imposed to achieve the paramount sentencing objectives of\nprotection of society, denunciation and deterrence.[60]Mr. Leduc, please stand.[61]For the offence of aggravated assault, I\nsentence you to life imprisonment.For the offence of attempt to choke, I\nsentence you to life imprisonment to be served concurrently.For the offence\nof break and enter a dwelling house with intent, I sentence you to 15 years\nimprisonment to be served concurrently.For the offence of breach of a\nprobation order I sentence you to 2 years imprisonment to be served\nconcurrently.[62]With respect to your eligibility for parole\nregarding the life sentences and the concurrent fifteen years sentence imposed\ntoday, I am satisfied pursuant to the principles set out ins.\n743.6(1) of the Criminal Code that you must serve ten years of those\nsentences before being able to be released on full parole.[63]Ancillary Orders are also required.[64]There is an Order made under s. 109 of the Criminal\nCode banning you for your lifetime from possessing any firearm or\nammunition or any other item referred to in that section.[65]You are ordered to submit forthwith to the\ntaking of a bodily sample for DNA analysis and data bank storage.[66]A lifetime registration under the Sexual\nOffender Information Registration Act (SOIRA) is ordered.[67]Finally, pursuant to s. 743.21 of the Criminal\nCode, you are prohibited from communicating directly or indirectly with\nRita Denobriga or any member of her family while serving your sentence.Justice L.

(Butterworths/LexisNexis May 2008)Reasons for judgment:McQUAID J.A.:BACKGROUND[1]The appellant Dean Carl Chappell was charged that on July 11, 2004, at\nor near Milton Station in Queens County, Prince Edward Island, with the use of\na firearm he robbed Andrew Frizzell contrary to s. 343(d) and 21(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. He entered a plea of not guilty and was\ntried by a Supreme Court judge and jury.On May 19, 2006, following a\nseven-day trial, the jury found him guilty on both counts.[2]On July 14, 2006, the trial judge imposed a sentence of seven and\none-half years in prison. The trial judge gave the appellant six months credit\nfor time served in custody prior to the sentence, and as a result, he sentenced\nthe appellant to serve seven years in a federal penal institution.[3]On August 6, 2006, the appellant filed a prisoner appeal from both the\nconviction and sentence.[4]The appellant was represented by counsel at trial; however, at all times\nafter the conclusion of the trial, including his sentencing hearing, the\nappellant represented himself. After filing a Notice of Appeal, the appellant\nmade two applications to this Court pursuant to s. 684 of the Criminal Code for the appointment of counsel. The motions\nwere denied.In deciding one of those motions, I provided written reasons\nwhich chronicle the history of the appeal to that point in time. See: R. v. Chappell 2010 PECA 18 (CanLII); [2010] P.E.I.J. NO. 46.[5]The appellant was given a number of opportunities to perfect his appeal\nby filing a written factum. In the above noted decision, I allowed the\nappellant until January 31, 2011, to perfect the appeal. When he did not comply\nand the Crown did not move to have the appeal dismissed, the Court set the\nappeal down for an oral hearing.At the hearing of the appeal, the Court\npermitted the appellant to present his argument orally. In the course of making\nhis oral submissions, the appellant made an application to admit fresh evidence\non the appeal. The Court took the application under advisement.A decision on\nthe application is included in these reasons.Crown Evidence(i)The\nrobbery[6]On July 10, 2004, Andrew Frizzell attended a car show in Moncton.He\nreturned to his home at approximately one a.m. on July 11th. At home\nwith him were two of his three children, a son and a daughter. At the time they\nwere 16 and 13 years of age respectively. All three retired for the night\naround two a.m. At approximately four a.m. Ryan Mutch, David Salman and Stacey\nBlackmore entered the residence.Mr. Salman was carrying a loaded gun. All\nthree were wearing camouflage clothing and masks.[7]Mr. Salman approached Mr. Frizzell who grabbed the barrel of the gun and\ndrove it into Salman's face. Mr. Frizzell was assaulted and pepper sprayed by\none of the other two individuals.[8]Mr. Frizzell's daughter was sleeping on a couch in the room where the\nthree individuals entered the residence. The gun was pushed toward her face and\nshe was held against the wall. The intruders threatened Mr. Frizzell that if he\ndid not open the safe in his residence, somebody was going to get hurt.Mr.\nFrizzell complied and opened the safe. The intruders used a pillow case to\ngather some of the items that were in the safe, and after doing so they left\nthe premises.[9]Mr. Frizzell immediately alerted two individuals who had been working\nthroughout the night in Mr. Frizzell's autobody shop located adjacent to his\nresidence. Mr. Frizzell testified that he observed the three intruders leaving\nin a turquoise Mazda truck. One of the men working in the body shop gave chase\nin his vehicle, and Mr. Frizzell also gave chase in his vehicle. They did not\ncatch the three intruders.[10]Subsequently, the truck driven by the three broke down.Messrs. Salman\nand Blackmore were separated from Mutch. They broke into a vacant home and were\nlater picked up by another co‑accused, William David MacDonald. Mr. Mutch\nhad fled on foot, and he was later apprehended by the police.[11]According to the evidence of Messrs. Blackmore and MacDonald, later that\nsame morning Salman, Blackmore, and MacDonald met the appellant at a residence\nin Charlottetown.They realized that the heist of Mr. Frizzell's safe was not\nfruitful.There were a few five and two dollar bills.Blackmore, Salman and\nMacDonald all testified that the appellant burned the $5. bills that had been\ncarried away from the Frizzell residence by Salman.(ii)Planning\nthe robbery[12]Prior to committing the robbery Messrs. Mutch, Salman, Blackmore and\nMacDonald met with the appellant at the appellant's residence. The appellant\nalso operated an auto body shop adjacent to his residence.[13]The plan they formulated was to break into Mr. Frizzell's residence,\ngain access to thesafe and remove a large sum of money, which they speculated\nto be in the vicinity of $50,000.All five agreed they would proceed to a\ncabin in the woods near York, P.E.I., owned by the appellant and a number of\nhis friends. From there Blackmore, Salman and Mutch would proceed to the\nFrizzell residence. The appellant and Mr. MacDonald were to stay behind at the\ncabin to meet the three when they returned with the cash.[14]After arriving at the cabin from the appellant's residence, Mr. Salman\nand the appellant left. They both proceeded a few kilometers down the York Road\nwhere they stole a turquoise Mazda truck. The vehicle was started by the\nappellant and driven back to the cabin by Mr. Salman.The appellant followed.\nSalman, Mutch and Blackmore left to undertake the robbery.[15]Eventually all five were charged with robbery.Messrs. MacDonald,\nMutch, Salman and Blackmore all entered guilty pleas and were sentenced to\nterms of imprisonment in federal institutions.[16]Messrs. Salman, Blackmore, Mutch and MacDonald all gave evidence at the\ntrial of the appellant. Their evidence was relatively consistent on the\nmaterial facts and inconsistent on some other less material facts.They all\ntestified the appellant participated in the planning of the robbery. They also\nall testified that they were all of the understanding there would be nobody in\nthe Frizzell home at the time and that they expected the safe to contain\n$50,000.[17]The appellant continues to take the position he is innocent. He denies\ntaking any part in the planning of the robbery or in being an accessory to the\nrobbery in any way. He says that he was home in bed when the robbery occurred,\nand he was at a car show in Moncton, New Brunswick, the morning of the robbery\nwhen the money was burned at the apartment in Charlottetown. He would not agree\nwith my summary of the facts set forth above, and he would assert vigorously\nthat the evidence of Messrs. MacDonald, Mutch, Blackmore and Salman as it\nrelated to his involvement is concocted and absolutely untrue. I will review\nthe appellant’s evidence and the evidence given by others in his defence.The Appellant's Evidence[18]The appellant gave evidence at trial in his own defence.[19]The appellant stated that he knew Mr. Mutch through a Mr. Justin Bradley\nwho was living with the appellant around the time of the robbery.[20]Mr. MacDonald was known to the appellant as a person who would visit the\nappellant’s shop from time to time. Mr. MacDonaldbought a vehicle through the\nappellant, and he would come to the appellant's shop to work on the vehicle. He\nsated that he had previously met Mr. MacDonald in 1995.The appellant stated\nthat he and MacDonald got along reasonably well except they did argue about one\nor more individuals MacDonald was referring to as a \"rat.\"[21]Through Mr. MacDonald the appellant knew Mr. Salman and Mr. Blackmore.\nOn two occasions he requested Mr. MacDonald to bring Mr. Blackmore to his\nshop.A woman the appellant was seeing had been a previous girlfriend of Mr.\nBlackmore, and she alleged that Blackmore had assaulted her on occasion.She\nlived in fear of him, and the appellant wanted to ensure that Mr. Blackmore did\nnot harm the woman.On another occasion the appellant asked Mr. MacDonald to\nbring Mr. Blackmore to his shop because Mr. Blackmore was allegedly making\nclaims around the City that he was going to kill the appellant.[22]The appellant knew Mr. Frizzell as he had worked for him in 1992.The\nappellant was familiar with the premises of Mr. Frizzell. He frequently\nattended at his shop to have paint mixed for vehicles the appellant was\nrepairing. He had been to the Frizzell shop two to three weeks prior to the\nrobbery for that purpose.The appellant denied any knowledge of a safe being\non the property of Mr. Frizzell.He denied being in the living quarters of Mr.\nFrizzell's property two to three weeks prior to the robbery. The appellant also\ndenied any previous confrontation, argument or dispute with Mr. Frizzell.[23]On July 10, 2004, the appellant stated he went to breakfast with his son\nwho was nine years of age at the time.When they returned home, a friend of\nhis son came to the residence.The appellant worked on a car throughout the\nrest of the morning.[24]The appellant had lunch around noon and then took his son and the friend\nfor an ice cream. They returned home and later that afternoon Mr. MacDonald\naccompanied by Mr. Mutch came by the appellant's residence and auto body shop.The appellant chatted with Mr. MacDonald about the vehicle he was working on.Mr. Mutch asked about Justin Bradley and whether he was at home. The appellant\nassumed Mr. Mutch went into the residence although he could not say for certain\nas the appellant's view of the residence was obstructed from where he was\nlocated in the shop. Mr. Mutch returned to the shop a short time later ‑\n10 to 15 minutes ‑ he and MacDonald departed and there were no plans to\nmeet later.[25]The appellant returned to his residence, and present at that time were\nJustin Bradley, his girlfriend as well as the appellant's son and his friend.[26]The appellant had supper and after supper he went to the shop again.\nAround 8:30 p.m., the appellant testified that two friends, Bruce Duck and Sean\nHenneberry, arrived to assist the appellant with work on the vehicle.[27]Later in the evening three friends of Justin Bradley's girlfriend\narrived at the residence. At or about midnight the appellant drove them to a\nnightclub in Charlottetown. The appellant testified the three friends were at\nthe residence between 10 p.m. and midnight.[28]After driving the three young women to Charlottetown, the appellant\nreturned to his shop.He testified that Mr. Duck and Mr. Henneberry left the\nautobody shop between one and 1:30 a.m. on July 11th.[29]The appellant cleaned up the shop and when returning to his residence,\nhe observed one of the young women returning to the residence with two young\nmen.The appellant had a conversation with them and did not allow one of the\nyoung men to enter the residence as he thought the young man was intoxicated.The appellant testified that he went to sleep around two a.m. and woke the next\nmorning around eight a.m.[30]The appellant also testified that the next morning, July 11, 2004, he\ntook a vehicle he had been working on to a residence in Charlottetown. He also\ntestified that he met Mr. Duck at this residence around 9:30 to 10 a.m.The\nappellant, Mr. Duck, Mr. Henneberry and four other young people who were\nchildren of the three or friends of their children, departed for the car show\nin Moncton.They were in Moncton for the day returning home at approximately\nseven p.m.[31]On his return home, the appellant noticed that $800. was missing from\nhis bedroom.[32]The appellant testified that he first learned of the robbery a few days\nafter July 11, 2004.The appellant's gun or one registered in his name had\nbeen recovered from Messrs. Mutch, Blackmore and Salman.[33]On July 29, 2004, the RCMP came to the appellant's residence with a\nsearch warrant. He was arrested shortly thereafter. While being interrogated by\nthe police in Montague, he had a conversation with his mother who advised him\nof damage to his gun cabinet which was located in a closet in his bedroom.The\nappellant testified he was not aware of damage to the gun cabinet prior to that\ntime.Two photos taken by the appellant's mother showing the damage to the\ncabinet were introduced into evidence.[34]The appellant gave evidence that he had shown his gun collection to Mr.\nMacDonald in June 2004. He testified that when he showed the collection to Mr.\nMacDonald, there was no damage to the cabinet.He also testified that he never\nmet MacDonald after he left his property on July 10, 2004.[35]During cross‑examination the appellant confirmed he had a criminal\nrecord.In 1987 he was convicted of assault with a weapon and assault causing\nbodily harm.In 1988 he was convicted of assault.In 1991 he was convicted of\ncontempt of court, and in 1992 he was convicted of the dangerous operation of a\nmotor vehicle.[36]The appellant was cross‑examined on why he did not tell the police\nin statements and the court in appearances at his preliminary inquiry and at\nvarious show cause hearings that he was home in bed the night of the robbery.He admitted that he did not tell the police about the three young women he had\ndriven to the nightclub in Charlottetown or about any of the other individuals\nwho were around his residence that day. The appellant also admitted that he\nnever told the police about the theft of $800. from this home, and he confirmed\nhe did not report the gun stolen from his property.[37]The appellant was released from custody on bail awaiting trial on these\ncharges.After he was released, he received legal advice and disclosure from\nthe Crown within two weeks.He stated that he did not give a statement explaining\nto the police his whereabouts because, when he was interrogated and he told the\npolice about the conversation with his mother, the police did not acknowledge\nthis, and he was ignored and that bothered him quite a bit.[38]He was asked to explain why the four individuals, three of whom he did\nnot know well, would implicate him as they did in their evidence. The appellant\ndid not offer an explanation.[39]Mr. Clay Meron gave evidence on behalf of the appellant.He was an\ninmate at the Sleepy Hollow Correctional Institute when he overheard a\nconversation between Mr. Mutch and another inmate he identified as Tyler\nBradley. Mr. Meron testified that he overheard Mr. Mutch telling Mr. Bradley\nthat he had a quantity of drugs, and $800. in a wallet hidden between a VCR and\nTV in a cottage.[40]Mr. Meron understood the cottage to be one owned by Mr. Mutch and not\nthe appellant. On cross‑examination, he admitted he was unsure of the\namount of money Mr. Mutch had mentioned. Mr. Meron was also unsure about the\nshotgun. He was also unsure as to precisely what Mr. Mutch was referring to or\nthat Mr. Mutch was linking it to the robbery; however, Mr. Meron testified that\nMessrs.Mutch and Bradley were speaking about why Mr. Mutch was in jail and\nthus Mr. Meron assumed the hidden items related to the robbery at the Frizzell\nresidence. Mr. Meron says this conversation took place in June or July 2004.[41]Mr. Meron said he couldn't be sure but he also thought he heard Mr.\nMutch mention that he also had a gun hidden in the same cottage.[42]Mr. Meron spoke to the appellant after his release.He spoke to him\nabout purchasing a car.He and the appellant had spoken while both were in\ncustody.They spoke after their release and it was in May of 2006 that Mr.\nMeron learned he would be a witness.[43]Bruce Duck and the appellant were friends who had known each other for\nseven to 10 years.Mr. Duck testified that on a Saturday night in July 2004\n(he did not provide a specific date), he was with the appellant and Sean\nHenneberry working on a car in the appellant's autobody shop. Mr. Duck\ntestified that he saw David MacDonald at the shop earlier in the evening of the\nsame day.Mr. Duck was not sure of the dates; however, he was certain it was\nthe day before the robbery which he learned of after it occurred.[44]The appellant stated that he never told Mr. Duck to go to the police and\naccount for the appellant's whereabouts on the night of July 10, 2004, and the\nearly morning of July 11th.[45]Mr. Duck recalled the appellant leaving the shop to drive three\nindividuals to Charlottetown.He testified he was not sure of the time.[46]About two weeks before giving evidence, Mr. Duck spoke with the\nappellant concerning the evidence he was to give at trial.Mr. Duck gave a\nstatement to the appellant's counsel.[47]At trial and in the course of his direct examination, counsel for the\nappellant showed Mr. Duck a statement he had given to the police for purposes\nof refreshing Mr. Duck’smemory.When this statement failed to refresh his\nmemory, counsel contemplated making a K.G.B.\napplication to have the statement admitted for the truth of its contents.[48]Counsel for the Crown and the appellant subsequently agreed on the\nadmission of parts of the statement for the truth of its contents. The\nstatement was given to the police on May 5, 2006.The trial judge satisfied\nhimself with the consent of counsel that the prerequisites for the admission of\nthe statement were met and the agreed upon segments of the statement were\nadmitted into evidence.[49]In his evidence at trial Mr. Duck could not remember when he left the\nappellant's shop the night/early morning of July 10th/11th.In his statement to the police he said categorically it was 12:30 to one a.m.\nAt trial he also couldn't remember the time the appellant left to take the\nyoung women to town. In the statement he said it was around midnight and that\nthe appellant was away from the shop approximately 30 minutes.[50]Mr. Duck corroborated most of the evidence of the appellant regarding\nthe trip to Moncton beginning with the two of them meeting at the appellant's\nshop that Sunday morning, dropping off a car and proceeding to Moncton.[51]Mr. Duck testified there were approximately 15 people involved with the\nownership and use of the cabin in York where the robbery had been staged. He\ntestified that he and his friends, including the appellant, used the cabin\nmostly in the winter when they were on their snowmobiles or four wheelers.MacDonald, Salman, Blackmore and Mutch were not members of that group. Mr. Duck\nconfirmed in his evidence that the appellant was part of the group.[52]A month or so after the robbery, Mr. Duck learned the cabin had been\nused as a staging venue for the robbery. He testified he did not learn this\nfrom the appellant and that he had not had any conversation with the appellant\nabout the fact that it had been so used.[53]After Mr. Duck learned about the robbery, the only conversation he had\nwith the appellant was about who could have possibly carried out the robbery.He also testified that he spoke to the appellant after the appellant was\ncharged and the appellant confirmed he was not involved.[54]Mr. Duck recalled the appellant telling him that his gun was stolen but\ndoes not remember when the appellant relayed this information to him.Also, he\ntestified that he was told by the appellant that $800. had been stolen from the\nappellant's home; however, Mr. Duck was also not sure when he received that\ninformation. Mr. Duck testified that he did not think it was important to\nprovide the police with all this information when he gave his statement under\noath to the police.[55]Messrs. Mutch, MacDonald and Salman all put themselves at the\nappellant's property between 12:30 a.m. and one a.m. in the early morning of\nJuly 11th.Blackmore does not state a time as to when they were\nthere. MacDonald says that the appellant wanted them to leave the property\nbecause he was expecting someone to come there and MacDonald suspected that to\nbe Bruce Duck.That doesn't match up with the evidence of the others or with\nMr. Duck. However, the other co-accused were all consistent that they were\nthere 12:30 to 1:00 a.m.[56]The gun recovered from the Mazda truck was a gun registered in the name\nof the appellant.The Appeal[57]The notice of appeal prepared by the appellant without the assistance of\ncounsel is not clear in setting out the grounds of appeal which might be\nconsidered by the Court.[58]The appellant has indicated in his notice of appeal that he is appealing\nfrom the conviction and from the sentence imposed.[59]Pursuant to s. 675(1)(a)(i) and (ii) of the Criminal\nCode, the appellant has the right to appeal from the conviction entered\nagainst him on any ground that relates to a question of law alone.With leave\nof the court, he also has the right to appeal from the conviction on a question\nof fact or a question of mixed fact and law.[60]Pursuant to ss. 675(1)(b) the appellant has the right to seek leave to\nappeal from the sentence imposed upon him. If leave is granted, he may appeal\nfrom the sentence.Appeal From The Conviction[61]Pursuant to s. 686(1)(a)(i) to (iii) of the Criminal\nCode, the Court may allow the appeal from the conviction if the Court is\nof the opinion the conviction should be set aside on the ground that it is\nunreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence.The Court may also set\naside the conviction if the Court is of the opinion the conviction was entered\nas the result of a wrong decision on a question of law.Finally, the Court may\nalso set aside a conviction on the ground that there was a miscarriage of\njustice.[62]I would dismiss the appellant's appeal from the conviction.The\nconviction was not entered as the result of a wrong decision on a question of\nlaw.The conviction is not unreasonable, and it is supported by the evidence.\nThe conviction did not result from a miscarriage of justice.(i)Was\nthere a wrong decision on a question of law?[63]First, I will address whether the conviction resulted from a wrong\ndecision on a question of law.[64]The appellant's defence at trial was that he did not participate in\nplanning of the robbery or in aiding its commission.The appellant states he\ndid not meet the four co‑accused to plan the robbery.At the time the\nfour co‑accused said they met with him to plan the robbery, the appellant\nsays that he was working in his auto body shop with Bruce Duck and Sean Henneberry.\nAt the time of the robbery he was at home in his bed.The next day when three\nof the co‑accused met to divide the paltry proceeds the appellant says he\nwas on his way to a car show in Moncton, New Brunswick, in the company of Mr.\nDuck and Mr. Henneberry. In other words, the appellant put an alibi defence\nbefore the jury.[65]The jury heard the evidence of Mr. Duck. They also heard the contents of\nhis sworn statement to the police. In his evidence he was unable to state when\nhe left the property of the appellant on the night of July 10th or\nthe early morning of July 11th.In his sworn statement to the\npolice on May 5, 2006, he stated that he left between 12:30 and one a.m.[66]While the appellant told the police on a couple of occasions that he did\nnot participate in the robbery, the details of his alibi were not provided to\nthe police until Mr. Duck gave a statement to the police on May 5, 2006. This\nstatement was taken after counsel for the appellant made available to the Crown\na sworn statement counsel had taken from Mr. Duck two or three days previous.\nThe trial was scheduled to commence and it did commence on May 15, 2006.[67]At the same time the potential evidence of Mr. Duck was disclosed to the\nCrown, counsel for the appellant also disclosed that Mr. Henneberry would give\nevidence supporting the appellant's alibi.Mr. Henneberry was working in\nAlberta and an issue arose as to both the timing of the request to bring him\nforward as a witness and the provision of funding by legal aid for him to\ntravel to Prince Edward Island.A pre‑trial conference was held before\nthe trial judge and the appellant has filed a copy with the Court of the\ntranscript of that pre‑trial conference.Attending were counsel for the\nCrown, counsel for the appellant, and the Director of Legal Aid.The result\nof the pre‑trial conference was that legal aid agreed to provide funding\nfor travel to Prince Edward Island if Mr. Henneberry could be located and\nserved.Mr. Henneberry did not give evidence at the trial.[68]At trial there was an issue as to the timeliness of the appellant's\ndisclosure of his alibi witnesses. The disclosure was made some two years after\nthe commission of the crime and at a time, at least with respect to Mr.\nHenneberry, when it would be virtually impossible to have his story\ninvestigated by the police and to have him attend at trial.[69]When the appellant was cross‑examined by Crown counsel, he was\nasked if he had ever disclosed his alibi on the number of occasions he attended\nat court for bail hearings or at the conclusion of his preliminary inquiry.The appellant confirmed that he did not disclose the alibi on those\nopportunities. He also confirmed that he did not make the police aware of the\nidentity of the young women he drove to the nightclub in Charlottetown or the\nnames of their friends.[70]At the hearing of his appeal, the appellant referred the court to the\ndecision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Cleghorn,\n1995 CanLII 63 (SCC), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 175; [1995] S.C.J. No. 73. This case is authority for the\nprinciples applicable to the disclosure of an alibi.[71]The defence of an alibi must meet two requirements.First, it must be\ndisclosed in time to permit the Crown an opportunity to investigate. Secondly,\nthe particulars of the alibi must be such that the investigation can be\nconducted in a meaningful fashion. The failure to give adequate notice does not\nmean the alibi evidence cannot be received by the court, but it is a factor to\nbe considered by the trier of fact in considering how much weight should be\ngiven to the evidence. Indeed the trier of fact may draw an adverse inference\nfrom the lack of adequate notice when weighing the alibi evidence.See: R. v. Cleghorn, at paragraphs 3 and 4.[72]In R. v. Cleghorn,Major J. wrote a\ndissenting opinion with which Sopinka J. concurred.Their departure with the\nmajority opinion of the Court rested on whether disclosure by the mother of the\naccused was sufficient. As for the principles generally applicable to the\nevaluation of alibi evidence, there does not appear to have been disagreement\nwithin the Court.[73]Major J. makes the point at paragraph 22 of his reasons that the\nprincipal reason a negative inference may be drawn from less than adequate\nnotice of alibi evidence is because such evidence can be easily fabricated. He\nalso cautions that the rules relating to the disclosure of alibi evidence must\nnow be considered in the context of the accused’s right to silence protected by\nthe Charter.[74]The court should not draw an adverse inference from an accused person's\nfailure to disclose the alibi immediately upon his or her arrest. Unless there\nis an issue as to the timeliness of the disclosure of the alibi or the adequacy\nof the alibi, cross‑examination of an accused as to why disclosure was\nnot made immediately upon arrest is not proper.Where disclosure is made\nsufficiently early to allow investigation, no questions on that issue should be\nallowed and no reference should be made to it in the charge to the jury.See: R. v. Cleghorn at paragraphs 23‑25.[75]Finally, with respect to the particulars of the disclosure Major J. states\nthat to constitute sufficient disclosure the disclosure must contain a\nstatement that the accused was not present at the location of the crime at the\ntime it was committed, the whereabouts of the accused at the time, and the\nnames of any witnesses to the alibi.[76]In the case at bar, there was an issue with respect to the timeliness of\nthe disclosure of the alibi less than two weeks before the trial and almost two\nyears after the commission of the offence. While the police did have an\nopportunity to take a statement from Mr. Duck ten days before the commencement\nof the trial, there was little time to further investigate.The other alibi\nwitness, Mr. Henneberry, was never brought forward despite the agreement of\nlegal aid to provide funding for his transportation if he could be located and\nserved with a subpoena.[77]There was an issue as to the adequacy of the alibi evidence.Mr. Duck\ncould not definitively say when he left the premises of the appellant on the\nnight the four co‑accused testified they attended there to plan the\nrobbery. The police were never informed of many other individuals named by the\nappellant in his evidence as being capable of providing support for his alibi.[78]Furthermore, the evidence of Mr. Duck does not place the appellant at\nhis home when the staging of the robbery took place at the cabin in York. In\nthis respect the alibi evidence does not disclose the names of the three or\nfour young people the appellant allegedly drove to Charlottetown around the\nsame time the co‑accused met at the appellant's property.[79]Over the course of the almost two years between the commission of the\noffence and the trial, the appellant made a number of appearances in court for\nshow cause hearings, bail release hearing and a preliminary inquiry.At no\ntime in the formal settings available to him and well after the commission of\nthe offence did the appellant disclose the alibi evidence he caused to be\nbrought forward less than two weeks prior to the trial.[80]The trial judge, over the objection of counsel for the appellant,\nallowed the Crown to cross‑examine the appellant as to why he did not\nbring forward the alibi evidence on the above occasions. Having due respect to\nthe appellant's right to remain silent, I am not satisfied that the trial\njudge's decision or ruling to allow the cross‑examination to continue\nconstituted an error of law. There was clearly an issue as to the timeliness of\nthe disclosure of the alibi evidence as well as an issue with respect to the\nadequacy of the alibi. The Crown was entitled to seek an explanation from the\nappellant as to the reasons for the delay.[81]The trial judge also gave the jury specific instructionson the issue\nof alibi evidence. He instructed the jury they were at liberty to accept or\nreject the evidence.The trial judge affirmed and impressed upon the jury that\nthe appellant had the right to remain silent. He asked the jury to consider\nwhether the disclosure of the alibi evidence was in sufficient time for the\npolice to investigate the evidence. He instructed the jury they should not draw\nan inference the appellant was guilty as the result of his failure to disclose\nthe alibi evidence at an earlier date.[82]The trial judge's complete instruction on this issue is set out below.See: the transcript May 19, 2006 at pp. 835 to 838 where the trial judge stated\nas follows:.\n. . . .Now I want to tell you a little bit more about the defence of\nalibi.You've heard evidence that Mr. Chappell had other people at his place\nwhere it's alleged that the staging took place.Those are the material times.If you believe that evidence, and believe that that puts it in such a way that\nthat couldn't have happened or didn't happen, then you'd acquit for that\nparticular incident.If you still don't believe it, but the evidence leaves\nyou in reasonable doubt, then you'd still acquit regarding that particular\nincident.But remember, you need one or more incidents.But Mr. Hornby's\ntheory is you either believe everything or believe nothing.So he said the\nhouse of ‑ he suggests, I think, the house of cards falls if you find\nthat they were lying about, the four robbers were lying about being at Mr.\nChappell's garage.So that's how the alibi evidence works.Now after ‑\nthis alibi was provided fairly late in the day, but on the other hand, it was\nprovided within a sufficient time for the police to have done their\ninvestigation of the alibi, or not their investigation, but to check on the\nvalidity of the alibi.So here's what the law says about that.After\nconsidering the alibi evidence, you may decide not to believe the alibi.There\nare many reasons why you may not believe the alibi evidence, for example, you\nmay be of the opinion that the witnesses, including the accused, who testified\nin support of the alibi were imprecise or inconclusive, that their recollection\nwas unreliable, or that they were simply mistaken.That does not mean that the\nevidence was falsely fabricated or concocted to mislead you, although you can\ndraw whatever conclusions you want.You've heard evidence that the alibi of\nthe accused was not disclosed to the Crown until weeks before the trial.You\nshould know that an accused person has the right to remain silent when charged\nwith a criminal offence.An accused person has no legal duty to come forward\nand offer an explanation, however, if you find that the alibi evidence was not\ndisclosed in time to permit the Crown and police to make a meaningful\ninvestigation of the alibi evidence, then you may take that delay into account when\ndeciding how much weight you'll give to the alibi evidence.In such\ncircumstances, you may, but not necessarily must, choose not to believe the\nalibi evidence.However, you should not draw an inference that the accused is\nguilty from the fact that he delayed in disclosing the alibi evidence to the\nCrown.That delay would only be a factor in deciding how much weight you give\nto the alibi evidence.So in the present case, the alibi evidence was raised,\nas I understand the evidence, with the Crown on May 3rd and the police did\ntheir investigation, their K.G.B. statement on July ‑ or May the 5th, and\nthe trial started on May the 11th.In the cross‑examination of Mr.\nChappell, the accused, there was questions about opportunities in the various\ncourt procedures leading up to the trial for him to have said I was home in\nbed, there's people that can vouch for me, it couldn't have been me involved,\nit must be a lie that they're doing.So, and he acknowledged that he didn't\ntell and he had legal advice at the time, some of the time, and that advice was\nto hold his own counsel.Now on the one hand, delay in disclosure makes a\ndifference for the Crown'sability to check out the alibi when I've already\ntold you about that.On the other hand, I want to tell you that you need to be\n‑ I'll repeat this from what I said before ‑ that an accused has a\nright to remain silent and has no duty to come forward and offer an\nexplanation.The Crown has the duty to prove the case.And it would be a\ncontradiction of the right to remain silent if you were to find that the\naccused is more likely to be guilty because he didn't disclose that early, and\nI've already said to you about late alibis.Anyway, almost done.[83]The four co‑accused who testified against the appellant fell short\nof even the lowest standard of what we might describe as a model citizen. Life\nendeavors, at least until 2004, had garnered Messrs. Blackmore and MacDonald\nunenviable criminal records.All four were involved in the planning and\ncarrying out a heinous crime which violated the sanctity of a man's home and\nplaced his life and the lives of his two children at risk. The evidence of the\nco-accused had to be treated with extreme caution.The jury had a full appreciation\nfor the character of these four individuals. It was open to the jury to accept\nor reject their evidence and to accept or reject the evidence of the\nappellant.The jury chose to accept the evidence of the co‑accused and\nreject the evidence of the appellant.This court does not have any\njurisdiction to interfere, absent a wrong decision on a question of law.[84]The trial judge instructed the jury to be careful when considering the\nevidence of the co‑accused, particularly Blackmore and MacDonald. The\ntrial judge warned the jury to be careful with the evidence of the co‑accused\nwhile at the same time instructing the jury that they were free to accept or\nreject it. See: Transcript of proceedings May 19, 2006 at pp.804 and 805 where\nthe trial judge stated:... Two of the Crown witnesses had lengthy criminal records, so\nI'm going to mention this to you.Where the evidence of a witness is highly\nimportant to your findings, you need to have in mind that there's a risk in\nadopting the evidence of a person considered ‑ the law makes a\nclassification called an unsavoury witness.So there's a risk of adopting the\nevidence of that witness, of such a witness, without more, without\ncorroboration.You can accept that person's evidence without corroboration, and\nyou can also, if there's corroboration, you can look at the corroboration.Both Stacey Blackmore and David MacDonald are the people we're talking about\nwith lengthy criminal records.You can assess all the other factors about\ntheir credibility, you had the observation opportunity. So when you have a\nperson with a long criminal record giving important evidence, the care and\ncaution is that you should look for some confirmation from somebody other. ....[85]The trial judge also referred to the appellant's criminal record.He\npointed out that the fact the appellant had a criminal record did not make the\nevidence of the appellant less reliable or less believable than the evidence of\nthe co‑accused.[86]The issues at trial raised significant questions of credibility.In the\nfinal analysis the jury was left with the evidence of the appellant and the\nevidence of the co‑accused.The jury had to decide which to accept.When this situation arises in a trial, it is important that the jury is\nproperly instructed on how to resolve this credibility issue in the context of\ndeciding whether the Crown has met the ultimate burden of proving the guilt of\nthe accused beyond a reasonable doubt.[87]The trial judge properly instructed the jury on this issue.He reinforced\nwith the jury that the appellant was entitled to the presumption of innocence.He also instructed the jury that because the appellant gave evidence in his own\ndefence that when they considered whether the Crown had proven the guilt of the\naccused beyond a reasonable doubt, it was not a matter of deciding whether to\naccept the evidence of the Crown witnesses or the evidence of the appellant.The jury was instructed that if they believed the appellant they had to acquit;\nthat even if they did not believe the appellant, if his evidence left them with\na reasonable doubt they could not convict and; even if the evidence of the\nappellant did not leave them with a reasonable doubt they had to ask themselves\nwhether on all the evidence they were left with a reasonable doubt as to the\nguilt of the appellant. See: the transcript of the trial proceeding s May 19,\n2006 at pp.795‑796.The trial judge's total instruction was materially\nin compliance with the direction provided in R. v. W.(D.),\n1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742 (SCC).[88]The inconsistent statements of Mr. Duck were also reviewed by the trial\njudge. He pointed out that he permitted reference to the statement given by Mr.\nDuck to the appellant's counsel for purposes of allowing Mr. Duck an opportunity\nto refresh his memory.He also pointed out that he permitted the introduction\ninto evidence of a portion of a statement given under oath by Mr. Duck to the\npolice. He gave his reasons why he permitted the introduction of the statement\nfor the proof of its contents.He pointed out that Mr. Duck's evidence at\ntrial regarding time was different than that given in both statements and that\nat trial Mr. Duckwas not prepared say what time he left the appellant's\nproperty on the night of July 10th or the early morning of July 11th.[89]The trial judge reviewed with the jury the essential elements of the\noffence.He noted that the fact there was an armed robbery committed on the\nproperty of Mr. Frizzell was conceded.The charge against the appellant was\nthat he was a party to that offence or robbery by reason of the evidence that\nhe aided in its commission or he abetted its commission.[90]The theory of the Crown’s case was that there were a number of ways the\nappellant aided or led in the commission of the offence.(1)he supplied the gun;(2)he stole the truck and supplied the truck;(3)he provided camouflage clothing;(4)he informed the co‑accused as to the layout of Mr. Frizzell's\nresidence;(5)he provided the cottage as a staging area;(6)he was intending to share in the proceeds;(7)he burned money.[91]The trial judge emphasized with the jury that if they were not satisfied\nthe appellant did any of the above they should acquit the appellant.On the\nother hand, the trial judge instructed the jury that if they were satisfied the\nappellant performed any one of the above acts, they should find him guilty.[92]The trial judge reviewed the evidence surrounding each of the above\ninstances that could amount to aiding the co‑accused. in the commission\nof the offenceThis review of the evidence was adequate.(ii)Reasonableness of\nthe verdict[93]I have also considered the verdict with respect to its reasonableness of\nthe verdict and whether it can be supported by the evidence.To decide whether\na verdict is unreasonable or whether the verdict is supported by the evidence a\ncourt of appeal must determinewhether the verdict is one that a properly\ninstructed jury or a judge could reasonably rendered. The court of appeal does\nnot have the jurisdiction in assessing the evidence and reviewing the record at\ntrial to substitute its opinion of the evidence for that of the jury. See: R. v. Yebes, 1987 CanLII 17 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168 (SCC) and R. v. Biniaris 2000 SCC 15 (CanLII); [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381.[94]Ihave reviewed all the evidence, and I am satisfied the verdict is one\nthat a jury properly instructed could reasonably have reached. I am unable to\nconclude the verdict is unreasonable.The verdict of guilt is supported by the\nevidence.[95]There was evidence from all co‑accused that the appellant was\ninvolved in the planning of the robbery.There is no question his gun was used\nin the robbery. He knew all co‑accused, and he was the only one with\naccess to the cabin in York from where the robbery was staged.[96]While the appellant does not accept the evidence adduced against\nhim, the members of the jury did.Their verdict was reasonable, and it is\nsupported by ample evidence which establish the essential elements of the\noffence against the appellant.The verdict was also reached absent any errors\nof law. In the result, I would dismiss the appeal from the conviction and\nconfirm the verdict of the jury.Motion to Introduce Fresh Evidence(i)The motion[97]At the commencement of the appeal hearing, the appellant made a motion\nto introducefresh evidence.The evidence he applied to introduce was:(1)A handwritten statement by a Mr. Geoff Dobson dated December 1, 2005.(2)A memo from Sgt. Kevin Baillie of the RCMP to the attention of the\nappellant at the Renous Correction Center dated March 31, 2008, and attached to\nthe memo are two pages of handwritten notes made by Sgt. Baillie as the result\nof an interview he had with the appellant on August 1, 2004.(3)Notes or comments sent to the appellant by Sgt. Baillie January 13, 2012\nas the result of the appellant's inquiry as to notes of the interview Sgt.\nBaillie had with the appellant.(4)Handwritten notes of a Mr. Dennis Collins dated January 3, 2007 which\nstate that he was approached \"by an individual\" who inquired of him\nas they drove by the Frizzell property as to whether he wanted to join in doing\na robbery.The \"individual\" who is not identified in the statement\nsays he knew where the money was located inside the residence.[98]Pursuant to s. 683 of the Criminal Code, a\ncourt of appeal may receive evidence either taken orally or in written form,\nprovided it is in the interests of justice to do so. The test for the admission\nof fresh evidence and what is in the interests of justice is governed by four\nfactors as set down in R. v. Palmer, 1979 CanLII 8 (SCC), [1980] 1\nS.C.R. 759 at p. 775. They are:(1)The evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it\ncould have been adduced at trial provided that this general principle will not\nbe applied as strictly in criminal cases as in civil cases.(2)The evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive\nor potentially decisive issue in the trial.(3)The evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable\nof belief; and,(4)The evidencemust be such that if believed it could reasonably, when\ntaken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected\nthe result.[99]In a criminal case the due diligence requirement should not be relied\nupon to refuse to admit fresh evidence on an appeal if the evidence is\ncompelling, and it is in the interests of justice to admit it.See: R. v. Angelillo, 2006 SCC 55 (CanLII), [2006] 2 S.C.R. 728 (SCC), at paragraph\n15, cited in R. v. West 2010 NSCA 16 (CanLII), at paragraph\n31.[100]Also\nunder the fourth factor, the fresh evidence can only affect the result if it is\nadmissible under the normal rules of evidence. See: R. v.\nWest supra, at paragraph 34.[101]Applied\nto the fresh evidence tendered by the appellant for admission in this appeal,\nthe evidence does not meet the first criterion.It is not so compelling that\nit would be in the interests of justice to minimize the due diligence\nrequirement and admit the evidence.There is no evidence that the written\nnotes the appellant now seeks to introduce were unavailable to the appellant at\nthe time of his trial.The notes taken by Sgt. Baillie do not assist the\nappellant in establishing or addressing the issue that he raised the alibi\ndefence at an opportunity earlier than twoweeks prior to the trial.The\nnotes do not explain the appellant's whereabouts on the night of the robbery,\nthey do not mention anything about the attendance of Messers. Duck and\nHenneberry at his shop or evidence on the night of the robbery.Interestingly,\nthey mention that Mr. Mutch may have called the appellant to come pick him up\nwhen he became separated from Salman and Blackmore. This evidence is not\ncompelling evidence for a different verdict than that reached by the jury.[102]The\nevidence is not relevant and it is not credible. When taken with all the\nevidence at trial, it could not be expected to change the result.The evidence\nof the notes of Mr. Dobson constitute hearsay statements of what was told to\nhim by a Mr. Gallant. Under the normal rules of evidence, this evidence of Mr.\nDobson would be inadmissible as hearsay.The evidence of the notes of Mr.\nCollins are of no relevance.They are hearsay, and they do not even identify\nthe name of the individual involved.[103]In\nthe result, I would deny the application to admit the foregoing fresh evidence.(ii)Effective assistance of\ncounsel and miscarriage of justice[104]Although\nnot set forth with particularity in his notice of appeal, the appellanturges\nthe court to consider and adjudicate his appeal on the ground that he did not\nreceive effective assistance of counsel at trial.This request is somewhat\nrelated to the introduction of fresh evidence but again the particulars are\nabsent. The question is also related to the court’s consideration of the appeal\nunder ss. 686(1)(a)(iii) of the Criminal Code as to\nwhether the Court should set aside the verdict on the ground there was a\nmiscarriage of justice.[105]The\nappellant does not allege that the evidence which he seeks to introduce as\nfresh evidence and which is outlined above was not introduced as the result of\nthe incompetency of counsel.However, in the event this is the substance of\nhis argument, I am not prepared to overlook the due diligence prong of the test\nfor the introduction of the evidence and allow for its admission on the ground\nthat counsel was incompetent in not bringing it forward.[106]If\nthe assistance of counsel was ineffective and the evidence was not brought\nforward as a result, the court might consider this in the application of the\ndue diligence requirement which in a criminal case as I have stated is not\nalways crucial. The Court would also consider whether this was a factor\nresulting in a miscarriage of justice.See: R. v. G.D.B.\n2000 SCC 22 (CanLII); [2000] 1 S.C.R. 529, at paragraphs 17 to 22.[107]The\nappellant's complaint with the effectiveness of his counsel is that there were\na number of witnesses the appellant wanted brought forward to testify in his\ndefence and his counsel at trial did not bring them forward.Except for Mr.\nSean Henneberry, the appellant has never identified these individuals.[108]I\nhave read the transcript of proceedings before the trial judge on June 26,\n2006, the date initially scheduled for the sentencing hearing.At that time\nthe appellant's trial counsel made a motion to withdraw as counsel citing a\nbreakdown in the confidence between the appellant and himself. At this hearing\nthe appellant asked for an adjournment of his sentencing hearing, and the\nadjournment was granted by the trial judge.[109]I\nhave also read the transcript of the proceedings before the trial judge where\nthe appellant made a motion to have counsel appointed for him on sentencing.This motion was denied.[110]While\nthe appellant insists he did not \"fire\" his counsel, it is clear from\nthe appellant's submissions at these hearings the appellant had lost confidence\nin his counsel and counsel quite properly made the motion to withdraw.Also, I\nam unable to conclude the evidence the appellant referred to at these hearings\nand which he continues to refer to, was not brought forward as the result of\nthe ineffective assistance of his counsel at trial.[111]As\nfor the evidence of Mr. Henneberry, it would appear from the record that the\nproblem was contactingMr. Henneberry particularly when the appellant’s\ncounsel was only informed by the appellant of Mr. Henneberry’s presumed\nimportance a short time before the trial.Counsel did what he could to gain a\ncommitment from Legal Aid to pay for Mr. Henneberry's attendance provided his\nprecise whereabouts could be determined.Counsel acted reasonably and I am\nunable to say the evidence did not come forward as the result of his\nineffective assistance.[112]It\nalmost goes without saying that all accused persons have the right to effective\nassistance of counsel. It is a right protected by ss. 7 and 11(d) of the Charter.[113]If\ncounsel is ineffective, there is an impact on the fairness of the trial, the\nreliability of the verdict, and the fairness of the process employed to arrive\nat the verdict.Counsel's effectiveness or competency is measured by the\nstandard of reasonableness.What would be considered reasonable judgment on\nthe part of counsel? The objective of considering this issue on appeal is not\nto measure the performance or professional conduct. These are issues which do\nnot exist in this case and in any event if they did exist they are left to the\nprofessional regulatory body.See:R. v. G.D.B. supra,\nat paragraphs 23 to 29.[114]In\nthe result on this issue I have considered the assistance provided to the\nappellant by his counsel at trial. In every respect I can come to no other\nconclusion that the level of assistance more than meets any standard of reasonableness\nin terms of the decisions made in the course of the exercise of counsel’s\nprofessional judgment throughout the trial.Appeal from Sentence[115]The\nappellant was sentenced to 7 ½ years in a federal penal institution and given\ncredit of six months for time served in pre‑trial custody. He was\nsentenced, therefore, to serve seven years in a federal penal institution. The\nappellant's appeal from this sentence is grounded on the principle that the\ndisparity between his sentence and the sentences imposed on the co‑accused\nis so great that his sentence is unfit.[116]When\ninitially charged, the appellant was remanded into custody from July 30, 2004\nto August 27, 2004.He was released from custody and when taken into custody\nagain on November 1, 2005, he was convicted of unrelated charges under the Criminal Code. Although unrelated to the robbery of Mr.\nFrizzell’s home, the charges relate to an incident between the appellant and\none of the co-accused. These charges were: (i) breach of an undertaking\ncontrary to s-s. 145(3)(b); (ii) uttering threats contrary to s-s.264.1(1)(a);\nand (iii) assault contrary to s-s. 266(b). The appellant was subsequently\nsentenced to time served plus three years probation on all of these charges.[117]The\nappellant had a previouscriminal record.Date/Locationof SentenceOffenceSentence10 August 1987One (1)\nCount Assault with weapon,Custody: One (1) dayCalgary, Albertacontrary\nto Section 245.1(1)(a), CCCFine: $250.00One (1) Count Assault causing\nbodily harm,Custody: One (1) daycontrary to Section 245.1(1)(b),\nCCCFine: $250.0002February 1988One (1)\nCount Assault,Fine: $450.00Calgary,\nAlbertacontrary to Section 245, CCC17 April 1991One (1)\nCount Dangerous operationCustody: Sixty (60) daysCharlottetown,\nPEIof motor vehicle, contrary to Section249(1)(a), CCC31 May 1991One (1)\nCount Contempt of Court,Fine $200.00Charlottetown, PEIcontrary\nto Section 708(1), CCC03 January 1992One (1)\nCount Dangerous operation ofCustody: Sixty (60) daysCharlottetown, PEImotor\nvehicle, contrary to SectionOne year probation249(2)(a), CCC[118]The\nco‑accused waived their preliminary inquiries, entered guilty pleas and\nthey were given the following sentences:(1)Robert Ryan Mutch ‑ entered a guilty on August 27, 2004 and he was\nsentenced to 4 years in a federal penal institution.(2)David Christopher Salman entered a guilty plea on September 10, 2004 and\nhe was sentenced to 4 years in federal penal institution.(3)Stacey Reid Blackmore entered a guilty plea on November 10, 2004 and he\nwas sentenced to 6 years in federal penal institution.(4)David William MacDonald entered a guilty plea on August 3, 2005 and he\nwas sentenced to 4 years in a federal penal institution.[119]These\nsentences were imposed by judges sitting in both the Supreme Court and the\nProvincial Court.All the sentences resulted from joint recommendations made\nby the Crown and the co‑accused.[120]Convictions\nwere entered against the co‑accused and the appellant for being party to\na robbery with an offensive weapon, contrary to s. 343(d) of the Criminal Code. In 2006, when the appellant was sentenced,\ns. 344(a) of the Criminal Code provided that where\nthe robbery was committed with a firearm, the minimum punishment was four years\nin prison and the maximum punishment was life in prison.Section 344 has been\nsubsequently amended; however, those amendments are not relevant to this\nappeal.[121]As\nnoted above, three of the co‑accused were sentenced to the minimum\npunishment provided for at the time.Mr. Blackmore was sentenced to six years\nin prison. He had a more extensive criminal record than the other co-accused\nincluding the appellant.[122]After\nhearing submissions from the appellant who appeared without counsel at the sentencing\nhearing and after hearing counsel for the Crown, the trial judge provided\nreasons for the sentence he imposed.[123]As\nI noted earlier, the appellant's right to appeal from sentence is grounded in\ns. 675(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. This section provides\nthat with leave of the court the appellant has a right to appeal from the\nsentence imposed by the trial judge unless the sentence is one fixed by law or\nthe sentence is a mandatory minimum sentence.[124]The\nappellant's notice of appeal requests leave to appeal the sentence. I would\ngrant the appellant leave to appeal the sentence because the appeal from\nsentence is arguable, has merit and is not frivolous or vexatious.[125]In\naccordance with the provisions of ss. 687(1) of the Criminal\nCode, this Court should consider the fitness of the sentence appealed\nfrom. The parameters of this review have been stated many times by this Court\nand by the Supreme Court of Canada.[126]This\nCourt does not have the power to interfere with the sentence unless the\nsentencing judge made an error in principle.An error in principle occurs when\nthe sentencing judge fails to take into account a relevant factor; takes into\naccount an irrelevant factor; fails to give sufficient weight to relevant\nfactors; overemphasizes relevant factors and generally, when the sentencing\njudge commits an error of law.[127]Also\nwhen the sentencing judge imposes a sentence which is outside the normal range\nof sentence customarily imposed for a like offence, the appellate court has\njurisdiction to interfere. See: R. v. M. (C.A.),\n1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500.[128]At\nthe time of the appellant's sentencing in July 2006, s. 348.1 of the Criminal Code provided that the court, in imposing a\nsentence for a conviction under s. 343 of the Criminal\nCode in relation to an offence committed in a dwelling‑house,\nshall consider as an aggravating factor the fact that the house was occupied at\nthe time of the commission of the offence. Furthermore, the court was also\ndirected by the section to consider as an aggravating factor that the person\ncommitting the offence knew the house was occupied or was reckless in\nascertaining whether it was occupied. Finally, the court was required to\nconsider whether the person committing the offence used violence or threats of\nviolence in committing the robbery.[129]The\ntrial judge considered as an aggravating factor the fact that the robbery to\nwhich the appellant was party occurred in a home. The trial judge noted that an\nadditional aggravating factor was that there were people in the home at the\ntime of the offence and that the perpetrators knew those people were in the\nhome, or the perpetrators were reckless in determining whether the residents\nwere in fact at home. The trial judge also considered that violence or at least\nthreats of violence were used against the residents at the time of the\ncommission of the offence.[130]The\ntrial judge did not refer to any mitigating circumstances. I agree there were\nnone.[131]The\ntrial judge considered the range of sentences imposed for armed robbery in this\nprovince, and he applied the range of sentence provided for in R. v. Cullen 2000 PESCAD 16 (CanLII); [2000] P.E.I.J. No. 66,\nwhere the offender committed an armed robbery in a public place. The sentence\nimposed on Mr. Cullen was eight years in prison.[132]The\nrange of the sentence imposed by the trial judge is not an issue in this appeal.\nSuffice it to say that the range of sentences for the type of offenders similar\nto the appellant committing or being accessory to an offence committed in the\ncircumstances like the one he committed is in the range of eight to 10 years.\nSee: R. v. Matwiy, 1996 ABCA 63 (CanLII), [1996] A.J. No. 134; (1996), 105\nC.C.C. (3d) 251 (Alta C.A.).[133]The\nissue in the appellant’s appeal from the sentence is the disparity with the\nsentences imposed on the co‑accused, particularly, MacDonald.[134]In\nresolving the disparity in the sentences the trial judge stated as follows:The most recent and similar offences are this one.For the\nsame armed robbery for which Mr. Chappell is being sentenced, the other four\nparticipants all pleaded guilty, and they received sentences, which I'm going\nto state with the adjustment that was made for time served, and how that\nconverts, as far as I can interpret, based on the guilty plea.There's caselaw\nin this jurisdiction, and it is my practice ‑ it varies, depending on the\ncircumstances of the case ‑ a genuine guilty plea made sufficiently early\ncan often attract anywhere from 25% to a third off of what a sentence would be\notherwise.And there has to be adjustments for the level of involvement in the\nevent, and based on the criminal record of the offender.‑ Mr. Mutch, the young, youngest and the first to plead\nguilty, was sentenced to four years less time served. He had no criminal\nrecord.‑ Mr. Salman was sentenced the minimum of four years less\ndouble time served.‑ Mr. MacDonald was sentenced to four years less\ntime served.‑ Mr. Blackmore was sentenced to six years less time\nserved.After adjustment for the guilty plea, to try to make some use\nof those sentences, they range, in the case of Mutch and Salman, to something\nin the range of 5 and 3/4 years to Mr. Blackmore to something in the range of a\nlittle over 8 ½ years. I also reflected on the different level of involvement\nof those various participants.[135]In\npart, the trial judge resolved the disparity in the sentences on the basis that\nguilty pleas were entered by the co-accused and the appellant chose to plead\nguilty and proceed to trial. The trial judge concluded, generally speaking,\nthat he would reduce the normal range of sentence for a particular offence by\none-quarter to one-third should the offender enter a guilty plea. While the\nentry of a guilty plea is a mitigating factor in sentencing it is but one\nfactor having regard to all the other principles of sentencing. The weight to\nbe given to the entry of a guilty plea is not to be reduced to only a\nmathematical calculation; however, it is a significant mitigating factor in the\nimposition of a sentence.[136]Furthermore,\nit should always be borne in mind that an accused person is entitled to a trial\nand is entitled to have the Crown prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe entry of a plea of not guilty should not become an aggravating factor in\nsentencing.[137]The\ntrial judge did not err in principle when he considered that the entry of\nguilty pleas by the co-accused may have been a mitigating factor in the length\nof the sentences they received.[138]Pursuant\nto s. 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code \"… a sentence should be similar to sentences\nimposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar\ncircumstances; …\".This principle\nmust be considered in the context of an overriding principle that sentencing is\nan individualized process.[139]Thisprinciple, which cautions against disparate sentences, is again only one of the\nprinciples to be followed by the court in imposing a sentence.The fundamental\nprinciple of sentencing as provided for in s. 718.1 of the Criminal Code is that a sentence must be proportionate to\nthe gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\nFurthermore, s.718.2(a) of the Criminal Code\nprovides that a sentence should be increased or reduced having regard to the\naggravating and mitigating circumstances.[140]Keeping\nall the principles of sentencing in perspective, when sentences meted out for\nparticipation in the same offence are compared, it is not necessary that they\nbe equal because sentencing is an individualized process having regard to all\nthe principles of sentencing.Nevertheless, the sentences must be\n\"understandable\" in the context that in comparing them, a person does\nnot come away with a sense of injustice. See: R. v.\nDouglas, 1996 CanLII 666 (ON CA), [1996] O.J. No. 2091, at paras. 7 \u0026 8. (Ont. C.A.); R. v. F., 1982 ABCA 148 (CanLII), [1982] A.J. No. 731, at paras. 14 ‑16\n(Alta. C.A.); R. v. Sharpe, 2008 MBQB 227 (CanLII), [2008] M.J. No. 300;\n2008 MBQB 227, at para.12;R. v. Knife, 1982 CanLII 2569 (SK QB), [1982]\nS.J. No. 443, at para.13 (Sask. Q.B.);R. v. O'Keefe\n2007 NLCA 58 (CanLII); [2007] N.J. No. 323, at paras. 26 to 33. The different sentences\nmust be \"rationally explicable.\"See:Ruby: Sentencing\n7th ed.[141]Naturally\na convicted person with the more onerous sentence will feel thatjustice has\nnot been done.That is not the test.The test is whether, considering all the\nprinciples of sentencing, the sentence imposed on the offender appealing the\nsentence is fit.[142]In\nsome respects, the appellant and Mr. MacDonald are like offenders.They were\nboth the master minds of the crime carried out by Messrs. Mutch, Salman and\nBlackmore. Their roles in the commission of the offence are similar.MacDonald’s criminal record is more serious and more extensive than that of the\nappellant.[143]In\nthis appeal there is a disparity between the sentence of four years imposed on\nMr. MacDonald and seven and one‑half years imposed on the appellant.The\ndisparity must be supported on the basis of all the principles and objectives\nofsentencing, and not only the fact that the co-accused entered guilty pleas.[144]The\nsentences imposed on the co-accused, particularly MacDonald would appear, at\nfirst glance, to be inadequate and unfit. On closer examination, however, it\nshould be noted that the sentences meted out to the co-accused were imposed as\nthe result of joint recommendations from the Crown and the accused. Neither the\ntrial judge nor this court has any knowledge of the background and the factors\nwhich entered into the agreement between the Crown and the accused to present\njoint recommendations to the sentencing judges.Furthermore neither does this\nCourt have, nor did the trial judge have, knowledge of the factors which the\nvarious sentencing judges took into consideration when deciding to adopt the\njoint recommendations.[145]A\nsentencing judge must give a joint recommendations respect and consideration.As well, if the joint recommendation is rejected the sentencing judge must give\nreasons as to why it was not suitable for acceptance.See: R. v. Hatt 2002 PESCAD 4 (CanLII); (2002), 163 CCC (3d) 552. While\nthe sentences imposed on the co-accused appear to be outside the range for\nthose types of offenders committing the offence of robbery, they must be\nconsidered in the context of all the circumstances including the fact that the\nsentences were imposed as the result of joint recommendations.[146]The\ntrial judge was not bound to accept these sentences in the sense that he was\nbound to impose a similar sentence on the appellant.He was obligated to\nconsider those sentences and attempt to achieve some parity; however, he was\nalso bound to consider the remaining principles and objectives of sentencing\nand impose a sentence on the appellant which was adequate and fit for his\ninvolvement and participation in the offence.[147]In\naddition to his guilty plea, MacDonald and the other co-accused cooperated with\nthe police.They testified against the appellant.This would justify a\nreduction, below the normal range, in the sentence imposed upon all the\nco-accused including MacDonald. See: R. v. Hewlett\n(2002), 2002 ABCA 179 (CanLII), 167 C.C.C. (3d) 425.Also see: R. v. O'Keefe\n2007 NLCA 58 (CanLII); [2007] N.J. No. 323.[148]The\naggravating factors applicable to the participation of the appellant in the\ncommission of the offenceare serious.The plan to undertake the robbery was\nmade initially at his home and then staged from a property to which he, among\nthe co‑accused, had sole access. The firearm used in the commission of\nthe offence belonged to the appellant.The appellant was instrumental in\nstealing the vehicle used by Messrs. Salman, Mutch and Blackmore in carrying\nout the robbery.These are aggravating factors which serve to increase the\nsentence imposed on the appellant. The appellant also committed crimes after\nthe offence.[149]Considering\nall the objectives and principles of sentencing, the sentence imposed on the\nappellant is a fit sentence. I would not vary the sentence even though it is\nsignificantly more severe than the sentences imposed on the co‑accused.CONCLUSION[150]In\nconclusion, I would dismiss the appellant’s appeal from the guilty verdict\ndelivered by the jury.The verdict was not made as the result of a wrong\ndecision on a question of law, it is reasonable and can be supported by the\nevidence, and it was not made as the result of a miscarriage of justice.[151]I\nwould also dismiss the appellant’s appeal from the sentence._____________________________________Justice\nJohn A.

DawsonThe Respondent not represented and not appearingMEMORANDUM OF\nDISPOSITIONWells, C.J.N.L.:[1]The Crown seeks leave to appeal, in part, the sentences imposed on the\nrespondent on February 3, 2006.The appeal is taken by the Crown solely for\nthe purpose of setting aside the probation order, that was part of that\nsentence, on the basis that it is now invalid.The respondent consents to the\nappeal.[2]Section 731 of the Criminal Code permits a probation order to be\nmade where a court decides to suspend the passing of sentence, or to be made in\naddition to fining or sentencing to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two\nyears.This Court has previously determined, in R. v. Hendrix (1999),\n1999 CanLII 13907 (NL CA), 176 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 293, 137 C.C.C. (3d) 445 and affirmed in R. v.\nRenouf (2001), 2001 NFCA 56 (CanLII), 206 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 67, 160 C.C.C. (3d) 173, that the\ncombined effect of section 731 of the Criminal Code and subsection\n139(1) of the Corrections and Conditional Releases Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20\nis that “[i]n a circumstance where a second sentence is imposed, while an\nearlier sentence imposed upon the offender remains unexpired, the two are to be\ntreated as one sentence which commenced on the date that the first sentence was\nimposed and ends on the date that the last sentence to be served would expire\nin the ordinary course”.Where that unexpired “one sentence” exceeds two\nyears, a probation order may not be imposed, and any probation order that may\nhave been properly imposed, in respect of any prior sentence that is a\ncomponent part of the “one sentence”, becomes invalid.[3]On February 3, 2006 the respondent was convicted of breaches of sections\n139(2), 145(1)(a), 264.1(1), and 145(5.1)(b) of the Criminal Code.In\nrespect of those convictions he was sentenced to a total of 2 years\nimprisonment.It was also ordered that he be placed on probation for 2 years\nfollowing release from that term of imprisonment.On June 28, 2006, at Moncton,New Brunswick, the respondent was convicted of breaches of sections 348(1)(b),\n430(4) and 145(5) of the Criminal Code.In respect of those convictions\nhe was sentenced to a total of 2 years and 7 months imprisonment, consecutive\nto the sentence then being served.[4]The deemed “one sentence”, that results from those convictions and\nsentencing, exceeds 24 months.For the reasons expressed above, the probation\norder that was made on February 3, 2006, while valid at the time that it was\nmade, became invalid when the second sentence was imposed on June 28, 2006.[5]Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed and the\nprobation order made on February 3, 2006 is set aside. In all other respects\nthe sentences imposed on that day remain unchanged.Wells, C.J.N.L."}

(Oral):Titus William\nCharlie is before the Court to be sentenced for three offences.The first\ncharge is a charge of sexual assault committed on the 19th of April,\n2005.The second and third charges are breaches of undertaking committed on\nthe 30th of June and the 25th of July, 2005.[2]With respect to the\nsexual assault offence, it appears that Mr. Charlie was in the Whitehorse\nPublic Library.Another of the persons in the library was a woman, who was\nunknown to Mr. Charlie.The woman was bending over to hand her child a book\nwhen Mr. Charlie reached between her legs and touched her vagina.She screamed\nand Mr. Charlie desisted.She told him to stay where he was and he did so\nwhile the woman summoned the police.When the police arrived, Mr. Charlie\nadmitted that he had touched the woman.[3]The other two\noffences, the breach charges, arose while Mr. Charlie was on release conditions\nawaiting the Court's dealing with the sexual assault charge.During the bulk\nof that time, Mr. Charlie was residing at the Adult Resource Center in Whitehorse.On two occasions he was found intoxicated by alcohol in breach of a\nno alcohol clause in his undertaking.Mr. Charlie has entered guilty pleas\nwith respect to all three offences.[4]It must be noted that\nalthough some months have passed, I am satisfied that the pleas are, in fact,\nto be treated as having been given at the earliest opportunity.Mr. Charlie\nattempted to dispose of the matters earlier, but was not able to do so as the\nissue of his fitness to stand trial had been raised and, not surprisingly, the\nCourt declined to accept the plea until the issue had been resolved and Mr.\nCharlie was found fit.[5]Once that issue had\nbeen resolved, Mr. Charlie entered his pleas and the matter proceeded with one\nfurther delay, which was the preparation of a pre-sentence report, which I am\ntold by Ms. Reid was not ordered at the behest of the accused.Suffice it to say\nthat, as I began by saying, that the guilty pleas can be considered as having\nbeen offered at the earliest opportunity.[6]Mr. Charlie is now\nsome 43 years of age.He has a very long and persistent record.However, it\nmust be noted at once that none of these offences are for a crime in any way\nrelated to the sexual assault.[7]From the circumstances\nof the sexual assault, it was to me, no particular surprise to learn from the\npre-sentence report and the fitness report and psychological reports filed that\nMr. Charlie suffers from a substantial degree of organic brain damage.It\nappears that this is the cumulative result of many years of very serious\nalcohol abuse, some head injuries and a brain injury which may have been\nsecondary to a hypoglycaemic episode two or three years ago.Whatever the\ncause or combination of causes, the result is a man who is clearly prone to act\nimpulsively and in an antisocial manner, absent close supervision.[8]In these\ncircumstances, the Crown submits that there should be a combination of a\nconditional sentence of four months followed by a year or more of probation, with\nthe principal requirement being that Mr. Charlie reside throughout at the ARC\nwhere he can be, in fact, closely monitored and supervised.[9]Ms. Reid submits that\nsuch a disposition would be an inappropriate use of criminal sanctions.Mr.\nCharlie's management, she says, is a social issue best left to and dealt with by\nthe health and welfare authorities.The flaw in this argument, of course, is\nthat Mr. Charlie is not before the health and welfare authorities, he is before\nthe criminal court having been found guilty of three criminal offences.I am\nsatisfied that her preferred option, which I can best describe as the option of\ndoing nothing, is not an option.[10]In the first place,\nsexual assault is a serious offence and the cases are clear that court\ndispositions must denounce such conduct.Moreover, Mr. Charlie's antecedents\nand the circumstances of the principal offence strongly suggest that there is a\nrisk that he will do such a thing again.For these reasons, I am satisfied\nthat a custodial sentence is warranted.However, there are two considerations\nthat remain.[11]Firstly, Mr. Charlie\nhas already served some 34 days in custody and is entitled to credit for that.It must also be mentioned that for some of the period, while Mr. Charlie was\nnot actually in custody at WCC, he was on release under conditions which Ms.\nReid, with not much hyperbole, described as house arrest and the strictness of\nthose release conditions is certainly a factor that the Court can consider.[12]The other factor is\nthat although a custodial sentence is warranted, given the type of offence and\ngiven the risk of repetition, that there appears to be good reason to believe\nthat a conditional sentence may be adequate, provided, as the pre-sentence\nreport says, that the sentence incorporates a structured and supervised living\nfacility.[13]Taking into account\nthe circumstances of the offences and taking into account the requirements of\nkeeping some control over this offender, I have come to the following\ndetermination with respect to disposition.[14]On the two charges of\nbreach of undertaking, Mr. Charlie, you are sentenced to a period of one day in\naddition to time already served.[15]On the charge of\nsexual assault, you are sentenced to a period of imprisonment of three months.That sentence, however, will be served conditionally, on conditions that I will\ncome back to.[16]Following the\ncompletion of the conditional sentence, you will be subject to a probation\norder for a further period of nine months.Again, I will return to the\nconditions.[17]Before reviewing those\nconditions I should mention one additional matter raised by Ms. Reid on behalf\nof the offender.She submitted that imposing conditions on Mr. Charlie, in effect,\nsimply sets him up for failure through breach of those conditions.I am\nprepared to grant that; there may be some degree of truth in that so far as it\ngoes.Unfortunately, I must also take account of the fact that failing to\nimpose conditions would just as likely set Mr. Charlie up for failure through\nthe commission of further offences which might not be breaches but might be\nsubstantive offences, which would hardly be a better situation for him.It\nwould certainly set up society to have to deal with the consequences of those\noffences.[18]With respect to the\nconditional sentence order, the conditions will be, Mr. Charlie:1.That you will keep the\npeace and be of good behaviour.2.You will report to the\nCourt as and when required.3.You will report\nforthwith to a conditional sentence supervisor and thereafter as directed.4.You will remain within\nthe jurisdiction of the Court unless given advance permission in writing by the\nconditional sentence supervisor to go outside of the Yukon Territory.5.You will notify the\nconditional sentence supervisor in advance of any change of name or address;\npromptly notify him of any change of occupation or employment.6.You will reside at the\nAdult Resource Centre or such other place as the conditional sentence\nsupervisor will specify.7.You will obey all\nrules of your residence from time to time.8.You will not possess\nor consume alcohol or controlled drugs or substances, except in accordance with\nthe prescription given to you by a duly qualified medical practitioner.9.You will provide\nsamples of breath or urine for testing on demand by a Peace Officer or by your\nconditional sentence supervisor.10.You will take such\npsychological or other assessment, treatment, counselling or programming as the\nconditional sentence supervisor will direct.11.You will take such\nalcohol assessment, treatment or counselling as the conditional sentence\nsupervisor will direct.12.You will have no\ncontact directly or indirectly with S.M.[19]With respect to the probation order:1.You will keep the\npeace and be of good behaviour.2.You will report to the\nCourt as and when required.3.You will report to a\nprobation officer within two working days after the order comes into force and\nthereafter as directed.4.You will advise the\nprobation officer in advance of any change of name or address and promptly\nnotify him of any change of occupation or employment.5.You will reside at\nsuch place as the probation officer will direct and obey all rules of your\nresidence from time to time.6.You will not possess\nor consume alcohol or controlled drugs or substances except in accordance with\nthe prescription given to you by a duly qualified medical practitioner.7.You will provide\nsamples of breath or urine for testing on demand by a Peace Officer or your\nprobation officer, provided, however, that either of those persons has\nreasonable grounds to believe that you have such substances in your body\ncontrary to the order.8.You will take such\ncounselling and programming as directed.9.You will have no\ncontact directly or indirectly with S.M.[20]I take it that the\nCrown is also seeking a DNA order and a registry order.[21]MS. DUNCAN:Yes,\nI neglected to -- I believe the DNA order is mandatory, but the other one is\ndiscretionary.We would be -- the prohibition -- the weapons prohibition, one\nis a discretionary order and so I just invite the Court to consider it and make\nno submissions.[22]THE COURT:Well,\nlet us -- I had not mentioned weapons but let us deal with these one at a\ntime.The DNA order, do you have any submissions on that, Ms. Reid?[23]MS. REID:No,\nYour Honour, I believe it is mandatory.[24]THE COURT:Yes.With respect to that, there will be an order whereby you will provide samples\nof bodily substances sufficient for the purpose of DNA analysis and banking.Now, is this also caught by the Sex Offender Registry Legislation?[25]MS. REID:I\nthink there is some discretion with that, Your Honour.[26]MS. DUNCAN:Unfortunately,\nI do not know that answer to that, if it could be stood down for five minutes I\ncould find out.[27]THE COURT:All\nright. We will take five to do that.[28]MS. DUNCAN:Thank\nyou.(Proceedings adjourned)(Proceedings\nreconvened)[29]MS. DUNCAN:Yes,\nYour Honour, I apologize for the delay.Section 271 is a designated offence\nunder s. 490.011 and pursuant to s. 490.012 the Crown does make an application\nfor an order and requirements for Mr. Charlie to comply with the Sex\nOffender Information Registration Act for the applicable period.Because\nthis matter was proceeded with summarily, that would be 10 years from the date\nof sentence, from today.[30]MS. REID:Your\nHonour, unless I challenge the validity of the section -- or I challengeunder\nthe constitution, which no one has at this point has done; I certainlydo not\nthink Mr. Charlie wishes me to do so, I do not think I have any groundsfor\nopposing this.I think it does not make any provision for makingany kind of\nsubmissions at all.The only concern I have, Your Honour, is thatsomeone\nescort him there to ensure that he actually gets to the centre anddoesn't\nforget about it, because the penalty for not getting there andregistering is a\nminimum six months on the first offence.[31]THE COURT:Now,\nMr. Hyde will put that on his to do list.[32]MR. HYDE:I\nwill see that it will happen, Your Honour.[33]THE COURT:All\nright.Now, Ms. Reid, you are not quite correct to say that the order is\nautomatic unless you challenge the constitutionality.There is a provision\nthat I need not make the order if the person establishes that the impact on\nthem would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest to be gained by\nhaving them register -- I take it you are not in a position to do that.[34]MS. REID:Your\nHonour, I mean I just think, as Mr. Hyde indicated, I mean, people knowwhere\nTitus is almost on a daily basis.He is often in RCMP cellssleeping it off.He is not someone anyone is going to have to go looking for and byhaving his\naddress registered -- he has no fixed address other than the ARC for thenext\nlittle while; where he is going to be after that, I do not know.So I do not\nknow what they have for people who have no fixed address.Theusefulness of\nthis kind of a tool for this particular clientele or for the majority ofsex\noffenders I have yet to understand, but I guess it would be like thefirearms\nregistry.[35]THE COURT:In\nany event, the order will go under s. 490.012, requiring Mr. Charlie to comply\nwith the provisions of the Sex Offender Information Registration Act.[36]MS. REID:I\nguess the one thing, Your Honour, is that it does label him.Someone who has\nnever had a sexual offence in their whole life, you all of a sudden havea\nlabel on them.I think that it does have an adverse impact onanybody.All of\na sudden you are on a national registry as a sex offender for touchingsomebody\nbetween the legs on one occasion in your whole 43 years, and now youhave that\nbig label and that stigma attached to you every time someone pulls youup.So\nI guess in that way I think that the impact on him is prettydisproportionate\nto the use this has to society here.[37]THE COURT:Well\nI guess it might be helpful if you make you argument before I give the order\nrather than afterwards but --[38]MS. REID:I\napologize, Your Honour.I mean I just -- I was thinking about itand had a\nchance to digest it and I guess I think that label, because the peoplethat we\nhear about on a daily basis, like that they have leprosy or something,are\npeople who are convicted of sexual offences.You can beat someoneup black and\nblue and you do not have a horrific label attached to you, people do not\nimagine horrific things about you, but if you have that designationattached to\nyour name in any way shape or form, you are labelled by society.[39]THE COURT:Well,\nit need not become a public spectacle when he is registered.So I have not\nbeen persuaded that I should not make the order.[40]The other remaining\nmatter would be an application or at least a consideration of whether there\nshould be a firearms prohibition.This man's record and the circumstances of\nthis offence would not incline me towards making that order.[41]THE CLERK:And\nthe victim fine surcharges, Your Honour?[42]THE COURT:The\nsurcharges will be waived.________________________________FAULKNER\nC.J.T.C."}

D.G.C.Date: 1992-10-05Docket: 1992 No. C.B. 777; 1992 No. C.B. 846Between:Her Majesty The QueenandD.G.C.Her Majesty The QueenandD.G.B., also known as D.G.C.Woolridge, J.Counsel:John Brooks, for the Crown;Paul Davis, for the accused.[1]Woolridge, J., [orally]: The accused pleads guilty to incest with\nhis sister and a breach of Undertaking.[2]The agreed evidence of the victim (taken from the Preliminary\nInquiry with the consent of defence counsel) shows that the accused at age 20\nbecame a child molester of his own 10 year–old sister when he commenced full\nunwanted sexual intercourse with her for a two–year period, between the ages of\n10 to 12. Over this two–year period these assaults took place three to four\ntimes a week. Over the two years this means there were more than 400 such\nincestuous assaults. They voluntarily ceased in 1990 before police\nintervention.[3]The accused has an unfortunate history of family abuse and\nneglect. Following the death of [his] father he became the “man of the house”.\nIt is sad to relate that this is about the same time that this abuse of his own\nsister began.[4]He is classified at least in the presentence report as a sexual\ndeviant due to this and other sexual relations with a cousin.[5]He has Grade 11 and is currently 23 years of age. He has an\nunrelated record as a young offender and there is evidence that he has an\nalcohol problem and has had one since the age of 15. Nevertheless he is\nconsidered an appropriate candidate for supervised probation.[6]There is evidence from the presentence report and the Victim\nImpact Study that the 14 year–old victim has suffered psychological problems\nwhich may very well affect her ability to relate to people in the future\nbecause of the shocking abuse she has suffered in her own bed and in her own\nhome. Her childhood innocence has been stolen from her by this accused.[7]While the presentence report is sceptical, the accused accepts\nresponsibility for the great damage he has done and he tells me that he is\nremorseful. Accordingly I will try to create a judgment that appropriately\npunishes this offender and offers some protection to the victim and bearing in\nmind the great benefit of the guilty plea which removes the trauma of the\nvictim giving evidence in court.[8]On the breach of undertaking charge the accused is sentenced to\ntime served.[9]On the incest charge the accused is sentenced to imprisonment for\na period of 18 months. The duration, in large measure, is to allow ample time\nfor the accused to receive counselling, perhaps at the Bishop’s Falls\nCorrectional Centre, for sexual deviancy and possible alcoholism as mentioned\nin the Presentence Report. If this treatment is successful perhaps we will\navoid dealing with a repeat offender.[10]In addition, the accused is placed on probation for a period of\nthree years under the following conditions:1. to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and appear\nbefore the court when required to do so by the court;2. to report to and be under the supervision of a probation\nofficer;3. to have absolutely no contact whatsoever with C. or S.M.C.\nat St. Paul’s or elsewhere;4. to follow the instructions of the probation officer with\nrespect to any counselling after release for sexual deviancy or alcoholism.[11]The correctional authorities are requested to provide whatever\ncounselling for whatever of these deficiencies as may be available.[12]Finally, under s. 100(1) of the Criminal Code there will\nbe a ten–year firearms prohibition after discharge of the accused from incarceration.\nAccused sentenced."}

B.AppellantDirk Derstine and Daniel Stein, for theappellantDena Bonnet and Lisa Joyal, for therespondentHeard:March 8, 2011On appeal from the conviction entered byJustice Robert M. Thompson of the Superior Court of Justice, dated December10, 2002 and from the sentence imposed by Justice Thompson, dated June 30,2006.By the Court:[1]The appellant appeals his conviction and\nsentence. Following a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of two counts of\nhistorical sexual assault and sentenced to an indeterminate period of\nincarceration as a dangerous offender.Conviction Appeal[2]In oral argument, the appellant focussed on the\nsentence appeal. Counsel relied upon the factum with respect to the appeal\nagainst conviction. We dismiss that appeal for the following reasons.[3]The trial judge did not\nerr in admitting the facts read in on the appellant’s guilty pleas in relation\nto sexual offences against five other boys as similar fact evidence. The\nevidence was properly admissible to prove that the sexual assaults occurred. Although\nhis reasons for concluding that the probative value of this evidence outweighed\nits prejudicial effect were limited, his ruling was not undermined by any legal\nerror or misapprehension of material evidence and was\nnot unreasonable.[4]The trial judge also did not err in admitting\nreply evidence by the Crown. The appellant raised the defence of alibi for the\nfirst time during his testimony. Given the late notice and expansive nature of\nthe alibi defence, the Crown had no option but to call rebuttal evidence and\ndid not improperly split its case by leading evidence that directly supported\nthe allegations. Although one of the witnesses in reply made an utterance which\ncorroborated a complainant’s evidence, the Crown could not have anticipated\nthat she would do so. Neither that statement nor the testimony of the other civilian\nreply witness prejudiced the appellant.[5]We also reject the submission that the\ndetective’s evidence in re-examination on reply that in his experience an\naccused who presented an alibi usually did so at the time of the investigation\nwas an improper attack on the appellant’s credibility. It followed questions by\ndefence counsel during the cross-examination about the reasonableness of the\ndelay in disclosing the alibi and the right to silence. It was a brief, general\nstatement to respond to the issue raised by the defence and was not oath\nattacking evidence in these circumstances. In any event, defence counsel at\ntrial did not object to this evidence and did not request any form of limiting\ninstructions.[6]We do not give effect to the grounds of appeal\nagainst conviction.Sentence appeal[7]The appellant does not dispute that he met the\ncriteria for a dangerous offender designation. Rather, he submits that the\nsentencing judge erred by failing to make a long- term offender (LTO) order in\nplace of the dangerous offender designation.[8]The appellant submits that the sentencing judge\nerred in his approach to issues involving anti-androgen medication and the role\nof the National Parole Board, and by ignoring important evidence relating to\nthe reasonable possibility of the eventual control of the appellant’s risk in\nthe community. He also seeks to admit fresh evidence regarding his suitability\nto take sex drive reducing medication.[9]A LTO order is available only if there is a\nreasonable possibility that an offender’s risk can be addressed and eventually\ncontrolled in the community – supervised during the currency of the LTO\nsupervision order and unsupervised at the completion of the order. The\nstatutory scheme contemplates a dangerous offender designation, and not a long-term\noffender order, where a sentencing judge is not satisfied that this criterion has\nbeen met.[10]As a 43-year-old acknowledged alcoholic and\nhomosexual pedophile with a criminal record for nine sexual offences, the\nappellant poses at least a moderate to high risk to re-offend if released into\nthe community. While the appellant has shown some willingness to deal with his\nproblems and has responded well to treatment in a structured environment, he\nhas re-offended each time he has been released from prison, even while on\ncommunity supervision. The experts agreed that sex drive reducing medication,\ntaken by a willing and motivated patient, as part of a treatment plan, could\nreduce the risk of re-offending.[11]We do not agree that the trial judge’s reasoning\nwith respect to the appellant’s potential for treatment with sex drive reducing\nmedication was “tainted with legal and factual error” for the following\nreasons.[12]The sentencing judge rightly understood that the\nparole board could order that a LTO take medication as prescribed by his\nqualified medical practitioner, but that a psychiatrist could not administer\nmedication if consent was withdrawn either capriciously or reasonably, based\nupon potential side effects. The sentencing judge noted that a condition\nrequiring an offender take medication as prescribed was not the same as a\ncondition that would ensure that an offender could be released only if he was,\nin fact, taking the medication. The sentencing judge found that without the\nmedical component of any treatment and release plan, the appellant was bound to\nre-offend. There was ampleevidence to support such a finding.[13]The sentencing judge did not materially misapprehend\nthe process or the ability of the parole board to deal with any breach of a LTO\ncondition. It may well be possible to fashion a condition to ensure that the\nappellant could be released only if taking the medication as initially\nrecommended by a psychiatrist. However, the sentencing judge recognized that\nthere are many factors which independently make the successful enforcement of a\ncondition requiring that the appellant continue to take medication problematic.\nThe sentencing judge found that he lacked reasonable assurance that the medical\ncomponent of the controls would be implemented and enforced. Further, the\nappellant would not be found in breach of such a condition under s. 753.3(1) of\nthe Criminal Code if he had a reasonable excuse for\nrefusing to take the prescribed medication.[14]In these circumstances,\nthe sentencing judge did not err by focussing on\nwhether the appellant would consent to take the medication. The evidence of the\nappellant’s attitude towards treatment was a factor that was highly relevant to\nthe assessment of risk. Given the circumstances of this case, where the risk is\ncreated by a life-long condition, and controlling the risk is premised to a\nsignificant extent, if not entirely, upon the appellant’s willingness and\ncapacity to take the medication, both during the currency of and potentially following\nthe expiry of any LTO supervision order, the judge was appropriately concerned\nwith whether the evidence specific to this offender demonstrated a sufficient motivation,\ncommitment, and capacity to take the medication on an ongoing basis.[15]The sentencing judge did not ignore evidence of\nthe appellant’s motivation for change. The appellant had responded well to\nprograms while incarcerated and had expressed a willingness to take the\nmedication to his defence expert. Nonetheless, the appellant did not testify\nand there was limited evidence regarding the appellant’s willingness and\ncapacity to take the medication.[16]In the end, the sentencing judge found that the\nevidence that the appellant could be treated with sex drive reducing medication\namounted merely to hope and speculation that his risk to children could be\ncontrolled if he were released back into the community. Reading the reasons as\na whole, it is clear that the sentencing judge understood and applied the\ncorrect test of whether there was a reasonable possibility of eventual control\nin the community of the appellant’s risk to re-offend. He made no error in\nprinciple and his findings were supported by the evidence.[17]Although the fresh evidence provides further\nevidence of the appellant’s physiological suitability to start the medication\nand of his taking of test doses, it does not go far enough to demonstrate his\nsuitability and his genuine motivation to do so, particularly on a longer term\nbasis.[18]Despite the additional evidence related to the\nside-effects of the medication, the evidence is clear that both the\nside-effects and patient tolerance of the side-effects are highly variable.[19]Further, the appellant did not provide an\naffidavit as part of the fresh evidence application, nor, other than the test\ndoses, has he begun actually taking the medication.[20]As we have said, the appellant’s risk is created\nby a life-long condition and controlling that risk is premised almost entirely\nupon his willingness and capacity to take the medication on a long-term basis.\nIn the circumstances, in our view, the fresh evidence simply does not go far\nenough to demonstrate the appellant’s motivation, commitment, and capacity to\ntake the medication on an ongoing basis.[21]Accordingly, we not satisfied that the fresh\nevidence could reasonably have affected the outcome of the dangerous offender application.[22]As a result, we conclude that the sentencing\njudge did not err in declaring the appellant to be a dangerous offender or in\nfinding that he did not meet the criteria for a long-term offender designation.\nThe appeal from conviction and sentence is therefore dismissed.RELEASED:April 27, 2011“JS”“Janet\nSimmons J.A.”“Paul\nRouleau J.A.”“Karakatsanis\nJ.A.”"}

The offenders' child, SM, was\nborn at the Moncton City Hospital on December 4, 2009. In the first month of\nhis life he lived with his parents and at times his mother's four‑year‑old\nson, AM, in Amherst. Ms. Maloney shared custody of AM with his father. On December\n29, SM's mother took him to the Cumberland Regional Hospital in Amherst, where\nhe was examined and it was decided to send him to a hospital in Moncton, NB. It\nappears that SM suffered a seizure at the Amherst hospital, although the doctor\nwas unable to make a definitive diagnosis. The notes on the hospital record\ninclude the words \"abuse\" and \"infection.\" However, the\nattending physician did not see signs of trauma, and said the chest x‑ray\ndid not show anything acute. He observed bruising on the face. SM suffered\nanother seizure on the way to Moncton.[3]On arriving in Moncton, SM was\nexamined again. Dr. Heidi Carlson testified that she was not sure what had\nhappened, but that SM was gravely ill. She observed bruising on his face,\nscratches, a bloody lesion on the side of his nostril and spots of bleeding in\nhis eyes. There was a scratch on the back of one of his knees. As he was on his\nback when she examined him, she did not observe whether there were any injuries\non his back. She suspected a traumatic event, although SM's parents said they\nhad not witnessed any trauma and denied leaving the child in the care of anyone\nwho could have caused it. She said his condition suggested \"shaken baby\nsyndrome.\" Neither the doctor in Amherst nor the ambulance attendant\nobserved the extent of bruising reported in Moncton.[4]Suspecting possible child abuse,\nDr. Carlson had SM transferred to the IWK Children's Hospital in Halifax, NS.\nHe was admitted to the IWK on December 30, 2009, with seizures, difficulty\nbreathing, bruising, a skull fracture, hematomas and hypoxic ischemia. The\nparents had no explanation for the injuries. Dr. Kim Blake was qualified as an\nexpert in pediatrics, with subspecialities in neurology, non‑accidental\nhead injuries and developmental medicine. In her report, she provided the\nfollowing summary:At the age of 25 days, [SM] was found to have substantial\nsubdural hemorrhages, a generalized hypoxic‑ischemic brain insult,\nretinal hemorrhages and extensive facial and bodily bruising.There is no available history of significant accidental trauma\nthat occurred prior to [SM's] presentation to hospital on December 29th, 2009.\nTo date, medical testing is not suggestive of any underlying medical illness in\nS.M., which might account for the above findings. S.M. does not have a\ncoagulopathy (bleeding problem). Medical evaluation to date cannot explain his\nskull fracture, subdural hemorrhage, brain injury, bruising, and retinal\nhemorrhages.In the absence of a history of significant accidental trauma,\nthe constellation of unexplained subdural hemorrhage with associated hypoxic\nischemic insult to the brain, cavitation within the brain, retinal hemorrhages,\nunexplained bruising, and skull fracture in an infant with limited mobility\nlead to my diagnosis of recent and older inflicted trauma (non‑accidental\ninjury) in [SM].[SM's] head injury and the hypoxic ischemic insult that he\nsuffered involved a significant portion of the cortical or higher centers in\nthe brain which are typically responsible for executive functioning, cognitive\nprocessing and motor commands. There is significant concern for [SM's] visual system\nas he is having problems with fixing and following objects. Because [SM] is\nstill young and the brain is in the early stages of development, [SM's] long‑term\nprognosis is not clear. Possibilities range from severe cognitive as well as\nphysical disability (such as blindness and cerebral palsy), to a more benign\noutcome consisting of problems such as learning and language delay with or\nwithout motor handicaps. His prognosis will only become clearer over time.[5]Dr. Ellen Wood also saw SM at the\nIWK. She was qualified as an expert in pediatrics, with a subspecialty in\nneurology, non-accidental head injury and developmental medicine. She testified\nabout the degree of swelling and the timing of the event that would have caused\nthe swelling. She said:Q. Having regard to your observations as to the status of the\nswelling, based on the CT that, the CAT scan that you had seen, are you able to\nsay when the event that would have led to the swelling would have occurred, the\noutside parameters? Is this the, what I'm referring to is that seven days,\nwhether or not we are now in a different time frame.A. Absolutely. No I mean the swelling was there. It was a great\ndeal of swelling. It clearly got worse, which necessitated the baby having to\ngo on a ventilator. So at the absolute outset, I don't see that this could have\nbeen more than, than three days and I think that would, I think it was less\nthan three days.Q. And that's the event that led to the swelling?A. Yes.[6]In my reasons at trial I concluded\nthat SM suffered a severe head injury and that this trauma occurred no more\nthan – and likely less than – three days before Dr. Wood examined him. During those three days, SM\nhad been in the care and custody of one or both parents, aside from a period of\ntime on December 27 when his parents went to Moncton, leaving him in the care\nof Karen Chapman, Mr. Chapman's mother. There was no suggestion, and no\nevidence, that anything untoward happened to SM during this time. There was\nevidence that upon his parents' return, SM was crying a lot, and Mr. Chapman\ntried to soothe him by rocking him. SM then fell asleep.[7]Three possibilities were suggested\nas the cause of SM's injuries: (1) that he was injured as a result of two\nincidents that occurred during his birth; (2) that the offenders together, or,\nmore likely, his father, shook him, and his mother, being aware of the\nsituation, took no steps to protect him; or (3) that his step‑brother,\nAM, who was then four years old, caused the injury while neither parent was\npresent.[8]SM's parents, and other family\nmembers who were present, claimed that at his birth there were two unusual\nincidents: first, that SM began to appear before the attending doctor was\nready, and he pushed SM back into his mother, and second, that when SM emerged\nthe second time, the doctor mishandled him and his head struck a pan that was\nbeing used in the delivery. The attending doctor and an attending nurse\ntestified that neither incident occurred, and the hospital record of the\ndelivery discloses no report of either incident. In any event, Dr. Wood\ntestified that the trauma that caused the injuries could only have occurred\nwithin the previous three days, and likely less time than that. They could not\nhave arisen from events at birth.[9]As to the other two possibilities\nfor the cause of SM's injuries, there was no evidentiary basis upon which to\ndetermine which had occurred. The offenders claimed that the injuries occurred\nat birth, or were caused by AM.The evidence established that AM had a\nhyperactive and rambunctious personality. The Crown maintained that the\noffenders assaulted SM and were attempting to blame AM in order to avoid\nresponsibility. Since both parents denied seeing SM struck by anyone, if AM had\ncaused the injuries, it would have to have been at a time when the parents were\nnot present, very possibly due to a temporary lapse of supervision.[10]I concluded that either\ncircumstance – direct infliction of the injuries, or failure to\nproperly supervise AM – would make out the offence of failing to provide the\nnecessaries of life to a person under their charge. I therefore found it\nunnecessary to determine which scenario had actually occurred.Law[11]The offenders were convicted under\ns. 215 of the Criminal Code, which provides, in part:Duty of persons to provide necessaries215(1) Every one is under a legal duty(a) as a parent, foster parent, guardian or head of a family,\nto provide necessaries of life for a child under the age of sixteen years;(b) to provide necessaries of life to their spouse or common‑law\npartner; and(c) to provide necessaries of life to a person under his charge\nif that person(i) is unable, by reason of\ndetention, age, illness, mental disorder or other cause, to withdraw himself\nfrom that charge, and(ii) is unable to provide himself\nwith necessaries of life.Offence(2) Every one commits an offence who, being under a legal duty\nwithin the meaning of subsection (1), fails without lawful excuse, the proof of\nwhich lies on him, to perform that duty, if(a) with respect to a duty imposed by paragraph (l)(a) or (b),(i) the person to whom the duty is\nowed is in destitute or necessitous circumstances, or(ii) the failure to perform the duty\nendangers the life of the person to whom the duty is owed, or causes or is\nlikely to cause the health of that person to be endangered permanently; or(b) with respect to a duty imposed by paragraph (1)(c), the\nfailure to perform the duty endangers the life of the person to whom the duty\nis owed or causes or is likely to cause the health of that person to be injured\npermanently.[12]Pursuant to s. 215(3)(a), a person\nconvicted \"is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment\nfor a term not exceeding five years.\" In this case, Ms. Maloney and Mr.\nChapman were convicted on the basis that even if they did not themselves\ninflict the injuries, a prudent person in their circumstances would have been\naware of the risk that an active four‑year old could pose to an infant,\nand that their supervision of the children was deficient to the degree that it\namounted to an offence under s. 215. There was no specific finding as to how\nthe injuries actually occurred. In particular, the evidence did not establish\nthat either accused inflicted the injuries.Sentencing principles[13]The principles of sentencing are\nset out at ss. 718‑718.2, which provide, in part:Purpose718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute,\nalong with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the\nmaintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions\nthat have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing\noffences;(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the\ncommunity; and(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and\nacknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.....Fundamental principle718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the\noffence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.Other sentencing principles718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into\nconsideration the following principles:(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for\nany relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or\nthe offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,(i) evidence that the offence was\nmotivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin,\nlanguage, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual\norientation, or any other similar factor, or(ii) evidence that the offender, in\ncommitting the offence, abused the offender's spouse or common‑law\npartner,(ii.1) evidence that the offender, in\ncommitting the offence, abused a person under the age of eighteen years,(iii) evidence that the offender, in\ncommitting the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to\nthe victim,(iv) evidence that the offence was\ncommitted for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a\ncriminal organization, or(v) evidence that the offence was a\nterrorism offenceshall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on\nsimilar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;(c) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined\nsentence should not be unduly long or harsh;(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less\nrestrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances;....[14]There is an issue in this case as\nto whether the court should impose a conditional sentence of imprisonment. The\nconditions necessary for a conditional sentence are set out at s. 742.1 of the Criminal\nCode:If a person is convicted of an offence, other than a serious\npersonal injury offence as defined in section 752, a terrorism offence or a\ncriminal organization offence prosecuted by way of indictment for which the\nmaximum term of imprisonment is ten years or more or an offence punishable by a\nminimum term of imprisonment, and the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment\nof less than two years and is satisfied that the service of the sentence in the\ncommunity would not endanger the safety of the community and would be\nconsistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in\nsections 718 to 718.2, the court may, for the purpose of supervising the\noffender's behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the\nsentence in the community, subject to the offender's compliance with the\nconditions imposed under section 742.3.[15]On behalf of Ms. Maloney it is\nsubmitted that a conditional sentence is available for the present offence. She\nstates that s. 215 does not constitute a \"serious personal injury\noffence\" as defined in s. 752, for which a conditional sentence would not\nbe available. Section 752 provides, in part:\"serious personal injury offence\" means(a) an indictable offence, other than high treason, treason,\nfirst degree murder or second degree murder, involving(i) the use or attempted use of\nviolence against another person, or(ii) conduct endangering or likely to\nendanger the life or safety of another person or inflicting or likely to\ninflict severe psychological damage upon another person,and for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for\nten years or more....[16]Section 215 provides for a maximum\nsentence of five years. As such, the offence is not a \"serious personal\ninjury offence\" that would be excluded from the conditional sentencing\nregime.Pre‑sentence ReportsLacy Maloney[17]Ms. Maloney was born on February 5,\n1990. She was raised by her mother and grandmother. She became pregnant at 14\nyears of age, and her son, AM was born when she was 15. She reported to the\nprobation officer that her relationship with AM's father was an abusive one.\nShe met Mr. Chapman in December 2008, and they moved in together in April 2009.\nShe said Mr. Chapman was a good stepfather to AM. Their son SM was born on\nDecember 4, 2009.[18]Ms. Maloney reported that she\ncompleted grade 12 and that she was Student Council President in high school,\nthat she taught dance and played several sports while she was in school. She\nsaid she had enrolled in an Early Childhood Studies program after high school,\nbut had not actually done the program because of her concerns about the\npresence of AM's father, with whom she reported repeated problems, including\nphysical assaults. She worked part‑time at Tim Horton's before moving to\nPugwash.[19]Kristen MacDonald, the social\nworker involved in the child protection case in relation to SM, reported to the\nprobation officer that \"on her own, Ms. Maloney was generally\nunderstanding and cooperative,\" but that \"often after their meetings,\nher partner would return to oppose everything that had been discussed.\"\nShe was concerned that \"Ms. Maloney's passive demeanour coupled with her\npartner's aggressive and controlling presentation could indicate a high risk\nfor domestic violence.\" She believed that Ms. Maloney \"did not appear\nto fully appreciate the extent of [SM's] injuries.\" She noted, however,\nthat Ms. Maloney \"behaved very appropriately during her supervised access\nvisits with her children and made significant effort to engage and bond with\nthem.\" The probation officer indicated that there are \"possible\nmental health issues\" with Ms. Maloney, and recommended a mental health\nassessment. She also wrote that Ms. Maloney seems to have \"inadequate\ninsight into the gravity of her son's injuries.\"Mitchell Chapman[20]Mr. Chapman was born on December\n17, 1989. He grew up living with his mother and stepfather in the Amherst area,\nalso spending periods in foster care and living with other relatives after\ngetting in trouble with the law. He lived in Alberta for a period around the\nage of 15, then returned and ultimately was incarcerated in the Nova Scotia\nYouth Facility. His schooling was sporadic, but he indicated in an interview\nfor his pre‑sentence report that he completed the requirements for grade\nten while incarcerated. His employment has also been sporadic, mainly\nconsisting of labour and service jobs beginning at the age of 12 or 13, as well\nas an apprenticeship with a pump business as part of his release plan from the\nYouth Facility, which did not lead to employment due to shortage of work.[21]Mr. Chapman met Ms. Maloney when\nhe was 19 years old. They began dating, and after six months he moved in with\nher and her four‑year‑old son, AM, when AM was in her custody. SM\nwas born eight months later.[22]As a youth, Mr. Chapman was\nsentenced three times to probation. The charges included assault, assault\ncausing bodily harm with a weapon, resisting a peace officer and breach of\nundertaking. In 2007 he received a total sentence of some 300 days at the youth\nfacility on charges of uttering threats, robbery, breach of undertaking, and\ndrug trafficking.[23]The pre‑sentence report\nrefers to a conversation with Kristen MacDonald, the social worker assigned to\nthe child protection case involving SM, who described Mr. Chapman's demeanour\nas \"highly volatile and stated that he'd been non‑compliant and\nverbally aggressive with her and other staff on a regular basis.\" She took\nthe view that Mr. Chapman's \"oppositional attitude toward Child Welfare\nhas limited his ability to act in the best interest of his son.\"\nSimilarly, Trina Pederson, an educator at the Nova Scotia Youth Facility, reported\nthat Mr. Chapman had \"anger management issues as well as problems with\nauthority.\" While she found that he \"seemed to like that he could\ninfuriate people,\" she also said that they had built \"a good\nrelationship with clear boundaries and expectations,\" and that despite his\n\"difficult presentation, she enjoyed working with him and was happy with\nhis successes.\" The probation officer also spoke to Mike Sears, Mr.\nChapman's stepfather, who believed that Mr. Chapman had anger management\nissues, but that he was maturing, and said that he \"can be defensive and\nmouthy but he does not consider [him] to pose a threat to anyone.\"[24]The pre‑sentence report\nindicates that areas of concern with Mr. Chapman include \"mental health\nissues of an unspecified nature,\" possibly including anxiety, Attention\nDeficit Disorder, Hyperactivity Disorder, and anger management deficits. The\nprobation officer recommended a complete mental health assessment and\nparticipation in any recommended treatment, and noted that Mr. Chapman appears\nto view himself as a victim in the present situation.[25]Both Ms. Maloney and Mr. Chapman\ncontinue to deny responsibility for SM's injuries, and to assert that they\nshould not have been convicted. They reported feelings of ostracization in the\ncommunity as a result of the present charges, to the extent that they moved\nfrom Amherst to Pugwash.ArgumentsThe factual basis for\nsentencing[26]This case raises a somewhat\nunusual consideration in respect of the circumstances of the offence,\nparticularly with respect to the mental element. If the offenders struck SM,\nthen they intentionally caused the trauma that resulted in his injuries. Few offences\nwould be more horrifying than parents deliberately striking a newborn infant of\nless than a month of age and causing injuries as severe as those suffered by\nSM. However, the same level of denunciation would not be warranted where the\ninjury occurred due to a momentary lapse in supervision or failing to take all\nthe necessary steps to prevent AM from having unsupervised access to SM. In\nview of SM's age and AM's personality and behaviour, the failure to ensure SM's\nsafety amounted to a failure to provide the necessaries of life, but did not\ncarry the degree of condemnation that would arise from the parents directly\nassaulting SM.[27]Where there are disputed facts\ngoing to sentence, \"[i]f the Crown does not call adequate evidence to\nestablish the more aggravated circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt, then the\naccused's version is to be accepted, unless there is some manifest reason why\nthat interpretation is contrived or erroneous\": R. v. Ewanchuk,\n2002 ABCA 95 (CanLII), at para. 22, application for leave to appeal dismissed, 2003\nCarswellAlta 249 (S.C.C.); R. v. Gobin (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Man.\nC.A.), at para 5. Speaking more broadly, where the facts are unclear, the court\nmust sentence on the basis of the version of the facts most favourable to the\noffender: R. v. Cardinal, 2007 ABCA 46 (CanLII) at para. 8. In R. v. Gardiner,\n1982 CanLII 30 (SCC), [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368, Dickson J. (as he then was), for the majority, remarked\nthat a guilty plea amounted to no more than \"an admission of the essential\nlegal ingredients of the offence,\" and any additional aggravating facts\n\"must be established by the Crown. If undisputed, the procedure can be\nvery informal. If the facts are contested the issue should be resolved by\nordinary legal principles governing criminal proceedings including resolving\nrelevant doubt in favour of the offender\" (414‑415.) Similarly, in R.\nv. Bruyere (1987), 49 Man. R. (2d) 288 (Man. C.A.), an appeal of a sentence\nof eight years for manslaughter, Huband J.A. said, for the majority, at para.\n2:We do not know the scenario of facts which led the jury to its\nverdict of manslaughter. Several views of the evidence are possible. The\nlearned trial judge shows the worst scenario in reaching his decision to impose\nan 8‑year sentence. In a case where other interpretations of the evidence\nare equally plausible, we think a more moderate view should have been followed\nand which would have resulted in a more modest sentence. The learned trial\njudge is not required to accept a fanciful version of facts favourable to and\nsuggested by the accused. But where it is impossible for judge or jury to\ndetermine the precise manner in which death occurred, which is the case here,\nit is not open to the sentencing judge to base his sentence on that version\nwhich is most detrimental to the accused.[28]This is a situation where the\noffenders' specific conduct has not been established. It was established beyond\na reasonable doubt that their conduct fell below the standard required by s.\n215, but there was no specific finding as to how SM's injuries occurred, and,\nparticularly, there was no finding that his injuries were inflicted by either\nparent. As such, they can only be sentenced on the basis of the lowest degree\nof culpability that their convictions encompass.Positions of the Crown\nand defence[29]The Crown seeks significant\ncustodial sentences for both offenders. Several cases are provided in support\nof the Crown's argument that conditional sentences are not available in these\ncircumstances, and that incarceration is required.[30]In R. v. J.M.B., 2005 NLTD\n121 (CanLII), the offender was convicted of failing to provide the necessaries of life\nto her two‑month‑old daughter. She waited over two days before\nseeking medical attention for a severe head trauma after the child had been\nleft alone with her husband, resulting in permanent brain damage to the child.\nShe was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment followed by 18 months' probation\nwith conditions. Rejecting a conditional sentence, the sentencing judge said,\nat para. 17:... I am not satisfied that serving the sentence in the\ncommunity would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of\nsentencing that I outlined earlier on. It would not meet the objectives of\ndenunciation and general deterrence, although I do acknowledge that a community‑based\nconditional sentence can, in the right circumstances, meet those objectives.\nHowever, in this case, I am satisfied that a period of incarceration in Her\nMajesty's Penitentiary is required to send the appropriate message of\ndenunciation and deterrence....[31]In R. v. Barry, 2003\nCarswellNfld 7 (Nfld. Prov. Ct.), the accused, a 19‑year‑old single\nmother of two children, delayed two days seeking medical attention for her\ninfant daughter's broken arm, which was established to be due to an assault,\nalthough it was not proven that the accused caused it. The mother was sentenced\nto six months' imprisonment. The sentencing judge found that her omission to\nact was purposeful, and that she knew that the child was in pain and needed\nmedical attention. The failure to act was a morally reprehensible omission,\ninvolving a conscious choice to allow her daughter to suffer.[32]In R. v. Foote, 2005 NLTD\n211 (CanLII), the accused failed to seek prompt medical assistance for non‑accidental\nhead injuries suffered by his eight‑week old daughter, which resulted in\nbrain damage, cerebral palsy, and a smaller head size. The accused was\nsentenced to eleven‑and‑a‑half months' imprisonment, the\nsentencing judge holding that a conditional sentence would not sufficiently\nsatisfy the objectives of denunciation and general deterrence, nor properly\naddress the accused's moral blameworthiness (paras. 60‑69). Counsel for\nMs. Maloney argues that Foote is distinguishable due to the day‑long\ndelay in seeking medical assistance after the child's condition was observed by\nothers, and by the slow method of taking the child to hospital by ferry, rather\nthan to a nearby medical centre.[33]The Crown cites R. v. G.S.J.,\n2007 NBPC 21 (CanLII), where the parents were convicted of failing to provide the\nnecessaries of life to their five‑year‑old daughter. After several\nmonths' involvement by the Ministry of Family and Community Services, a social\nworker found the child weakened, crying and dishevelled and lying in a fetal\nposition, with a broken arm and wrist, and with bruises and abrasions. The\nparents denied guilt, and it was not established that they inflicted the\ninjuries. The sentencing judge said, at para. 34, 37:The importance of sedulously preserving, promoting and\nprotecting the traditional relationship between a dependent child and parent\ncannot be overstated. It is the most important social bond that we share in a\ncivilized society, the result of which is a trust of the highest order. Its\nimportance is never higher than when a very young child such as D.J., who was\nat five years of age at the time, is involved. At such a young age the child's\ndependency upon her parents is virtually complete whether it is viewed from the\nphysical, economic, social or psychological standpoint. A breach of trust by a\nparent or parents in failing to carry out any of the fundamental legal duties\nowed a young child in such circumstances is especially serious.....Cases that fall into the category of failing to provide the\nnecessaries of life thereby endangering life while requiring judges, as all\nsentence hearings do, to consider all the principles of sentence share a\nspecial focus on denunciation and general deterrence in determining an\nappropriate sentence.[34]The court declined to impose a\nconditional sentence, reasoning that such a sentence \"would not pay due\nregard to the important principles of denunciation and deterrence. It would not\nadequately recognize the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offenders. It would not acknowledge the harm done to the\nvictim by their collective inaction as parents. The request for a conditional\nsentence is denied\" (para. 52). The parents were each sentenced to eight\nmonths' imprisonment followed by one year's probation. Counsel for Ms. Maloney\nsubmits that the facts in G.S.J. disclose much more egregious conduct by\nthe parents than the present case does. For example, the father admitted on\ncross‑examination that the child had been kept out of school for two\nweeks in order to conceal her condition.[35]The Crown relies on R. v. Grant,\n2009 NBPC 17 (CanLII), where the accused pleaded guilty to failing to provide the\nnecessaries of life to her mother, who was found by paramedics sitting in her\nown waste, with gangrenous wounds on her legs, arms and buttocks and suffering\nfrom profound malnutrition and dehydration. She was admitted to palliative care\nand died four days later of heart failure. The accused was the victim's sole\ncaregiver and did not take her for follow‑up appointments after she was\ndiagnosed with peripheral vascular disease. She was not seen by a doctor until\nshe was admitted to hospital. The accused was employed and had no criminal\nrecord. Sivret Prov. Ct. J. sentenced the accused to 4 years' imprisonment,\nrejecting her claim of limited mental ability. The facts in Grant – involving prolonged abuse of the offender's elderly\nmother – were more aggravated than those in this case, and Grant\nis of limited assistance here.[36]Generally speaking, the cases\ncited by the Crown are distinguishable. They involve prolonged abuse, as in Grant,\nor deliberate delays in obtaining medical assistance in order to avoid blame\nfor the injuries, as in J.M.B., Foote, and Barry.Neither\ncircumstance is established in this case. This, however, is not to minimize the\nseriousness of a parent's failure to perform the duties owed to an infant in\ntheir care, as noted in G.S.J.Ms. Maloney[37]The Crown seeks a sentence of 25\nmonths incarcerations for Ms. Maloney. The Crown asserts that Ms. Maloney\n\"knows who hurt SM and is covering for herself or someone else,\" or\n\"does not know and has caused the injuries by her failure to properly\nsupervise SM.\" As I have made clear, the first scenario was not\nestablished, and the sentence will be imposed in accordance with the second\nscenario, which carries a lesser degree of culpability. The Crown also says the\nmother's blaming AM for SM's injuries will lead to \"feelings of incredible\nguilt\" in AM as he gets older as a result of the type of \"rumour and\ntalk\" that occurs in small communities.[38]The severity of SM's injuries are\nalso an aggravating factor. In this respect, the Crown speaks of the injuries\nas permanent ones, including the loss of the two frontal lobes so that memory,\nspeech, coordination, and decision‑making abilities all \"stand to be\nseverely affected\" and the child will need \"continuous life long\nsupport from both family members and the government.\" The evidence does\nnot allow this degree of conclusiveness. The medical evidence is to the effect\nthat SM suffered potentially life‑threatening injuries, and there was\nbrain damage, but that it is too early to assess the longer‑term effects.\nThis conclusion appears to be supported by a consultation report by Dr. Monique\nTaillon of the Stan Cassidy Centre For Rehabilitation in Fredericton, NB, dated\nApril 23, 2012. Dr. Taillon noted that SM had \"made significant gains\nsince I last saw him\" but \"cautioned that there might be subtle\nlearning issues that would only become evident when he was older.\"[39]A similar conclusion was reached\nby Dr. Heidi Carlson, who was called by the Crown at the sentencing hearing. On\ncross‑examination by counsel for Ms. Maloney, Dr. Carlson said:Q: And so although he doesn't have the verbal skills at this\ntime, he has certainly shown an ability to communicate. Correct?A: Yes.Q: And now to be clear, you would agree that there were other\npossible causes of his speech delay, but based on his brain injury, you viewed\nthat as the most likely reason for the speech delay. Correct?A: Yes.Q: So at this point, there is certainly a possibility that he\nwill continue to improve in his speech, and may have regular speech at some\npoint in the future?A: Yes, because the brain has the capacity to heal, so the\ninjuries that he sustained, it may allow for the development.Q: Okay. And in terms of vocabulary, when you were learn, when\nyou were referring to vocabulary when discussing matters with Ms. Nurse, what\nyou were talking about is his own speaking vocabulary. Correct?A: Right.Q: So you weren't referring to his comprehension vocabulary,\nwere you?A: No.Q: And you would agree that his comprehension vocabulary is\nactually quite high at this point, isn't it?A: Well, I wouldn't necessarily say high, but it's certainly\nwithin the norm for his age.Q: So in terms of the milestones for a child of [S's] age, and\n[S] is approximately two and a half years now, if I suggested to you that he is\nmeeting all milestones but for his spoken communication, would you agree with\nthat?A: I would.[40]Ms. Maloney's counsel submits that\nit was clear from her testimony that if AM accidentally caused SM's injuries,\nhe was not at fault. It is also submitted on her behalf that SM's injuries have\nseverely impacted her life, and that of her family. These events have also\nallegedly caused Ms. Maloney to be isolated and ostracized in the community,\nand have attracted publicity; counsel cites Clayton Ruby's comment, in Sentencing,\n6th edn., that \"[m]ere appearance in a public forum together with the\nfinding of guilt undoubtedly has serious consequences to anyone,\"\nparticularly a first offender (see §5.189).\nAll that being said, I put little weight on the aspects of publicity and\nisolation as a factor in sentencing. They are not unique to this particular\noffence or offender.[41]With respect to general\ndeterrence, Ms. Maloney cites R. v. Da Silva, [2005] O.J. No. 2389 (Ont.\nSup. Ct. J.), affirmed at 2005 CanLII 46380 (ON CA), 203 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. C.A.), where Watt J. stated\nthat a first sentence of imprisonment, especially for a first‑time\noffender, should be as short as possible and tailored to that offender's\ncircumstances, rather than imposed solely for the purpose of general\ndeterrence\" (para. 91).Conditional sentencing[42]The basic principles governing\nconditional sentences in cases of this kind were reviewed in R. v. J.R.B.,\n[2003] N.J. No. 9 (Nfld. Prov. Ct.), where Gorman Prov. Ct. J., in the course\nof refusing a conditional sentence, said, at paras. 36‑38:In R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61 the Supreme Court of\nCanada set out a two‑stage test that is to be applied. The first stage\ninvolves a consideration of whether or not the statutory prerequisites exist,\nincluding a determination that serving the sentence in the community would not\nendanger the safety of the community. The second stage of analysis requires a\ndetermination of whether or not the sentence would be consistent with the\nfundamental principles of sentencing. Proulx clearly points out that there are\nno classes of offences which are exempt from conditional sentences.In R v. Wells, 2000 SCC 10 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 207 the Court held that\nat the second stage of analysis the court must undertake a \"comprehensive\nconsideration\" of the principles of sentencing set out in sections 718‑718.2\nof the Criminal Code.I conclude that Ms. J.R.B. does not constitute a danger to the\npublic. However, this is not conclusive. As pointed out by the Newfoundland and\nLabrador Court of Appeal in R. v. Carroll (2002), 2002 NFCA 1 (CanLII), 207 Nfld. \u0026\nP.E.I.R. 317, at paragraph 6, \"While the appellant may not be a danger to\nthe community at large, additional factors are relevant in determining whether\na conditional sentence is warranted.\"....[43]In arguing for a conditional\nsentence for Ms. Maloney, counsel points out that the first requirement of s.\n742.1 – that the offence is not subject to a minimum\nsentence, or to a maximum sentence of ten years or more – is met. This is correct. She argues that the cases\ncited by the Crown, with the exception of the distinguishable Grant,\ninvolve sentences of under two years, so there is no basis in the authorities\nto impose a sentence of two years or more. For the reasons discussed earlier, I\nam satisfied that the caselaw does not support a sentence of greater than two\nyears in the present circumstances. Having regard to all the circumstances,\nincluding the degree of culpability upon which the sentence is to be\ndetermined, I am satisfied that a custodial sentence of one year is\nappropriate.[44]Counsel submits that there is no\nreason to believe that for Ms. Maloney to serve her sentence in the community\nwould endanger the safety of the community. In particular, Ms. Maloney has no\nhistory of violence and she has complied with conditions governing contact with\nher children. Her pre‑sentence report would suggest that she would have\nbeen regarded as a person of good character. Taking all of these factors into\naccount, I am not satisfied that permitting her to serve her sentence in the\ncommunity would be likely to endanger the safety of the community.[45]Finally, it is necessary to\nconsider whether a community‑based sentence for Ms. Maloney is contrary\nto the purpose and principles of sentencing. While a conditional sentence in\nthe community is generally perceived to be less onerous than actual\nimprisonment, it must be recalled that a conditional sentence served in the\ncommunity is nevertheless a custodial sentence. While permitted to live in her\nown residence and continue her employment or education, the offender is subject\nto restrictions on her liberty, and a breach of those conditions may result in the\noffender serving the remainder of the sentence in prison.[46]The use of community‑based\nsentences in cases of this kind was considered in R. v. Beaudry, 2006\nONCJ 577, 2006 CarswellOnt 9641. In that case, the mother of a seven‑month\nold child delayed taking him to the hospital upon discovering that his head was\nswollen, fearing that she would be blamed for the injury. There was evidence\nthat he might have been hit on the head with a toy by another child. Harris J.\naccepted a joint submission of a conditional sentence, stating, at paras. 33‑34\nand 38‑39:I note that pursuant to section 718.01 and paragraphs\n718.2(a)(ii.1) and (iii), I must treat the fact that this offence involved both\na breach of trust and the abuse of a child under the age of 18 years as\naggravating factors and that I must give primary consideration to the\nobjectives of denunciation and deterrence of such conduct. I note also however\nthat the Supreme Court of Canada has expressly said that a conditional sentence\n\"... is also a punitive sanction capable of achieving the objective of\ndenunciation and deterrence.\" (See Proulx, supra at page\n468).A similar finding was made in R. v. Lawson [2001] O.J.\nNo. 1562 (Ont. S.C.J. per Hill J.) where a conditional sentence was imposed in\na case of breach of trust arising out of sexual activity between a court escort\nofficer and a female prisoner. In that case, Hill J. accepted that \"The\ndominant sentencing principles applicable are denunciation and general\ndeterrence.\" After considering all the circumstances however, and the\nreasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada in Gladue and Proulx, he\nconcluded that, \"Denunciation of the offender's conduct and general\ndeterrence can both be served by the imposition of punitive conditions.\"....Valerie Beaudry, age 28, is appearing before the court for the\nfirst time. Her crime is a serious one. It is serious enough to warrant a\nperiod of imprisonment in the range proposed to me. Ms. Beaudry did not injure\nher son herself. She was not aware of the severity of his injuries. That being\nsaid, I note that she breached her very sacred trust as a parent when she\nfailed to take him to hospital, and put him at risk of very serious\ncomplication arising from his injuries. While Jacob is currently making good\nprogress, it is still too early to know the long‑term consequences of\nthis offence. Ms. Beaudry's reasons for breaching her trust and committing this\noffence included a fear of what Family and Children's Services would do. This\nis no excuse for what she did. I am more sympathetic however to the fact that\nshe was also intimidated by her abusive boyfriend who told her not to go to\nhospital with the child. This too does not legally excuse Ms. Beaudry but it is\na mitigating factor. Other mitigating factors include her guilty plea and her\nextensive involvement in counselling and psychiatric treatment over the past 20\nmonths.Taking into account these facts and those expressed throughout\nthese Reasons for Sentence, I am in agreement that this is an appropriate case\nfor the sentence of imprisonment to be served in the community. This is the\nposition taken by both Crown Counsel and counsel for Ms. Beaudry, and concurs\nwith that of the author of the pre‑sentence report.[47](It appears that Harris J. also\nfound it necessary to consider s. 718.2(e), which requires the court to\nconsider all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in\nthe circumstance for all offenders, with particular attention to the\ncircumstance of aboriginal offenders.) Conditional sentences were also imposed\nfor s. 215 offences in R. v. Campbell, [2005] O.J. No. 3642 (Ont. Sup\nCt. J.) and R. v. Guimond, 2010 MBPC 33 (CanLII). Campbell involved a\nfailure to adequately supervise a child, resulting in the child falling from a third‑floor\nwindow, being rendered paraplegic, and ultimately dying. The father received a\none‑year conditional sentence for failing to provide necessaries. Guimond\nalso involved injuries to a child resulting in death, when the child was\nleft temporarily unsupervised while the accused used the bathroom and fell down\na steep flight of stairs. The accused had a related record, including a prior\nconviction for assault causing bodily harm against the same child and his\nsister. After double credit for 90 days pre‑trial custody, the offender\nreceived a sentence of 18 months conditional, followed by three years\nprobation.[48]A conditional sentence was denied\nin R. v. Peterson, [2005] O. J. No. 4450 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal\nrefused at [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 539, where a son failed to provide the\nnecessaries of life to his father. The majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal,\nper Weiler J.A., affirmed the custodial sentence, with the qualifier that this\ndid \"not mean that a conditional sentence may not be appropriate in some\ncases. When a trial judge decides to impose or not impose a conditional\nsentence, the judge engages in a discretionary exercise that is entitled to\nconsiderable deference\" (para. 58). Borins J.A., dissenting in part, would\nhave substituted a conditional sentence.[49]Ms. Maloney provided a written\nstatement to the court. She stated, in part:The past 2 1/2 years have been\nincredibly long and stressful. Mitchell and I have lost both of our children,\nand it tears us apart inside. AM and SM is everything to us and always will be.\nWe know that we will never get our kids back and that is the most hurtful\nsituation that we have in our heads and hearts every day. We would love to\nstill go to our visits and have a relationship with AM and SM.[50]In many ways this is likely the\nstrongest deterrence possible from any sentence this court imposes.[51]Counsel for Ms. Maloney seeks a\nconditional sentence in the range of nine to eighteen months. Alternatively,\nshe suggests a sentence of three to six months' custody, a position supported\nby Barry, supra, R. v. Ward, 2007 ONCJ 333, and R. v.\nJ.R.B., [2003] N.J. No. 9. She notes that Grant is the only case\nreferenced by the Crown in which a sentence of more than one year in custody\nwas imposed, and it is distinguishable for reasons already discussed.[52]Counsel also cites R. v.\nChittamath, 2008 ONCJ 444 (CanLII), which was affirmed at 2009 ONCA 239 (CanLII). It should\nbe noted, however, that the Ontario Court of Appeal found that the sentence in\nthat case was manifestly unfit, and would have substituted a much longer\ncustodial term but for the fact that the sentence was already served, and that\nfresh evidence answered \"to a considerable extent the trial judge's\nconcern about the respondent's failure to appreciate the gravity and\nseriousness of her crime\" (paras. 5‑6). This case cannot be taken as\nauthority for a short custodial sentence, but it is distinguishable in terms of\nthe extent of the injuries and the fact that the injuries led to death.[53]This is not a case where the\nparent has been proven to have directly caused the injury, to have deliberately\ndelayed seeking medical treatment for the child, or to have mistreated or\nneglected the child over an extended time period. Rather, all that has been\nproven is that the parents failed to provide the necessaries of life. For the\nreasons previously outlined, this sentence is imposed on the basis of the\nrelatively lower degree of culpability associated with a temporary lack of\nsupervision, as compared to direct infliction of the injuries by the offenders\nthemselves. I am not satisfied that a prison sentence is required for purposes\nof denunciation or general deterrence. I believe these purposes can be met with\na conditional sentence for Ms. Maloney. Accordingly, Ms. Maloney shall serve a\nsentence of one year in the community, followed by two years' probation.Mr. Chapman[54]With respect to Mr. Chapman, the\nCrown notes his continued denial of responsibility for SM's injuries, and his\napparent belief that those injuries are not significant or long‑lasting.\nThe Crown notes Mr. Chapman's criminal record, which includes crimes of\nviolence, and argues that his pre‑sentence report leads to the conclusion\nthat it is unlikely that \"anything short of a lengthy period of\nincarceration will deter [him] from re-offending.\" The Crown seeks a\nsentence of 48 months incarceration for Mr. Chapman. As with Ms. Maloney, the\nCrown appears to premise its position on the belief that Mr. Chapman caused the\ninjuries directly, but I cannot sentence on that basis. I also note that, while\nthe pre‑sentence report raises questions about Mr. Chapman's likelihood\nof re‑offending and the possibility of domestic violence (of which there\nwas no evidence before the court), Mr. Chapman is being sentenced on the basis\nof failure to adequately supervise AM, resulting in injuries to SM.[55]In considering whether a\nconditional sentence is available for Mr. Chapman, the first two criteria – lack of a minimum sentence, and the absence of a\nmaximum sentence of ten or more years –\napply as in the case of Ms. Maloney. Despite his record, in the circumstances\nthere is no justifiable basis to impose a sentence greater than that imposed on\nMs. Maloney. I would therefore sentence him to a one year custodial sentence.\nOn the third criteria – whether allowing him to serve his sentence in the\ncommunity would endanger the safety of the community – the probation officer's concerns about potential to\nre‑offend are relevant, but Mr. Chapman does not have unrestricted access\nto the victim. Further, the circumstances of the offence are not likely to be\nrepeated. While I acknowledge Mr. Chapman's criminal record, and the evidence\nof his temper, I am not convinced that permitting him to serve his sentence in\nthe community would, in the circumstances, be likely to endanger the safety of\nthe community.[56]His counsel submits that Mr.\nChapman has suffered ridicule in the community; as with Ms. Maloney, I do not\nfind this a significant factor in determining his sentence. Nor do I agree with\nthe submission that Ms. MacDonald's report is merely a \"personal\nopinion\" that should receive little or no weight. I do agree, however,\nthat a denial of guilt is not an aggravating factor.[57]In all the circumstances, I agree\nwith counsel's submission that incarceration is not required for the purpose of\ngeneral deterrence, denunciation, or otherwise. He shall serve a sentence of\none year in the community, to be followed by two years' probation.Conditions[58]Both offenders serve their\nsentences under house arrest, with exceptions for employment, education,\nmedical treatment, meetings with lawyers and court appearances, counselling,\nand religious services. Ms. Maloney is also permitted scheduled access visits\nwith SM and AM, while Mr. Chapman is permitted access visits with SM.MacAdam,\nJ."}

Alexson is apposite:This Court has repeatedly indicated that offences of\nthis nature will be treated severely.This is the only\nmeans available to the courts to discourage crimes of this\nnature which involve victims who are particularly\nvulnerable to such an attack.The range of sentences is\nsuch that 3 years is at the lower end of the scale for an\noffence of this nature.This being so, it is not\nappropriate to indicate that a sentence of 7 months is\nappropriate, even when the totality of those sentences\namounts to 28 months.Taking into account the accused's\ncircumstances which include a lengthy record, the sentence\nfor these four thefts should not be less than 40 months.\nSuch a sentence, when added to the sentences rendered for\nother offences not included in this appeal, increases the\nsentence this accused is serving to one of 4 years.Although the respondent is a young person, he has\naccumulated a serious criminal record.Unfortunately, he\nhas not been responsive to the consideration and leniency\nextended to him on previous occasions.There is no point\nin reminding him of his duty to society.Under such\ncircumstances, we must do what we can to prevent him from\nharming others and at the same time try to encourage him to\nchange his ways.The predominant principles to be invoked\nin cases of this nature are the protection of society and\ngeneral deterrence.After carefully considering the\ncircumstances of this offence as well as the fact that the\nrespondent is a relatively young person who can change his\nways if he chooses to do so, we conclude that a fit\nsentence would be three years imprisonment.Accordingly,\nwe allow the Crown's appeal and increase the sentence to a\nterm of three years imprisonment consecutive."}

PierceReasons on AppealIntroduction[1]The appellant, Dwayne William\nBoissoneau, pleaded guilty to theft under $5,000, contrary to s. 334(b) of the Criminal\nCode, fraud under $5,000, contrary to s. 380 of the Code and threatening to\ncause death or bodily harm, contrary to s. 264.1 of the Code.He takes no\nissue with the sentences imposed for theft and fraud. However, he appeals from\ncustodial portion of the sentence imposed by Mr. Justice F. Valente with respect\nto the charge of uttering threats.[2]The sentence imposed for threatening\nwas 365 days in prison less credit for 166 days of pre-sentence custody served,\ncredited at a rate of 1.5 days for each day, resulting in a credit of 250 days\nof pre-sentence custody served. In addition, Mr. Boissoneau was sentenced to 30\ndays consecutive on the theft count and 30 days concurrent for fraud. The\nsentence included two years’ probation, a ten year weapons prohibition and a\nrequirement to submit a sample of his DNA. The appellant does not take issue\nwith the propriety of the probation or ancillary orders.[3]Mr. Boissoneau has served his\ncustodial sentence. Nevertheless, he submits that the sentencing judge erred in\nprinciple in imposing a sentence of one year in prison for the charge of\nthreatening, based on the facts of the case, his background, including Gladue\nfactors, the principle of proportionality, and by considering factors that\nshould not have been considered.[4]On a preliminary basis, the Crown\nargued that the appeal should be dismissed as moot, because Mr. Boissoneau has\nserved his sentence and there is no longer a dispute to be adjudicated.[5]Counsel agree that case law with\nrespect to the unique facts of this case is sparse.They agree that Mr.\nBoissoneau is not a terrorist. However, the appellant submits that the court\nshould provide guidance on the quantum and range of sentence for aboriginal\noffenders engaged in threatening in a “terrorism-like” context.[6]The principles for considering\nmootness are set out in Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General) 1989 CanLII 123 (SCC), [1989]\nS.C.J. No. 14 (S.C.C.), paras. 31, 34, and 40. Hearing a Case that is moot is a\ndiscretionary matter.Although there is no adversarial contest remaining\nbetween the parties, and although hearing the appeal draws on scarce judicial\nresources, nevertheless, there is a public interest in the court exercising its\nlaw-making function by entertaining this appeal. For that reason, I exercise my\ndiscretion to hear the appeal.Facts\nUnderlying the Plea to Uttering Threats[7]The exchanges referred to below\noccurred via the social medium of Twitter.[8]On August 28, 2014, the appellant\nsent out two messages on his Twitter account. The first message, “Death to\nAmerica,” was addressed to two other Twitter addresses. The second message,\nsent to one of the two addressees, read “I kill infidels.”[9]On October 19, 2014, an individual\nidentified as Abu Turaab al-Kanadi replied, “And the best outcome is for the\nrighteous, 7128. Keep the brothers in your dua.”[10]Then, on October 24, 2014, the appellant responded to Turaab’s Tweet\nin these words: “Hey brother, I’m ready to fight and support ISIS till death.\nI’m a Canadian and I’m sick of this [sic] fake politics here.”[11]On October 28, 2014, a person named Kim sent the appellant a tweet,\n“Want a free ticket?” The appellant replied to Kim on November 6, 2014, saying\n“I will fight to the death of all this fake politics in US and Canada.” He also\ntweeted, “If I could afford it, I’d be gone by now.” Later that day he wrote to\nTuraab, saying, “Canada and US will suffer wrath of IS.” Below this tweet\nappeared the appellant’s tweet of October 13, 2014: “God willing, I will come\nand fight the cause.”[12]On November 7, 2014, a twitter user identified as Abu Dujana tweeted\nto the appellant, “Who wants to do something to some top kaffirs? We get\naddresses for you.”[13]The appellant responded to Dujana and another twitter user on\nNovember 10, 2014, “Give me Canadian addresses. I will ensure something\nhappens.” This utterance comprised the threat with which Mr. Boissoneau was\ncharged. Turaab and Dujana are considered to be Muslim extremists and\nsupporters of ISIS.[14]These exchanges associated with the appellant were detected by the\nRCMP Tactical Internet Operational Support Unit in November, 2014. In a\ncautioned statement, the appellant stated that he didn’t remember writing some\nof the tweets but acknowledged posting some “stupid stuff” that he shouldn’t\nhave. His statement concluded,I don’t know what to\nsay, like I know you guys are going to look through the computers. There isn’t\ngoing to be – there won’t be much. I did have a Twitter account. I did say\nthose things. I haven’t associated with anyone. I have never met a terrorist in\nperson. I wasn’t really that serious about going down there. I wasn’t that\nserious. I was going through a rough time. I would test the system; I already\nknow people get caught. I wanted to see if CSIS and stuff was really real,\nactually real, like I know they’re real but if they can actually detect stuff\nlike that. I pretty much use only Facebook. I got no terrorists on there. I do\nGoogle stuff like Canadians joining ISIS and stuff. I’ve looked up the costs of\nplane tickets to go to Turkey; I have looked that up. And that Kim girl. I\ndon’t even think she supports ISIS because a lot of times on her posts she\nseems kind of against that stuff.[15]The court also heard that the appellant’s sister gave police a\nstatement about the appellant. She advised that Mr. Boissoneau developed a\nromantic relationship with a woman from Hungary and he had travelled to Europe\non three occasions to see her. Ms. Boissoneau also indicated that her brother\nwas curious about terrorism but that she didn’t want him to go because she\nfeared he would be killed.[16]The Crown’s theory was that a threat was made to a class of individuals,\ncitizens of the United States and Canada, rather than to a specific individual.\nThe Crown did not allege that the appellant was an actual terrorist or that he\ntook steps beyond the content of the tweet. However, the Crown submitted that\nhis actions could not be divorced from the context of terrorism globally and in\nCanada. The plea was taken a few months after the shooting occurred on\nParliament Hill. The Crown argued that general deterrence and denunciation\nshould be the primary sentencing objectives for terrorism-related offences.[17]The defence conceded that Mr. Boissoneau intended the words to be\ntaken seriously. However, the defence submitted that the nature of the offence\nand the offender did not warrant the length of sentence that the Crown was\nadvocating.[18]The appellant’s criminal record was admitted. It began in 1999 and\ncontinued until 2011. His Youth Court record contains four convictions for\nfailing to comply with a disposition; one conviction for breach of undertaking;\nthree convictions for theft; three convictions for break and enter; three\nconvictions for mischief; and one conviction each for being unlawfully at\nlarge, assault, and possession of stolen property.[19]His adult record consists of the following convictions: break and\nenter; three counts of theft; three counts of breach of probation; four counts\nof mischief; one count of threatening; three counts of breach of recognizance;\ntwo counts of breach of undertaking; one count of failing to attend court; one\ncount of failing to attend for identification and one assault conviction. Thus,\nMr. Boissoneau’s criminal history featured property and nuisance-related\noffences, supplemented by compliance breaches. As his defence counsel on the\nplea submitted, the sentences are at the lower end of the spectrum. His\nprevious conviction for threatening attracted a sentence of thirty days.[20]A pre-sentence report was filed at the sentencing hearing. At the\ntime of the report, Mr. Boissoneau was a First Nations man, aged thirty years.\nHe was raised by his father who had been exposed to residential school. Mr.\nBoissoneau’s relationship with his father was positive. The same cannot be said\nof Mr. Boissoneau’s relationship with his mother.She is an alcoholic; his\nrelationship with her is strained.[21]As a toddler, the appellant he sustained multiple skull fractures\nwhen he fell downstairs. Later he was diagnosed as suffering from Fetal Alcohol\nSpectrum Disorder.Undoubtedly the FASD has led him to make bad decisions that\nbring him into conflict with the law.[22]The appellant’s difficulties with the law at age twelve led to his\napprehension by the child welfare authorities as his father found his behaviour\nunmanageable. He was in care for about two years.[23]His legal difficulties coincided with his experimentation with\nmarijuana and alcohol. During his teen years, he drank heavily. By\ntwenty-three, he graduated to using opiates. His drug habit was funded by\ncriminal behaviour. He enrolled in the methadone program for a few years at the\nage of twenty-five but withdrew in order to travel with his girlfriend. He\nadvises that he quit using drugs in 2014, but admits that he continues to use\nalcohol. His family identifies his alcohol use as problematic. He has not had\nany residential treatment.[24]Mr. Boissoneau also had difficulty in school. He was assessed as\nfunctioning in the low average range. Because of his history of incarceration,\nhe did not attend high school and has no work history. He is supported by\npublic disability benefits. The Crown described him as impulsive as a result of\nthe brain injury, lack of formal education and FASD.[25]The pre-sentence report (p. 8) observed that the appellant:…did not appear to minimise his\nbehaviour though was not always able to fully to fully explain his actions. He\ngives the impression of being easily led and susceptible to substance abuse.[26]Mr. McCartney, his defence counsel on the sentencing submitted that\nthere was no evidence that the European travel he undertook was related to\nterrorism pursuits. As well, he indicated that his relationship with the woman\nfrom Hungary had ended. He characterized Mr. Boissoneau as unsophisticated in\nhis understanding of Islamic extremism. The appellant’s father told the police\nthat his son often says things to “seem macho.”[27]Prior to being sentenced, the appellant apologized.[28]The Crown submitted that denunciation and deterrence should be\nemphasized. It sought a global sentence of 15 – 16 months for all three charges\nplus two years’ probation and ancillary orders. The defence submitted that time\nserved of four months (the equivalent of six months with pre-sentence credits)\nplus one day would be a fit sentence. This defence submission was made on March\n19, 2015; in fact, sentence was reserved and not imposed until April 29, 2015,\nmeaning that the appellant’s time in pretrial custody then totalled 166 days.\nIn sentencing the appellant, the judge recognized the additional time served at\ncredited him with the equivalent of 250 days served.Parameters\nfor Sentence Appeals[29]Sentencing decisions are entitled to significant deference unless\nthe sentencing judge has made an error in principle, at which point, the\ndeference ends. The Ontario Court of Appeal described such errors in R. v.\nRezaie (1996), 1996 CanLII 1241 (ON CA), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 97, at para. 20:…an appellate court may interfere\nwith a trial judge’s sentencing discretion in only two kinds of cases. First,\nan appellate court may interfere if the sentencing judge commits an “error in\nprinciple”. Error in principle is a familiar basis for reviewing the exercise\nof judicial discretion. It connotes, at least, failing to take into account a\nrelevant factor, taking into account an irrelevant factor, failing to give\nsufficient weight to relevant factors, overemphasizing relevant factors and,\nmore generally, it includes an error of law. If the sentencing judge commits an\nerror in principle, the sentence imposed is no longer entitled to deference and\nan appellate court may impose the sentence it thinks fit. [Citations omitted].[30]The second type of case in which an appellate court may interfere is\nif the sentence is outside an “acceptable range”: Rezaie, para. 21. The\nnotion of an “acceptable range” for sentences encompasses sentences that are\ntoo severe or not severe enough.Did the\nSentencing Judge Err in Principle?[31]There is a dearth of sentencing cases dealing with individuals who\ncommit offences of a “terrorism-like” nature. In effect, these are nuisance\noffences that take up the time and attention of the authorities. They arise out\nof bad judgment but the offenders are at a low level in posing a risk to the\npublic.[32]By way of contrast to Mr. Boissoneau’s misconduct, the appellant\ncited R. v. Lapoleon, [2008] B.C.J. No. 484 (British Columbia Provincial\nCourt). Unfortunately, this case was not presented to the sentencing judge for\nits persuasive value.[33]Mr. Lapoleon was convicted after trial of engaging in a hoax\nregarding terrorist activity contrary to s. 83.231(1) of the Criminal Code; and\npublic mischief by causing police to investigate to determine whether the hoax\nconstituted a real threat, contrary to s. 140(1)(a) of the Code.[34]The facts found at trial in 2007 are that Mr. Lapoleon sent a fax to\nthe national security unit of the RCMP alleging that an Islamic terrorist cell\noperating in Vancouver was plotting to blow up the Danish and American\nconsulates. The communication set out the names and addresses of three alleged\nterrorists involved. It also referred to explosives being kept at a certain\nlocation.[35]While the police did not assess the risk as high, nevertheless, they\nkept the three individuals under surveillance. The two consulates were advised\nof the threat and police protection was enhanced at both locations. As well, a\ncanine search for explosives was conducted at the location identified in the\ncommunication.[36]Simultaneously, a grand jury subpoena was obtained in New York City\nto seize computer records from the server believed to have directed the fax\ntransmission through various computer re-routes. RCMP and Vancouver police were\ncalled in on the case. Investigation eventually linked Mr. Lapoleon’s fax to\nvarious computers used at internet cafes. He was placed under surveillance, a\nplan which was complicated by the fact that Mr. Lapoleon had no fixed address.\nUltimately, he was arrested and charged. The three persons he identified in his\nfax were entirely blameless; he simply didn’t like them.[37]Mr. Lapoleon was sentenced on the charge or perpetrating a terrorist\nhoax to six months in custody plus time served of four and a half months\n(credited at nine months). He was sentenced to four months consecutive on the\nmischief count. As well, a two year probation order was imposed.[38]The court recognized that Mr. Lapoleon was an aboriginal man who was\nhomeless. He had a background of physical and sexual abuse, alcoholism and\npetty crime. In sentencing him, the court took into account the significant\ninvestigative resources required to deal with the matter, diverting police from\nlegitimate terrorist threats. The court considered that Mr. Lapoleon undertook\nsignificant planning to perpetuate the hoax and his actions took place in a\nserious socio-political context.In summary, the sentence emphasized\ndeterrence.[39]The Crown submits that Lapoleon is distinguishable in that\nthe offender was convicted of a different offence than threatening; in the alternative,\nthe Crown argues that the sentence imposed in this case was within the range\nestablished in Lapoleon.[40]In sentencing Mr. Boissoneau, the sentencing judge properly\nconsidered the sentencing principles set out in the Criminal Code, including\nMr. Boissoneau’s personal circumstances and Gladue factors. In his\nreasons, he pointed to the following four circumstances requiring a\ndenunciatory sentence:(1)the period of time during which the offence was committed;(2)that while the appellant “may well not have committed any specific\nterrorism related offence,” the concept of terrorism informed the appellant’s\nutterances;(3)by virtue of his plea and his counsel’s submissions, the appellant\nintended his comments to be taken seriously; and(4)the appellant’s utterances were made at a time of intense public\nsensitivity and insecurity about the threat of terrorism, making his words more\nominous.[41]The\nappellant contends that the sentencing judge erred when he referred to a period\nof time over which the offence was committed as a factor calling for\ndenunciation. The Crown suggests this was not an error; the comment refers to\nthe narrative read into the record that provides the context for the utterance\nthat gave rise to the charge. It also corresponds with the wording on the information.[42]I agree that the sentencing judge was entitled to consider the\ncontext in which the offending comment was made. Indeed, it was necessary in\norder to understand the degree of blameworthiness attached to the utterance.\nHowever, the period of time over which the offence took place is not an\naggravating factor. Rather, considering that the offence took place in\ncommunications made between August 28 and November 10, 2014 is a\nmischaracterization of the admission made on the guilty plea that the last\nTwitter utterance gave rise to the offence.[43]The appellant concedes that the second factor, the backdrop of\nterrorism underpinning the threat was aggravating. I agree with this\nsubmission. The sentencing judge was entitled to treat it as an aggravating fact.[44]Counsel for the parties agree that the third factor listed by the\njudge, that the appellant intended his comments to be taken seriously, is not\nan aggravating factor, but rather a necessary element of the offence of\nthreatening. It forms part of the mens rea of the offence and is\ntherefore a neutral factor. See: R. v. McRae, 2013 SCC 68 (CanLII), [2013] 3 S.C.R. 931\n(S.C.C.), para. 23.[45]Next, the appellant submits that the sentencing judge erred in\nconsidering that the utterance was made at a time of intense public sensitivity\nabout terrorism in order to impute the appellant’s level of intent when there\nwas no evidence that Mr. Boissoneau was aware of the terrorism-motivated\nshooting on Parliament Hill.[46]The Crown argues that the sentencing judge is entitled to take\njudicial notice of local conditions when sentencing an offender, citing R.\nv. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII), para. 90. In Lacasse, the Supreme Court\nrecognized that denunciation of conduct endemic to a local area was a\nconsideration for sentencing. The court stated:Although the fact\nthat a type of crime occurs frequently in a particular region is not in itself\nan aggravating factor, there may be circumstances in which a judge might\nnonetheless consider such a fact in balancing the various sentencing\nobjectives, including the need to denounce the unlawful conduct in question in\nthat place and at the same time to deter anyone else from doing the same thing.\nIt goes without saying, however, that the consideration of this factor must not\nlead to a sentence that is demonstrably unfit.[47]In my view, in naming public sensitivity to terrorism as a ground\nfor a denunciatory sentence, there are three problems. The first is that there\nwas no evidence that Mr. Boissoneau was aware of the shooting on Parliament\nHill or that his utterance was linked to these events. The chain of his\ncommunications on Twitter preceded the shooting by several months.His counsel\nat the sentencing, characterized Mr. Boissoneau’s conduct as “shooting his\nmouth off”. The pre-sentence report described Mr. Boissoneau as an impulsive\nindividual who had suffered from a brain injury and FASD, such that he\nfunctioned in the low-average range. The report-writer commented that the\nappellant “was not always able to fully explain his actions” and left her “with\nthe impression he does not fully appreciate the gravity of his actions in\nrespect to the offences before the Court.”[48]The second problem is that there is no suggestion that threats of\nterrorism are prevalent in the Thunder Bay area, such that the sentencing judge\nought to have emphasized denunciation. In other words, there is no “local\ncondition” inviting judicial notice in sentencing.[49]The third problem arises from the judge’s conclusion that Mr.\nBoissoneau’s threat was more ominous in light of a distressed society. In fact,\nthe evidence indicates that the appellant had a limited following on Twitter.His\ncommunication came only to the attention of a couple of terrorists anxious to\nrecruit him and the police unit tasked with monitoring their conduct. Thus,\nunlike in Lapoleon, there was no public distress occasioned by the\nappellant’s thoughtless Twitter post.[50]The Crown contends that the sentence for threatening was\nproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the culpability of the\noffender. Respectfully, I do not agree. In my view, the sentence unduly\nemphasized denunciation and deterrence given the nature of the offence and the\ncircumstances of the offender. In short, the sentence imposed was outside the\nacceptable range. In his submissions at the sentencing hearing, defence counsel\ncommented,…my view is that there’s never\nbeen a police state in history that hasn’t been started with the law getting\npushed around by public fear and news headlines, and we’re in that situation\nnow in respect to Islamic extremism.[51]His defence counsel also queried whether, had the offence taken\nplace two years earlier, when there was less alarm about radical extremism,\nwould the sentence be more serious than the four months he actually spent in\nprison? It is telling that Mr. Boissoneau’s previous sentence for threatening\nwas thirty days.[52]The case at bar is obviously distinguishable from Lapoleon,\nwhere international law enforcement agents were involved, an extensive\ninvestigation was required, innocent people were accused, and two consulates were\nput on alert. Here, the police investigation was limited. Mr. Boissoneau did\nnot conceal his identity. His threat was naïve and unsophisticated, in keeping\nwith his brain injury, his cognitive abilities and the Gladue factors. Mr.\nBoissoneau took no steps to plan attacks in Canada and did not involve others\nin the threat. His threat did not alarm the public.His real motivation was to\nobtain a plane ticket to visit his girlfriend in Europe. In these\ncircumstances, his culpability was limited.[53]In my view, the appellant is correct that the sentence should not\nhave exceeded the time served, which was four months in jail, having regard for\nthe two other offences for which he was also sentenced. Mr. Boissoneau’s\nconduct was in the nature of a nuisance to law enforcement.[54]The appeal is therefore allowed. The sentence of Mr. Justice Valente\nfor the offence of uttering threats is varied to four months in custody, which,\non an enhanced basis of 1.5:1 constitutes six months in custody.“Original signed by”The Hon.

(ad hoc)April 5, 2007Criminal law -- Dangerous offenders -- Sentencingjudge erring in placing onus on Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubtthat there was no reasonable possibility of eventual control of riskpresented by accused in community -- Issue of whether public threat canbe reduced to acceptable level through long-term offender provisions ordeterminate sentence not requiring either party to satisfy burden ofproof -- Appropriate to designate accused long-term offender if judgesatisfied on whole of evidence reasonable possibility of eventualcontrol of offender's risk in community -- Accused should be designateddangerous offender if judge not satisfied criteria for long-termoffender met or if uncertain whether met -- Crown arguing that appellatecourt should substitute dangerous offender designation as accused wouldinevitably have been found to be dangerous offender but for errorregarding burden of proof -- New hearing required as trial judge makingno findings of fact regarding conflicting psychiatric evidence -- Crownappeal from long-term offender designation allowed and new hearingordered.The accused was convicted of prostitution offences. Hehad a lengthy criminal record, including nine prior prostitution-related convictions. The Crown brought an application to have theaccused declared a dangerous offender. The trial judge found that thestatutory criteria for a dangerous offender were satisfied. However, heconcluded that before the accused could be declared a dangerousoffender, in addition to the statutory criteria, the Crown had to provebeyond a reasonable doubt that there was no reasonable possibility ofeventual control of the risk the accused presented in the community. Ashe was not satisfied that the Crown had satisfied that burden, hedismissed the dangerous offender application, declared the accused to bea long-term offender and imposed a three-year sentence and a ten-yearsupervision order. The Crown appealed.Held, the appeal should be allowed.The trial judge erred in imposing a burden on the Crown to provebeyond a reasonable doubt that there was no reasonable possibility ofeventual control in the community of the risk the accused presented. Inthe context of a dangerous offender application, the sentencing judgemay exercise his or her discretion not to declare an offender dangerousafter finding that the offender satisfies the statutory criteria forthat designation if, he or she is satisfied that, the public threat canbe reduced to an acceptable level through either the long- term offenderprovisions or a determinate sentence. This is not an issue thatrequires either party to satisfy a burden of proof; rather, it is anissue for the sentencing judge concerning whether to exercise his or herdiscretion based on the whole of the evidence adduced. If the judge isnot satisfied that there is a reasonable possibility of eventual controlin the community of the risk posed by the offender or if the judge isuncertain whether he or she is satisfied, the offender should be foundto be a dangerous offender.The Crown asked that the court makethe finding that the accused was a dangerous offender. The defencenominated psychiatrist, although stating that the offender's prospectsfor rehabilitation were poor and the risk he posed of future [page722]violence moderately high to high, nonetheless expressed doubt aboutwhether the accused fitted the criteria for designation as a dangerousoffender. The trial judge made no findings of fact regarding the defencepsychiatrist's evidence and, as a result, this is not an appropriatecase for substituting a finding that the accused is a dangerousoffender. A new hearing is ordered.APPEAL fromthe judgment of O'Flynn J. of the Superior Court of Justice, dated April22, 2005, dismissing a dangerous offender application and sentencingthe accused as a long-term offender.\nCases referred toR. v.

These crimes related to the same victim andwere the respondent's tenth and 11th prostitution-relatedconvictions. Following the verdicts, the Crown applied to havethe respondent declared a dangerous offender.[2] The trial judge found that the statutory criteria for adangerous offender designation were satisfied. However, heconcluded [page723] that before the respondent could bedeclared a dangerous offender, in addition to the statutorycriteria, the Crown had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt thatthere is no reasonable possibility of eventual control of therisk the respondent presents in the community. As he was notpersuaded that the Crown had satisfied that burden, the trialjudge dismissed the dangerous offender application, declaredthe respondent a long-term offender and imposed a three-yearsentence (in addition to four years' credit for time served)plus a ten-year supervision order.[3] Pursuant to s. 759(2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985,c. C-46, the Crown appeals from the order dismissing thedangerous offender application. The Crown submits that, inexercising his discretion concerning whether to declare therespondent dangerous, the trial judge erred in law by placingan onus on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt thatthere is no reasonable possibility of eventual control of therisk the respondent presents in the community. The Crowncontends that but for this legal error, a dangerous offenderdesignation was inevitable. The Crown therefore asks this courtto set aside the trial judge's order and to substitute an orderdeclaring the respondent a dangerous offender.[4] In the alternative, the Crown contends that the trialjudge erred in law by failing to provide any reasons forfinding that the risk the respondent presents can eventually becontrolled in the community and asks this court to set asidethe trial judge's order and direct a new dangerous offenderhearing. Finally, in the event this court rejects its appealfrom the dismissal of the dangerous offender application, theCrown submits that the custodial sentence imposed by the trialjudge is demonstrably unfit and asks this court to increase theperiod of incarceration to the maximum available penalty.[5] By way of response, the respondent submits that the legaltest applied by the trial judge was correct. In any event, hesubmits that the trial judge erred in finding that thestatutory criteria for a dangerous offender designation weresatisfied and, in addition, claims that there were othergrounds upon which the trial judge could have relied toexercise his discretion not to declare the respondentdangerous. The respondent therefore asks that this appeal bedismissed.[6] While I agree that the trial judge erred in imposing aburden on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt thatthere is no reasonable possibility of eventual control in thecommunity of the risk the respondent presents, for reasons thatI will explain, in my view, it is necessary that there be a newdangerous offender hearing. I would therefore allow the appeal,set aside the trial judge's order and direct a new dangerousoffender hearing. [page724]I. Background(i) The predicate offences[7] The respondent was found guilty of procuring and livingpartially off the avails of prostitution of a person under theage of 18 years on February 18, 2003. He was acquitted ofcharges of sexual assault and sexual assault with a weaponconcerning the same victim. Directed verdicts of not guiltywere entered on other related charges.[8] The predicate offences arose out of events that occurredbetween June and September 1998. At the time, the appellant wason parole in relation to a nine-year sentence imposed in March1991. The victim, 17-year-old E.G., was an unemployed singlemother on welfare. She was approached by the respondent shortlyafter moving to Kingston, while dancing at a nightclub. He toldher he had a business proposal for her, that she wasattractive, that he could get her a house, a car, and lots ofmoney and that all she had to do was \"sell herself\".[9] On the first day she went to work for him, the respondenttold E.G. to give him the money she received from each clientfor safekeeping. At the end of the night, E.G. asked for hermoney back but the respondent refused, saying that he spent iton drugs. E.G. continued to work for the respondent out of fearfrom June 1998 until the respondent was hospitalized onSeptember 6, 1998. She was too afraid to go to the police atthat time, but did so later.[10] The respondent underwent major surgery in September1998, returned home on September 24, 1998, and continued toreceive home nursing care until December 1998. He was arrestedon September 9, 1999, after attempting to procure fourteen-year-old C.K., and has been in custody ever since.(ii) The evidence at the dangerous offender hearing[11] Apart from the evidence at trial concerning thepredicate offences and psychiatric evidence, the evidence atthe dangerous offender hearing consisted primarily ofdocumentary evidence.(a) The respondent's criminal record[12] The respondent has 26 criminal convictions dating backto 1977. As noted, he had nine previous convictions forprostitution-related offences and he received penitentiarysentences of six and nine years respectively for two sets ofsuch offences. He has nine convictions for crimes of violenceand has committed numerous offences while on bail or parole.[page725](b) The respondent's prior prostitution-relatedconvictions[13] The respondent's prior convictions for prostitution-related offences have the most significance for the purposesof this appeal.[14] In September 1985, the respondent was convicted ofliving off the avails of prostitution in relation to S.W.during the period January to December 1983. The respondent hadbeen living with S.W. for 7 1/2 years at the time and had threechildren with her. There was evidence at the dangerous offenderhearing that during conversations with various health careprofessionals the respondent admitted hitting S.W. andthreatening her to get her to work as a prostitute.[15] The respondent was convicted of living off the avails ofprostitution in relation to 14-year-old J.B. in March 1985.Evidence at the dangerous offender hearing indicated that therespondent was on bail for the charges in relation to S.W. whenhe procured J.B. to work as a prostitute during a two-dayperiod in July 1984. There was some evidence at the dangerousoffender hearing indicating that J.B. was afraid of therespondent.[16] In November 1985, the respondent was convicted ofattempting to procure 19-year-old D.B. and attempting to liveoff the avails of prostitution in relation to her during a two-day period in January 1985. The respondent was on bail forthe charges in relation to S.W. when he sexually seduced D.B.,took her to Montréal and attempted to make her work as aprostitute. Evidence at the dangerous offender proceedingindicated that D.B. was able to call home and that her familydrove to Montréal to pick her up.[17] The respondent was released to a halfway house on dayparole in January 1988. While under supervision at the halfwayhouse, the respondent used cocaine and gambled daily, andregularly attended nightclubs. During this period, he alsostarted pimping S.D., procured and pimped W.W. and beganpimping C.G. In November 1988, he went unlawfully at large. Hetook S.D. with him and continued to pimp her in western Canada.In September 1989, he was arrested in Winnipeg on chargesrelating to C.G. and W.W.[18] The respondent was convicted of several offences inrelation to C.G. and W.W. on March 18, 1991, and was sentencedto a total of nine years in the penitentiary. The evidenceindicated that the respondent threatened to kill 20-year-oldC.G. regularly and that on one occasion he grabbed her by thethroat with one hand and put a knife to her throat with theother hand. The evidence also indicated that the respondentbeat 24-year-old W.W. and threatened to kill her, her familyand her three children. One night, he punched W.W. between theeyes, [page726] knocking her unconscious. Two months later, hepunched her in the left eye, opening a wound which bledprofusely. The impact also shattered W.W.'s contact lens. W.W.was later diagnosed as having a concussion and a severeinfection in the left eye. She required surgery to treat theinfection and to repair the skull area around the eye that hadcollapsed from the impact. She was also informed that her nosewas broken from the earlier assault. While she was in thehospital, the respondent called her daily to ensure that shewould not make a statement to the police.[19] The respondent was never charged with any offences inrelation to S.D., whom he married in 1990. However, evidence atthe dangerous offender hearing indicated that the respondentphysically abused his wife and also forced her to prostituteherself. He once kicked her in the face, fracturing her nose.On approximately ten occasions, he whipped her with a hangerwhile she was naked. He also whipped her with an extensioncord. On one occasion he tied her up for ten hours while shewas naked.[20] In January 2001, the respondent was convicted ofattempting to procure 14-year-old C.K. in the period betweenJuly and September 1999. After being introduced to C.K., therespondent obtained her telephone number and called her athome. He invited her to work as a prostitute but she declined.He subsequently met with her, called her repeatedly andthreatened to hurt her or to kill her.(c) The respondent's background[21] The respondent was born on August 13, 1960 in Toronto.He described his father as a gangster who abused him and hisfamily; he described his sisters as prostitutes and drugaddicts. When the respondent was 11 or 12, he was sent to livewith his uncle who was a pimp. As a 15-year-old teenager, hebegan to rely on pimping as a lucrative source of financialsupport. He quit school in grade 9, has no employment historyand has gambling and drug addictions.[22] The respondent was diagnosed with Crohn's disease whilein the penitentiary. Medical records filed at the dangerousoffender hearing for the period October 1997 to December 1999demonstrated that the respondent had undergone significanthospitalization, operations and treatment for Crohn's diseaseand for a debilitating spinal infection during that period.(d) Psychiatric evidence[23] In addition to reports of numerous assessments conductedwhile the respondent was incarcerated, Dr. Hucker, for theCrown, [page727] and Dr. Bradford, for the respondent, providedpsychiatric evidence at the dangerous offender hearing. Dr.Hucker and Dr. Bradford both diagnosed the respondent as havingan antisocial personality disorder and as being a psychopath.Further, both indicated that the respondent was a moderate-highto high risk to re-offend violently, most likely in the contextof the sex trade industry.[24] Dr. Hucker said that the respondent needs very, verytight monitoring. A halfway house would be inadequate. He saidthat any suitable community supervision \"would be so tight thatI can't imagine what it would be\". Dr. Hucker's opinion wasthat there was not a \"fairly good chance that his behaviourwill be controlled within an appropriate time within thecommunity\". He said it would be very difficult to monitor therespondent and that there was no foundation upon which he couldsay that at some point within the foreseeable future therespondent would be a \"fairly good chance for a safe release tothe community\".[25] Dr. Bradford expressed reservations in his report aboutwhether, from a legal perspective, the respondent meets thestatutory criteria for a dangerous offender. In particular, henoted that the respondent had never been convicted of a sexualassault and that the degree of violence in the offences hecommitted was relatively low compared to what Dr. Bradford hadseen in other dangerous offender applications. However, Dr.Bradford concluded that the respondent's chance of beingrehabilitated was poor. He said:Mr. D. has very severe problems, a poor prognosis and verylittle chance of a successful rehabilitation in theattainment of a pro-social lifestyle. This is based on thesevere antisocial personality disorder that he presents withfor which there is very little optimism for any responsewhatsoever to treatment. In addition, he clearly has problemsrelated to sexual attraction to adolescent females as well ashaving evidence of a sexually sadistic preference for thesame age group.[26] Dr. Bradford testified that, while it was inaccurate tosay that there was absolutely no treatment for the respondent,the chances were \"extremely slim for any treatment to beeffective\". He said that assuming that past programs had hadsome effect on him, the respondent would have to stay away fromthe sex trade industry and be monitored in such a way to makereturning to it impossible. There would have to be random urinetests, treatment for substance abuse and treatment forgambling. These factors, in addition to his age and health, mayreduce his risk to re-offend. The respondent's biggest barrierto success was his severe personality disorder. Dr. Bradfordsaid it would require a \"cognitive restructuring\" and that \"itrequires a total commitment on behalf of the person undergoingthe treatment\". [page728]II. Relevant Statutory Provisions[27] The issues on this appeal require consideration of boththe dangerous offender provisions and the long-term offenderprovisions contained in Part XXIV of the Criminal Code. Thedangerous offender provisions have been amended on severaloccasions. The most recent version came into force on August 1,1997 (S.C. 1997, c. 17). In R. v. H. (M.B.) (2004), 2004 CanLII 14199 (ON CA), 70 O.R.(3d) 257, [2004] O.J. No. 1679, 186 C.C.C. (3d) 62 (C.A.),this court observed that these provisions give the court thediscretion to find that an offender is a dangerous offender andto impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for anindeterminate period via two possible routes.[28] First, under s. 753(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, thecourt may declare an offender to be a dangerous offender whereit is satisfied that the offender has been convicted of aserious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752(a) of theCriminal Code and that the offender constitutes a threat to thelife, safety or physical or mental well-being of other personsbased on evidence establishing that the offender falls into anyof three categories.[29] Second, under s. 753(1)(b), the court may declare anoffender to be a dangerous offender where it is satisfied thatthe offender has been convicted of a serious personal injuryoffence as defined in s. 752(b) of the Criminal Code and thatthe offender has shown a likelihood of causing injury, pain orother evil to other persons through failure to control his orher sexual impulses.[30] The relevant portions of the dangerous offenderprovisions are as follows:753(1) The court may, on application made under this Partfollowing the filing of an assessment report under subsection752.1(2), find the offender to be a dangerous offender if itis satisfied(a) that the offence for which the offender has beenconvicted is a serious personal injury offencedescribed in paragraph (a) of the definition ofthat expression in section 752 and the offenderconstitutes a threat to the life, safety orphysical or mental well-being of other persons onthe basis of evidence establishing(i) a pattern of repetitive behaviour by theoffender, of which the offence for which he orshe has been convicted forms a part, showing afailure to restrain his or her behaviour and alikelihood of causing death or injury to otherpersons, or inflicting severe psychologicaldamage on other persons, through failure in thefuture to restrain his or her behaviour,(ii) a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour bythe offender, of which the offence for which heor she has been convicted forms a part, showinga substantial degree of indifference on thepart of the offender respecting the reasonablyforeseeable consequences to other persons ofhis or her behaviour, or[page729](iii) any behaviour by the offender, associated withthe offence for which he or she has beenconvicted, that is of such a brutal nature asto compel the conclusion that the offender'sbehaviour in the future is unlikely to beinhibited by normal standards of behaviouralrestraint; or(b) that the offence for which the offender has beenconvicted is a serious personal injury offencedescribed in paragraph (b) of the definition ofthat expression in section 752 and the offender, byhis or her conduct in any sexual matter includingthat involved in the commission of the offence forwhich he or she has been convicted, has shown afailure to control his or her sexual impulses and alikelihood of causing injury, pain or other evil toother persons through failure in the future tocontrol his or her a sexual impulses.752. In this Part,. . . . .\"serious personal injury offence\" means(a) an indictable offence, other than high treason,treason, first degree murder or second degreemurder, involving(i) the use or attempted use of violence againstanother person, or(ii) conduct endangering or likely to endanger thelife or safety of another person or inflictingor likely to inflict severe psychologicaldamage upon another person,and for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonmentfor ten years or more, or(b) an offence or attempt to commit an offencementioned in section 271 (sexual assault), 272 (sexual assault with a weapon, threats to athird party or causing bodily harm) or 273 (aggravated sexual assault).(Emphasis added)[31] The long-term offender provisions of the Criminal Codewere first introduced with the 1997 amendments to the dangerousoffender provisions. They provide the court with discretion tofind that an offender is a long-term offender where the courtis satisfied that three criteria set out in s. 753.1(1) of theCriminal Code are met. Those criteria require that the court besatisfied: (i) that it would be appropriate to sentence theoffender to a period of imprisonment of at least two years;(ii) that there is a substantial risk that the offender willre-offend; and (iii) that there is a reasonable possibility ofeventual control of that risk in the community. If the courtfinds an offender to be a long-term offender it shall impose asentence of imprisonment for a minimum of two years and orderthe offender to be supervised in the community for a period notexceeding ten years: s. 753.1(3). [page730][32] The relevant portions of the long-term offenderprovisions are as follows:753.1(1) The court may, on application made under this Partfollowing the filing of an assessment report under subsection752.1(2), find an offender to be a long-term offender if itis satisfied that(a) it would be appropriate to impose a sentence ofimprisonment of two years or more for the offencefor which the offender has been convicted;(b) there is a substantial risk that the offender willreoffend; and(c) there is a reasonable possibility of eventualcontrol of the risk in the community.(Emphasis added)[33] Section 753.1(2) sets out certain circumstances in whichthe court shall be satisfied that there is a substantial riskthat an offender will re-offend. Amendments were made to thissection in 2002, after the predicate offences were committed.At the time the predicate offences occurred, this section read:753.1(2) The court shall be satisfied that there is asubstantial risk that the offender will reoffend if(a) the offender has been convicted of an offence undersection 151 (sexual interference), 152 (invitationto sexual touching) or 153 (sexual exploitation),subsection 173(2) (exposure) or section 271 (sexualassault), 272 (sexual assault with a weapon) or 273 (aggravated sexual assault), or has engaged inserious conduct of a sexual nature in the commissionof another offence of which the offender has beenconvicted; and(b) the offender(i) has shown a pattern of repetitive behaviour, ofwhich the offence for which he or she has beenconvicted forms a part, that shows a likelihoodof the offender's causing death or injury toother persons or inflicting severepsychological damage on other persons, or(ii) by conduct in any sexual matter including thatinvolved in the commission of the offence forwhich the offender has been convicted, hasshown a likelihood of causing injury, pain orother evil to other persons in the futurethrough similar offence.(Emphasis added)[34] As this court noted in H. (M.B.), supra, it is clearfrom the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in R. v. Johnson,2003 SCC 46 (CanLII), [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357, [2003] S.C.J. No. 45 that where theCrown brings a dangerous offender application, the sentencingjudge must first consider whether the Crown has established thestatutory criteria in either s. 753(1)(a) or s. 753(1)(b) fordeclaring the offender dangerous. If the Crown has notsatisfied that burden, [page731] the dangerous offenderapplication cannot succeed. If the Crown has satisfied thatburden, the sentencing judge then has the discretion not todeclare the offender dangerous and, in exercising thatdiscretion, must consider whether any available sanction shortof a determinate sentence would adequately protect the public,including a long-term offender designation.[35] While the Crown may seek a long-term offenderdesignation as an alternative remedy on a dangerous offenderapplication, it may also seek that designation by way of afree-standing application under s. 753.1 of the Criminal Code.III. The Trial Judge's Reasons[36] As already noted, the trial judge dismissed the Crown'sdangerous offender application and declared the respondent along-term offender. Before turning to his analysis, he reviewedcertain aspects of the evidence adduced at the hearing, thegeneral law applicable to dangerous offender and long-termoffender applications and the positions of the parties. As partof this review, he referred to Johnson, supra, and noted thatthe court retains the discretion not to declare an offenderdangerous even where the statutory criteria are met. He alsonoted that, in seeking to have the respondent declareddangerous, the Crown relied on both ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and 753(1)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code.[37] The trial judge then set out his analysis as follows:I find the offender, Mr. D., meets the criteria for both adangerous offender and a long-term offender.Section 753.1(1)(c) requires the Court to consider, despitethe offender's substantial risk to re-offend, whether thereis a \"reasonable possibility\" of eventual control of therisk in the community. If the result of that analysis isthat there is no such possibility, then the offender isdesignated a dangerous offender.There are certain concerns on the part of the doctors as tothe treatability of Mr. D. The Crown has to establish beyonda reasonable doubt that there is no reasonable possibilityof eventual control of the risk presented by Mr. D. in thecommunity.Mr. D. does not have to prove he is treatable. The Crownmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is nottreatable.I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, considering allthe evidence and in particular the evidence of Dr. Bradford,that Mr. D. is not treatable. I am satisfied that thecriteria in section 753.1(1)(a)(b)(c) have been met.I thereby find Mr. D. to be a long-term offender pursuant tosection 753.1(1).I am exercising my discretion and not declaring Mr. D. to bea dangerous offender.(Emphasis added) [page732]IV. Analysis(i) Did the trial judge err by placing an onus on the Crownto prove beyond a reasonable doubt there is noreasonable possibility of eventual control of the riskthe respondent presents in the community?[38] The main issue on appeal is whether, in exercising hisdiscretion whether to find the respondent a dangerous offender,the trial judge erred by placing an onus on the Crown to provebeyond a reasonable doubt that there is no reasonablepossibility of eventual control of the risk the respondentpresents in the community. One of the three statutory criteriafor a long-term offender designation requires that the court besatisfied there is a reasonable possibility of eventual controlin the community of the risk an offender presents. Expresseddifferently, the main issue on appeal is whether the trialjudge erred in law by placing an onus on the Crown to negativethe availability of a long-term offender designation beforedeclaring the respondent a dangerous offender.[39] In fairness to the trial judge, in the court below theCrown agreed that it bore the burden set out above.Nevertheless, I conclude that the trial judge erred in law inimposing this burden. In my view, the trial judge's approach isinconsistent with the Supreme Court of Canada's analysis inJohnson, supra, which addresses the relationship between thedangerous offender and long-term offender provisions of theCriminal Code.[40] In Johnson, supra, one of the primary issues was whethera sentencing judge retains the discretion not to declare anoffender dangerous where the offender meets the dangerousoffender criteria set out in either s. 753(1)(a) or (b) of theCriminal Code. The British Columbia Court of Appeal hadconcluded that there was no such discretion, but that asentencing judge must consider the prospects for treatment orcure in order to determine whether an offender's pattern ofconduct is sufficiently intractable to satisfy the statutorycriteria for a dangerous offender designation.[41] The Supreme Court of Canada concluded that a sentencingjudge does retain the discretion not to declare an offenderdangerous even though the offender meets the statutorycriteria. In addition to the permissive language in s. 753(1),the court relied on the following factors:-- the primary purpose of indeterminate detention under thedangerous offender regime is the protection of the public,but it is warranted \"only insofar as it actually serves[that] purpose\"; and [page733]-- the dangerous offender provisions form part of the CriminalCode sentencing regime. The underlying objectives of thesentencing regime mandate the existence of the discretionto impose a just and fit sentence in the circumstances ofthe individual case. Further, the interpretation of thedangerous offender provisions must be governed by thefundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out inss. 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code.[42] Having regard to the principles of proportionality andrestraint, the court held that an indeterminate sentence shouldonly be imposed where lesser sanctions would be insufficient toadequately protect the public from the risk of harm presentedby a dangerous offender. The court said:The principles of sentencing thus dictate that a judge oughtto impose an indeterminate sentence only in those instancesin which there does not exist less restrictive means by whichto protect the public adequately from the threat of harm,i.e., where a definite sentence or a long-term offenderdesignation are insufficient. The essential question to bedetermined, then, is whether the sentencing sanctionsavailable pursuant to the long-term offender provisions aresufficient to reduce this threat to an acceptable level,despite the fact that the statutory criteria in s. 753(1)have been met.(Emphasis added)[43] The court concluded that it is possible that someoffenders will satisfy both the dangerous offender and long-term offender criteria and that an offender cannot bedeclared dangerous and sentenced to an indeterminate period ofdetention where the threat to the public \"can be reduced to anacceptable level\" through the long-term offender provisions:In order for the sentencing sanctions available pursuant tothe long-term offender provisions to reduce the threatassociated with an offender who satisfies the dangerousoffender criteria to an acceptable level, it must be possiblefor the same offender to satisfy both the dangerous offendercriteria and the long-term offender criteria . . .Almost every offender who satisfies the dangerous offendercriteria will satisfy the first two criteria in the long-termoffender provisions . . . In a certain percentage of thosecases there will also be a reasonable possibility of eventualcontrol of the risk in the community. In those instances inwhich the offender currently constitutes a threat to thelife, safety or physical or mental well-being of otherpersons yet there is a reasonable possibility of eventualcontrol of the risk in the community, an offender willsatisfy the criteria in both the dangerous offender and long-term offender provisions.In those instances where both the dangerous and long-termoffender provisions are satisfied, it may be that thesentencing sanctions available under the long-term offenderprovisions are capable of reducing the threat to the life,safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons toan acceptable [page734] level . . . If the public threat canbe reduced to an acceptable level through either adeterminate period of detention or a determinate period ofdetention followed by a long-term supervision order, asentencing judge cannot properly declare an offenderdangerous and sentence him or her to an indeterminate periodof detention.(Emphasis added)[44] In my view, placing an onus on the Crown to prove beyonda reasonable doubt that there is no reasonable possibility foreventual control of the risk an offender presents in thecommunity in the context of a dangerous offender applicationwould be inconsistent with Johnson, supra. Johnson holds that asentencing judge may exercise the discretion not to declare anoffender dangerous where the long-term offender criteria aremet. Those criteria include the requirement that the sentencingjudge be satisfied that there is a reasonable possibility ofeventual control of the risk that an offender presents in thecommunity. If the sentencing judge is uncertain whether thatrequirement is satisfied, Johnson indicates that the sentencingjudge should refuse to exercise the discretion not to declarethe offender dangerous based on the long-term offenderprovisions.[45] Further, in the light of Johnson, I am not persuadedthat the cases on which the respondent relies provide soundauthority for holding that there should be an onus on the Crownin dangerous offender applications to prove beyond a reasonabledoubt that there is no reasonable possibility of eventualcontrol of the risk that an offender presents in the community.The respondent relies on the following cases that have heldthat such an onus exists: R. v. B.R.B., 2002 BCCA 420 (CanLII), [2002] B.C.J. No. 2363,174 B.C.A.C. 243; R. v. A.P.A., 2003 BCCA 376 (CanLII), [2003] B.C.J. No. 1503, 184B.C.A.C. 268; R. v. Lemaigre, 2004 SKCA 125 (CanLII), [2004] S.J. No. 589, 189 C.C.C.(3d) 492 (C.A.); R. v. J.J.M., 2006 NBCA 39 (CanLII), [2006] N.B.J. No. 166, 208C.C.C (3d) 312 (C.A.); R. v. D.B.B., [2004] O.J. No. 1395, 62W.C.B. (2d) 247 (S.C.J.); and R. v. R.M., [2005] O.J. No. 4977,68 W.C.B. (2d) 78 (S.C.J.).[46] To the extent that these cases articulate a rationale,it appears to be rooted in jurisprudence interpreting thedangerous offender provisions as requiring the Crown to provebeyond a reasonable doubt that an offender's pattern of conductis substantially or pathologically intractable in order tosatisfy the dangerous offender criteria and equating thatrequirement with the impugned burden of proof: see e.g., B.R.B.at para. 11.[47] This was the approach taken by British Columbia Court ofAppeal in R. v. Johnson, 2001 BCCA 456 (CanLII), [2001] B.C.J. No. 2021, 159 B.C.A.C.255 (C.A). At para. 58, the court referred to the followingcomments made by La Forest J. in R. v. Lyons, 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R.309, [1987] S.C.J. No. 62, at para. 43, concerning s. 687 ofthe [page735] Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34, Part XXI, apredecessor to the current s. 653:Also explicit in one form or another in each subparagraph ofs. 687 is the requirement that the court must be satisfiedthat the pattern of conduct is substantially orpathologically intractable.[48] At para. 72 of its decision in Johnson, supra, theBritish Columbia Court of Appeal interpreted these comments asmeaning that treatment prospects had to be considered at thedesignation stage and that it would therefore be illogical torequire the sentencing judge to examine treatment prospectsonce again as part of a residual discretion not to declare anoffender dangerous. However, this approach was not adopted bythe Supreme Court of Canada in its decision in Johnson.Accordingly, I am not persuaded that I should follow theauthorities on which the respondent relies.[49] Moreover, in its post-Johnson decision in R. v. Wormell,2005 BCCA 328 (CanLII), [2005] B.C.J. No. 1289, 198 C.C.C. (3d) 252 (C.A.), leave toappeal refused [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 371, the British ColumbiaCourt of Appeal held that there is no onus on the Crown in adangerous offender proceeding to prove beyond a reasonabledoubt that there is no reasonable possibility of eventualcontrol of the risk an offender presents in the community. BothSouthin J.A. and Ryan J.A. indicated that it is not appropriateto approach the issue of whether there is a reasonablepossibility of eventual control of the risk an offenderpresents in the community from the perspective of who bears theburden of proof. In particular, Ryan J.A. stated the following[at para. 62]:It follows that I agree with Madam Justice Southin when shesays that it is not right to approach s. 753.1(1) with theburden of proof at the back of one's mind. Such an approachwas found not to be right in R. v. Proulx, [2000] 1 S.C.R.61, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449, when the court dealtwith the language of the conditional sentence provisions ofthe Criminal Code. Section 742.1 of the Code permits asentencing judge to impose a conditional sentence, if, amongother things, the court \"is satisfied that serving thesentence would not endanger the safety of the community\". (Emphasis added.) With respect to that language LamerC.J.C. said this, at paras. 120-21:The wording used in s. 742.1 does not attribute to eitherparty the onus of establishing the offender should orshould not receive a conditional sentence. To inform his orher decision about the appropriate sentence, the judge cantake into consideration all the evidence, no matter whoadduces it . . .In matters of sentencing, while each party is expected toestablish elements in support of its position as to theappropriate sentence that should be imposed, the ultimatedecision as to what constitutes the best disposition isleft to the discretion of the sentencing judge.For reasons that I will explain below, I agree with thesecomments. [page736][50] In the context of a dangerous offender application, theissue is whether the sentencing judge should exercise thediscretion not to declare an offender dangerous after thesentencing judge has found that the offender satisfies thestatutory criteria for that designation. As I have explained,the sentencing judge may exercise that discretion where he orshe is satisfied that the public threat can be reduced to anacceptable level through either the long-term offenderprovisions or a determinate sentence. This is not an issue thatrequires either party to satisfy a burden of proof; rather, itis an issue for the sentencing judge concerning whether toexercise his or her discretion based on the whole of theevidence adduced. Moreover, given the requirement that anassessment report under s. 752.1(2) of the Criminal Code befiled as a pre-condition to making either a dangerous offenderdesignation or a long-term offender designation, I see littlerisk that the sentencing judge will be left without evidenceaddressing the issue.[51] In the context of a stand-alone long-term offenderapplication, the language of the statute appears to suggest aburden on the Crown to prove affirmatively that there is areasonable prospect of eventual control of the offender in thecommunity: e.g., see R. v. Currie, 1997 CanLII 347 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 260, [1997]S.C.J. No. 10, and R. v. Guilford, [1999] O.J. No. 4894, 44W.C.B. (2d) 523 (S.C.J.). However, in my view, the requirementin s. 753.1 that there be a reasonable possibility of eventualcontrol of the risk the offender presents in the community isof a different character than the first two criteria in thatsection and I do not agree that it is necessary to approachthis criterion as imposing a burden of proof.[52] The first two criteria in s. 753.1 are similar to thecriteria in the dangerous offender provisions. They speak tothe level of risk the offender is likely to pose in the futurehaving regard to the offender's past conduct. They alsoestablish the justification for subjecting an offender to aspecial sentencing regime based on the need for publicprotection. Accordingly, these are matters that the Crownshould properly bear the onus of proving on the standard ofproof beyond a reasonable doubt.[53] By way of contrast, the third criterion in s. 753.1 isnot a justification for subjecting an offender to the long-termoffender sentencing regime. Rather, it appears to be aimedsolely at addressing whether the offender qualifies for a long-term offender designation as opposed to the more onerousdangerous offender designation. Importantly, as with thedangerous offender provisions, the long-term offenderprovisions give a sentencing judge a residual discretion toforego the more onerous designation where a lesser sanctionwould be sufficient to protect the public from the risk theoffender presents. [page737][54] Finally, I note that, in addition to Proulx, supra,there are other cases that have held that a requirement that acourt be \"satisfied\" of a particular matter does notnecessarily connote a standard of proof beyond a reasonabledoubt. See, e.g., R. v. M. (S.H.), 1989 CanLII 31 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 446, [1989]S.C.J. No. 93, 50 C.C.C. (3d) 503, in which McLachlin J. notedthat the concept of a standard of proof is \"typically concernedwith establishing whether something took place\" and is \"lesshelpful\" when one is engaged in balancing various factors andconsiderations. See also R. v. A.O; R. v. J.M., 2007 ONCA 144 (CanLII), [2007] O.J. No.800, 222 O.A.C. 38 (C.A.).[55] Viewed in the context of the foregoing factors, I see nonecessity or rationale for viewing the third criterion in s.753.1 as imposing a burden of proof.(ii) Is it necessary that there be a new dangerous offenderhearing?[56] Both parties argue that a new dangerous offender hearingis unnecessary. The Crown relies on the trial judge's findingthat the respondent meets the dangerous offender criteria andcontends that there was no evidence capable of supporting afinding that there was a reasonable possibility of eventualcontrol in the community. The respondent relies on the trialjudge's finding that he meets the long-term offender criteriaas a complete answer to the Crown's position. In addition, therespondent contends that the trial judge erred in holding thathe meets the dangerous offender criteria and that, in anyevent, there were other grounds upon which the trial judgecould have relied to decline to declare the respondentdangerous.[57] In my view, it is necessary that there be a newdangerous offender hearing. The trial judge's reasons spanapproximately 64 pages. However, his analysis is limited towhat is reproduced in para. 37 above and he made no findings offact. Given these circumstances and the context of this case,in my view, the trial judge's conclusions are not amenable toproper appellate review.[58] Although the trial judge found that the criteria for along-term offender designation in s. 753.1 were satisfied, itis not clear whether his finding was premised, at least inpart, on his erroneous conclusion that the Crown had failed tomeet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that thereis no reasonable possibility of eventual control of the riskthe respondent presents in the community.[59] The respondent submits that the facts of the predicateoffences were not of the same character as his prior offencesand, therefore, it was not open to the trial judge to find apattern of [page738] conduct sufficient to warrant a dangerousoffender designation. In addition, the respondent contends thatthere was no evidence capable of supporting a finding that therespondent's conduct had or would cause such severepsychological harm or physical injury as to warrant a dangerousoffender designation. I do not accept the respondent'ssubmission that these findings were unreasonable. However, Iconclude that the trial judge's failure to make findingsconcerning these issues and in relation to Dr. Bradford'sevidence concerning whether the respondent's conduct warrants adangerous offender designation, and his failure to explain thebasis on which he exercised his discretion to decline to make adangerous offender designation requires that there be a newdangerous offender hearing.V. Disposition[60] Based on the foregoing reasons, I would allow theappeal, set aside the trial judge's order, and direct thatthere be a new dangerous offender hearing.Appeal allowed."}

Colford for Her\nMajesty the Queen.Ms. K. Tremblett for Mr. Wheeler.JUDGEMENT OF GORMAN, P.C. J.INTRODUCTION:[1]Every year, countless women in this country are\nharassed, threatened and sometimes even killed by their former husbands/spouses/boyfriends.The primary method used by our courts to protect women from such men is the inclusion\nof “no contact conditions” through the issuing of probation orders and\nundertakings/recognizance.However, these orders are only effective if they\nare taken seriously by those who are required by law to comply with them and by\nthose who enforce them.As a result, when such an order is breached, the\nsentence imposed for it must reflect the seriousness of such an offence.In R. v. Bates (2000), 2000 CanLII 5759 (ON CA), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 321, for\ninstance, the Ontario Court of Appeal stressed \"how critical it is that\noffenders not breach court orders or their undertakings to the court while on\nrelease” (also see R. v. Skinner, [2002] N.J. No. 377 (C.A.)).[2]In this case, Mr. Wheeler was bound by two court orders which were designed\nto prevent him from having any contact with his former wife (Ms. Faye Wheeler).Mr. Wheeler ignored both of these orders and has pled guilty to having breached\nsections 733.1(1) and 811 of the Criminal Code of Canada, RSC\n1985 (the Criminal Code).[1]In R. v. A.M., [2007] N.J. No. 65, in\nattempting to rank such offences by their level of seriousness, I noted that\nwhen a breach of such an order involves “prohibited contact with a\nwitness or complainant”, this must be viewed as being particularly serious:Breaches of Court\norders must always be taken seriously. If the Court does not respond to them in\nan appropriate fashion, it should not expect those who are bound by them to\ntake them seriously or to comply with them. Having said this, not all breaches\nof a court order are of a similar magnitude. Those involving breaches of a\ncurfew are considerably less serious than those, for instance, involving\nprohibited contact with a witness or complainant in contravention of an\nundertaking or a victim in contravention of a probation order...[3]Crown counsel can play a crucial role in attempting to deal with the ongoing\nproblem of no contact orders being breached, but only if they recognize that their\nsubmissions can play an important role in how our courts deal with this issue.In R. v. Compton, [2007] N.J. No. 93, I noted that “Crown counsel\nhas the ability to expand the range of sentence for a particular offense\nthrough thorough and well considered sentencing submissions”:…it\nis important for Crown counsel to understand the importance that their\nsentencing submissions have in the development of ranges of sentence by the\njudiciary. Crown counsel has the ability to expand the range of sentence for a\nparticular offense through thorough and well considered sentencing submissions.\nHowever, Crown counsel can also cause the range of sentence for a particular\noffence to be reduced through sentencing submissions that fail to properly\nreflect the seriousness of an offence.[4]In this case, Crown counsel agreed to a joint submission (thirty days\nimprisonment) which woefully fails to reflect the seriousness of the two\noffences committed by Mr. Wheeler and which if accepted, would bring the\nadministration of justice into serious and long term disrepute.As a result, I\nam unable to accept the joint submission put forward by counsel.I have\nconcluded that a period of six months imprisonment is an appropriate sentence\nfor the two offences committed by Mr. Wheeler.Let me explain my reasons for\nthis conclusion by commencing with a review of the circumstances of the two\noffences committed by him.THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCES[5]On September 26, 2006, Mr. Wheeler was ordered to comply with a section\n810 Criminal Code recognizance.This order, which was imposedfor a period of twelve months, contained the following\nconditions:•do not contact or communicate in\nany manner, direct or indirect, with Faye Wheeler, unless invited by her; and•do not be within 50 metres of the\nresidence or place of employment of Faye Wheeler.[6]On June 6, 2007, Mr. Wheeler was convicted of making harassing telephone\ncalls to Ms. Wheeler, contrary to section 372 of the Criminal Code.He was also convicted of having breached the section 810 recognizance referred\nto earlier on two occasions and of having breached an undertaking, contrary to\nsection 145(3)(b) of the Criminal Code.For these offences, Mr.\nWheeler was placed on probation for a period of two years.This probation\norder contained the following conditions:•you must refrain from having any\ncontact or communication, of any form, with Faye Wheeler, except if it is in\nthe presence of legal counsel or any representative of Family Justice Services\nWestern; and•you must refrain from entering on\nor within Pratt Street in Corner Brook or the Western Regional Memorial Hospital in Corner Brook, except for seeking medical attention.[7]Ms. Wheeler lives on Pratt Street and is\nemployed at the hospital.[8]On August 22, 2007, at approximately 10:38 p.m., the Royal Newfoundland\nConstabulary received a complaint indicating that a breach of a court order was\nin “in progress.”When they arrived at Ms. Wheeler’s residence on Pratt Street, they observed Mr. Wheeler standing\non the front steps of her residence.Mr. Wheeler was arrested and he has been\nin custody since that time, having subsequently been denied judicial interim\nrelease.[9]Ms. Wheleer advised the police that Mr. Wheeler had breached the no contact\norders “on a number of occasions by contacting her a number of times.”[10]As regards these latter facts, though Mr. Wheeler took no issue with\ntheir accuracy, he has not been specifically charged with any offence to which\nthey relate.Thus, they constitute “uncharged but proven facts.”In R.\nv. Larche, 2006 SCC 56 (CanLII), [2006] 2 S.C.R. 762, the Supreme Court of Canada pointed out\nthat in Canada, offenders are only sentenced “in respect of crimes for which\nthey have been specifically charged and of which they have been validly\nconvicted.”However, the Court also noted that this general rule is subject to\nthe exception created by section 725(1)(c) of the Criminal Code.That section states:(1) In determining the sentence, a\ncourt(c) may consider any facts forming part of the\ncircumstances of the offence that could constitute the basis for a separate\ncharge.[11]The Supreme Court of Canada concluded in Larche, that\nthis section is a discretionary one which “allows the court to take into\nconsideration facts that could constitute the basis for a separate\ncharge that has not -or at least not yet - been laid.”The\nCourt also held that it allows a sentencing judge to “take into account as\naggravating factors other uncharged offences that satisfy its requirements.”The Court described the section’s requirements, as follows (at paragraph 47):Section\n725(1)(c) has three components, which may be broken down this way:\n\"In determining the sentence, a court ... [l] may consider any facts [2]\nforming part of the circumstances of the offence [3] that could constitute the\nbasis for a separate charge.\"The use of the word\n\"may\" signifies that the provision is discretionary, as I have\nalready mentioned. The requirements of \"forming part of the circumstances\nof the offence\" and the necessity that these facts be capable of\nconstituting \"the basis for a separate charge\" are two necessary\npreconditions for the exercise of that discretion.[12]As regards the words, “facts forming part of the circumstances of the\noffence”, the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that there are “two general\ncategories of cases where a sufficient connection may be said to exist.”The\nCourt described these categories in the following manner (at paragraphs 54 and\n55):Both res gestae\nand the phrase \"while committing\" are narrower than the expression\n\"facts forming part of the circumstances of the offence\" employed in\ns. 725(1)(c). The \"circumstances\" of an offence are more than\nthe immediate transaction in the course of which it transpires. Thus, in\naddition to encompassing the facts of a single transaction, s. 725(1)(c)\nalso applies, in my view, to the broader category of related facts that inform\nthe court about the \"circumstances\" of the offence more generally.\"Facts\"\n(or uncharged offences) of this sort that have occurred in various locations or\nat different times cannot properly be said to form part of the transaction\ncovered by the charge for which the offender is to be sentenced. Recourse to s.\n725(1)(c) may nevertheless be had where the facts in question bear so\nclose a connection to the offence charged that they form part of the\ncircumstances surrounding its commission. In determining whether they satisfy\nthis requirement of connexity, the court should give appropriate weight to\ntheir proximity in time and to their probative worth as evidence of system or\nof an unbroken pattern of criminal conduct.[13]In this particular\ncase, I am satisfied that section 725(1)(c) is applicable because the proven facts\nconcerning the extent of the contact Mr. Wheeler has had with Ms. Wheeler bears\nsuch a “close a connection to the offence[s] charged that they form part of the\ncircumstances surrounding [their] commission” and they illustrate an “unbroken\npattern of criminal conduct.”The uncharged but proven facts put forward by\nthe Crown occurred after the commencement of the court orders which constitute the\nbasis for the two charges to which Mr. Wheeler has pled guilty and they are of\na similar nature as those two offences.In addition, Mr. Wheeler will not\nsuffer any prejudice as a result of the Court considering these facts.He\nagreed that the Crown’s factual assertions were correct and took no objection\nto them forming part of the agreed facts presented to the Court for the\npurposes of sentencing.In addition, as a result of section 725(2) of the Criminal\nCode, Mr. Wheeler is protected from any further proceedings being taken\nagainst him in relation to these uncharged but proven facts.Thus, these facts\nwill be considered in imposing sentence.Pursuant to section 725(2)(b) of the Criminal\nCode, the two informations charging Mr. Wheeler with the two offences\nto which he has pled guilty will be endorsed as follows:In imposing\nsentence, the Court has considered that Mr. Wheeler had breached the respective\norders involved by contacting the complainant a number of times.[14]In Larche,\nthe Supreme Court of Canada indicated that when a sentencing Court exercises\nits jurisdiction to consider facts pursuant to section 725(1)(c) of the Criminal\nCode, these “uncharged but proven offences, if they are considered at\nall, will invariably be treated as ‘aggravating circumstances’ within the\nmeaning of s. 718.2(a) and related provisions of the Criminal Code.”In this case, the uncharged but proven facts/offences concerning the extent of\nthe contact that Mr. Wheeler had with Ms. Wheeler establishes a series of\noffences and that his conduct on August 22, 2007, cannot be considered as an\nisolated incident.Rather, it establishes an ongoing defiance of the Court’s\ntwo orders.This is an extremely aggravating factor in sentencing (see R.\nv. Angelillo, 2006 SCC 55 (CanLII), [2006] 2 S.C.R. 728, at paragraph 30).THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES[15]As pointed out earlier, both counsel requested that a period of thirty\ndays imprisonment be imposed.This submission was made on September 7, 2007.After\nthe joint submission was presented, I advised counsel that I had concerns with\nthe sentence being recommended.I informed them that I was willing to provide\nthem with an opportunity to make further submissions in support of their request.I also asked them to provide the Court with sentencing precedents which would\nsupport the sentence they were requesting, as neither counsel had made any\nreference to any sentencing precedents during their submissions.The sentence\nhearing was then adjourned to September 20, 2007.[16]On September 20, 2007, Crown counsel did not make any additional\nsubmissions nor present any sentencing precedents.Ms. Tremblett submitted\nthat the sentence proposed was proportionate and should be accepted by the\nCourt.She reminded the Court of the importance of plea negotiations and joint\nsubmissions.Finally, Ms. Tremblett submitted two sentencing precedents:\nR. v. White (1996), 145 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 46 (N.L.P.C.) and R.\nv. May, 2002 Carswell 1764 (B.C.P.C.).[17]In White, the accused entered pleas of guilty to the\noffences of assault and breach of probation.The victim, Mr. White’s former\nwife, had gone to his residence to pick up their children.Mr. White became\nupset and struck her on her back.At the time, he was subject to a probation\norder, but the judgement does not indicate if it included a no contact\ncondition.Mr. White had been convicted of previously assaulting her and of\nhaving breached an undertaking.[18]The trial judge imposed a period of two months imprisonment on each\noffence, to be served on a concurrent basis.However, no explanation was\nprovided as to why this period of custody was determined to be appropriate nor\nany indication as to why the sentences were ordered to be served on a\nconcurrent basis.[19]In May, the accused pled guilty to breaching a probation\norder which prohibited him from being within a certain distance of the\ncomplainant.The accused had been previously convicted of having breached an\norder issued pursuant to section 810 of the Criminal Code.The\njudgement does not indicate the exact nature of the relationship which existed\nbetween Mr. May and the complainant.[20]The trial judge accepted a joint submission that Mr. May be sentenced to\none day in custody (i.e., his appearance in court).[21]I do not find either of these judgements helpful.It is difficult\nto understand why such a sentence was imposed in May.It can hardly\nbe considered proportionate or consistent with the principles of sentencing set\nout in the Criminal Code.[22]In White, the offender did not have the history of\nbreaching court orders exhibited by Mr. Wheeler.[23]Having considered the precedents submitted, it\nis now time to consider the nature and importance of joint submissions.THE IMPORTANCE OF JOINT\nSUBMISSIONS[24]I recognize the important role that joint submissions play in\nthe administration of justice and the necessity of judges usually accepting\nthem.In R. v.\nO'Donnell, [2002] N.J. No. 333, I\nexplained the importance of joint submissions, and the presentation of\nprecedents in support, in the following manner:Guilty pleas are\nthe life blood of the Canadian criminal justice system.Without them\nthe system could not cope.Therefore, judges should generally accept\njoint submissions on sentence.Such submissions recognize the\nimportant role played by counsel in the sentencing process. When a joint\nsubmission is made, counsel should however, provide some authority to the court\nto establish that the sentence recommended is appropriate.In the\nabsence of the filing of such authorities, Crown counsel in particular, should\nalert the trial judge to the reason or rationale for the joint submission.This is particularly important when the submission, as in this case, is\none which is obviously below the standard which is normally\napplied.As pointed out by Madam Justice Dunn in R. v. Williams, [2001] N.J. No. 256,\n01T 0202 (N.L.S.C.), when a joint submission is made and it is on the \"low\nside of any range of sentence\" the court must pay \"closer\nscrutiny\" to it.[25]In R. v.\nDruken (2006), 2006 NLCA 67 (CanLII), 261 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 271(N.L.C.A.),\nthe Court of Appeal considered joint submissions and indicated that “a\nsentencing judge should depart from a joint submission by counsel only if\naccepting the submission would bring the administration of justice into\ndisrepute or would otherwise be contrary to the public interest” (at paragraphs\n9, 17, 18 and 19):When\nan accused pleads guilty, the uncertainties associated with a trial are avoided\nand a conviction is obtained. This is often achieved by agreement between Crown\nand defence counsel to a joint submission on sentence (a plea bargain). While a\nsentencing judge usually accepts the joint submission, he or she is not bound\nto do so. The courts have established a test to be applied by a judge in\ndetermining whether the joint submission should or should not be accepted.…To summarize, a\nsentencing judge should depart from a joint submission by counsel only if\naccepting the submission would bring the administration of justice into\ndisrepute or would otherwise be contrary to the public interest.In making this\ndetermination, the question of whether the sentence is unreasonable must be\nconsidered. This requires an assessment of the facts as presented to the court,\nnormally in the form of an agreed statement. Counsel must provide sufficient\nfacts to permit the sentencing judge to determine whether the sentence is\nreasonable in the circumstances. The court is bound by the agreed statement of\nfacts; the sentencing judge cannot \"find\" additional facts. As well,\nany inferences the judge may draw must follow clearly from what is set out in\nthe agreed statement. It is preferable that counsel provide a factual basis for\nthe judge to assess the proposed sentence that does not require the judge to\ndraw factual inferences.The acceptable\nrange of sentence must be such that the accused has an incentive to plead\nguilty, i.e. a quid pro quo. That requires an adjustment down from the\nnormal range of sentence to take account of the accused's agreement to forgo\nhis right to a trial. Of course, there must be some minimum, having regard to\nthe facts of each case, below which a proposed sentence cannot be accepted.[26]If the Court was to accept the joint submission made to it in this\ncase, it would leave itself in the position of imposing a sentence that it\nknows would utterly fail to reflect the seriousness of the breaches of the\ncourt orders which occurred.It would constitute the imposition of a sentence\nwhich would fail to have any specific or general deterrent value whatsoever.It\nwould send a clear message to the community that the Court does not take breaches\nof court orders seriously, even when they are committed against an offender’s\nvictim, shortly after a court order has been issued, by an offender who has a\nhistory of disobeying court orders.In short, acceptance of the joint submission\nplaced before the Court in this case would bring the administration of justice\ninto serious disrepute and it would be contrary to the public interest.THE CRIMINAL CODE'S SENTENCING\nPROVISIONS[27]Section 718\nof the Criminal Code states that the fundamental purpose of\nsentencing “is to contribute…to respect for the law and the maintenance of a\njust, peaceful, and safe society.”This is to be achieved by imposing\nsentences which have, among others, the following objectives:- separating\noffenders from society, where necessary;- denouncing\nunlawful conduct;- general\ndeterrence;-\nrehabilitation; and- the promoting of a “sense of\nresponsibility in offenders, andacknowledgement\nof the harm done to victims and the community.”[28]Section\n718.2(d) states that “an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less\nrestrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances” and section\n718.2(e) states that “all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are\nreasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with\nparticular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.”[29]Section 718.1 of the Criminal\nCode states that any sentence imposed must be “proportionate to the\ngravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.”[23]In R. v. Angelillo (2006), 2006 SCC 55 (CanLII), 214 C.C.C. (3d) 309\n(S.C.C.), the Supreme Court of Canada indicated that \"sentencing is an\nindividualized process in which the court must take into account not only the\ncircumstances of the offence, but also the specific circumstances of the\noffender.\"[30]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code indicates that any\nsentence imposed “must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the\ndegree of responsibility of the offender” and section 718.2(a)(ii) indicates\nthat:A\ncourt that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following\nprinciples(a)a sentence should be increased or reduced to account\nfor any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the\noffence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,(ii)\nevidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s\nspouse or common-law partner,shall\nbe deemed to be aggravating circumstances.[31]In R. v. Breen, No. 0807A-00200, September 19, 2007,\n(N.L.P.C.), Judge Porter, in imposing sentence for the offence of breach of undertaking,\nsaid:Breach\nof undertaking is a serious and prevalent offence in this Province.That\nprevalence is reflected in the jurisprudence, including in my own decisions in R. v. Newport, [2004] N.J. No. 37, R.v. Kelly,\n[2004] N.J. No. 18, R. v. Lewis, [2004] N.J. No. 25, R. v. Matthews,\n[2004] N.J. No. 35, R. v. Mayo, 2006 CanLII 19926 (NL PC), [2006] N.J. No. 165, and R. v. Young,\n[2006] N.J. No. 208.[32]In R. v. Gale, [2006] N.J. No. 87, I\nconsidered the range of sentenceapplicable to breach of undertaking offences.At paragraph 70, I\nconcluded:I\nconclude that the range of sentence for breach of undertaking is quite broad.\nIt often will fall within the range of one to three months, but it may extend\nbeyond this range when a complainant is contacted.RECENT SENTENCING PRECEDENTS FROM THE TRIAL DIVISION OF THE SUPREME\nCOURT OF NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR[33]A review of recent sentencing precedents form the Trial Division\nof the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador, which are binding upon this Court, illustrates\nthe unreasonableness of the joint submission presented in this case.Counsel\ndid not refer to any of these precedents.These precedents clearly indicate\nthat the joint submission presented to the Court in this case cannot be\naccepted.[34]In R. v. Suarak (2006), 2007 NLTD 5 (CanLII), 262 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 230\n(N.L.S.C.), for instance, the accused was convicted of the offences of assault\ncausing bodily harm, break and entry, two counts of breach of probation and\nthree counts of breach of a section 810 Criminal Code recognizance.The\ntrial judge imposed a period of nine years imprisonment.This included a\nperiod of one year imprisonment for each of the breaches of recognizance\noffences, to be served on a concurrent basis.[35]In R. v. S.G. (2006), 2006 NLTD 144 (CanLII), 260 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 332\n(N.L.S.C.), the accused pleaded\nguilty to two charges of breach of probation (pursuant to the Youth\nCriminal Justice Act, RSC 1985), three charges of breach of undertaking,\nassault and damage to property, contrary to the Criminal Code.The\ntrial judge imposed fines and a period of probation.An appeal by the Crown\nwas dismissed.In doing so, Mr. Justice Handrigan stated:There is nothing\ndemonstrably unfit about these sentences. Together they are a creative, fair\nand balanced response to the crimes that Mr. S.G. committed. They take into\naccount Mr. S.G.'s circumstances, his victims needs, and society's need for\nprotection. There is no basis for me to interfere. In short, the sentences fit\nthe crimes and the offender. I dismiss the appeal.[36]In R. v. Driscoll (2006), 2007 NLTD 1 (CanLII), 262 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 108\n(N.L.S.C.), the accused was convicted of the offences of assault, breach of\nprobation and breach of undertaking.The accused had a lengthy criminal\nrecord.The trial judge imposed a period of twenty-four months imprisonment.This\nincluded periods of six months imprisonment, to be served on a consecutive\nbasis, for both the breach of undertaking offence and the breach of\nprobation offence. In imposing these latter sentences, Mr. Justice Orsborn\nstated (at paragraphs 20, 21, 24 and 25):Both general and\nspecific deterrence are important. If the rule of law is to prevail, members of\nsociety must comply with the rules that govern us all. These rules include\ncourt orders such as probation orders directed at individuals. If individuals\nregard court orders as meaningless, our civilized method of governance and\ndispute resolution is placed in jeopardy. If a sentence does not properly\nreflect the importance of court orders, then how can that sentence, again to\nuse the words of s. 718, \"promote the fundamental purpose of contributing\nto respect for the law\"?An aggravating\nfeature here is Mr. Driscoll's demonstrated disregard for court orders. His\ncriminal record tells me that past sentences have had little or no effect. They\nhave not deterred Mr. Driscoll from continuing his disregard of society's\nrules. Will another sentence make any difference? Who knows? I can only hope\nthat a sentence that reflects the significant need for specific deterrence may\npersuade Mr. Driscoll to think twice before breaching any further order or any\ncondition of the probation order that he will be subject to.Society is\nentitled to expect that when an accused person is released from custody pending\ntrial, that person will comply with the conditions of his or her release. If an\naccused considers these obligations meaningless, then not only is society put\nat risk, but the system of pre-trial release will be brought into disrepute.Both general and\nspecific deterrence are significant considerations. Mr. Driscoll's lengthy\nhistory of breaching undertakings is an aggravating factor and emphasises the\nneed for specific deterrence. There are no mitigating factors. After\nconsidering the purposes and principles of sentencing, after reviewing the\nauthorities provided and taking into account the aggravating factor of the\nrecord of past breaches of undertakings, a fit sentence for the breach of\nundertaking given on April 18, 2006, is six months imprisonment. The total\nperiod of imprisonment from these sentences is 24 months.[37]In concluding that\nthe sentences imposed for the breach of undertaking and the breach of probation\noffences should be served on a consecutivebasis,\nMr. Justice Orsborn stated (at paragraph 26):These sentences\nshould be served consecutively. Unlike the situation in Holwell, the\nbreach of probation and breach of undertaking arise from two separate\nobligations, one in 2004 imposed by a judge, the other in 2006 accepted by Mr.\nDriscoll as a condition of his pre-trial release. Although the assault\nconviction grounds both breaches, they are separate offences with separate\nlegal elements. I note that in the authorities provided the breach - related\nsentences are generally consecutive to other sentences, subject to modification\nto accommodate totality.[38]In R. v. Sheppard (2006), 2006 NLTD 48 (CanLII), 255 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 207\n(N.L.S.C.), the accused was convicted of the offences of robbery and breach of\nprobation. The offender had a lengthy record for breach of probation offences.Mr.\nJustice LeBlanc imposed a period of six months imprisonment to be served\non a consecutive basis, for the breach of probation offence.[39]In R. v. Poker (2006), 2006 NLTD 154 (CanLII), 261 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 1\n(N.L.S.C.), the accused was convicted of the offences of assault with a weapon,\naggravated assault, and breach of probation.The accused had a lengthy\ncriminal record which contained numerous breaches of court orders.The trial\njudge imposed a period of twelve months incarceration for the breach of\nprobation offence, to be served on a concurrent basis.In doing so, Mr.\nJustice Fowler said that this \"is the last time that Mr. Poker will breach\na Court Order and not pay a price for it\" (also see R. v. Obed\n(2006), 2006 NLTD 155 (CanLII), 260 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 286\n(N.L.S.C.) and R.\nv. Whitten (2006), 2006 NLTD 34 (CanLII), 255 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 4\n(N.L.S.C.)).[40]In R. v. MacDonald,\n[2007] N.J. No. 115 (S.C.),\nthe accused was convicted of a number of violent offences in relation to a\nwoman that he had been involved in a relationship with.Mr. Justice LeBlanc\ndescribed the circumstances of the offences as follows:The accused has\nbeen charged and convicted of six separate offences. All of these offences\noccurred on August 15, 2006 and primarily involved offences related to a\nrelationship that Mr. MacDonald had with one of the victims in this case,\nDeborah King. He has been charged with committing an assault upon her. My\nunderstanding of what has been relied on as the basis of the assault is that he\ngrabbed her by the neck. At the time he possessed a firearm. As well, he was\ncharged with unlawfully confining Ms. King, Paul Guinchard and Ansel King in\nthe home of Ansel King, offences contrary to s. 279(2) of the Criminal Code.\nHe was also charged with uttering a threat to cause death or bodily harm to\nPaul Guinchard and with unlawfully evading the police by failing to stop his\nvehicle after the incident. Other charges include him using a firearm while\ncommitting the indictable offence of forcible confinement as well as breach of\nrecognizance, related to a condition to have no contact with Debbie King. With\nregard to this latter charge, it has been agreed by the parties that this\nmatter would be dealt with before this Court, albeit that it is an absolute\njurisdiction offence.[41]The offender had\neighteen previous convictions.Mr. Justice LeBlanc imposed a period of thirty-three\nmonths imprisonment, including a period of six months imprisonment, to\nbe served on a consecutive basis, for the breach of recognizance\noffence.In relation to that offence, Mr. Justice LeBlanc stated:Aggravating as\nwell is fact that the accused was at the time of these offences subject to a\nrecognizance to remain away from Ms. King. He has now been charged with a\nbreach of that recognizance. The breaching of a court order is extremely\nserious particularly where it relates to the protection of Ms. King, one of the\nvictims in this case.[42]These precedents must now be applied to\nthis case.ANALYSIS[43]The precedents referred to (except for S.G.),\nillustrate that lengthy periods of imprisonment have been imposed for the type\nof offences committed by Mr. Wheeler in this case, particularly when the\noffender has a history of refusing to comply with court orders.Though, Mr.\nWheeler’s criminal record is not nearly as extensive as those of the offenders\nin the precedents referred to, and though the Crown proceeded by way of summary\nconviction, Mr. Wheeler’s present convictions constitute the fourth and fifth\ntime that he has refused to comply with a court order and the third time that\nhe has breached the order issued by this Court pursuant to section 810 of the Criminal\nCode.In addition, his present offences involve prohibited contact\nwith a victim of one of his earlier crimes, and thus, they involve the most\nserious type of breach of court order which can occur.To accept the joint\nsubmission put forward in this case would constitute the imposing of a sentence which would fail to “properly\nreflect the importance of court orders” and which would therefore, fail to \"promote\nthe fundamental purpose of contributing to respect for the law.\"The\nimposition of sentence in these types of cases must include a denunciatory\ncomponent and the joint submission presented does not do so.[44]As pointed out earlier,\nMr. Wheeler was bound by two separate court orders on August 22, 2007.In Driscoll,\nMr. Justice Orsborn concluded that the periods of imprisonment imposed in that\ncase for the breaching of two separate court orders should be served on a\nconsecutive basis.I conclude that such an approach should also be taken in\nthis case.The reason I have reached this conclusion is that if concurrent\nperiods of imprisonment were imposed, then Mr. Wheeler would effectively receive\nno punishment for one of the offences committed by him.For instance, if Mr.\nWheeler had only been bound by a probation order on August 22, 2007, I would\nhave imposed a sentence of five months imprisonment for that offence because of\nthe nature of the breach which was committed (being found on a victim’s front\ndoor, late at night); Mr. Wheeler’s history of breaching court orders; the\nshort time period of time between the issuing of the probation order (June 6,\n2007) and Mr. Wheeler’s breaching of it; the precedents referred to earlier; and\nthe Crown’s decision to proceed by way of summary conviction (I would have then\nconsidered Mr. Wheeler’s plea of guilty and the time he has spent in custody\nawaiting the imposition of sentence).However, on August 22, 2007, Mr. Wheeler\nwas also bound by an order issued by this Court pursuant to section 810 of the Criminal\nCode.That offence cannot be ignored.A proportionate sentence must\nalso be imposed for that offence.Thus, I conclude that the appropriate approach\nto be taken in cases such as this one is to impose consecutive periods of\nimprisonment and then apply the totality principle of sentencing.In applying\nthis latter principle, the fact that the two court orders were breached by a\nsingle act of defiance becomes a significant mitigating factor.Having said\nthis, the fact that two separate orders were in place on August 22, 2007, must\nbe seen as a significant aggravating factor in applying the proportionality\nprinciple of sentencing and this must be reflected in the total sentence\nimposed.It must be understood that a sentence which fails to reflect the\nnumber and nature of the offences committed by an offender will be\ndisproportionate if it is too low.[45]As regards the two offences\ncommitted by Mr. Wheeler, I have considered his history of breaching court\norders and the nature of the breaches which occurred in this case.For the\nreasons provided, I have concluded that a period of three months imprisonment\nshould be imposed for the section 811 offence and a period of five months\nimprisonment for the section 733.1(1) offence.This latter sentence reflects the\nbrief period of time between the issuing of the probation order and the breaching\nof it by Mr. Wheeler.[46]The two offences committed\nby Mr. Wheeler occurred on the same date, but they relate to two separate orders.As these are separate and distinct offences, the periods of imprisonment\nimposed for them should be ordered to be served on a consecutive basis, with\nthe timing of the breaches being a consideration in applying the totality\nprinciple of sentencing.Imposing consecutive sentences would result in a\nperiod of eight months imprisonment being imposed.Is this a proportionate\nsentence?Considering the nature of Mr. Wheeler’s breaches of the two court\norders he was bound by, his history of ignoring court orders, and the\nrequirement for the Court to emphasize the sentencing principles of\ndenunciation, specific deterrence and general deterrence, I am satisfied that a\nlengthy period of imprisonment is required.However, considering that Mr.\nWheeler entered pleas of guilty to both offences and that they both relate to a\nsingle incident, I have concluded that a total period of six months\nimprisonment would be consistent with the applicable principles of sentencing.This is achieved by reducing the sentence imposed for the section 733.1(1)\noffence to three months imprisonment.PRE-SENTENCE CUSTODY[47]As pointed out earlier, Mr. Wheeler\nhas been in custody since he was arrested on August 22, 2007, as a result of\nhaving been denied judicial interim release.Normally, such pre-sentence\ncustody is credited at a two for one rate so as to recognize the nature and\nconsequences of such custody.In R. v. Provost (2006), 2006 NLCA 30 (CanLII), 256 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 205\n(N.L.C.A.), the Court of Appeal described the rationale for the rule as\nfollows:The usual practice is to give \"double credit\"\nor \"two-for-one\" for time served in custody awaiting trial.This\nrecognizes that \"none of the remission mechanisms contained in the Corrections\nand Conditional Release Act apply to that period of detention\"\n(Arbour, J. in R. v. Wust, 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455 at\npara. 45).It also recognizes that time spent on remand is often \"hard\ntime\", with even fewer amenities and opportunities than in prison[48]However, the Court of\nAppeal in Provost clearly indicated that no absolute rule\napplies.In this particular case, I conclude that Mr. Wheeler should not\nreceive double credit for the period of pre-sentence custody he has served.He\nhas been held in custody because of his failure to comply with court orders and\nhe has a history of ignoring court orders (see R. v. Roberts\n(2004), 2005 ABCA 11 (CanLII), 192 C.C.C. (3d) 462 (Alta. C.A.), at paragraph 67).Having\nsaid this, Mr. Wheeler should receive credit for the thirty days he has spent\nin pre-sentence custody.Thus, the period of custody imposed in this case is\nreduced by thirty days.Therefore, Mr. Wheeler is hereby sentenced to a period\nof five months imprisonment.This is achieved by reducing the sentence to be\nimposed for the section 733.1(1) offence, to a period of two months\nimprisonment.CONCLUSION[49]For the reasons provided herein, Mr. Wheeler is hereby sentenced to a\nperiod of five months imprisonment.A victim fine surcharge of $50.00 is\nimposed in relation to both offences.Mr. Wheeler has thirty days from today’s\ndate to pay the surcharges imposed.In light of the existing probation order,\nno such further probation order will be imposed.[50]Judgement accordingly.[1] The Crown proceeded by way of summary conviction in\nrelation to both offences."}

Dean Sinclair, Q.C., for the AppellantHal B. Wellsch for the RespondentLane J.A.I.Introduction[1]The Crown seeks leave to appeal a sentence imposed on the respondent for\none count of sexual assault (s. 271 of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985,\nc C-46) and one count of luring a child (s. 172.1(1)(a)). The respondent\nreceived a sentence of 14 months of incarceration for the sexual assault\nconviction, nine months concurrent for luring, a 10-year s. 109 firearms\nprohibition order, a DNA order, a 20-year SOIRA order and a $100\nsurcharge: see R v Miller, 2015 SKQB 221 (CanLII) [Miller]. At the time of\nthe offences in 2010, the complainant was 13 years of age and a Grade 8\nelementary school student. The respondent was 19 years of age when he started communicating\nwith the complainant and was 20 years of age when he sexually assaulted her\napproximately six months later.[2]We are all of the view the global sentence imposed was not a fit\nsentence and that the appeal must be allowed. It was conceded at the outset that\nthe 20-year duration of the SOIRA order was an error and that it must be\nextended and apply for the life of the offender (s. 490.013(2.1)). The\nsentence itself is increased to a global sentence of three years, which, as we\nwill explain, is at the low end of the sentencing range because of the unique\ncircumstances of the respondent.II.BACKGROUND[3]Neither party takes issue with the facts as set out in Miller,\nwhich are as follows:[4]The defendant takes no\nissue with the facts as described by the Crown. They can be fairly summarized\nas follows. The complainant was born in 1996 and was 13 years of age at the\ntime the offences occurred. She was then a Grade 8 student at a Regina\nelementary school. The complainant lived with her grandparents, who were her\nlegal guardians. Although they were her grandparents, the complainant referred\nto them as her “Mom and Dad”.[5]The defendant was born on\nJune 4, 1990. He was 19 years of age at the time the luring activity began and\nhad just attained the age of 20 before the admitted sexual assault occurred. It\nshould be noted that the defendant was born with a severe form of spina bifida,\na condition which has presented, and will continue to present, significant\nproblems for the defendant, both physically and otherwise. Considerable\nevidence was presented at the hearing about the defendant’s condition and its\npossible impact, or not, on the determination of his sentence. I will speak\nmore of this later in this judgment.[6]The defendant and the\ncomplainant became acquainted with each other in January 2010 through a website\nknown as “Tagged”. Crown counsel described Tagged as a social discovery website\nthat allows members to browse the profiles of other members and connect with\nthose members by email and live chat. The website is described as being open to\nusers aged 13 years and older.[7]The connection between\nthe defendant and the complainant began with online chat and eventually\nprogressed to include texting. As part of the evidence presented at the sentencing\nhearing, an 80 page message log was produced which recorded chat conversations\nbetween the complainant and the defendant during the period between April 10,\n2010 and May 1, 2010. The court was advised that the message log captures only\na portion of the total communication between the complainant and the defendant.[8]It should be noted that\nthe complainant’s grandfather passed away during the period of time covered by\nthe log. The significance of this fact is reflected in the Crown’s submission\nthat the defendant exploited the complainant’s vulnerability after her\ngrandfather’s passing in order to have his way with her. In support of this\nsubmission, the Crown directed the court’s attention to a number of passages\nafter the complainant’s grandfather passed away.[9]I reviewed the contents of\nthe entire log, not just passages directed to the court’s attention. While I do\nnot diminish the significance of the passages referenced by the Crown, I note\nthat, prior to the grandfather’s passing, there were conversations between the\ndefendant and the complainant that alluded to the prospect of sexual activity\nbetween the two. Although it is clear that the defendant was leading these\nconversations, it is equally clear that the complainant was more than a passive\nparticipant in them. The conversations in the early part of the log contain\nreferences to the prospect of the complainant sneaking out of her home and\nmeeting with the defendant as well as references to the prospect of sexual\nactivity between the two. It is clear that there was an emotional relationship\nbetween these two people and that it had become rather sexualized.[10]This relationship continued\nafter the death of the complainant’s grandfather. While it would be fair to say\nthat the relationship remained sexualized, it is equally fair to conclude that\nthe complainant displayed greater vulnerability than was shown in the earlier\nconversations. The log reflects frequent references to her grandfather (whom\nshe described as her “Dad”) and to the fact that she thought about and missed\nhim a great deal. There were also references to the complainant crying during\nthe conversations with the defendant. At one point in the conversation, two\ndays after her grandfather’s passing, the complainant confided that she had\nthought a lot about her father and about the defendant. In the course of this\nparticular chat conversation, the defendant asked the complainant whether she\nwanted to call him “Daddy”. In response, the complainant said she would “really\nlike that”. After that, the log contains numerous references where the\ncomplainant called the defendant “Daddy”.[11]As the log continues, the\nsexually charged nature of the relationship became more significant. The\ndefendant asked the complainant to pose nude in certain sexual positions for\nhim via a web camera. When the complainant refused, it is evident that the\ndefendant became upset. The chat conversations about sexual activity became\nmore explicit during this period. They included references to the prospect of\nthe defendant and the complainant engaging in intercourse.[12]It was also evident that\nthe complainant had developed a certain degree of emotional dependence on the\ndefendant. The complainant sought the defendant’s attention and became very concerned\nwhen he threatened to withdraw from the relationship entirely.[13]Aside from the electronic\nand online communication, there were occasions when the defendant and the\ncomplainant came together in person. On at least one of these occasions, the\ndefendant picked the complainant up in his car from her school. They spent time\ndriving around the city of Regina or visiting various parks in the city. There\nwere also occasions when the complainant would sneak out of her home in the\nearly morning hours and meet the defendant at a specific rendezvous point.[14]On the night of the\nadmitted sexual assault, the complainant snuck out of her house in the early\nmorning and met the defendant in his car approximately one block away. After\ndriving around Regina for a period of time, the defendant stopped the vehicle\nat an undisclosed location. After a period of time, the defendant and the\ncomplainant engaged in vaginal intercourse.[4]In its factum, the Crown referred to several conversations from the\nInternet chat log, which was introduced into evidence and demonstrated the complainant’s\nvulnerability, the effort of the respondent to persuade the child to\nparticipate in online and in-person sexual activities with him, and the fact\nthat the conversations went on for several months.[5]The Crown raises several grounds for appeal; however, for our purposes,\nthe significant issues are the application of the principle of parity and\nwhether the sentencing judge properly accounted for the luring offence in his\nsentencing of the respondent.[6]The Crown reiterates the position it took at trial where it sought a\nsentence of three years for the sexual assault and a further consecutive\nsentence of two years for the luring offence. Crown counsel relied on the\ndecisions of this Court in R v Revet, 2010 SKCA 71 (CanLII), 350 Sask R 292 [Revet]\nand R v Whiting, 2013 SKCA 101 (CanLII), 423 Sask R 177 [Whiting], and the\nOntario Court of Appeal decision in R v Bauer, 2013 ONCA 691 (CanLII), 119 OR\n(3d) 11 [Bauer], for the proposition that the starting point for\nsentences with respect to a major sexual assault is three years.[7]At the sentencing hearing, defence counsel argued for a suspended\nsentence followed by a lengthy probation order that it contended was\nappropriate given the respondent’s personal circumstances. On appeal, the respondent\nargued the sentence imposed was a fit sentence and the sentencing judge\nproperly relied on Whiting as the facts were “extremely similar to the\nfacts in this case” (respondent factum at para 16). The respondent says the sentencing\njudge was correct to impose concurrent sentences as this was a single\ntransaction that took place over a period of time.III.The SENTENCING JUDGE’S Decision[8]The sentencing judge found the Crown’s proposal of a total sentence of\nfive years of incarceration was “significantly disproportionate.” He properly\nrejected the respondent’s request for a conditional sentence and chose to\nimpose a global sentence of 14 months. In our view, in doing so, the sentencing\njudge failed to note the significant differences between this case and that of Whiting\n(upon which he had totally relied) and, as a result, erred in his application\nof the principle of parity. Further, although he imposed a concurrent sentence\nfor luring, he failed to consider the offence of luring as a discrete and separate\noffence in his analysis, which led him to impose a demonstrably unfit sentence.[9]The sentencing judge reviewed the aggravating and mitigating factors.\nWith respect to the aggravating factors, he found the respondent was fully\naware the complainant was an elementary school student because he picked her up\nat the school on more than one occasion. He noted, as well, the planning and\npersistence on the part of the respondent. He found the respondent spent\nconsiderable time grooming the complainant and moved her to the point where she\nbecame somewhat emotionally dependent on him. The complainant and her\ngrandmother described the significant negative impact the incident caused to her\nlife.[10]The sentencing judge turned to the mitigating factors, which included\nthe relative youth of the respondent and the fact he had no criminal record. He\nfound the “social maturity” of the respondent to be that of a 17- or\n18-year-old at the time of the offences, which he said was (at the very least)\na circumstance that gives added emphasis to the factor of the respondent’s relative\nyouth. This conclusion results from a 1991 scientific journal article reporting\non spina bifida and adolescence, which was presented to the Court by the respondent’s\ntrial counsel. The sentencing judge was “reasonably optimistic at the prospect\nof rehabilitation” and noted the respondent had the full support of his family.\nThe sentencing judge found that the respondent, in the intervening five years\nbetween when the charges were laid and the sentencing hearing, had more or less\nbeen able to get his life back on track, had become gainfully employed and was\ninvolved in more meaningful relationships with his peers, including a\nmeaningful relationship with a young woman. He accepted the respondent was\nremorseful for his actions.[11]The respondent’s pre-sentence report assessed him as a medium overall\nrisk for general reoffending and a moderate-low level of risk for reoffending\nsexually.[12]The respondent has spina bifida and his condition presents considerable\nchallenges with respect to what facilities would be able to accommodate him. At\nthe sentencing hearing, evidence was presented as to available accommodations\nat the federal level. The sentencing judge did not see the respondent’s\nphysical condition as a mitigating factor in light of the incarceral options.[13]The sentencing judge referenced the above noted three cases: Revet,\nBauer and Whiting.[14]Whiting is of significance to this appeal because the sentencing\njudge found it difficult to see “how this case justifies a stiffer disposition\nthan the one substituted by the Court of Appeal in Whiting. Except for\nthe circumstances of this defendant’s illness, the cases are quite similar” (Miller\nat para 48). He essentially relied on Whiting for his ultimate\ndetermination.IV.ANALYSIS[15]The sentencing judge indicated he accepted the three-year threshold for\na major sexual assault but, as stated above, relied completely on Whiting\nto impose a sentence of less than three years. In our view, however, he\nfell into error when finding the facts in this case were directly comparable to\nthose in Whiting.[16]In Whiting, the Crown had appealed a sentence of six months of\nincarceration in respect of a 19-year-old defendant who engaged in one act of\nsexual intercourse with a 14-year-old girl he had met through an online\ncomputer network. The offender had sexual conversations with the complainant over\nthe course of only one day, culminating in a meeting that night. They drove to\na parking lot where each removed their own clothing and commenced sexual\nintercourse. When the complainant asked the offender to stop, he did so. They\ngot dressed and returned to her home. The Court allowed the Crown’s appeal and\nimposed a sentence of 14 months.[17]This Court in Whiting found the offence to be a major sexual\nassault on a person incapable of providing consent and the starting point of\nthree years of incarceration expressly stated in Revet ought not to have\nbeen rejected by the trial judge. From this starting point, the Court noted the\nCrown had conceded the sentence should be in the range of 20 to 24 months. It\nnoted the personal circumstances of the offender including that he had a job,\nhad pursued his education and had a career with a responsible position. He had\nno prior criminal record, pled guilty and the Court noted the proximity in the\nages of the parties.[18]In Whiting, there were indications the complainant had been in\ncontrol, had taken off her own clothes after they parked and had stopped the\nsexual act after it had commenced by saying “no.” In this appeal the\ncomplainant was not in control and tried to delay the sexual act, did not\nremove her own clothes and was sexually assaulted despite saying “no” before\nthe act commenced. This is not to say the issue of control is material, but\nsimply to note a factual difference in the cases.[19]In Whiting, there was, in fact, only one day of online\nconversations between the offender and the complainant. That case did not\ninvolve the offence of luring. In the case before us, the luring formed a\nseparate offence and included behaviour that occurred over many months and\ninvolved a persistent emotional manipulation of a highly vulnerable child. In Whiting,\nthe age differential was not as significant; while here, the complainant was 13\nyears of age and the respondent 20. In our view, the cases are not comparable\nand thus the sentencing judge erred in his application of the principle of\nparity.[20]Moreover, even though the sentencing judge accepted this was a serious\nsexual assault, he failed to appreciate the full gravity of the offences by discounting\nthe luring charge when he found the facts to be “quite similar” to those in Whiting,\nwhere luring had not been charged. The sexual assault conviction would normally\nlead to a sentence in the range of three years (see Revet and Bauer).\nLuring is itself a very serious offence and if sentencing on a concurrent basis,\nas the sentencing judge did here, it ought to have been considered as elevating\nthe overall gravity of the offences and the respondent’s moral culpability in\ntheir commission. If sentencing on a consecutive basis, as was open to the\nsentencing judge in the circumstances of this case, an additional sentence over\nand above the threshold sentence of three years for the sexual assault would\nhave been appropriate. The sentencing judge failed to properly consider the\nluring charge.[21]In R v Woodward, 2011 ONCA 610 (CanLII), 284 OAC 151, Moldaver J.A., as he\nthen was, referring to that Court’s earlier decision in R v Jarvis\n(2006), 214 OAC 189 (CA), had this to say at para 58:[58] Even if Jarvis\ndid purport to set a range of 12 to 24 months for the offence of luring, that\nrange needs to be revised given the 2007 amendment in which Parliament doubled\nthe maximum punishment from 5 years to 10 years. Moreover, if it is shown\nthrough the introduction of properly-tendered evidence that the offence of\nluring has become a pervasive social problem, I believe that much stiffer sentences,\nin the range of three to five years, might well be warranted to deter, denounce\nand separate from society adult predators who would commit this insidious\ncrime.[22]In R v Hepburn, 2010 ABCA 157 (CanLII), 487 AR 222, the Alberta Court of\nAppeal, in a much more serious case, said the following:[50] The global effect of the sentence\nwas, of course, a relevant consideration. However, we agree with the Crown that\nthis sentence effectively gave the respondent a “free ride” for the pornography\ncharge and under-emphasized his deep degree of culpability for luring. A global\nsentence of two to three years on the luring charges was required,\nnotwithstanding his guilty plea, lack of a previous record, and relative youth\n(without which a significantly higher sentence would have been called for).\nAlthough he expressed remorse to the judge, Dr. Yacoub’s view that he was\nminimizing his culpability is especially troubling.[51] Given all this, as well as the\nfact that the statutory minimum of one year for counselling the making of\npornography applied here, in our view a consecutive\nsentence of at least one year ought to have been imposed for that charge. This\nis not to say that a consecutive sentence is always required when there is\nluring as well as counselling the making of pornography. The same result, for\nexample, can be achieved by considering the effect of individual sentences for\neach count and then adjusting to find an appropriate global sentence.(Emphasis in\noriginal)[23]One cannot overstate the seriousness of luring as an offence. There is\nsometimes a belief that anonymity merits no consequences and, therefore, any\npersuasive techniques are acceptable. The manipulation of vulnerable young\npeople through the anonymity of the Internet is a serious societal problem.\nSuch manipulation will often take place in the safety of the victim’s home and\nin the privacy of their own room. Here, anonymity was not a factor but\nmanipulation was. The offence of luring must be assessed as a separate crime and\nthe offender’s overall moral culpability for its commission must be reflected\nin the sentence. The sentencing judge, in this case, erred when he failed to do\nso. Had he done so, an additional sentence of a minimum of one year for that particular\noffence in these circumstances would not have been unfit. We note at the time\nthe offences were committed there was no minimum sentence for luring. Parliament\nhas now legislated a minimum punishment of one year imprisonment on a\nconviction for the indictable offence under s. 172.1(2) of the Criminal\nCode.[24]We are cognizant of the fundamental principle of proportionality in\ndetermining the fitness of a sentence to be imposed. We have also considered the\npersonal circumstances of the respondent, which make him more vulnerable in an institutional\nsetting. We note he has nearly completed the sentence imposed below and,\nbecause of this Crown appeal, he was not able to take advantage of the\nappropriate programs available. As well, we recognize the respondent has, as\nnoted by the sentencing judge, been able to get his life back on track over the\nintervening now nearly six years. In our view, in these particular\ncircumstances, a fit sentence is three years of imprisonment. This is at the\nlow end of the global sentencing range.[25]The Crown appeal is allowed,\nthe SOIRA order is extended to a lifetime order, and the sentence below\nis varied in that a sentence of three years of incarceration is substituted\ntherefor. We note the judge below received a written report from the Nursing\nManager for the Regina Correctional Centre and the viva voce testimony\nof the Executive Director of the Regional Psychiatric Centre (RPC) in Saskatoon\nas to the capability of those facilities to deal with the respondent’s medical\ncondition. The Executive Director, having been made aware of the respondent’s\ncondition, expressed considerable confidence in that facility’s ability to\nhandle each of the identified problems or to make any necessary referral. She\nwas also certain the sentence would be served at the RPC. Given the information\nCorrectional Service of Canada has, we would urge an immediate assessment so\nthe respondent can, if possible, be processed directly to the RPC.“Lane J.A.”Lane J.A.I concur.“Caldwell J.A.”Caldwell J.A.I concur.“Ryan-Froslie J.A.”Ryan-Froslie J.A."}

He claimed he was not driving, which\nremarkably he also told the conscientious citizen on the other case.His truck\nstalled-out on 4th Avenue and in a stopped position was at an angle\nto the curb.The offender was out of his truck to switch over the fuel tank\n“changing gas line” when the police approached him.Mr. Joe was intoxicated\nand very angry about being “arrested for nothing”.The issue of care and\ncontrol was closely examined by the court.Mr. Joe was found to be the driver.Even if I were wrong in that assessment of the evidence he was nonetheless in\ncare or control of his own truck that night.Mr. Joe was taken to the\ndetachment and there he blew 150 and 140 at 12:51 a.m. and 1:11 a.m.\nrespectively.[8]The Crown sought a global sentence of four to\nfive years for the two drinking and driving offences.The defence felt that\ntwo to three years would be sufficient.Both acknowledged the 19.5 months credit\nfor time in custody prior to sentence.[9]This offender has a horrendous record of 12\nprevious convictions for drinking and driving offences plus four convictions\nfor driving while prohibited and 14 convictions for failing to comply with\ncourt orders.His criminal history also includes violent and property related\noffences.The driver’s abstract from the Territorial government reveals a\nlengthy history of vehicle impoundments and suspensions, but no moving\nviolations.[10]Without any doubt whatsoever the principles of\nsentencing applicable to these cases are denunciation, deterrence and\nseparation from society.Rehabilitation takes a back seat and is of little\nconcern except insofar as it may piggy-back on specific deterrence.[11]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code reads\nas follows:A sentence must be\nproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of\nthe offender.[12]Although R. v. C. (A.M.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R.\n500 was decided before s. 718.1 was enacted, comments by Chief Justice Lamer at\npp. 557-558 reflect the same principle and are relevant in this situation:Retribution in a\ncriminal context, by contrast, represents an objective, reasoned and measured\ndetermination of an appropriate punishment which properly reflects the moral\nculpability of the offender having regard to the intentional risk-taking of the\noffender, the consequential harm caused by the offender and the normative\ncharacter of the offender’s conduct.Furthermore, unlike vengeance,\nretribution incorporates the principle of restraint; retribution requires the\nimposition of a just and appropriate punishment, and nothing more.[13]Courts all over the civilized world have\nexpressed great concern about the consequences of drinking and driving.Judge\nGorman in R. v. O’Connell (2015), 369 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 274 (Nfld.\nP.C.) quoted from an Australian case:“It ‘would be fatuous to suggest that\nany person in the community in the present day did not understand the very\ngreat risk to life and limb posed by people driving whilst intoxicated’ (see Pasznyk\nv. The Queen, [2014] VSCA 87 at paragraph 68.”[14]The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v.\nBernshaw, 1995 CanLII 150 (SCC), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 254, R. v. Beaudry, 2007 SCC 5 (CanLII) and R.\nv. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII), has in no uncertain terms condemned drinking and\ndriving.In both Lacasse and Beaudry, the Supreme Court returned\nto the “sad situation” as outlined by Cory J. in Bernshaw at para. 16.Every year, drunk\ndriving leaves a terrible trail of death, injury, heartbreak and destruction.From the point of view of numbers alone, it has a far greater impact on\nCanadian society than any other crime.In terms of the deaths and serious\ninjuries resulting in hospitalization, drunk driving is clearly the crime which\ncauses the most significant social loss to the country.[15]In October 2009, a majority of the United States\nSupreme Court decided not to review a decision of the Virginia Supreme Court on\nthe issue of detailed public tips given to the police and how the driver’s\nfourth Amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure were infringed:Virginia v. Harris, 558 U.S. 978 (2009).[16]Chief Justice Roberts along with the late\nJustice Scalia would have reviewed the case.In the course of the reasons of\nthe Chief Justice, he paid special heed to the dangers of drinking and driving\nincluding 13,000 deaths and State initiatives to encourage tips:There is no\nquestion that drunk driving is a serious and potentially deadly crime, as our\ncases have repeatedly emphasized.No one can seriously dispute the magnitude\nof the drunken driving problem or the States’ interest in eradicating it.Media reports of alcohol-related death and mutilation on the Nation’s roads are\nlegion.[17]I mention this observation from the United\nStates Supreme Court only for the purpose of showing international concern for\nthe drinking and driving issue.[18]In a neighbouring jurisdiction, the Court of\nAppeals of Alaska also wrote of the seriousness of these crimes in Miller v.\nState of Alaska, 1996 WL 685760, an unpublished opinion.Miller,\nlike in R. v. Woloshyn, 2006 BCCA 228 (CanLII) (as discussed in paragraph\n36), involved impaired driving causing death, in fact two deaths caused\nby Miller and one by Woloshyn.Unlike Woloshyn, Miller had no prior felony record\nbut several speeding offences and a previous impaired conviction.The\npredicate offence involved the operation of a boat.Miller was sentenced to\nserve 12 years with an additional “32 years of suspended time”.[19]The Alaska court spoke of the courts’ duty to\nexpressly disapprove “the reckless acts of drinking drivers”.If the criminal\njustice system is to reduce the alarming frequency of drunken driving manslaughters,\nclear and consistent notice must be served that the conduct involved in such\ncases will not be tolerated by the law…both as an expression of community\ncondemnation and as a deterrent to other potential offenders…[20]R. v. Richardson and\nothers, [2006] EWCA Crim 3186 is a decision from England.The Court dealt\nwith four men and one woman and addressed the aspects of sentencing for\ndrinking and driving causing death.In the course of their reasons at\nparagraph 22, the Court discussed the obvious central concern, namely driving\nafter consuming alcohol:The consumption of\nalcohol is deliberate.Everyone knows, or should know, that the consumption of\neven small quantities of alcohol undermines the ability of any driver to apply\nhis full concentration to the road.Where the consumption is high, it is\neffectively extinguished.Alcohol makes a driver personally unfit to drive,\nand the car of which he is in con becomes as dangerous with him at the wheel as\nif it were subject to a serious known, potentially fatal, mechanical defect.Looking at the matter broadly, there is never any acceptable excuse for driving\na vehicle when the ability to do so properly is impaired by alcohol or drugs.That is the critical ingredient of this offence. …[21]The cases from the\nSupreme Court of Canada, other courts throughout Canada, and the world\ngenerally are universal in their condemnation of drinking and driving.It is a\ntotally needless and senseless offence, causing untold and immeasurable harm.While rehabilitation must never be completely lost sight of, the paramount\nconsiderations on sentencing are denunciation and deterrence.[22]There was some glimmer of hope expressed in 2007\nby the Supreme Court in Beaudry at para 42:The situation in\nCanada has improved since Cory J. made this damning observation, but only\nbecause both the authorities and society itself have made extensive efforts to\nraise public awareness and crack down on impaired driving.[23]In R. v. Schmidt,\n2012 YKSC 17 (CanLII), Veale J. analyzed some statistics and observed the following with\nexcerpts from paragraphs 25 and 26:[25] … Despite the\nstatistics fluctuating from year to year, one can conclude that the problem of\nalcohol – involvement or drinking and driving in the Yukon is, at the very\nleast persistent.[26] … Alcohol and\ndrug impaired driving is a concern in the Yukon.[24]Just two months later\nin R. v. Vallee, 2012 YKTC 92 (CanLII), I expressed agreement with the\nobservation of Mr. Justice Veale.[25]In R. v. Lacasse,\nthree-and-one-half years later, the Supreme Court of Canada overturned a Quebec\nCourt of Appeal decision and largely restored the sentencing decision of Judge\nCouture of the Court of Quebec.Judge Courture had considered the local\nsituation as a factor in his decision and emphasized that impaired driving was\na [translation] “scourge” in the area.Indeed, in the Beauce region in which\nMr. Lacasse committed his offences, there were a “large number of offences\nrelated to drinking and driving.”Any inclination that the situation of\nimpaired driving crimes was going down was certainly not alluded to by the\nSupreme Court of Canada as it was in Beaudry.[26]In the present case,\nunlike Schmidt, no statistics were presented.Nonetheless, it is my\nobservation, as a longstanding deputy judge in this jurisdiction, that the\nproblem is certainly not getting any better.For example, while presiding in\nthe Whitehorse docket court on 11 May 2016, there were 35 individuals on the\nlist.Of all the federal statutes including the Controlled Drugs and\nSubstances Act, 1996 c. 19 and the Criminal Code, and of all the\nTerritorial statutes, clearly seven of the 35 were facing at least one drinking\nand driving charge.[27]R. v. Donnessey (Y.T.C.A.), [1990] Y.J. No. 138 is a\ndecision of the Yukon Court of Appeal which has offered substantial guidance\nover the last 25 years or so.The respondent had six prior drinking and\ndriving offences, was 60 years old, married, steadily employed and was in\ndanger of “losing his trapline”.[28]Mr. Donnessey was on an\naccess road and his lights “were turned on and off as the vehicle passed the\npatrol car.”There were no other driving irregularities.He blew 180 and 200.[29]The Yukon Court of\nAppeal quoted with strong approval the statement set forth in R. v. Wise,\n[1988] B.C.J. 1990 (C.A.), from R. v. McVeigh, (1985), 1985 CanLII 115 (ON CA), 22 C.C.C. (3d)\n145 (Ont. C.A.).[30]In McVeigh,\nMacKinnon A.C.J.O. made it abundantly clear how courts should deal with\noffences at the “lower end”:…it is the conduct\nof the accused, not just the consequences, that is the criminality punished. …\nThe public should not have to wait until members of the public are killed\nbefore the courts’ repudiation of the conduct that led to the killing is made\nclear.It is trite to say that every drinking driver is a potential killer.[31]The Yukon Court of\nAppeal allowed the Crown appeal and increased the Donnessey sentence\nfrom three months imprisonment plus one-year driving prohibition to two years\nless a day imprisonment and a three-year driving prohibition.[32]The pendulum does not\nalways swing to the left.Most courts have responded responsibly to the\ncarnage so unnecessarily caused by impaired drivers.[33]Since McVeigh in\n1985, the Ontario Court of Appeal made the following pronouncement in R. v.\nJunkert, 2010 ONCA 549 (CanLII) at para. 46:In recent years\nthere has been an upward trend in the length of sentences imposed for drinking\nand driving offences.The reasons for this trend can be attributed to\nsociety’s abhorrence for the often tragic consequences that result when\nindividuals choose to drink and drive, thereby putting the lives and safety of\nothers at risk.[34][35]In the\nnationally highly publicized case of Marco Michael Muzzo, Madam Justice Fuerst\nin her decision, R. v. Muzzo, 2016 ONSC 2068 (CanLII) at paragraph 69 had this to\nsay:The second\nproposition that emerges from the jurisprudence is that sentences for impaired\ndriving causing death have increased in recent years.This reflects society’s\nabhorrence for the often tragic consequences of drinking and driving, as well\nas concern that even though the dangers of impaired driving are increasingly\nevident, the problem of drinking and driving persists. …[35]The Court in Woloshyn\nreminded us of what sets drinking and driving apart from most other offences.Madam Justice Ryan referred to her decision in R. v. Johnson,(1996) 1996 CanLII 3148 (BC CA), 112\nC.C.C. (3d) 225 (B.C.C.A.), where she stated at paragraph 30:Drinking-driving\ncausing death or bodily harm offences are senseless crimes because they are so\neasily avoided and at the same time they are so easily committed by ordinary\ncitizens.They are unlike any other crimes in the sense that nothing much can\nbe offered to justify driving drunk.Crimes of theft may be motivated by\npoverty, crimes of assault may be motivated by fear, but what excuse can be\noffered for driving drunk, except that alcohol allowed the offender to lose all\nsense of judgment?It is for this reason that the communities rightfully\nexpress their outrage when victims are killed or injured as a result of such\nconduct.It is for this reason that both deterrence and denunciation are legitimate\nobjectives to pursue for this type of offence.[36]Further in Johnson,\nMadam Justice Huddart added the following reasoning at paragraphs 59 and 60:[59] In assessing\nmoral blameworthiness, I would, however, place the emphasis less on the\nhorrific consequences that are a risk undertaken by every person who drinks and\ndrives, and more on that which makes the drunk driver morally culpable.[60] The moral\nblameworthiness of a drunk who drives is in not seeking treatment for his\nalcoholism, in getting behind the driver’s wheel of a motor vehicle, and in not\nputting in place safeguards to prevent him from driving when drunk, just as\nwould a person with other health problems that make driving an exceptionally\ndangerous activity.It is that irresponsible behaviour society seeks to\ndenounce.It is that irresponsible behaviour that encroaches on our society’s\ncode of values as expressed in the Criminal Code.[37]The British Columbia\nCourt of Appeal in Woloshyn made it abundantly clear that “there are\ncases where the rehabilitation of the offender will take precedence as the\nappropriate objective in sentencing.This is not one of those cases … because\nthe gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender are so\ngreat that the sentence must communicate society’s condemnation of this\nconduct”. (paras. 18 – 19).[38]Similarly here, as to\nrehabilitation taking precedence, “this is not one of those cases”.[39]In Woloshyn the\nsentence was increased by the Court of Appeal from two years’ to four years’ imprisonment,\nand in Johnson from three years’ to five years’ imprisonment.Both of\nthese cases involved deaths, as did Lacasse.However, it is important\nto always bear in mind the overall sentencing scheme and to impose meaningful\nsentences even when there is no death or bodily harm caused (Donnessey, McVeigh,\nR. v. Vold, (1990) CanLII 1201 (BCCA)).[40]It is not necessary for\nParliament to have increased this particular maximum punishment for the courts\nto impose generally higher sentences recognizing the harm done to society by\ndrinking drivers.Thus, offenders such as Mr. Joe with horrendous records will\nbe approaching sentences in the upper range.Their culpability and moral blameworthiness\nare extremely high.[41]This offender is not a\nhopeless alcoholic with nothing going for him.He is a well-spoken, highly\ntalented artist and was able to stay sober for eight and one half years.[42]The Crown’s position is\nfor a global sentence in the range of four to five years less time served.Realistically, Mr. Joe and other notorious repeat offenders should be looking\nat seven to eight years; however, there are a number of mitigating factors and\nthe totality principle to deal with.[43]The late guilty plea on\nthe refusal charge is a minor consideration.More important are the age and\nhealth of Mr. Joe.While rehabilitation is far less important, it is\nrecognized that there would be far more control over him and better protection\nfor the public if he were subject to a lengthy driving prohibition order and\nthe maximum probation order of three years with strict and practical terms.Furthermore, by allowing him to serve a territorial sentence, he would have\ncommunity and family supports nearby and not be in an isolated way in B.C.[44]The imposition of a\nseven year sentence, for example, three years on the refusal charge with four\nyears consecutive on the breathalyzer charge would probably be considered\nexcessive and represent on my part a rejection of the totality principle.[45]The highest court in Newfoundland\nand Labrador in R. v. Hutchings, 2012 NLCA 2 (CanLII), set out an exhaustive set\nof guidelines for the totality principle at paragraph 84:84The foregoing analysis, as well as the\nfact that the Ruby formulation which was referred to in M.(C.A.),\npre-dated ss. 718.1 and 718.2(c), requires a restatement of the applicable\napproach. I would state the following as guidelines for the analytical approach\nto be taken henceforth:1.When sentencing for multiple offences, the sentencing judge should commence by\nidentifying a proper sentence for each offence, applying proper sentencing\nprinciples.2.The judge should then consider whether any of the individual sentences should\nbe made consecutive or concurrent on the ground that they constitute a single\ncriminal adventure, without consideration of the totality principle at this\nstage.3.Whenever, following the determinations in steps 1 and 2, the imposition of two\nor more sentences, to be served consecutively, is indicated, the application of\nthe totality principle is potentially engaged. The sentencing judge must\ntherefore turn his or her mind to its application.4.The approach is to take one last look at the combined sentence to determine\nwhether it is unduly long or harsh, in the sense that it is disproportionate to\nthe gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.5.In determining whether the combined sentence is unduly long or harsh and not\nproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of\nthe offender, the sentencing court should, to the extent of their relevance in\nthe particular circumstances of the case, take into account, and balance, the\nfollowing factors:(a)the length of the combined sentence in relation\nto the normal level of sentence for the most serious of the individual offences\ninvolved;(b)the number and gravity of the offences involved;(c)the offender's criminal record;(d)the impact of the combined sentence on the\noffender's prospects for rehabilitation, in the sense that it may be harsh or\ncrushing;(e)such other factors as may be appropriate to\nconsider to ensure that the combined sentence is proportionate to the gravity\nof the offences and the offender's degree of responsibility.6.Where the sentencing judge concludes, in light of the application of those factors\nidentified in Step 5 that are deemed to be relevant, that the combined sentence\nis unduly long or harsh and not proportionate to the gravity of the offences\nand the offender's degree of responsibility, the judge should proceed to\ndetermine the extent to which the combined sentence should be reduced to\nachieve a proper totality. If, on the other hand, the judge concludes that the\ncombined sentence is not unduly long or harsh, the sentence must stand.7.Where the sentencing court determines that it is appropriate to reduce the\ncombined sentence to achieve a proper totality, it should first attempt to\nadjust one or more of the sentences by making it or them concurrent with other\nsentences, but if that does not achieve the proper result, the court may in addition,\nor instead, reduce the length of an individual sentence below what it would\notherwise have been.8.In imposing individual sentences adjusted for totality, the judge should be\ncareful to identify:(a)the sentences that are regarded as appropriate\nfor each individual offence applying proper sentencing principles, without\nconsiderations of totality;(b)the degree to which sentences have been made\nconcurrent on the basis that they constitute a single criminal adventure; and(c)the methodology employed to achieve the proper\ntotality that is indicated, identifying which individual sentences are, for\nthis purpose, to be made concurrent or to be otherwise reduced.9.Finally, the sentencing judge should indicate whether one or more of the\nresulting sentences should be further reduced to reflect any credit for\npre-trial custody and if so, by how much.[46]That decision\nacknowledged the preference of the general approach taken in R. v. Li,\n2009 BCCA 85 (CanLII).Mr. Li was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment on five serious drug\ncharges.The sentence was upheld on appeal.In the course of their reasons\nthe B.C. Court of Appeal wrote at paragraphs 28 and 52:28Thus,\nthere is a two-stage approach to sentencing an offender convicted of multiple\noffences. The first stage is to determine the appropriate sentence for each\noffence, and decide whether the individual sentences should be made consecutive\nor concurrent. If consecutive sentences are imposed, then the second stage is\nto determine whether the sentences, in the aggregate, offend the totality\nprinciple. If the sentence, as a whole, is unduly harsh or disproportionate,\nthen the length of the individual sentences should be adjusted in order to\narrive at an appropriate global sentence. See R. v. P.P.H.,\n2003 BCCA 591 (CanLII).…52Thus, it is the principle of\nproportionality, as applied through the totality principle, which governs the\nimposition of a \"just and appropriate\" sentence. That requires an\noverall consideration of the gravity of the offence and the culpability of the\noffender.[47]With regard to the two\ndrinking and driving offences before me, the maximum sentence is five years on\neach.While various maximum sentences for such offences have been increased by\nParliament over the years since Donnessey in 1990, the five-year maximum\nby indictment remains the same.[48]The Court is well aware\nof R. v. Cheddesingh, 2004 SCC 16 (CanLII).We are not attempting to place\nlabels such as “worst offender” or “worst offence”.Rather, what is truly\nimportant is the harm caused by impaired drivers and the moral blameworthiness\nof this offender.His moral blameworthiness is compounded by his efforts to\navoid blame by falsely claiming that someone else was driving on both occasions.[49]Remaining to be\njudicially considered is s. 718(2)(e) of the Criminal Code which reads\nas follows:718.2 A court that imposes a sentence\nshall also take into consideration the following principles:…(e) all\navailable sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the\ncircumstances and consistent with the harm done to victims or to the community\nshould be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the\ncircumstances of Aboriginal offenders.[50]We have had the benefit\nof a thorough, detailed and reliable R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688 Report\nprepared by Mark Stevens which clearly helps us understand something of the\nlife and family background of Arthur Joe.[51]The fact that Mr. Joe\nwas horribly abused as a child in residential schools does not relieve him from\nresponsibility for these offences.Nor, in my view, does it “reduce his moral\nculpability, in keeping with the jurisprudence” (see para. 33 of R. v. Charlie,\n2015 YKCA 3 (CanLII)).[52]The degree of moral\nblameworthiness is extremely high.Unlike Franklin Charlie, this offender does\nnot suffer from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.Indeed, as pointed out above, Mr. Joe\nis very aware of his issues, is well spoken, and despite being an alcoholic,\nwas able to remain sober for eight and one half years according to his Gladue\nReport.This is reflected in his criminal record showing a gap between 2005\nand 2014, only a part of which was time being served in a federal penitentiary.[53]In R. v. Schinkel,\n2015 YKCA 2 (CanLII), at paras. 25, 26 and 27, the Court wrote of Gladue\nconsiderations and proportionality.[54]The background of this\nparticular offender is rife with Gladue factors as were the backgrounds\nof Mr. Ipeelee and Mr. Ladue (paras. 2, 3, 19-21 of R. v. Ipeelee,\n2012 SCC 13 (CanLII)).[55]Born in the winter of\n1952, Arthur Joe hails from a noble line of the Champagne and Aishihik First\nNations.His great-grandfather, Chief Isaac, had profitable dealings with the\ngold rush stampeders almost 120 years ago.Grandparents, Albert Isaac and\nElsie Johnson, largely raised Arthur Joe, whose biological father was “likely a\nmember of the Canadian Air Force” and had no involvement.His mother, Jenny\nJoe Isaac, and stepfather drank, and “Jenny froze to death when Arthur was nine\nyears old”.Thus, he was largely raised in a good, traditional home by his\ngrandparents, and spent solid quality time with them also on the land absorbing\nan “idyllic” life and learning his First Nation’s language.[56]His life was shattered\nat age five when he was removed and sent to the Lower Post residential school\nin northern B.C. “one of the more repressive and brutal residential schools in\nCanada” where he was forced to stay for 10 years.This deeply affected him\never since.His brother and a sister were compelled to attend there too.The\nlatter committed suicide while the former “drank herself to death”.[57]The sexual and physical\nabuse unmercifully and criminally forced on him built up a lot of hatred in\nthis youth towards the Roman Catholic Church and the RCMP. As Mr. Joe\nexplained:It’s just people\nin uniforms that trigger me off.Everything happened to me … any and all the\nabuse there is. I suffered the mental, the physical, the spiritual, the\nemotional, [and] the sexual.[58]Even a move to Coudert\nHall in Whitehorse for a couple of years did not improve his victimized lot.His drinking started possibly as early as five years of age and by his late\nteens he was an alcoholic, unable to hold down regular employment.[59]His relationships\nsuffered.Another heavy tragedy was visited on him when his second partner,\nwho had longstanding alcohol abuse issues, died in police cells of bronchial\npneumonia.She had, at least one time before, during her many stays in the\ncells, shown that she was “prone to seizures.”Thus, to this day, Mr. Joe\nfeels strongly that the RCMP was responsible for her death.[60]Towards the end of the Gladue\nreport under the heading Next Steps, Mr. Stevens presented a succinct\nsummary:Arthur readily\nadmits that he has to overcome a number of barriers to success, not the least\nof which is his addiction to alcohol.He is also still clearly struggling with\nthe trauma of residential school and other events in his life, including the\nuntimely death of his mother, two of his siblings, and the death of his partner\nin police custody.He carries with him a huge amount of resentment towards\nrepresentatives of the justice system, which he believes is a self-propagating\ninstrument of colonialism designed to oppress First Nations’ people in ways\nthat will not promote their rehabilitation.He has not fully accepted\nresponsibility for the offences he is dealing today because he feels that he\nhas been “railroaded” by a system that is inherently racist.Given his life\ncircumstances, Arthur’s anger and resentment are entirely understandable.[61]The Supreme Court of\nCanada has reminded trial judges of their duties in paragraphs 86 and 87 from Ipeelee:86In\naddition to being contrary to this Court's direction in Gladue,\na sentencing judge's failure to apply s. 718.2(e) in\nthe context of serious offences raises several questions. First, what offences\nare to be considered \"serious\" for this purpose? As Ms. Pelletier\npoints out: \"Statutorily speaking, there is no such thing as a 'serious'\noffence. The Code does not make a distinction\nbetween serious and non-serious crimes. There is also no legal test for\ndetermining what should be considered 'serious'\" (R. Pelletier, \"The\nNullification of Section 718.2(e): Aggravating Aboriginal Over-representation\nin Canadian Prisons\" (2001), 39 Osgoode Hall L.J. 469, at p. 479). Trying to carve out an\nexception from Gladue for serious offences would\ninevitably lead to inconsistency in the jurisprudence due to \"the relative\nease with which a sentencing judge could deem any number of offences to be\n'serious'\" (Pelletier, at p. 479). It would also deprive s. 718.2(e) of much of its remedial power, given its focus on\nreducing overreliance on incarceration. A second question arises: Who are\ncourts sentencing if not the offender standing in front of them? If the\noffender is Aboriginal, then courts must consider all of the circumstances of\nthat offender, including the unique circumstances described in Gladue. There is no sense comparing the sentence that a\nparticular Aboriginal offender would receive to the [page486] sentence that\nsome hypothetical non-Aboriginal offender would receive, because there is only\none offender standing before the court.87The sentencing judge\nhas a statutory duty, imposed by s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code, to consider the unique circumstances of\nAboriginal offenders. Failure to apply Gladue in any\ncase involving an Aboriginal offender runs afoul of this statutory obligation.\nAs these reasons have explained, such a failure would also result in a sentence\nthat was not fit and was not consistent with the fundamental principle of\nproportionality. Therefore, application of the Gladue\nprinciples is required in every case involving an Aboriginal offender,\nincluding breach of an LTSO, and a failure to do so constitutes an error\njustifying appellate intervention.[62]I am not suggesting\nthat drinking and driving offences be categorized as “serious”, as opposed to\nvarious crimes of violence.Who is being sentenced here is Mr. Joe for the\ncrimes he committed.In this rare case of a notoriously repeat drinking driver,\nit is my view that he should have almost no particular consideration afforded\nto him as an aboriginal offender, regardless of how lifelong miseries were\nforced on him by residential schools and integration.While not totally\nignoring Gladue, I would rate it as infinitesimal in and of itself.It\nwas but one of other factors which kept him away from a federal penitentiary.[63]For a person with now 14\ndrinking and driving offences, there is really no other option than a lengthy\nperiod of imprisonment.Given the universally accepted grave and serious\nconcerns about impaired driving, it cannot be said that with such repeat\noffenders there is an “overreliance on incarceration”. Indeed there is no\nevidence before me that aboriginal offenders are over-represented in jail on\naccount of drinking and driving offences.[64]It is only because of\nhis sincere desire to help others, age, health and ability to support himself\nthrough his considerable artistic talent that I am not sentencing him to a\nglobal sentence of seven years.The Crown had sought a sentence of four to\nfive years in a federal penitentiary while the defence pressed for two to three\nyears.Both acknowledged the 19.5 months of credit for time spent in custody\nprior to sentence.[65]Mr. Joe’s only family,\ncommunity and current professional support is here in this territory.[66]I use the phraseology\nof Rothstein J., dissenting in part in Ipeelee at paragraph 154.I\ndo not absolve Mr. Joe for his own conduct.Also in the dissent at\nparagraph 131:…However, as in all cases,\nthis must be done with protection of the public as the paramount concern;\nAboriginal communities are not a separate category entitled to less protection\nbecause the offender is Aboriginal. …[67]Indeed what must be\nremembered in this case, is that we are dealing with drinking and driving\noffences on two of the busiest thoroughfares north of 60.The public to be\nprotected includes First Nations people, other Canadians and tourists from all\nover the world.[68]Given his age and\nunconscionable record, I believe the ends of justice are best served by\ncurtailing the freedoms of Mr. Joe for as long as reasonably and fairly\npossible in terms of imprisonment, strict probation and a prohibition order\nwhich will effectively prevent him from lawfully driving for the rest of his\nlife.[69]As to s. 259 the\nmaximum duration would be life.It is not unheard of to impose prohibition\norders of 10 years or more.In R. v. Hunt (2001), 2001 CanLII 33789 (NL SCTD), 207 Nfld. \u0026\nP.E.I.R. 104 (Nfld. S.C.), LeBlanc J. of the Supreme Court Trial Division\nimposed a 15-year driving prohibition on a 47-year-old man with a far lesser\ncriminal record than Mr. Joe and on a similar breathalyzer offence.[70]Mr. Arthur Frankie Joe\nis hereby sentenced to 22 months’ imprisonment on the s. 254(5) offence from\nJanuary 2014, five days consecutive on the s. 145(5.1) offence and 21 months\nconsecutive on the s. 253(1)(b) offence from October 2014.On the latter\ncharge, he is given credit of 19.5 months for pre-sentence custody.There are\nconcurrent 10-year driving prohibitions on the s. 254(5) and s. 253(1)(b)\noffences.The 10 years is “plus any period to which the offender is sentenced\nto imprisonment” pursuant to s. 259(1)(c) and further to the directions of the\nSupreme Court of Canada in Lacasse.Driving on a highway is a\nprivilege, not a right.This is a privilege which is essentially taken away\nfrom this offender on account of this order, his age, and the unlikelihood that\nhe would ever be insurable.[71]The victim surcharges\nare set at $200 where we are dealing with procedure by indictment.Mr. Joe\nwill have the means to pay if given sufficient time.I am not making these\nsurcharges payable forthwith.The funds go towards worthwhile programmes in\nthis territory.Accordingly, this offender will be given three years to pay\n$600.[72]By imposing a very high\nterritorial sentence, the Court is able to better control the behaviour of Mr.\nJoe for a longer time.If the Court had accepted the Crown’s position even at\nthe high end, five years with the time served, the offender would have gone to\na federal penitentiary for about 40 months and thus not be subject to a\nprobation order at all.With this sentence there is a realistic control and\nsupervision of Mr. Joe for about 59 months, not taking into account in either\nscenario early release from the penitentiary or the prison.[73]The probation order of\nthree years is comprehensive but not oppressive.Serious consideration was\ngiven to the conditions based on the Gladue Report, his record and his\nabilities.The order has been carefully crafted to discourage Mr. Joe from\ncommitting further offences and thereby protect the public.It also gives him\nan opportunity to help people out, as he so adamantly stated he wants to do.[74]The following are the\nprobation conditions:1.Keep the peace and be\nof good behaviour;2.Appear before the court\nwhen required to do so by the court;3.Notify the Probation Officer, in advance,\nof any change of name or address, and, promptly, of any change in employment or\noccupation;4.Remain within the Yukon unless you obtain\nwritten permission from your Probation Officer or the court;5.Report to a Probation Officer immediately\nupon your release from custody and thereafter, when and in the manner directed\nby the probation Officer;6.Reside as approved by your Probation\nOfficer;7.Not possess or consume alcohol and/or\ncontrolled drugs or substances that have not been prescribed for you by a\nmedical doctor.Provide a sample of your breath for the purpose of analysis\nupon demand by a peace officer who has reason to believe that you may have\nfailed to comply with this condition;8.Not attend any premises whose primary\npurpose is the sale of alcohol including any liquor store, off sales, bar, pub,\ntavern, lounge or nightclub;9.Attend and actively participate in all\nassessment and counselling programs as directed by your Probation Officer, and\ncomplete them to the satisfaction of your Probation Officer, for the following\nissues:alcohol abuse, and anger management, and provide consents to release\ninformation to your Probation Officer regarding your participation in any\nprogram you have been directed to do pursuant to this condition;10. Perform eighty (80) hours of community\nservice as directed by your Probation Officer or such other person as your\nProbation Officer may designate.This community service is to be completed no\nlater than one (1) year before the end of this order.Any hours spent in\nprogramming may be applied to your community service at the discretion of your\nProbation Officer; and11. Not to be present in any motor vehicle when\nan occupant has any alcohol in his or her body.________________________________LUTHER\nT.C.J."}

Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, Arbour, J., speaking for the Court\nsaid:Triers\nof fact, whether juries or judges, have considerable leeway in their\nappreciation of the evidence and the proper inferences to be drawn therefrom,\nin their assessment of the credibility of witnesses, and in their ultimate\nassessment of whether the Crown’s case is made out, overall, beyond a\nreasonable doubt.Any judicial system must tolerate reasonable\ndifferences of opinion on factual issues.Consequently, all factual findings\nare open to the trier of fact, except unreasonable ones embodied in a legally\nbinding conviction.Although reasonable people may disagree about their\nappreciation of the facts, a conviction, which conveys legality, authority and\nfinality, is not something about which reasonable people may disagree.A\nconviction cannot be unreasonable, except as a matter of law, in which case it\nmust be overturned.[12]An appeal judge should direct his or her mind to whether there was evidence to\nsupport the findings of fact by the trial judge.See R. v. G.J.G.\n2002 NBCA 99 (CanLII), [2002] 254 N.B.R. (2d) 131; R. v. Lanteigne (E.)\n(1997), 1997 CanLII 9568 (NB CA), 189 N.B.R. (2d) 235 (C.A.)\nper Bastarache J.A. (as he then was) at paras 7 to 9; R. v. Schriver\n(1983), 49 N.B.R. (2d) 364 (C.A.) per\nStratton J.A. (as he then was) at paras. 4 and 5; and R. v. Sabine,\n[2000] N.B.J. No. 46(C.A.) per\nDrapeau J.A.[13]In R. v. Francoueur 1983 N.B.R. (2d) 239 (N.B.Q.B.) Daigle, J., as he then was, at page 246 cited Estey, J. in R. v.\nHarper 1982 CanLII 11 (SCC), 40 N.R. 255, at 268 as to the role and powers of an appellate\ntribunal:The role and the powers of an appellate tribunal have long\nbeen the subject of numerous commentaries by appeal court judges, but Estey, J.\nvery recently again clarified the scope of these powers in R. v. Harper:An appellate tribunal has neither the duty nor the right to\nreassess evidence at trial for the purpose of determining guilt or\ninnocence.The duty of the appellate tribunal does however include a\nreview of the record below in order to determine whether the trial court has\nproperly directed itself to all the evidence bearing on the relevant\nissues.Where the record, including the reasons for judgment, discloses a\nlack of appreciation of relevant evidence and more particularly the complete\ndisregard of such evidence, then it falls upon the reviewing tribunal to\nintercede.[14]In my opinion, the trial judge in this case directed\nhis attention to the relevant evidence and applied proper legal principles in\nassessing the evidence presented to the court.[15]While an appeal court must assess the reasonableness\nof the verdict it must not substitute its own view of the evidence for that of\nthe trial judge, especially in matters involving findings of credibility.A\ntrial judge observes and hears the witnesses and is in a better position to\nassess matters of credibility and cogency than an appeal court judge who see\nthe words on a transcript.[16]Findings as to credibility can be reviewed by an\nappellate court but only with great deference: R. v. W. (R.),\n1992 CanLII 56 (SCC), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122 (S.C.C.).An appeal court should only interfere if there\nis something to indicate an inherent improbability in the testimony relied on\nby the trial judge: R. v. B.(J.N.), 1991 CanLII 111 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 66 (S.C.C.).[17]In my opinion, in this case the trial judge correctly\napplied the facts to the appropriate legal principles under consideration and\nwhen referring to the total body of evidence found the Appellant, beyond a\nreasonable doubt, committed the acts alleged, thereby finding him guilty.[18]Based upon these well established standards of\nappellate review, I cannot say that the verdict of guilty in this case was an\nunreasonable verdict, or that it was not supported by the evidence.The trial\njudge did not make a palpable and overriding or manifest error.[19]The Appellant’s next grounds of appeal can all be\ndealt with together.These grounds of appeal are:“…did not produce the video tape they said they had.No\nfinger-prints taken of pool cue which they said was used.Never let the 2\nwitnesses from Dooly’s testify Ronny Inkpen \u0026 Allmon.”[20]Crown Counsel says he is not aware of the videotapes\nto which the Appellant is referring.He says that the Appellant was given full\ndisclosure through his trial counsel, Allen Doyle, an experienced criminal\nlawyer.Although the trial witnesses made references to a pool cue held by the\nAppellant, the trial judge did not convict the Appellant of the assault with a\nweapon charge but only of an assault by summary conviction pursuant to section\n41 of the Criminal Code.Accordingly, whether\nthere were or were not finger-prints on the pool cue, is irrelevant in these\ncircumstances.[21]The Crown is not required to call all possible\nwitnesses that may have been present at the time of the offence: R. v. Cook\n[1997] 1 S.C.R. 1143.The Appellant has a right to call evidence on\nhis own behalf which he did.In my opinion, if the Appellant felt the two\nnamed witnesses had relevant evidence then the onus is upon him to call them as\nwitnesses.He says at this appeal hearing that his lawyer told him he did not\nneed those two witnesses, Mr. Inkpen and Mr. Allmon.[22]The Appellant’s next ground of appeal is set out as\n“Judges actual words on decision were based on my reputation.”, “…acting like\n“Steven Seagall”.Crown Counsel asserts that the evidence at trial from the\nwitnesses, especially Ms. Wood and her husband, was that the Appellant did have\na reputation as someone who can be difficult to deal with, however, it is\nasserted by Crown Counsel that the findings of the trial judge in this regard\nwere based upon the evidence that was before him and not the reputation that\nthe Appellant may have had with others.Crown Counsel asserts that the trial\njudge’s reference to “Steven Seagall” was made in reference to the way that the\nAppellant acted on this particular occasion in the altercation with Mr. Wood\n(see Judgment/Sentencing Transcript at pages 5 – 6).Based on this transcript\nof the trial, I agree with the assertions made by Crown Counsel in this regard.[23]The Appellant’s next ground of appeal is that the\ntrial judge, “Remanded me for 1 ½ month because of drinking (No\nstipulations)”.In this regard, the Appellant was remanded by Judge McNamee on\nOctober 30th, 2007 following a bail hearing.At that time the\nAppellant was represented by defense counsel, Mr. Doyle.Accordingly, this\nparticular ground of appeal has no application to the convictions entered by\nthe trial judge, Judge Tonning, and which are the subject of this appeal.[24]As to the Appellant’s final ground of appeal, “also\nwasn’t read my rights”, Corporal Milner in his evidence stated that he read the\nAppellant his Charter and Caution (see page 118 of Transcript).Mr. Mallory at\nthis appeal hearing acknowledged that Corporal Milner read him his Charter and\nCaution.[25]In my opinion, the findings of the trial judge were\nclearly supported by the evidence before him and accordingly the convictions\nwere properly entered against the Appellant.I accept the trial judge’s\nassessment of credibility and his verdict as being reasonable.There was no\nerror of law.[26]In the result, for these reasons, the appeal is\ndismissed.The Cross Appeal of Sentence[27]The Respondent argues that the sentence imposed by\nthe trial judge was inordinately low given the seriousness of the offences for\nwhich the Appellant was convicted and that the trial judge failed to give\nsufficient weight to the principle of general and specific deterrence.[28]I allow the Respondent’s leave to appeal the sentence\nimposed and will deal with the cross appeal now.[29]The Appellant at the time of sentencing had an\nextensive criminal record for similar type of offences which record extends\nover a long period of time.The Respondent argues that the offences for which\nthe Appellant was convicted were serious and consistent with the Appellants\nprevious convictions.The Crown asserts that the trial judge, in imposing a\nthree year suspended sentence, failed to adequately address the sentencing\nprinciples of deterrence.The Crown acknowledges that at the time of\nsentencing the trial judge imposed a thirty day sentence for the four offences\nthat occurred on July 3rd, 2007, which consisted of three charges\n(assault of a peace officer, s. 270(1)(a) and damaging a police vehicle, s.\n430(4)(b)).It is also acknowledged by the Crown that the trial judge took\ninto account the one and one half months of pre-trial remand time in arriving\nat his sentence.However, the Crown asserts in light of the fact that the\nAppellant was convicted of six different offences occurring on two separate\noccasions, the sentence imposed was inordinately low.[30]At the sentencing of the Appellant Crown Counsel\nasked for a period of incarceration and that Mr. Mallory not be on the premises\nknown as Dooly’s, nor have any contact with the witnesses who testified at\ntrial.No specific incarceration period was requested by the Crown.[31]With respect to a jail sentence, the trial judge\nemphasized: “it’s important to bear in mind that Mr. Mallory has been in\ncustody for some particular period of time.”The trial judge then sentenced\nthe Appellant to 30 days in jail on all counts pursuant to section 270(1)(a) of\nthe Criminal Code to run concurrently to one another.The trial\njudge again emphasized: “Again bearing in mind he’s been in custody for a month\nand a half which almost equates to three months.”[32]In R. v. Proulx 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII)\n[2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, Chief Justice Lamer writes:A\nsentencing judge still enjoys a position of advantage over an appellate judge\nin being able to directly assess the sentencing submissions of both the Crown\nand the offender. A sentencing judge also possesses the unique qualifications\nof experience and judgment from having served on the front lines of our criminal\njustice system. Perhaps most importantly, the sentencing judge will normally\npreside near or within the community which has suffered the consequences of the\noffender's crime. As such, the sentencing judge will have a strong sense of the\nparticular blend of sentencing goals that will be \"just and\nappropriate\" for the protection of that community. The determination of a\njust and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which attempts to balance\ncarefully the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of\nthe offender and the circumstances of the offence, while at all times taking\ninto account the needs and current conditions of and in the community.The discretion of a sentencing judge should thus not be interfered with\nlightly.[33]In the result the argument in favour of deference to a sentencing judge remains\ncompelling and I choose to invoke deference in this case.The Respondent’s\nCross Appeal as to sentence is accordingly dismissed._______________________________Peter S.

Lobel and C Long, for the Defendant)))HEARD: December3, 2003 and January 7, 8 and 9, 2004.REASONS\nFOR SENTENCECUMMING J.The circumstances of the offence[1]An order has been made as to non-publication of names\npursuant to s. 486 (3) of the Criminal Code R.S. c. C-34 as am.[2]The offender, T.T.E., has been convicted of the\nsexual assault of his step-daughter, N.N. The circumstances of the offence are\nset forth in my Reasons for Decision dated July 23, 2003, a copy of which has\nbeen filed as exhibit # 9 to this sentencing. The complainant victim had\nrecently become the step-daughter of the offender at the time of the offence.\nShe was 15 years old when she arrived in Toronto from Kenya June 15, 1999. The\nassault took place in August, 1999.[3]Ms. N.N. was in an uncertain position in her new family upon her arrival\nand rejoining her mother, Ms. L.T., the spouse of Mr. T.T.E., after an absence\nof several years. She was in a new and strange country and culture and part of\na new family. Mr. T.T.E. took advantage of a situation where the victim was\nvulnerable and isolated. A victim impact statement has been filed as Exhibit\n#2.[4]The impact upon the victim has been horrendous. While she lives with her\nmother, the relationship is apparently very difficult and the inference I make\nfrom the victim impact statement is that the mother unfortunately resents her\ndaughter having come forward with her accusation which has led to the demise of\nthe marriage. As well, the victim states that her two younger brothers often\nberate her, call her names and accuse her of falsely bringing the charge\nagainst their father, the offender. I sense the victim has been ignored if not\nshunned by the Southern Sudanese/Canadian community in Toronto.The circumstances of the offender[5]As set forth in my Reasons for Decision filed as\nExhibit #9, and in the Pre-Sentence Report filed as Exhibit #8, Mr. T.T.E., now\n44 years of age, was born in Sudan, left that country with his family to go to\nUganda when he was 10 because of the civil war, and returned when he was 15. He\nreportedly had a good family upbringing, notwithstanding the war. He completed\ntwo years at university in Sudan.[6]Mr. T.T.E. arrived in Canada as a refugee in 1987 and became a Canadian\ncitizen in 1995. He met L.T. in 1991 and they were married in 1993. The\nmarriage produced two sons, now ages 8 and 10. The family was joined by N. and\nher sister, J., daughters of L.T., who came from Kenya, in June, 1999.[7]Mr. T.T.E. assumed the role of father to the girls. Mr. T.T.E. has a\ngood work history and has present employment as a delivery co-ordinator. This\nis confirmed by Mr. M.M., a manager with Mr. T.T.E.’s present employer, (…),\nLeaving aside the offence, Mr. T.T.E. reportedly has been a good father to the\nchildren and his personal life seems to have been exemplary.[8]Mr. T.T.E. is consistently described by others as a responsible citizen\nand a valuable member of the Toronto community. He attends church regularly.\nThere is no suggestion of substance abuse. The family seemed to be doing well\nand prospering until the tragic event of the single sexual assault which\nundoubtedly has changed each of their lives profoundly. The marriage has now\nbroken down. The victim continues to live with her mother.[9]Mr. T.T.E. now has a new romantic relationship developed over the past\nyear. This person, Ms. R.I.A. has an out-of-Canada 15 year old daughter whom\nshe intends to sponsor to bring to Canada. She writes that she believes “he\nposes no threat to any child and neither will he be a threat to my daughter.”\n(Exhibit #7)[10]Mr. T.T.E. shows no remorse; but in fairness to him this is consistent\nwith his continuing position that he is innocent. His estranged wife, L.T.,\nstates that he continues to have a strong and positive relationship with their\ntwo young sons.[11]Dr. Derek Pallandi testified as an expert witness at the sentencing\nhearing. He is Staff Forensic Psychiatrist, Oak Ridge Division, Mental Health\nCentre, Penetanguishene. His report was entered as Exhibit # 4. He interviewed Mr.\nT.T.E. for some 3.25 hours, and as collateral information read my Reasons for\nDecision and the pre-sentence report. He also had Mr. T.T.E. undergo\nphallometric testing. Dr. Pallandi concluded that based on the present\nassessment and collateral information “it is not warranted to diagnosis [sic] Mr.\nT.T.E. with any psychiatric illness, including any sexual disorder. Neither an\nestablished pattern of offending, nor the present examination provide evidence\nfor such.”[12]Dr. Pallandi’s report (Exhibit #4) states that theresults of Mr. T.T.E.’s phallometric testing were\nindeterminate on two occasions. Active suppression of responding, anxiety, or a\npervasive low rate of response to any stimuli are all plausible explanations\nfor these findings.[13]However, it was determined during the course of\nDr. Pallandi giving evidence that it was the view of Dr. P. Klassen, Head of\nthe Phallometric Laboratory, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Clarke\nInstitute of Psychiatry thatPhallometric retesting produced an invalid test\nprofile, likely due to manipulation of test outcome, as there were notable\nattempts at response suppression. (Exhibit#5).[14]Dr. Pallandi estimated the risk of\nsexual-re-offending using the STATIC-99 “developed specifically for determining\nrisk of sexual recidivism amongst child molesters and rapists.” Mr. T.T.E.’s\nscore translated to a risk of sexual recidivism of 5%, 11% and 13% at 5, 10 and\n15 years and a risk of violent recidivism of 6%, 12% and 15% at 5, 10 and 15\nyears.[15]Dr. Pallandi testified that from a probabilities standpoint, a low score\ncauses less concern of risk than a higher score.[16]Dr. Pallandi concludes that, in his opinion, Mr. T.T.E. “would be a\nsuitable candidate for community supervision.”[17]I mention that Dr. Pallandi seems to emphasize that Mr. T.T.E. appears\nto not have any tendency toward paraphilic behaivour. However, the victim in\nthis case, while a child in a legal sense, being only 15, is in my view more\naptly described as a young adult woman.[18]A letter was signed by some 23 individuals (Exhibit #6) attesting to the\nactive role Mr. T.T.E. plays in performing volunteer activities in the\ncommunity. Letters from the President of the Sudanese-Canadian Community\nOrganization of Greater Toronto, Manuela Pechova, and a friend from the Toronto\nSouth Sudanese community, Huda Abuzeid, to the same effect, were put in\nevidence. (Exhibits #10and #11).[19]Mr. John Yebuga testified on behalf of Mr. T.T.E.’s character. He\ntestified that the Canadian/ African community is shocked at the allegations\nagainst Mr. T.T.E. It is quite obvious that Mr.Yebuga and others have made real\nefforts to help Mr. T.T.E. and L.T. in these difficult times for both.[20]Ms. Mary Duku testified. She is the head of “Music Africa”, an\norganization promoting African music and culture. She first met Mr. T.T.E. when\nhe was a student in Sudan. She met him again about 1989 in Toronto. She\ntestified as to his willingness to help her and others in the many community\nactivities.[21]The Reverend Thomas Kedini testified. He is a pastor with the Anglican\nchurch serving the Toronto Sudanese community. He is a close friend of Mr.\nT.T.E. and L.T. and has been the surety for Mr. T.T.E. since his arrest. He too\ntestified as to Mr. T.T.E. being a good person who is a leader in the South\nSudanese community in Toronto. Reverend Kedini was advised as to the\nallegations of the complainant by her mother, L.T., who came to seek his\nassistance, well before the police became involved. Reverend Kedini attended at\nthe family residence for prayer sessions, in a commendable effort to restore\nthe normal functioning of the family.[22]As an aside, I make the following observation. Given L.T.’s\ncommunication to Reverend Kedini I infer that it was very probable that Mr.\nT.T.E. discussed the matter of the allegations with Reverend Kedini and his\nwife, or both, and knew the purpose of the prayer sessions. It is remarkable\nthat a man who claims his innocence would engage in prayer sessions for a month\nor so in an effort to deal with serious family problems without openly\naddressing the issue of the allegations in the presence of his wife, Reverend\nKedini and the complainant.[23]I recognize the sincerity and honesty of all the witnesses on behalf of Mr.\nT.T.E. in this sentencing. It is obvious that many persons believe in the\ngoodness of Mr. T.T.E. and they quite rightfully have expressed this belief on\nhis behalf. Without diminishing this observation, I feel I must mention, with\nregret, that my sense of the situation is that at the same time the community\nexpressing its support for Mr. T.T.E. has ignored, and perhaps even shunned,\nthe young victim of the crime which he has been found guilty of. I am not at\nall sure why this is so and I can only speculate. It may be that they do not\nbelieve the complainant’s allegations; it may be that they attach a stigma to\nthe complainant; it may be that the complainant is not viewed as a member of\nthe South Sudanese community because she is from Kenya, or it may simply be\nthat they simply do not see it as appropriate or necessary to approach and\nassist the complainant or that they have simply and inadvertently overlooked\nher needs. I do not fault them. However, because I accept the sincerity of\ntheir efforts to assist in bringing whatever healing is possible to this family\ntragedy, I mention as an aside that in my view, it is critical to not only\nassist the offender and his spouse, but also to assist and support the\ncomplainant.[24]I accept the testimony of the witnesses that Mr. T.T.E. is a good and\nvaluable member of the community and a good father to his two sons. These\nwitnesses are honest and sincere in their testimony. However, and I emphasize, Mr.\nT.T.E. is not the victim in the situation at hand, although he undoubtedly\nsuffers because of it. His step-daughter, the complainant, is the victim.[25]The Canadian/ South Sudanese community should recognize this and while\ncertainly providing their full support to Mr. T.T.E., also provide support and\nsustenance for his step-daughter, a member of his now-broken family. Her victim\nimpact statement attests to the isolation and rejection she has experienced\nfrom the community, as well as from her mother, who should be reaching out and\ngiving her their unqualified support. Whatsoever individual views may be as to\nguilt or innocence, findings have been made in this Court through the due\nprocess of law. The community must do all it can to assist and support all\nthose who have suffered by reason of this most unfortunate family tragedy. I\nemphasize that, in my view, the victim cries out for help from the community.[26]I express these views because I hope that all those who, quite properly\nand helpfully, have given support to Mr. T.T.E., will also now lend their\nsupport to the victim, who is alone and isolated and in desperate need of their\nhelp and understanding.The\nsubmissions of the Crown as to sentence[27]The Crown submits that a penitentiary term of a minimum of four years is\nwarranted for the offender.The submissions of the Offender as to sentence[28]Defence counsel submits that a sentence in the range of 12 to 15 months\nis warranted, with a conditional sentence order whereby the sentence is served\nin the community subject to conditions.[29]Both counsel have submitted extensive authorities. The applicable\napproach for analysis in sentencing is set forth by the Supreme Court of Canada\nin Regina v. Proulx 140 C.C.C. (3d) 68(SCC) and R. v. Wells 141\nC.C. C. (3d) 129 (SCC).Disposition[30]A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the\ndegree of responsibility of the offender. At the outset, considering the fundamental\npurpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Code,\nI determine that it is appropriate to exclude two possibilities, being simply\nprobationary measures and a penitentiary term. The purpose of sentencing is to\nfoster a just, peaceful and safe society. The sentencing principles of specific\nand general deterrence, and denunciation, call for a sentence of imprisonment,\nconsidering the gravity of the offence and the high moral blameworthiness of\nthe offender. There are aggravating factors, given the significant\nvulnerability of the young victim in a new country and new household. The\ncomplainant was in a position of great uncertainty in that new household, in\nparticular, as to the strength of her position with her mother, with whom she\nwas only recently reunited, and her dependence upon Mr. T.T.E., the new step\nfather, as husband to her mother, the head of the household and its primary\nprovider. She had just come to Canada and a new and different culture from\nKenya.[31]Mr. T.T.E. took advantage of the complainant’s extreme vulnerability\nwhen the opportunity arose in seeking gratification of his own sexual desire.\nThere was vaginal penetration and he employed force to constrain the victim. He\ntold her she would get into trouble if she told her mother about the incident.\nHe shows no insight into the situation nor any empathy for the complainant.\nIndeed, it is apparent he has turned her young step-brothers against her. Mr.\nT.T.E. violated a position of trust with his new step-daughter.[32]Mr. T.T.E. has no criminal record. The principle of rehabilitation must\nalso be recognized. Mr. T.T.E. has been, and can be, a productive and\nresponsible member of society. Considering all the factors, in my view a prison\nterm in the range of 15 months to two years less a day, followed by a three\nyear period of probation, would be an appropriate sentence.[33]I turn now to the matter of a possible conditional sentence order\nwhereby the offender could serve the sentence in the community, with\nappropriate conditions.[34]There are three prerequisites to be satisfied before there can be any\nconsideration as to whether a conditional sentence order is appropriate: there\nis no mandatory term of imprisonment, the sentence imposed is less than two\nyears in duration and I am satisfied that serving the sentence in the community\nwould not endanger the community.[35]Clearly, the first two criteria are present. The third criterion is of\nsome concern. There is, in my view, some risk posed by the individual offender\nif he were to serve his sentence in the community. While I accept Dr.\nPollandi’s expertise and sincerity in expressing his opinion as to minimal risk\nof re-offending, I think it is largely based upon the fact of no criminal\nrecord other than the offence at hand. The offender is an impressive individual\nin terms of his community life and leads an outwardly exemplary life in terms\nof his conduct in the external community but he has demonstrated that he is\nprepared to seize upon an opportunity to satisfy his sexual desire through a\nsexual assault when he thinks he can get away with it. It seems unlikely that\nthe offender will re-offend inasmuch as I believe he committed the offence in\nthe case at hand because it was seen as an easy crime of opportunity within his\nown house and that he ran little danger of being caught and punished. If he\nwere to re-offend, the gravity of the damage that could follow would be severe,\nas it has been for the complainant in the situation at hand. In my view, the\noffender is a hypocrite. So I am left with some uncertainty in respect of the\nthird criterion. However, the risk of re-offending could be minimized by\nrestrictive conditions as to being alone with young females, and providing for\nsupervision in the community, as allowed by s. 742.3 (2) (f) of the Code.\nWhile I have concerns, I am prepared to find on balance that the offender would\nnot endanger the community.[36]Given that I am prepared to find that the three criteria of s. 742.1 of\nthe Codeare met, I must now consider whether a conditional sentence\nwould be consistent with the fundamental purpose of sentencing and the\nprinciples of sentencing as set out in ss. 718 to 718.2. A consideration of the\nsentencing principles will determine whether the offender should serve his\nsentence in the community or in jail, the duration of the sentence, and if a\nconditional sentence, the nature of the conditions to be imposed.[37]Sentencing is an individualized process. The Court has considerable\ndiscretion, to be exercised judicially upon a consideration of the facts of the\nparticular case, having regard to the principles and objectives of sentencing.\nA fundamental principle is that of proportionality, which provides that a\nsentence must be proportional to the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender. There are numerous examples of a conditional\nsentence order being appropriate even when the offence is a sexual assault.[38]The values underlying the principles expressed in ss. 718, 718.1 and\n718.2 of the Code all seek to foster a just, peaceful and safe society.\nThese values include the objectives of denouncing unlawful conduct, achieving\nspecific and general deterrence, rehabilitating the offender and promoting a\nsense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledgement of the harm done to\nvictims and the community.[39]A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the\ndegree of responsibility of the offender. Section 718.2 recognizes as\naggravating circumstances that an offence is committed against a child and when\nan offence constitutes an abuse of a position of trust or authority in relation\nto the victim.[40]Denunciation is the communication of society’s condemnation of the\noffender’s conduct. The offender has been found guilty of sexual assault in\nrespect of his own new step-daughter. He was in a position of trust and\nauthority and he violated that position by forcibly sexually assaulting her.\nShe was in a very vulnerable, isolated and dependent position, as he well knew,\nand he thought he could take advantage of that dependency. He violated her\npersonal integrity in the basest of ways. She, at 15, new to Canada from Kenya,\nand new to his family and uncertain of her mother’s position, was extremely\nvulnerable. He insulted her by throwing money at her after the deed. He knew\nshe was vulnerable, insecure and uncertain as to whether her mother would\nbelieve her if she told her mother, and he acted upon her position of weakness.\nMr. T.T.E. shows no remorse and I infer has turned his two young sons, the\ncomplainant’s half-brothers, against her. His position is that he is innocent;\nhence, he shows no remorse. In my view, his lack of any remorse is grounded in\nhis own self-interest through a fear of loss of standing in the community,\nwhich causes him to continue to deny any wrongdoing and to continue to show no\nconsideration or compassion for the harm he has doneto the complainant.[41]Incarceration will usually provide more denunciation than a conditional\nsentence. However, a conditional sentence can have punitive aspects, of course,\nsuch as through house arrest. The deterrent effect of incarceration is\nuncertain from an empirical standpoint, although being a harsher sanction\nordinarily as compared to a conditional sentence, it seems that the objective\nof both specific and general deterrence is more probably achieved through\nincarceration. Most significantly, it seems that general deterrence is more\nlikely achieved if incarceration is known in the community to be a not uncommon\nresult for the crime of sexual assault upon a dependent step-daughter. While a\nconditional sentence order can be fashioned to foster deterrence, this is less\neasily done when the offender shows no remorse and does not admit to the crime.[42]Restorative objectives are certainly generally more easily achieved\nthrough a conditional sentence order. Rehabilitation is more easily obtained\nwhen the offender, as in the case at hand, has existing employment and is a\nproductive member of the community. As well, the offender at hand is the father\nof two young boys, and their needs, as testified to by the witnesses at the\nsentencing hearing suggest that that they benefit from the presence of their\nfather. While the evidence is that they a dutiful and care-giving mother who\nalso looks after their needs, the presence of two good, lovingparents is\nalways preferable to only having one present.[43]Reparations to the community can often be achieved through a condition\nof community service. However, it is difficult to see how the needed sense of\nresponsibility in this offender and acknowledgment of the very significant and\ngrievous harm he has done to the victim and to the community can be fostered,\ngiven his continuing complete lack of remorse and indifference to her welfare.\nHe refuses to acknowledge his wrongdoing, has divided the family against her\nand he is undoubtedly aware that this has a continuing adverse psychologicalimpact upon the mental well-being and health of the complainant.[44]In my view, weighing the pertinent factors in the case at hand, where\nsome of the objectives militate in favour of a conditional sentence, while\nothers favour incarceration,a sentence of incarceration is called for as the\nfit sentence The punitive objectives of denunciation and deterrence are\nparticularly pressing given the very aggravating circumstances seen in respect\nofMr. T.T.E.’s offence. In my view, the need for denunciation is so pressing\nin the circumstances of the case at hand, that incarceration is the only\nsuitable way in which to express society’s condemnation of the offender’s\nconduct.[45]As well, in my view, incarceration is the more appropriate sentence in\nthe instant situation whereby to promote a sense of responsibility in the\noffender and acknowledge the grievous harm to the victim and to the community\nat large.[46]Considering all the circumstances, the nature of the crime, the gravity\nof the offence and the impact upon the unfortunate young victim, I am of the\nview that denunciation of Mr. T.T.E.’s’ unlawful conduct, the need to foster\nthe objective of general deterrence and the need to promote a sense of\nresponsibility on his part and acknowledgment of the harm done to the\ncomplainant and the community call for a sentence of incarceration in prison.[47]In my view, and I so find, serving the sentence in the community would\nnot be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles set out in ss.\n718 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code. Accordingly, I exercise my\ndiscretion to not grant a conditional sentence order.[48]Considering that Mr. T.T.E. has no criminal record beyond his conviction\nfor the offence at hand, has otherwise been a productive member of society and\nis the father of two young boys, I am of the view that the sentence should be\nat the low end of the appropriate range. I fix the sentence at 18 months in\nprison, to be followed by three years probation.[49]The terms of the probation order shall include the mandatory terms and\noptional terms, being(a)to report to and be under the direction of a probation officer as\nrequired by the probation officer;(b)to not have any communication with the complainant except with the\nexpress consent of the complainant and in the presence of her mother;(c)to not come within 500 metres of the residence of the complainant other\nthan to exercise visitation rights in respect of his sons if they are living in\nthe same residence, and to be accompanied by another adult acceptable to the\nprobation officer for any such attendance at the residence;(d)to not to be in the presence of any female child under the age of16\nyears without being in the presence of at least one other adult person of at\nleast 18 years of age; and(e)to take such programs or counseling in respect of sexual conduct and\nbehaviour as he may be directed by the probation officer.[50]An order requiring a DNA sample as stipulated by s. 481.051 of the Criminal\nCode shall be made.[51]This concludes my reasons for sentencing and the sentence imposed.________________________CUMMING J.Released:January 9, 2004"}

Quigley J.[1]Ryan Barton was convicted on December 21, 2015, along with Kervon James,\nBevon Marshall and Sadyk Sadykov, of aggravated assault, committing an assault\nusing an edged weapon, and possession of an edged weapon for a purpose\ndangerous to the public peace.[2]These four offenders were inmates of the Toronto East Detention Centre\nwho had been moved into Range 3B West along with the victim, Andrew Burnett, on\nthe evening of Friday, January 2, 2015. That range is a temporary overnight\nholding area for inmates who are anticipated to be attending at court on the\nnext day, in this case, Monday, January 5, 2015. Andrew Burnett was scheduled\nto commence his trial for first-degree murder on that day. Ironically, Ryan\nBarton was to appear in court that day to plead guilty to a charge of\npossession of a firearm and to be released that day for pre-trial custody\nserved.[3]On the morning of Saturday, January 3, however, Ryan Barton participated\nwith the three other offenders in a vicious and plainly pre-planned aggravated\nassault on Andrew Burnett. The assault took place inside his cell. The evidence\nis entirely circumstantial, consisting of the video surveillance of the actions\nof the four offenders that Saturday morning.[4]At paragraph 61 of my Reasons for Judgment cited at R. v. Barton,\n2015 ONSC 7990, I summarize my reasons for convicting the four accused as\nfollows:In summary, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that the Crown has made out the elements of the three offences of\naggravated assault, assault with a weapon and possession of a weapon for a\npurpose dangerous to the public peace against each accused, based on my finding\nthat they acted in concert to achieve this common unlawful purpose. However, I\nam not satisfied to the criminal standard that either Barton or James were core\nprincipals of the assaults, based on their location outside of Burnett's cell\nwhen the actual injuries had to have been inflicted by Sadykov and Marshall. As\nsuch, while they are plainly parties to the offences, they will be found guilty\nof the lesser but included offences of aiding and abetting, rather than being\nprincipals in the criminal action that took place that morning.[5]Because of his prior record, the Attorney General has given notice of\nher intention to bring dangerous offender proceedings against Bevon Marshall.\nThat leaves Sadyk Sadykov, Ryan Barton and Kervon James to be sentenced by me\nin the ordinary way.[6]The Crown seeks a sentence of eight to nine years against Mr. Sadykov\nfor his participation in these events as one of the two principals, and the\nCrown seeks sentences of three to four years against Mr. Barton and Mr. James\nfor their convictions of having aided and abetted in the commission of that\naggravated assault against Andrew Burnett. The Crown also seeks DNA orders on\nthe basis that this is a primary designated offence, and a section 109 weapons\nprohibition for life. I note that neither of the last two orders are opposed\nand so given I am satisfied that both are appropriate in the circumstances,\nthose ancillary orders will issue as requested.[7]The circumstances of the offence are described at paragraphs 12 through\n27 of my Reasons for Judgment. The assault commenced just after 9 o'clock in\nthe morning after the cells were unlocked. Mr. Sadykov, Mr. Marshall and Mr.\nJames can be seen on the video surveillance footage conferring in a back corner\nof the range, a couple of steps from Mr. Barton's cell, 3214. Several minutes\nlater, Mr. Barton comes out of his cell and joins the three of them and they\nwalked directly single file towards and into cell 3210, Andrew Burnett ‘s cell,\nafter his cellmate, William Ferguson, had left some minutes earlier. The\naccused marched directly and plainly towards Mr. Burnett's cell. Mr. Sadykov is\nfirst in line, followed by Mr. Marshall, Mr. Barton and finally Mr. James. They\nclose the door behind them as they enter Mr. Burnett's cell.[8]About five seconds later, Mr. James emerges from the cell and closes the\ndoor behind him, and can be seen holding the door closed with the side of his\nfoot for a short period of time, perhaps five seconds, and then he re-enters\nMr. Burnett's cell. Some seconds after that, Mr. Barton exits Mr. Burnett's\ncell and walks towards his own, doing a congratulatory tap with Mr. Mendez as\nthey pass.[9]As I found in my Reasons, it is plain from the video surveillance\nfootage that the top half of Mr. Barton’s orange jumpsuit had been ripped open.\nHowever, no blood was visible to my eye. His total involvement in the matter\nappears to have spanned about 30 seconds. Mr. Barton never goes back into Mr.\nBurnett's cell. The state of his orange jumpsuit as he exits, however,\nindicates that even if he was not involved in the actual slashing of Mr.\nBurnett that took place, for which I have found Mr. Sadykov and Mr. Marshall to\nbe principally responsible, it seems that he was probably involved in some\nphysical altercation at the front end during that first minute when the four of\nthem entered the cell and restrained Mr. Burnett.[10]That is the extent of Mr. Barton’s actual involvement physically in the\nperpetration of the aggravated assault, although as noted from my finding\nabove, I found him to clearly be a part of the group and acting in concert with\nthe others even if his role was materially less and even if I found him guilty\nof being an aider and abettor, rather than a principal.[11]Ryan Barton is 24 years of age. He comes from a good home. His mother,\nfather and sister attended at the trial and were here for the sentencing\nhearing. As I indicated to Mr. Nuttall, counsel for Mr. Barton, it was plain to\nme that Mr. Barton does enjoy support from his family. He is the only one of\nhis siblings who has run afoul of the law. Nevertheless, he also has a\nrelatively short criminal record.[12]He was sentenced on March 21, 2012, of assault and theft under $5,000\nfor which he received a suspended sentence and twelve months of probation on\neach charge. He was also prohibited from possessing a weapon for five years\nunder section 110 of the Criminal Code. His second sentencing took place\non January 7, 2015, as I noted above, just after this offence took\nplace, and on that day he was sentenced to one day in jail in addition to 360\ndays of credit for pre-sentence custody, thus totaling one year, for\nunauthorized possession of a firearm. His weapons prohibition was continued and\nkicked up a notch by being extended from five years on the first offence to ten\nyears on the second.[13]I also specifically note, however, that in the context of this\nsentencing, that was not in fact a sentence that was imposed before the commission\nof this offence. It was not technically a second offence that is aggravating\nfor sentencing purposes at the time that this offence was committed.[14]I agree with Mr. Nuttall that while he is a party to these offences, and\nwhile I found that he acted in concert with the others, it would be unsafe for\nme to conclude that Mr. Barton was present when the wounds were actually\ninflicted on Mr. Burnett. He certainly aided and abetted, but I cannot be sure\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that he was present when the wounds were inflicted\nand I specifically made that point plain in paragraph 61 of my Reasons, because\nit seemed evident to me in the context of the whole of the video surveillance\nfootage that the wounds would have been inflicted on Mr. Burnett after the initial\n30 seconds, and after Mr. Barton and Mr. James left his cell.[15]As I have made plain in my Reasons for Judgment, and in my Reasons for\nSentence of Sadyk Sadykov, and again emphasize here, this is a very serious\noffence. Just because this is an assault that takes place between inmates in a\ncorrectional institution does not mean that it is less serious than it would be\nif it had taken place on the street, or in this courthouse, or somewhere else\noutside of a custodial corrections environment.[16]It is very important that sentences for offences such as these emphasize\ndenunciation and deterrence, generally, and specifically to the offender. While\nthe Crown has not provided me with any authorities on ranges of sentence\nrelative to circumstances of individuals who were aiding in the commission of\nsuch an offence, the cases the Crown has put forward relative to the sentence\nsought against Mr. Sadykov as a principal shows that the sentences that have\nbeen imposed for similar assaults against fellow inmates perpetrated in a\ncorrectional systems environment, in this province, have ranged from six to\nnine years although there have been sentences of considerably less severity\nalso imposed in seemingly very serious circumstances: See references in: R.\nv. Sadykov, released together with these Reasons.[17]Crown counsel emphasized as well that that sentence ought to be\nconsecutive to whatever sentence the offender is serving at that time that\ncauses him to be in the corrections facility where the inmate assault takes\nplace. While it is true that the cases that the Crown has put forward all\nappear to reflect sentences imposed consecutive to the existing sentence being\nserved by the offender, I do not believe that to be an appellate directive that\nsuch sentences must always be consecutive, particularly where the imposition of\na significant potential sentence, combined with the predicate offence, would\noffend the principle of totality. I have discussed this issue in my Reasons\nrelative to the sentencing of Mr. Sadykov.[18]Here, however, there is no prior offence in respect of which this\nsentence can be imposed consecutive to some other sentence. It will stand\nalone. More importantly, while this was a vicious offence, and while Mr. Barton\nacted in concert with the other three, it is plain that his involvement is\nlimited and of short duration.[19]Equally importantly, to my eye, are the letters of reference provided\nfor Mr. Barton that I find show that he does indeed have real prospects of\nrehabilitation. Moreover, Mr. Barton has completed his grade 12 education, and\nthe letters provided in support of him provide substance, in my view, for the\nsentence in his circumstances to not be retributive, and to not focus\nexclusively on deterrence and denunciation, notwithstanding the severity of the\noffence to which he was an aider. I have concluded instead that he needs to be\nprovided with one, not two, not three, but one and only one last opportunity to\nchange the direction of his life and move away from his past bad decisions and\ninstead turn towards a direction of becoming a law-abiding and productive\nCanadian citizen, with the assistance and support of his family and those who\ncare for him.[20]So against that background, and given that he has never been to the\npenitentiary before and is a relatively youthful offender of 24 years of age,\nthe principles set out in R. v. Borde, 2003 ONCA 4187, would suggest\nthat if it is possible to meet the principles of sentencing with the imposition\nof a sentence to be served in the provincial corrections system rather than in\nthe federal penitentiary system, or at least the minimum penitentiary sentence\nthat will meet the requirements of sentencing in the particular circumstances,\nthat would be the preferable result.[21]It would also be preferable in these circumstances, because the victim\nof the assault, Andrew Burnett, is now serving a life sentence in the federal\npenitentiary system. Federal corrections officials do everything in their power\nto ensure that there is no opportunity for one inmate to exact revenge on\nanother for a prior assault or insult, though this case shows those efforts are\nnot always successful. It can reasonably be anticipated that there is greater\nrisk of that happening if Mr. Barton is sentenced to a term of penitentiary\nimprisonment than if he was sentenced to two years less a day.[22]Mr. Barton's counsel also emphasizes, and the Crown agrees, that Mr.\nBarton would otherwise be entitled to approximately four months of credit for\npre-trial custody. Mr. Nuttall also argues that Mr. Barton ought to be granted\ncredit under R. v. Downes for strict conditions of bail imposed against\nhim on March 25, 2015, that is for a period of eleven months. As such, defence\ncounsel argues that in total, Mr. Barton should receive credit of six and a\nhalf to seven months. The problem with that line of argument is that if I\naccept the Crown’s position that a minimum sentence of three years is required\nin the circumstances of this case for Mr. Barton, applying that credit will not\nkeep him out of the federal penitentiary.[23]I do accept the proposition that a minimum sentence of at least two if\nnot three years would typically be the level of sentence required in the\ncircumstances of someone who aided in the commission of an offence of this\ngravity. Defence counsel suggests that a sentence of two years less a day,\nreduced by the credits he argues for, would meet the objectives of sentencing,\nbut I am not persuaded by that argument.[24]Nevertheless, I do not intend to impose a three-year level of sentence.\nI am persuaded instead that this is a unique circumstance where the prospects\nof rehabilitation for this man in his case and the need to keep him out of the\nfederal penitentiary, do call for a sentence of two years less a day. However,\nthey also call for a term of probation for a further 30 months. Further, in\nlight of that global position, I have determined that no credit should be\nprovided for his pre-trial custody or for the strict terms of his bail.\nNevertheless, it will be plain to all that they are indeed factors that I have taken\ninto account, along with his prospects of rehabilitation, in determining that\nthe principles of sentencing in this case can best be met by a custodial\nsentence of two years less a day to be served in a provincial corrections\nfacility, followed by two and a half years of probation. The Crown seeks a\nsentence of three to four years. The total “sentence” I am imposing on Mr.\nBarton is six months longer than four years, but composed differently of a\nshorter period of custody and a longer period of supervision, to meet the\nparticular needs of this case, to encourage rehabilitation, but nevertheless to\nalso keep him under the watchful eye of the state for a significant period.[25]As a primary designated offence, however, as noted above, there is no\ndispute that Mr. Barton will provide a DNA sample and he will be subjected to a\nsection 109 weapons prohibition order for life.[26]I am imposing a sentence of two years less a day, plus two and a half years\nof probation. I have imposed two and a half rather than three years of\nprobation taking additional account of the fact that Mr. Barton is receiving no\nspecific credit for the time spent in pre-trial custody, even if that is a\nfactor I have taken into account in imposing a more lenient custodial sentence.\nRelative to probation, however, I specifically have in mind creating a\nsupervisory environment that will take Mr. Barton out until he is getting close\nto thirty years of age and keep him under the supervisory eye of the state for\nthat period of time.[27]Frankly, my hope is that the rehabilitation prospects which seem evident\non the face of letters of support for him, and the support of his mother and\nfather and other family members, will assist him to make the transition from\nhis brief past criminal orientation towards one of respect for the law and\ncontribution to the community that shows great faith in him, unproven I might\nadd, that he is going to be capable of turning himself around. I certainly hope\nthey are right.[28]In the context of this matter, I regard this is the most lenient\nsentence that I can possibly impose that will still meet the objectives and\nprinciples of sentencing, and reflect the need to express the denunciation of\nour community and to seek to deter others who find themselves in a corrections\nenvironment from committing or participating in the commission of offences\nagainst other inmates, but that will also reflect hope that this individual can\nturn himself around, rehabilitate himself, and will not be again seen before\nour courts.[29]Nevertheless, Mr. Barton, you need to know that I intend to order that\nthese Reasons for Sentence be kept in your file and that if you are ever\ncharged and convicted again on another matter, that these Reasons are specifically\nto be brought to the attention of the sentencing judge at that time. They are\nto be brought forward at that time to indicate to any future sentencing judge\nthat you, Mr. Barton, have already received all of the leniency that, in my\nview, you are entitled to from our justice system.[30]It will always be the prerogative of any future sentencing judge to\ndetermine whata fit sentence is for the offender in the particular\ncircumstances of the offence. The message I am trying to convey to you today,\nhowever, is that if you re-offend in the face of the trust that I have placed\nin you in sentencing you in this way, while I may not have any influence on a\nfuture sentencing judge, I can let that judge know why I did what I did today\nand can let that judge know with certainty that Mr. Barton would receive no\nfurther leniency from me. There is an old expression, \"Fool me once, shame\non you. Fool me twice, shame on me.”[31]I sincerely hope, Mr. Barton, that you will get the message that this\nsentence is seeking to convey to you and commit yourself to the direction it\nprescribes.[32]Ryan Barton stand up.[33]For the reasons I have indicated, I have determined that an appropriate\nsentence in the particular circumstances of your case will be a period of\nincarceration in a provincial corrections facility for two years less a day, to\nbe followed by two and a half years of probation with the statutory terms and\nsuch other terms as agreed by counsel together, and approved by me. If counsel\nare unable to agree on all terms, I will hear further brief submissions and\ndetermine the terms accordingly.Michael G. Quigley J.Released: April 1, 2016CITATION: R. v.

MICHAEL NELSON(Applicant/Appellant)BEFORE:DOHERTY,\nROSENBERG and MOLDAVER JJ.A.COUNSEL:Sam Scratch\nfor the appellantJohn McInnes\nfor the respondentHEARD:May 24, 2001On appeal from the conviction\nimposed by Justice D.G. Humphrey, sitting with a jury,dated February 26,\n1999 and the sentence imposed on March 24, 1999.E N D O R S E M\nE N T[1]The appellant was convicted of robbery and several\nother offences arising out of the same events.The Crown alleged that the\nappellant, while masked, gained entry to the apartment of Debbie Edwards and\nattacked and terrorized Ms. Edwards and a friend over the course of several\nhours.The appellant was sentenced to 8 years in the penitentiary.He appealed his conviction and sentence.[2]At the conclusion of oral argument, the court dismissed\nthe conviction appeal and varied the sentence from 8 years to 7 years.These are the reasons for that disposition.The Conviction Appeal(a)The undisclosed alibi[3]The Crown’s case rested primarily on the evidence of\nMs. Edwards.She knew the appellant.She testified that although\nthe intruder was masked and she was pepper sprayed by the intruder, she was\nable to identify the appellant as the intruder.She gave several reasons\nfor that identification and was cross-examined extensively on those\nreasons.There was also independent evidence capable of confirming Ms.\nEdwards’ identification of the appellant as her attacker.[4]The appellant testified that during the time period\nwhen the attack occurred, he was in his apartment cooking and also spent some\ntime in another apartment visiting friends.Both apartments were in the\nsame building as Ms. Edwards’ apartment.According to the appellant’s\ntestimony, his uncle’s girlfriend who lived with the appellant and his uncle\nwas at home in the apartment with the appellant during the relevant time.Also, according to the appellant, two young women were with him in the other\napartment.The appellant provided the name of one of these two\nwomen.[5]When arrested shortly after the event, the appellant\nhad told the police that he was at home when Ms. Edwards was attacked.He\noffered no further details as to his whereabouts and made no reference to his\nuncle’s girlfriend or the two women in the other apartment.These details\nfirst emerged during the appellant’s cross-examination.[6]Counsel for the appellant forcefully submitted that the\nCrown improperly invited the jury to draw an adverse inference from the\ndefence’s failure to call witnesses who could, according to the appellant’s\ntestimony, account for his whereabouts at the time of the attack on Ms. Edwards\nand her friend.Counsel further argued that even if the inference could\nbe drawn, the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury as to the\nlimited nature of that inference and the caution to be exercised before drawing\nthat inference.[7]On appeal the Crown characterized this as a case of an\nundisclosed alibi.He argued that the appellant’s failure to reveal the\nidentity of witnesses, who could confirm his whereabouts, until\ncross-examination amounted to a failure to give timely notice of the essential\ndetails of an alibi and invited an instruction as to the adverse inference\nwhich could be drawn from the failure to give that timely notice:R.\nv. Cleghorn (1995), 1995 CanLII 63 (SCC), 100 C.C.C. (3d) 393, per Iacobucci J. for the majority,\nat p. 397, per Major J. in dissent, at p. 407.[8]We accept the Crown’s submission.The appellant’s\ndefence was that he was elsewhere when the crime was committed.In short,\nhe advanced an alibi:R. v. Hill (1995), 1995 CanLII 271 (ON CA), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 469 at\n478-9 (Ont. C.A.).The appellant’s failure to disclose to the prosecution\nuntil cross-examination, the identity of those who according to him could\nconfirm his whereabouts denied the prosecution the opportunity to effectively\ninvestigate the alibi.In these circumstances, the trial judge should\nhave told the jury that the failure to make timely disclosure of the witnesses\nreferred to in the appellant’s cross-examination was a factor to be considered\nin determining what weight should be given to the appellant’s evidence that he\nwas elsewhere when the crime was committed:R. v. Hill, supra, at\n477-78;R. v. Chambers (1990), 1990 CanLII 47 (SCC), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 321 at 343 (S.C.C.).[9]Neither trial counsel nor the trial judge treated this\nas an alibi case.Crown counsel made a submission to the jury that it\nshould consider the appellant’s failure to call certain witnesses in assessing\nthe appellant’s credibility.Crown counsel could have told the jury that\nthe trial judge would tell them that they could consider the appellant’s\nfailure to disclose the names of the witnesses in a timely fashion when\nassessing the veracity of the appellant’s evidence as to his whereabouts.The submission made by Crown counsel was no more effective than that which the\nCrown could have made had it approached the case as one involving an\nundisclosed alibi.[10]The trial judge said nothing about the failure of the\nappellant to call the witnesses referred to by the Crown.He also made no\nreference to the appellant’s failure to make timely disclosure of the identity\nof those persons who according to the appellant could vouch for his whereabouts\nat the relevant time.The absence of an instruction as to the potential\nimpact of the appellant’s failure to make timely disclosure benefitted the\nappellant.From the appellant’s vantage point, the trial judge put the case\nto the jury on a better basis than the appellant was entitled to as a matter of\nlaw.The appellant can demonstrate no prejudice flowing from Crown\ncounsel’s submissions concerning the failure to call certain witnesses, or from\nthe trial judge’s failure to address those submissions in his instructions to\nthe jury.(b)Count 9[11]The Crown acknowledges that the trial judge should have\ngiven the jury more detailed instructions on count 9 in the indictment.That count alleged that the appellant assaulted Ms. Edwards’ friend and caused\nher bodily harm.Crown counsel concedes that the jury could have\nconcluded that the appellant assaulted the friend, but did not cause her bodily\nharm.The trial judge gave only the tersest of instructions on this\ncount.[12]Crown counsel submits that while there was evidence to\nsupport a conviction for assault causing bodily harm, justice would not be\nserved by a new trial on that count alone.He submits that the court\nshould substitute a conviction for assault.We agree with that position\nand pursuant to s. 686(3) of the Criminal Code, would set aside the\nconviction for assault causing bodily harm on count 9 and substitute a\nconviction for assault.[13]The sentence imposed on count 9 (3 years) was\nconcurrent to the much longer sentence imposed on the robbery charge.We\nwould not vary the sentence imposed on count 9.The Sentence Appeal[14]The appellant received a total sentence of 8\nyears.He had spent some 10 months in custody prior to sentencing.Assuming the usual two for one credit given for pre-trial custody, the\nappellant’s sentence was equivalent to a sentence of 9 years and 8\nmonths.[15]Although the appellant is a young man (21 years old)\nand has only a minor criminal record, a lengthy penitentiary term was fully\nwarranted.The appellant assaulted, terrorized and humiliated Ms. Edwards\nover a prolonged period of time.His attack was premeditated and marked\nby repeated and egregious acts of gratuitous violence.The appellant also\nconfined and assaulted Ms. Edwards’ friend.To make a bad situation even\nworse, the attack occurred in Ms. Edwards’ home.No doubt, she will live\nwith the terror of that afternoon for the rest of her life.[16]In his reasons for sentence the trial judge said:So there is absolutely zero\nremorse;not only zero remorse, complete defiance of the criminal justice\nsystem by attempting to perpetrate a completely perjurious defence on the\njury.Fortunately, they were not fooled and rejected the accused’s\nevidence.[17]The trial judge continued with this theme when he came\nto the appellant’s pre-trial custody:I take into consideration that he\nhas done nine months dead time – ten months pre-trial custody – I also bear in\nmind that the reason he was in custody for ten months was to enable him to\nmount this perjurious defence that he has put forward.[18]In our view, the trial judge erred in principle in\ndisregarding the pre-trial custody based on his assessment of the nature of the\ndefence mounted by the appellant.Quite simply, there is no connection\nbetween the reason credit is given for pre-trial custody and the trial judge’s\nconclusion that an accused has advanced a “perjurious defence”.It seems\nto us that the trial judge felt that the appellant’s sentence should be\nincreased because he had advanced a “perjurious defence”.Sentences\ncannot be increased to express disapproval of the conduct of the defence.[19]Having found that the trial judge erred in principle,\nthis court must consider the appropriateness of the sentence imposed\nafresh.We are in substantial agreement with the trial judge’s assessment\nof the appropriate sentence.A sentence closely approaching 9 years was\nentirely appropriate in this case.Giving the appellant credit of 20\nmonths for his pre-trial custody, we think that 7 years in an appropriate\ndisposition.(c)Disposition[20]As indicated at the end of oral argument, a conviction\nfor assault is substituted on count 9 and the conviction appeal is\ndismissed.Leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal is allowed\nby varying the 8 year sentence imposed on the robbery charge to a sentence of 7\nyears.In all other respects, the sentences imposed at trial stand.“Doherty J.A.”“M.

(Nick) ScaravelliHeard:June 30th, 2016, in Pictou, NovaScotiaCounsel:Bronwyn Duffy, for theFederal CrownBill Gorman for the Provincial CrownDouglas Lloy, for Christian Stanton BurkeOrally By the Court:[1]Christian Burke appears for sentencing having\nentered guilty pleas for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking\ncontrary to section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and\non the same date, being in possession of a shotgun, without a license, contrary\nto section 91(1) of the Criminal Code.[2]The facts as detailed by the crown are\nsummarized as follows:On August 18th, 2015 the RCMP, acting on a\ncall to the detachment, stopped a vehicle operated by the offender in the area\nof Greenhill, Pictou County.A rifle, later determined to be a 12 gauge\nshotgun was observed on the floor of the vehicle behind the front seat.Shotgun shells were also located in a gun case on the floor.A subsequent\nsearch of a knapsack revealed what was described as two large white power\nstones later identified as 2 grams of cocainetogether with a digital scale\nand baggies.Two cell phones were located in the vehicle.Mr. Burke had $120,\nall in $20 bills, on his person.[3]A pre-sentence report was prepared for the\ncourt.Mr. Burke is 22 years of age and was 21 at the time of the offence.He\nhas a grade 11 education and resides with his grandmother.He is reported to\nhave been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder at a young\nage.Mr. Burke does not have a prior criminal record.He is currently\nemployed with G.P.F. Tree Services and is reported to be a good worker.He has\na young son from a previous relationship whom he supports.[4]It is mitigating that Mr. Burke entered an early\nguilty plea, is accepting responsibility and has no criminal record.[5]Pursuant to section 10(2) of the CDSA, it\nis an aggravating factor that Mr. Burke carried a weapon at the time of his\noffence.Specifically, the shotgun and shells were in immediate proximity in\nthe backseat and, therefore, readily accessible.[6]Counsel have presented a joint recommendation on\nsentencing of two years in federal penitentiary for the possession of cocaine\nfor purpose of trafficking and for the offence of unlawful possession of a\nfirearm, 30 days concurrent.[7]As stated by our Court of Appeal in R. v.\nCromwell 2005 NSCA 137 (CanLII),joint recommendations are generally accepted\nunless the sentence is not in the acceptable range, is contrary to the public\ninterest, or would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.In\nother words the sentencing judge does not reject a joint submission just\nbecause the judge would have imposed a more severe sentence.[8]I have reviewed sentencing decisions provided by\ncounsel including R. v. Oickle , 2015 NSCA 87 (CanLII); R. v. Knickle 2009\nNSCA 59 (CanLII); and R. v. Aucoin 2011 NSCA 64 (CanLII).[9]Trafficking in cocaine for profit will generally\nreceive a term of imprisonment in a federal penitentiary.This is reinforced\nby the aggravating factor of the presence of a weapon.[10]Mr. Burke is a young first time offender with\nprospects of rehabilitation.He would be described as a petty retailer at the\ntime of this offence.The court however, must emphasize denunciation and\ndeterrence and send a message to the community that trafficking in a harmful\ndrug such as cocaine will be dealt with severely by the court.As this court\nhas stated previously, people who obtain and use these drugs become victims in\nour society.[11]I am satisfied, given the present circumstances,\nthe joint recommendation on sentencing complies the purpose and principles of\nsentencing as set out in the Criminal Code..[12]Mr. Burke is sentenced to a term of two years\nfederal penitentiary for the offence of possession of cocaine for the purpose\nof trafficking contrary to section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and\nSubstances Act.The sentence for unlawful possession of a firearm contrary\nto section91(1) of the Criminal Code is 30 days concurrent.[13]In terms of ancillary orders, the following is\nordered:-A firearms prohibition order pursuant to section\n109 of the Code for a period of 10 years and for life on prohibited\nweapons;-A secondary designated DNA collection order;-Forfeiture of offence related property pursuant\nto section 16 of the CDSA-Forfeiture of the firearm pursuant to section 491(1)(a)\nof the Criminal Code;-Victim Surcharge $200, 36 months to pay.Scaravelli, J."}

RichardAppearances:David McWhinnieAndré RoothmanAppearingfor the CrownAppearingfor the AccusedREASONS FOR SENTENCINGDELIVERED FROM THE BENCH[1]RICHARD J. (Oral):The offender\nbefore the Court has been found guilty by a jury of an offence of aggravated\nassault contrary to s. 268 of the Criminal Code.This offence carries a\nmaximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment in a federal penitentiary; thus,\nParliament has given a wide discretion to a sentencing judge to impose a fit\nand appropriate sentence in each case of aggravated assault. The sentencing\njudge is required by law to have regard to the principles of sentencing, which\nare now codified in the Criminal Code of Canada, and I have done so.\nAlso, the Court is required to take into consideration the particular personal\ncircumstances of the offender before the Court and the particular circumstances\nof the crime that he has committed.[2]The offender before the Court is Clinton\nDerkson, a 24-year-old man who, at the time of the offence, was a bouncer or\ndoorman or security person working at a bar in Whitehorse. The victim of the aggravated assault was Joshua August, a 19- or\n20-year-old young man who had been in the bar with his friend, Brent Lehrbass,\ndrinking for several hours. The two of them, at the time of the assault, were\nboth extremely intoxicated.[3]The two intoxicated young men had to be asked\nseveral times to leave the bar at closing time by the bar staff, including by this\noffender. One or both of the two intoxicated young men used abusive or rude\nlanguage towards the bar staff but eventually left of their own accord. About\nfive minutes later, three members of the bar staff, including this offender,\nwent out the front door of the bar to have a cigarette on the sidewalk. While\nthere, they were approached by the two intoxicated young men and discussions\nensued again about the fact of their having been asked to leave the bar.[4]A physical altercation started between the\nvictim’s friend, Brent Lehrbass, and another individual associated with the bar\nstaff. While the victim was watching this other physical altercation, he was\nstruck on the face by this offender. The blow to his head knocked him down, and\nhe hit his head on the sidewalk. As a result, he suffered serious injuries, in\nparticular, a fractured jaw and a skull fracture. He underwent surgery and,\nalthough at the time of the trial some 20 months later he appeared to have\nrecovered, for a time he had hearing difficulties; he obviously required\nsurgery and dental treatment, and for eight weeks could only take nourishment\nthrough a straw.[5]By their verdict, the jury did not accept this\noffender’s statement that he was acting in self-defence. By their verdict, the\njury accepted the testimony of the one eyewitness who stated that the one blow\nwas administered by the offender while the victim was looking at the other\naltercation. So although this is a one punch case, the one punch, in the\nvernacular, was a sucker punch or a blindsided one, and at the time of this\nblindsided punch the victim was, by the offender’s own testimony, extremely\nintoxicated.[6]In addition to hearing the victim’s testimony at\ntrial, the Court has also been provided with Mr. August’s victim impact\nstatement, as permitted by the Criminal Code. That victim impact\nstatement is now marked as Exhibit S3. The victim confirms that he was in a\ngreat deal of pain for some time following this serious assault. He makes\nparticular mention of having to wear wire braces as his jaw was wired shut for\nseveral weeks. As a result, he was restricted in his eating habits and was on a\nliquid diet for an extended period of time. His physical activities were also\nrestricted. He was unable to return to work for two or three months. He lost\nemployment income. He also incurred expenses for dental care, for transportation\ncosts in connection with his medical and dental care, and expenses associated\nwith his special diet while his jaw was wired shut.[7]Mr. August also suffered emotionally as a result\nof the restrictions on his daily life or daily routine. For example, he\nsuffered depression, anger, bitterness, et cetera. All of this to say that this\nwas not only a serious assault; it had significant consequences for the\ninnocent victim.[8]The offender before the Court is 24 years old\nand was 22 at the time of this offence. He was raised in British Columbia and had been living here\nin Whitehorse for a year or so\nat the time of committing this offence. Although the offender’s high school\neducation was interrupted for intervals of time, he has, since the events of\nOctober, 2007, returned to high school in BritishColumbia, and I take it that he now has the equivalent\nof a high school education. In addition to the employment that he had at the Whitehorse bar, he has had other sporadic\nemployment on various jobs in the construction industry and related fields.[9]Clinton Derkson has a criminal record which has\nbeen placed before the Court on this sentencing hearing. He is not a first\noffender. In June 2005, in Surrey, B.C., he was convicted of assault and received a sentence of a\n$500 fine plus a six-month probation term. In April 2007, here in Whitehorse, he was convicted of two counts\nof breach of undertaking or recognizance and received a sentence of seven days\ntime served.[10]Subsequent to the incident of October 3, 2007,\nwhen this offender violently struck the victim, there was a delay in the police\ninvestigation for several months. Mr. Derkson was then formally charged and\nelected trial by judge and jury. Following his conviction by his jury, the\nCourt granted his request for an adjournment of the sentencing hearing so that\na pre-sentence report might be prepared. These facts explain, in part, why it\nis only today, two years after the assault, that there is a final disposition\nof this matter.[11]Mr. Derkson’s counsel has provided the Court\nwith letters of reference on behalf of his client. In the main, these are from\nindividuals who have known the offender upon his return to a small community in\nBritish Columbia, that is,\nafter the October 2007 incident here in Whitehorse, a community where the offender lived with his father and attended\nhigh school in order to complete his Grade 12 education requirements. These\nindividuals speak to Clinton Derkson’s efforts to change his life, to become a\nbetter person, to providing help to younger students and to that community.\nThese efforts, post-offence, are to Mr. Derkson’s credit and I take this into\naccount in the determination of an appropriate sentence. These efforts act to\nmitigate the sentence that would otherwise be imposed.[12]The comments in the letters of reference,\nhowever, are at odds with some of the contents of the pre-sentence report, and\nin particular with some of the statements made by Clinton Derkson in his\ninterviews with the author of the pre-sentence report. These interviews took\nplace post-verdict, i.e. in the last few months; in other words, subsequent to\nthe observations made by the authors of the letters of reference. In his\nstatements to the Probation Officer who authored the pre-sentence report, the\noffender does not appear to have accepted the jury’s verdict. In those\nstatements, he displays a rather cavalier attitude towards the justice system\nand the sentencing process. He appears to blame the Crown witness for his\ncurrent predicament rather than accepting personal responsibility for his own\nbehaviour. More importantly, he does not appear to have any empathy for the\nvictim of his assault and is insensitive to the grievous harm he inflicted on\nthe victim.[13]Mr. Derkson today pleads with the Court to not\nsend him to jail but rather to allow him to serve his sentence in the community\npursuant to the conditional sentence provisions of s. 742.1 of the Criminal\nCode, i.e. the version of that section that was in force at the time of the\ncommission of this offence in October 2007. Upon careful consideration, I am\nunable to accede to that request. I look to the criteria for a conditional\nsentence as set out in s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code and as discussed in\nR. v. Proulx, [2000] S.C.J. No. 61, and other cases.[14]On the facts and circumstances of this offence\nand of this offender, I am not satisfied that to allow Clinton Derkson to serve\nhis sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community.\nIt is the Court’s view that he has had, and probably still has, anger management\nissues. It is the Court’s view that this offender does not yet see the\nseriousness of his conduct, nor of the harm that he has done. To acquiesce to\nMr. Derkson’s request that he serve his sentence in the community would be to\ngive him the wrong message in the sense of how he is to conduct himself\nvis-à-vis other members of society with whom he comes into conflict.[15]In addition, in the particular circumstances of\nthis offence and of this offender, I am not satisfied that the imposition of a\nconditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and\nprinciples of sentencing.[16]One of the objectives of sentencing is\ndenunciation of unlawful conduct. In my view, the appalling conduct of Mr.\nDerkson as a bar bouncer or security person towards an extremely intoxicated\npatron of that bar, resulting in serious injuries to that patron, requires the\nCourt to denounce such conduct in a meaningful way, and a conditional sentence\nsimply does not do that. For the same reason, in the particular circumstances\nof this offender and this offence, a conditional sentence would not act to\ndeter this offender or other persons, bar bouncers or otherwise, from\ncommitting a similar offence. The Court’s sentence must make it clear that bar\npatrons, even if extremely intoxicated and extremely obnoxious, are entitled to\nthe protection of the law.[17]Another of the objectives of the sentencing\nprocess is to promote in the offender before the Court a sense of\nresponsibility for his unlawful conduct and to promote in him an\nacknowledgement of the harm he has done to his victim. In my view, a custodial\nsentence is necessary to achieve this objective in the case of this offender\nand this offence. I note the fact of Mr. Derkson’s two recent convictions for\nbreaches of court process and also I note his comments to the PSR author about\nthe appropriateness of the Court imposing those conditions on him. These things\ndo not bode well for the prospects of any supervisory community sentence that\nmight be imposed on him.[18]Finally, I will just mention that to impose a\nconditional sentence in this case would offend the principle of\nproportionality, i.e. a fit and proper sentence is one that is proportionate to\nthe gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.[19]In the end result, taking into consideration all\nof the circumstances, a conditional sentence is simply not on and a meaningful\nterm of actual imprisonment is required. It is the Court’s hope and expectation\nthat while serving his term of imprisonment Mr. Derkson will reflect on his own\nbehaviour that has led to his incarceration, that he will not deflect\nresponsibility for his predicament to other people or to the justice system,\nand that he will, instead, focus on what he himself can do on his release to\nbecome the type of person that is described in the letters of reference that\nhave been provided to the Court.[20]Please stand, Mr. Derkson. Clinton Robert\nDerkson, for the crime that you have committed, aggravated assault, contrary to\ns. 268 of the Criminal Code, it is the sentence of this Court that you\nbe imprisoned for a period of 15 months.[21]In addition, there will be a firearms order\nunder s. 109 of the Criminal Code for a period of ten years.[22]Further, the DNA order sought by the Crown is\ngranted and, in the circumstances, there will be no victim fine surcharge.________________________________RICHARD\nJ."}

(Oral):Joey\nVaneltsi has entered a guilty plea to having committed the offence of robbery,\ncontrary to s. 344 of the Criminal Code.[2]Circumstances\nare set out in an Agreed Statement of Facts, as follows:1.On\nAugust 26, 2015 in the City of Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, at approximately 7\npm Sheri Saari and Greg Tamm parked their tour van and trailer in the east side\nparking lot outside of the 202 Motel. Ms. Saari and Mr. Tamm were tour\noperators returning bikes and equipment from Alaska to Montana.Mr. Tamm\nbought some beer entered the 202 Motel and Ms. Saari dealt with some\nthings in the trailer.2.Joey\nJason Vaneltsi was intoxicated and outside of the 202 Motel parking lot.When\nMr. Tamm entered the 202 Motel, Mr. Vaneltsi asked Mr. Tamm for some beer\nand offered to sell Mr. Tamm some marijuana.Mr. Tamm said he didn’t want any\nmarijuana and didn’t give Mr. Vaneltsi any beer.3.Mr. Vaneltsi\nthen exited the 202 Motel and broke the window of the tour van and took Ms. Saari's\npurse and Patagonia bag, containing an Apple computer and tips from the summer\ntour operation.Ms. Saari heard the disruption in the tour van and saw Mr. Vaneltsi\ntaking the Patagonia bag.Mr. Vaneltsi apologized to Ms. Saari for\nsmashing the window and then Ms. Saari and Mr. Vaneltsi got into a\ntug of war over the Patagonia bag.4.Ms. Saari\nhollered for help and Mr. Vaneltsi said he needed $40 dollars.Ms. Saari\ngave him $40 dollars and Mr. Tamm, having seen the altercation through a\nwindow, ran out and started to wrestle with Mr. Vaneltsi.5.Mr. Vaneltsi\nbroke free and ran a few metres with the Patagonia bag and Mr. Tamm caught Mr. Vaneltsi\nat which point Mr. Vaneltsi dropped the Patagonia bag and then fled again.6.Mr.\nTamm discovered the window of the tour van was broken and he caught Mr. Vaneltsi\nagain and Mr. Vaneltsi apologized for the damage to the window.7.Ms. Sheri's\nshoulder was sore from the tug-of-war with Mr. Vaneltsi and she was shaken\nup.8.Mr. Vaneltsi\nwas arrested on August 27, 2015, and has remained in custody since that time.[3]Crown\ncounsel submits that Mr. Vaneltsi should be sentenced to three and one\nhalf years' imprisonment.Counsel submits that a term of imprisonment of this\nlength is based upon the application of the step‑up principle.[4]Counsel\nfor Mr. Vaneltsi submits that an appropriate disposition is 12 to 18 months\nof custody to be followed by two years of probation.[5]Both\ncounsel agree that Mr. Vaneltsi is entitled to receive credit for his time\nin custody in remand at a rate of 1.5:1.This is a total of 285 days, which\ncan be deducted from any custodial disposition.Circumstances of Mr. Vaneltsi:Criminal record[6]As a\nyouth, Mr. Vaneltsi has the following record:-two convictions for assault,\ncontrary to s. 266;-three convictions for break\nand enter, contrary to s. 348(1)(b);-five convictions for theft,\ncontrary to s. 334;-one\nconviction for possession of property obtained by crime, contrary to\ns. 354;-one conviction for\nmischief, contrary to s. 430(1);-one conviction for obstruct\npeace officer, contrary to s. 129;-two convictions for failure\nto appear, contrary to s. 145(5); and-four\nconvictions for fail to comply with dispositions, contrary to s. 26 of the\nYoung Offenders Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. Y-1.[7]As an\nadult, Mr. Vaneltsi has the following record:-one conviction for robbery,\ncontrary to s. 344;-one conviction for\nattempted robbery, contrary to s. 344 — and, of course, s. 24(1),\nwhich deals with attempts;-one conviction for assault\npeace officer, contrary to s. 270;-one conviction for assault,\ncontrary to s. 266;-three convictions for break\nand enter, contrary to ss. 348(1)(a) and (b);-one conviction for care and\ncontrol over 80 mg, contrary to s. 253(1)(b);-one conviction for\nunlawfully at large, contrary to s. 145(1)(b);-one conviction for escape\nlawful custody, contrary to s. 145(1)(a);-two convictions for theft,\ncontrary to s. 334;-four convictions for\npossession of property obtained by crime, contrary to s. 354(1)(a);-one conviction for fail to\nattend court, contrary to s. 145(2);-two convictions for fail to\ncomply with disposition, contrary to s. 26 of the Young Offenders Act;-seven convictions for fail\nto comply with probation order, contrary to s. 733.1(1); and-four\nconvictions for fail to comply with recognizance, contrary to s. 145(3).[8]Mr. Vaneltsi’s\nrecord of convictions was fairly unbroken between 1997 and 2009.Since his\nrelease from prison after the 2009 robbery and other convictions, there were\nconvictions in 2011 and 2015 with one offence of violence for assaulting a\npeace officer in 2011.This was the most notable gap in Mr. Vaneltsi's\npattern of criminal offending.Pre‑sentence Report\n(“PSR”)[9]Mr. Vaneltsi\nis 32 years old.His mother, Pauline Johnston, is Tetlit Gwich'in First\nNation.His biological father was white and died when Mr. Vaneltsi was\napproximately two years old.His mother remarried.His stepfather, Thomas\nJohnston, is Teslin Tlingit First Nation.Mr. Vaneltsi identifies as Tetlit\nGwich'in First Nation.Mr. Vaneltsi states he grew up with little\nconnection to his First Nation culture and knows little about it.[10]Mr. Vaneltsi\nhas two brothers who still live with his parents.He says he was raised in a\nstable and supportive home with no drinking or family violence.His parents\ncontinue to be supportive of Mr. Vaneltsi.[11]Ms. Johnston\nattendeda residential school for kindergarten and grade 1, when living in FortMcPherson, Northwest Territories.Her mother also attended aresidential school.This\nwas a day school.Ms. Johnston’s family moved to British Columbiawhen she was\napproximately seven years old.While her family practices some ofher First\nNation's traditions, Ms. Johnston says that she does not practicethem\nmuch anymore.Her family moved to Inuvik when she was 13, and shebegan\ndrinking at that time.Both her parents drank, as didMr. Vaneltsi's\nfather.However, she decided she did not want that lifestyle andquit drinking\nwhen she was 17 years old.[12]Mr. Johnston\nwas raised under traumatic circumstances in Teslin.His mother died when he\nwas five and he was placed in foster care with his three older brothers.He\nattended residential school in Whitehorse.Two of his brothers have substance\nabuse issues.Mr. Johnston quit drinking 20 years ago.[13]Mr. Vaneltsi\nattended school until he dropped out in grade 10 due to his use of alcohol and\ndrugs.Apart from that, he described his school experience as being pretty\ngood.He said his marks were good and he got along well with his teachers and\nthe other students.He attended Yukon College when he was 25 for upgrading but\ndropped out after one semester.He subsequently took a 12‑week job training\nprogram while attending the Yukon College campus in Carcross.He indicates\nthat he wants to go back to school to take additional courses, however he has\nnot taken any steps to inquire about courses or to see whether there is any First\nNation funding available to assist him.[14]Mr. Vaneltsi\nhad a variety of friends while growing up.He says he got along well with\npeople.However, he began to get into trouble when he was hanging around\nfriends who also got into trouble.He says he has friends who are not in\ntrouble as well as those who are.[15]He has\na limited work history, comprised mostly of general labouring at odd jobs.He\ndescribes himself as a hard worker who is focused, on time, and rarely absent\nfrom work.He has, however, mostly lived off of social assistance and has\noften utilized the food bank.[16]Mr. Vaneltsi\nhas been in a relationship with Trisha James for approximately 12 years.He describes this relationship as being a good one with no violence.This was\nconfirmed by Ms. James.Both of them have, however, struggled with\nsubstance abuse issues.Ms. James has continued to maintain the\nrelationship while Mr. Vaneltsi has been incarcerated, whether in jail\nserving a sentence, or while in custody on remand awaiting the disposition of his\nmatters.[17]Ms. Johnston\nhas expressed concerns about this relationship not being a healthy one for Mr. Vaneltsi,\nin part due to the ongoing substance abuse issues he and Ms. James both\nstruggle with.[18]Mr. Vaneltsi\nand Ms. James were homeless at the time of his arrest on this charge.Prior to that, they had resided at a home arranged for with Blood Ties\nassistance.They had to leave this residence due to their drug-using\nlifestyle.Previously, they had lived for several years with Ms. James'\nmother and stepfather.[19]Mr. Vaneltsi\nstates that he wishes to live with his parents when he is released from custody\nuntil he gets back onto his feet.Ms. Johnston confirmed that he is\nwelcome to live there.[20]Mr. Vaneltsi\nhas never attended for counselling or treatment in the past.He has been\nmeeting with Hannah Zimmering, Justice Navigator, from Blood Ties Four Directions\nwhile in custody on remand.They have discussed treatment options, including\nalcohol and drug services and a Jackson Lake treatment program.Ms. Zimmering\nprovided a letter indicating that, in her opinion, since Mr. Vaneltsi\nfirst connected with Blood Ties in 2013, he has \"shown a strong desire to\nmake positive changes in his life.\"He was noted to be respectful of the staff\nand others when involved with Blood Ties and he meaningfully participated in\nworkshops and support groups.[21]Since\nhis recent incarceration at Whitehorse Correctional Centre (“WCC”), Mr. Vaneltsi\nhas actively participated in a three-part program offered by the health\neducation coordinator.In Ms. Zimmering's opinion, Mr. Vaneltsi's “commitment\nto continue to access services while incarcerated further indicates his commitment\nto change.Mr. Vaneltsi is working hard to ensure he has supports in\nplace to help facilitate his transition into the community.”[22]It is\nnoted in the PSR that, although Mr. Vaneltsi has indicated numerous times\nthat he wants to address his substance abuse issues, he has never attended\ntreatment or long-term counselling.Mr. Vaneltsi is noted as having a\nmoderate level of problems with alcohol and a substantial level of problems\nwith drug use.He does not consider alcohol abuse to be a problem for him.[23]Ms. James\nis not a drinker and is not supportive of Mr. Vaneltsi using alcohol, as\nher father died as a result of alcohol abuse.Ms. James, however, states\nthat Mr. Vaneltsi struggles with both alcohol and drug abuse, although he\nhas periods of sobriety followed by binge drinking.She states that whenever\nhe gets into trouble, he has been consuming alcohol.I note that Mr. Vaneltsi\nwas under the influence when he committed the offence for which he is now being\nsentenced.[24]Ms. James\nhas taken advantage of counselling opportunities.She has, however, expressed\nconcerns about her attempts to live a sober lifestyle when Mr. Vaneltsi is\nreleased from custody.[25]Mr.\nVaneltsi states that he stopped smoking marijuana two years ago as well as\nstopping using cocaine one year ago.He states he has began a methadone\ntreatment program about two years ago that assisted him in stopping using\nstreet drugs.This program was not available to him when he was incarcerated\nin WCC for these charges — and as I understand it, he was taken off\nmethadone.[26]The\nauthor of the PSR states that the areas that Mr. Vaneltsi struggles with are\nas follows:-poor impulse control;-difficulty planning and\nworking towards goals;-poor judgment;-severe substance abuse\nproblems;-school difficulties;-lack of consistent\nemployment; and-poor\ninsight into his problem areas.[27]The\nauthor believes that a psychological assessment would be useful in order to\nassist Mr. Vaneltsi in identifying his problem areas and treatment needs.Of particular concern is the lack of any in-depth assessment and treatment for\nhis substance abuse problem over the years.[28]Mr. Vaneltsi\nstates it was his intent to do a smash-and-grab of the bags that were in the\nvehicle.He expressed remorse for what happened.He said the victim told him\nhe was a \"polite robber\" who should get treatment.He said that he\napologized to her for committing the offence while he was committing it.When\nasked how she may have felt, he noted that she did not appear to have been\ntraumatized in the statement she provided to the police and she was not hurt.[29]The\ncriminogenic risk assessment noted Mr. Vaneltsi to require a high level of\nsupervision, to have a high criminal risk rating, and to have a high level of\ncriminogenic needs.[30]An\ninteresting comment in the pre-sentence report was when Mr. Vaneltsi\nstated that … “it was too bad that the Judge couldn't give me a condition to\nexplore my First Nation culture.\"Authorities[31]Crown\ncounsel filed several cases, including R. v. Vaneltsi, 2009 YKTC 70 (CanLII), which\nwas the sentencing decision of Faulkner J. following Mr. Vaneltsi's\nconviction after trial on a charge of robbery, as well as on guilty pleas to\nattempted robbery; breaking and entering; breach of recognizance for fail to\nabstain from the consumption of alcohol; and failing to appear in court on his\ntrial date.[32]Faulkner\nJ. acceded to the joint submission for three years' custody, which he stated\nwas at the very lowest end of the range.He considered that three years'\ncustody could have been an appropriate sentence on the robbery conviction on\nits own.Submissions from counsel indicated that there were some difficulties\nwith proving the attempted robbery charge and the three-year sentence would be\na substantial jump from previous sentences.[33]The\ncircumstances of that robbery were that Mr. Vaneltsi accosted the victim\noutside of a bar, assaulted him, and stole his wristwatch.In the attempted\nrobbery, Mr. Vaneltsi accosted the victim outside of a bar and assaulted him.The victim in that case was able to flee.I note the similarities to the case\nat bar, in that Mr. Vaneltsi had an initial contact with the owner of the\nvan outside of a bar, and, while not assaulting him at that time, which\ndifferentiates it from the other, it is the location that is still similar.[34]In R.\nv. Bush, 2006 BCCA 350 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of two years'\nimprisonment on a charge of robbery, effectively considered to be three years'\nimprisonment when his five months in pre-trial custody was factored in.(see para. 10)[35]In Bush,\nthe 39-year-old offender rode up behind the victim on a bicycle and snatched\nthe wallet she was holding in her hand.The victim tackled the offender and\nwrestled him to the ground in an attempt to recover her wallet.The offender\nwas able to escape with the wallet but was stopped by the police a block away.The victim suffered a bleeding lip and a cut as a result of this incident.[36]The\noffender had 29 prior convictions with 10 property offences, including two counts\nof robbery for which he had received a nine-month conditional sentence.He\nalso had four prior convictions for assault.He had a sad history of drug and\nsexual abuse and was HIV-positive.[37]The Court\nreiterated the “step-up” principle, which:9…is one that is often used to describe the philosophy that sentences should\nusually increase in moderate steps since a sudden, large increase in the length\nof the sentence may interfere with the goal of rehabilitation, if that is the\nfocus of the sentence.The step-up principle has little application where a\nsentencing judge determines that the offence in question calls for a sentence\nin which the primary goals are denunciation and deterrence.…[38]The Court\nagreed that denunciation and deterrence were properly the primary goals of the\nsentence imposed by the sentencing judge, noting that the offender was on\nprobation at the time of the offence; he was undeterred by the victim's\nresistance; she was injured in the struggle; and he had a lengthy record for\nproperty offences and assault, including the two prior robbery convictions.[39]In R.\nv. Cochrane, 2008 YKTC 57 (CanLII), I acceded to a joint submission for a 12-month\nsentence of incarceration on a guilty plea to the offence of assault causing\nbodily harm.The offender and a youth approached two 10-year-old boys outside\nof a movie theatre and demanded money from them, threatening to beat them up if\nthey did not give them any.The youth punched one of the victims in the face,\nbreaking his glasses, causing bruises, and some minor scrapes around his eye.Mr. Cochrane\nwas a party to the assault.Mr. Cochrane had two prior convictions for\nassault.While the offence pled to is that of assault causing bodily harm, I\nnoted that the facts certainly fell within what would constitute a robbery\nwhich could have attracted a sentence closer to the two‑year range.[40]In R.\nv. Jimmie, 2009 BCCA 215 (CanLII), the Court upheld a sentence of two years plus a\nday on a guilty plea to a charge of robbery.This was in addition to 35 days\nof pretrial custody.The incident was described as a violent purse snatching\nwith an 81-year-old victim.The victim suffered minor injuries in her\nunsuccessful struggle to hold on to her purse.The 46-year-old offender was a\nchronic alcoholic who was intoxicated at the time of the offence.She had a\nlengthy criminal record, undoubtedly related to her addiction, including 39\nproperty related offences; 10 offences of violence, including one for armed\nrobbery; and seven for breaches of court orders.Her longest period of\nincarceration previously had been nine months imposed for the armed robbery.[41]The\nsentencing judge considered the application of R. v. Gladue, [1999]\nS.C.R. 688, and the Appeal Court considered the sentencing judge to have been\nclearly alive to the systemic factors that had negatively influenced Ms. Jimmie's\nformative years and had continued to impact her adult life.[42]Ms. Jimmie\nwas of the Kluskus community located in a rural area of the Chilcotin.Her\nlife was described as being “full of horrors”.She attended residential school\nwhere she was exposed to an atmosphere of violence.The sentencing judge\nweighed Ms. Jimmie's “bleak prospect for rehabilitation” and concluded\nthat the principles of denunciation and deterrence were paramount, requiring a\nfederal sentence.Balanced against this was the need to craft a sentence that\nrecognized Ms. Jimmie's expressed desire to renew her efforts in\nrehabilitation.[43]The Court,\nin paras. 19 to 21, reiterated the step-up principle, as had been enunciated by\nRyan J.A. in Bush, and concluded that it had no application in these\ncircumstances, as Ms. Jimmie's rehabilitation was not a significant\nsentencing factor at the time.[44]The\nBritish Columbia Court of Appeal has further commented on the step-up principle\nin R. v. T.A.N., 2012 BCCA 498 (CanLII), stating:[23]The \"step-up\" principle is discussed in R. v. Kory by Ryan\nJ.A. at para. 6 she said:[6]... The \"step-up principle\" is not a principle or goalset out in\nthe Criminal Code.It is a short hand way of expressing the idea that\nsentencing requires a measured approach, even for repeat offenders.As Mr.\nJustice Lambert put in R. v. Robitaille, 1993 CanLII 2561 (BC CA), [1993] B.C.J. No. 1404.[8]In relation to that argument, I say that the theory that sentences should go up\nonly in moderate steps is a theory which rests on the sentencing principles of\nrehabilitation.It should be only in cases where rehabilitation is a\nsignificant sentencing factor.So the conclusion, in any particular case, that\nthe increase in sentence should not be too large rests on a consideration of\nthe circumstance of the particular offender and a desire not to discourage any\neffort he may be making to rehabilitate himself by the imposition of a sentence\nthat may be seen by him to be a dead weight on his future life....Thus,\nto achieve the goals of specific deterrence and rehabilitation it often is\nunnecessary to do more than increase punishment incrementally when an offender\nis engaged in repetitive offending.However, the step-up principle should be\napplied where the circumstances call for it.[7]In a case such as this, where the respondent has a lengthy record for which\nhe has received consistently low sentences for the same type of offence, the\nstep-up principle is not of great assistance.It has not worked.[8]Mr. Kory’s record shows that he has not been deterred or rehabilitated by the\nsentences he has received and remains a threat to his community.This was a\nserious offence, committed by a persistent criminal.The principle of the\nprotection of the public through a denunciatory sentence ought to have taken\nprecedence in this case.[Emphasis\nadded.]Application for Mr.\nVaneltsi[45]I find\nthat the circumstances of Mr. Vaneltsi's offence, in and of themselves, are\nless aggravating than in any of the above noted cases.Unlike\nMr. Vaneltsi's prior convictions for robbery and attempted robbery, this\nrobbery does not involve an act of violence against a victim committed at the\noutset in order to facilitate the robbery.Mr. Vaneltsi broke a vehicle\nwindow in what would, if not for the intervention of the victim, have been\ncategorized as theft in the smash-and-grab category.This became a robbery\nwhen Mr. Vaneltsi continued to struggle with the victim and obtained $40\nfrom her after she intervened to stop the theft.Had Mr. Vaneltsi simply\ndropped the items and fled, he would not have been facing a charge of robbery.[46]Similarly\nin the Bush and Jimmie cases, the theft was from a person with\nthe intentional use of force against the victim in order to commit the\noffence.Mr. Vaneltsi's use of force came after the initial theft.The\nviolence in the Cochrane case was intentional and much more significant,\nparticularly considering the young age of the victims.[47]This\nsaid, the aggravating feature of Mr. Vaneltsi's case is his significant\ncriminal record.I agree with the principle that a sentence should not be\nincreased as a result of prior convictions in a manner that effectively re-punishes\nthe offender for crimes for which he or she has already been sanctioned.However, the existence of a significant criminal record, and in particular\nwhere there are convictions for the same offence for which the offender is now\nbeing sentenced, often calls for longer jail sentences due to the increased\nrisk for the commission of future crimes that the offender poses as\ndemonstrated by the fact of the prior convictions.[48]While\nthis assessment of increased risk is not inevitable, certainly in the absence\nof information regarding the offender that would counter the notion of\nincreased risk, the need to separate the offender from society in order to\nprotect society is an elevated consideration.There is also an increased\nemphasis on denunciation and deterrence.[49]The\ninformation regarding Mr. Vaneltsi paints a portrait of an individual who,\ndespite having the support and ability to lead a pro-social life, has simply\nchosen not to put any real effort into doing so.He has chosen a lifestyle in\nwhich he defaults to substance abuse and does not attempt in any serious way to\ntake steps to obtain assistance and support and make day-to-day decisions to\nchange his lifestyle.[50]On the\none hand, Mr. Vaneltsi's criminal history and seemingly entrenched\ncriminal lifestyle would appear to call for a sentence that emphasizes\ndenunciation and deterrence and puts little emphasis on Mr. Vaneltsi's\nprospects for rehabilitation, which could perhaps be considered to be slim.On\nthe other hand, there is some information before me to indicate that Mr. Vaneltsi\nis taking at least some initial positive steps towards obtaining an\nunderstanding of the issues that he has failed to deal with to date.His\ninvolvement with Blood Ties since 2013 is indicative of some recognition of a\nneed for help and of steps towards changing his lifestyle.[51]As Mr. Vaneltsi\nhas not availed himself of any treatment or counselling in the past, there is a\nreasonable possibility that should he put any effort into involving himself in\ntreatment and counselling, he may actually acquire some ability to end his\ncurrent destructive lifestyle.I am not prepared to discount Mr. Vaneltsi's\nexpressed desire to begin to engage in assessment, counselling, and treatment.However, he is certainly not at the point where I can minimize the importance\nof denunciation and deterrence in order to emphasize rehabilitation.Mr. Vaneltsi\nhas a ways to go yet.[52]Certainly\nthe principles of Gladue as reinforced in R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC\n13 (CanLII), apply.While there is not the type of dysfunctional home life and\nchildhood in Mr. Vaneltsi's case that is often seen when sentencing Aboriginal\noffenders, s. 718.2(e) nonetheless requires me to consider all other\nalternatives to imprisonment.This, of course, includes requiring me to\nconsider, in the event that a custodial disposition is warranted, just how long\na sentence needs to be imposed.I am satisfied that the appropriate\ndisposition needs to strike a balance between the need to denounce this offence\nto deter Mr. Vaneltsi and others from committing similar offences and to\nseparate him from society in order to protect the public.[53]In this\ncase, I find that, given Mr. Vaneltsi's historical lack of motivation to\npursue a positive change in his life and his expressed desire to now begin\ndoing so, that a sentence that emphasizes specific deterrence will, in fact,\nassist him in his rehabilitative efforts.It will do so by sending him a\nmessage now that he needs to find the motivation to begin and follow through on\nassessment, counselling, and programming and then to put into practice what he\nlearns there.He is young enough to make the changes necessary to have a\npositive and pro-social life.He is also, however, at the age where, if he\nfails to make the necessary changes, he will soon find himself watching life\npass him by while he sits in custody and opportunities disappear.In this\nsense, specific deterrence serves the objective of enhancing the prospects for rehabilitation.[54]Mr. Vaneltsi\nstated that he wished he could be required, as part of his sentence, to explore\nhis First Nation culture.He does not need me to impose such a requirement.If that is something that Mr. Vaneltsi is interested in, then that is\nsomething he can pursue on his own.It is time for Mr. Vaneltsi to find\nthe motivation within himself to put his current somewhat criminally entrenched\nlifestyle behind him and move forward into a more productive and useful life.[55]I\nunderstood the Crown's submission on the step-up principle to be that the Crown\nwas seeking a moderate increase from the three-year sentence imposed the last\ntimes, on the basis that rehabilitation is still a factor for Mr. Vaneltsi.In that sense, the Crown was giving some recognition to the positive steps\ntowards rehabilitation while at the same time looking at his last sentence and\nseeking only a moderate increase.I have indicated in this decision that I\nfind the facts of this case to be less aggravating than in the prior\nconvictions for robbery and in the cases filed before me.I agree that this is\na case where rehabilitation is still a realistic possibility and, as such,\nthere should not be a significant increase in the sentence that is given to Mr. Vaneltsi.[56]This\nsaid, and in note of what I said earlier given the somewhat different\ncircumstances of this robbery, I nonetheless find that the appropriate\ndisposition in this case is less than that sought by the Crown.I find that\nthe appropriate sentence is one of 24 months.Applying nine and one third\nmonths' credit for Mr. Vaneltsi's time in custody on remand, this leaves a\nremanet of 14 2/3 months to be served in custody.This will be followed by a\nperiod of probation of two years.[57]The\nterms of the probation order will be as follows:1.Keep the peace\nand be of good behaviour;2.Appear before\nthe court when required to do so by the court;3.Remain within the Yukon Territory unless you obtain written\npermission from your

reality is that Mr. Vaneltsi\nneeds to make the decision himself as to what role alcohol is going to play in\nhis life and I do not intend to require him to abstain from alcohol.What he\nneeds to do is abstain from committing offences and this provides a bit of a\ntransition period.8.Attend and actively\nparticipate in all assessment and counselling programs as directed by your

TranCitation No.\n2014 MBPC 44THE\nPROVINCIAL COURT OF MANITOBABETWEENHerMajesty the Queen))Anne Turner and Christina Cheater,for the Crown)-and –))AnthonyTran)Roberta Campbell, for the Accused))Judgment delivered:)November 1, 2014CORRIN, BRIAN, P.J.Introduction[1]On April 16, 2014, the accused was found guilty\nof charges of possession for the purpose of trafficking (s.5(2) CDSA) and\npossess property obtained by crime under $5,000.00 (s.354 (1)(a)).The\noffences took place on July 9, 2010 and the trial took place on December 11,\n2013.No information was provided to the court as to why it took almost 4\nyears to resolve this matter.[2]The accused was the subject of a traffic stop by\nWinnipeg Police Service on July 9, 2010.At such time, the following items\nwere seized from his vehicle by the police:687 ¼ gr. rocks of cocaine; 5\nounces of powdered cocaine; a digital scale and $1,525.00 cash.The $1,525.00\ncash constituted the property obtained by crime.[3]The following were filed as exhibits at the\nsentencing:•S-1 – A pre-sentence report dated June 27, 2014\nprepared by Kristie Pedrosa and Patrick Cortino, Probation Officers.The\nreport described the offender to be “very low risk to re-offend”.[4]The accused admits that he asked an unnamed drug\ndealer for an employment opportunity.It is his position that he did this in\norder to earn money to go to university and that he had only been so employed\nfor approximately 2 months before his arrest.According to the accused, it was\nhis job to deliver drugs to customers, collect monies owing with respect to\nsuch transactions and remit the money to his employer.He claimed to have only\nmade $1,500.00 in the approximately 2 months that he acted in such respect.It\nwas his contention that the money in his possession, the $1,525.00, represented\nhis total earnings as a drug courier.According to Mr. Tran he had only made\nsome 4 or 5 deliveries prior to his arrest.In this regard Mr. Tran told the\ncourt that he was in personal possession of these monies because he feared that\nhis parents might find same if he left it in his bedroom at home and deduce\nthat he was up to no good.The drug seizures were street valued at\napproximately $30,000.00.[5]The Crown seeks a sentence of 36 months while\nthe accused seeks a sentence of 2 years less a day to be served conditionally.[6]It is the Crown’s position that the range for\nthis type of offence is roughly 2 ½ to 6 years and the sentence that they are\nseeking takes account of the accused’s mitigating factors as it is at the low\nend of such range.In this respect the Crown referred to R. v. Rocha,\n2009 MBCA 26 (CanLII) wherein Chartier, J.A., indicates that couriers involved at the\nmid level whose sole purpose is to transport drugs in order to prevent their\nemployers from being detected must expect a sentence to be in the range of 3 –\n6 years, and, R. v. Gilchrist, 2004 MBCA 21 (CanLII), where Freedman, J.A.\ndescribed the ranges of sentences for this type of offence and this type of\noffender as being less than 2 ½ years and beyond 4 years.The Crown also\nreferred to R. v. Stebeleski 2007 MBCA 1 (CanLII), another Manitoba Court of\nAppeal decision supporting the position that R. v. Gilchrist reflected\nthe appropriate range for this type of offence and this type of offender.In\nthis regard, Huband, J.A. quotes Freedman, J.A. at paragraph 19:“The range for this type of offence,\nand for this type of offender, may start at less than 2 ½ years but it is\ncertainly wide and it extends beyond 4 years” (at para. 27 of Gilchrist)[7]Mr. Tran is currently 23 years of age.He has\nno prior record and has expressed remorse for his actions.He hopes to return\nto university, get a degree and obtain conventional employment in the future.Mr. Tran was in the final year of university but dropped out approximately a\nyear prior to the preparation of the pre-sentence report.He attributed this\nto stress from these proceedings.The past year was the first time that he had\nnot been enrolled as a full time student.Mr. Tran has been working full time\nsince the spring of 2014.At the time of the subject offence he was working\npart-time for Best Buy Electronics.He has also held other part time\npositions.There is no reason to believe that Mr. Tran has ever been involved\nin a life style involving illicit drugs.He appears to come from a very\nsupportive and close family who sustain and encourage a relatively positive and\npro-social lifestyle.His parents have been very supportive of him even to the\nextent that they gave him the money to re-imburse his drug employer for the\nlost cargo of drugs seized by the police in this matter.[8]The Criminal Code sets out the purposes\nand principles of sentencing in section 7.18.In this respect, in imposing any\nsentence the court must keep in mind the following objectives:a)denunciation\nof unlawful conduct;b)deterrence\nof others as well as the offender;c)where\nnecessary, the separation of offenders from the rest of society;d)rehabilitation;e)reparation\nto victims and the community;f)promoting a sense of responsibility in offenders and an\nacknowledgment of the harm done.[9]In deciding what a fit and proper sentence is,\nthe court must take into account the circumstances of the offence and the\noffender and the fundamental principle that a sentence must be proportionate to\nthe gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.[10]In the Gilchrist case, previously cited,\nthe accused was a young man, only 20 years of age with no criminal history.He\nhad been found to be in possession of crack cocaine with a street value of\n$14,000.00 and $7,640.00 cash and other drug-related paraphernalia.The accused\nhad pled guilty at a relatively early stage.He had an unfortunate family\nbackground and had been determined to lack family supports.He was out on bail\nat the time of the drug offence.The Court of Appeal agreed with the\nsentencing judge’s opinion that the accused was something more than a street\nlevel dealer and upheld a 4 year conviction, acknowledging that it was at the\nhigh end of the available range.[11]R. v. Rocha was a\ncase where the Appeal Court confirmed a sentence of 4 years for an accused who,\nafter trial, had been found guilty of possessing 20 ounces of cocaine for the\npurpose of trafficking.The court described him as a courier who transported\ndrugs at the multi-ounce level.Chartier, J.A. emphasized that deterrence and\ndenunciation are the prime ingredients of the sentence assessment for an\noffence involving possession for the purpose of trafficking cocaine.[12]Given the amount of drugs and cash in Mr. Tran’s\npossession at the time of his arrest I think it fair to categorize him as a\nmid-level courier for the purposes of this sentence analysis.The Gilchrist/Rocha\nrange is therefore less than 2 ½ to 6 years in the penitentiary.As was\nexpressed in these cases, the purpose of establishing this range is to ensure\nthat people will not easily allow themselves to be part of the trafficking of\ncocaine and other such pernicious drugs.It is a trite observation that people\nwho perform services such as those performed by Mr. Tran act as insulators in\nthe drug trade preventing the apprehension of those who actually control the\nillegal business.The Court of Appeal has emphasized that such accomplices\nmust receive penalties that act as a disincentive to their willingness to\nbecome engaged in the business.In the case before me the Crown has argued that\nthe only way to maintain such a disincentive is to order a penitentiary term of\n3 years.[13]Counsel for the accused argued that deterrence\nand denunciation should not be utilized to the exclusion of other sentencing\nconsiderations such as long term rehabilitation.Ms. Campbell submits that in\nall the circumstances, a conditional sentence is the appropriate option as such\na sentence while reflecting the denunciation and deterrence also permits\nappropriate elements of emphasis on rehabilitation.In such regard she cited a\nnumber of court decisions in which conditional sentences have been granted in\ncase involving trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking of\ncocaine or similar hard drugs, namely:•R. v. Marchioni,\nNovember 8, 2012, Manitoba Queen’s Bench•R. v. Viznaugh,\n[2010] MBQB 17•R. v. Petit,\n[2009] MBQB 234•R. v. Tarnowski,\n[2010] MBQB 218•R. v. Deleon,\n[2011] MBQB 165•R. v. DeJesus,\nJuly 12, 2006, Manitoba Queen’s Bench•R. v.Alcantara,\nDecember 9, 2010, Manitoba Provincial Court•R. v. Dare,\nSeptember 3, 2008, Manitoba Provincial Court•R. v. Piche,\nApril 19, 2011, Manitoba Provincial Court•R. v. Tourand,\nFebruary 1, 2006, Manitoba Queen’s Bench[14]The cases where lengthy conditional sentences\nwere imposed tend into two situations:Firstly, dire circumstances that have\nled a person with no previous criminal record into trafficking drugs and\nsecondly, situations where offenders have made exceptional and significant\nchanges in their lives for a lengthy period of time after having been charged.Most such sentences in the second category involve offenders who were involved\nin trafficking in order to support their own drug addiction.With respect to\ndefence counsel, I am not of the opinion that either of these situations\npertain at the case at bar.[15]When the Court of Appeal sets out a range that\ndoes mean that it must be applied in every case that comes before a lower level\ncourt.The sentencing judge is definitely entitled to exercise some\ndiscretion.In R. v. Marchioni, a decision of Dewar, J. of the Manitoba\nCourt of Queen’s Bench, delivered on November 8, 2012, Dewar, J. quoted from\nthe Supreme Court of Canada in the case of R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 2 (CanLII),\nwhich described such discretion as follows:“The wide discretion granted to\nsentencing judges has limits.It is fettered in part by the case law that has\nset down, in some circumstances, general ranges of sentences for particular\noffences, to encourage greater consistency between sentencing decisions in\naccordance with the principle of parity enshrined in the Code.But, it\nmust be remembered that, while courts should pay heed to these ranges, they are\nguidelines rather than hard and fast rules.A judge can order a sentence\noutside that range as long as it is in accordance with the principles and\nobjectives of sentencing.Thus, a sentence falling outside the regular range\nof appropriate sentences is not necessarily unfit.Regard must be had to all\nthe circumstances of the offence and the offender and to the needs of the\ncommunity in which the offence occurred.”[16]It is my view that this is not a case where the\nneeds of the community will be well served by recognizing Mr. Tran’s relative\nsuccess within the community.In other words, the specific circumstances of\nthe offence and the personal circumstances of the accused do not encourage the\nadjustment of the general range in this particular case.This in my view\nbecause the accused was, prior to his involvement, already well on his way to\nleading a productive law and materially rewarding life.In reality, Mr. Tran\nhas not been called upon to make any significant efforts to change his way of\nlife.He was a relatively intelligent and pro-social individual before his\ndecision to enter into the illegal drug industry world and essentially is still\nthat person today.No dire personal circumstances led Mr. Tran into drug\ntrafficking.However, that being said, the court notes that Mr. Tran appears\nto show sincere remorse for what he has done and appears to have been\ninfluenced in such regard by his relative state of immaturity at the time of\nhis offending behavior.He was after all, only 19 years of age.I also agree\nwith the pre-sentence report conclusion that he is at low risk of\nre-offending.The court therefore views the accused as an excellent candidate\nfor rehabilitation in the circumstances.The court also observes that a\nconditional sentence can impose conditions that satisfy the elements of\ndenunciation and deterrence.[17]It is my view that defence counsel is correct\nwhen she argues that a conditional sentence would be consistent with the\nfundamental purpose and principles of sentencing as set out in s. 718.2 of the Code.As I mentioned before, the Supreme Court in R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII),\nstated that a conditional sentence can accomplish the objectives of\ndenunciation and deterrence.[18]The dicta in Proulx also make clear that\nthere are no presumptions for or against the use of conditional sentences for\nany offence.That sentencing is an individualized process and a court must\nimpose a sentence that is fit or appropriate for the specific offender given\nthe nature and circumstances of the specific offence. The sentencing judge must\nof course always consider which sentencing objectives are most important in the\nparticular circumstances of the case before him or her.As was also discussed\nin Proulx, where both punitive and restorative objectives need to be\nachieved in a given case, a conditional sentence is likely a better sanction\nthat incarceration.Conversely, where the need for punishment is particularly\npressing and there is little opportunity to achieve restorative objectives,\nincarceration will likely be the more attractive sanction option.However,\neven where restorative objectives cannot be readily satisfied the conditional\nsentence will be preferable to incarceration in cases where a conditional\nsentence can achieve the objectives of denunciation and deterrence as\neffectively as incarceration.Of course where punitive objectives such as denunciation\nare particularly pressing, such as in cases in which there are aggravating\ncircumstances, incarceration will generally be the preferable sanction.This\nwill be the case notwithstanding that restorative goals might be achieved by\nthe imposition of a conditional sentence.[19]Conversely, a conditional sentence may provide\nsufficient denunciation even in cases where restorative objectives are of\ndiminished importance, depending on the nature of the conditions imposed, the\nduration of the sentence and the circumstances of the offender and the\ncommunity in which the conditional sentence is to be served.Of course there\nmay be circumstances in which the need for deterrence will warrant\nincarceration.Proulx also warns sentencing judges of the dangers of placing\ntoo much emphasis on deterrence.It reminds judges that the deterrent effect\nof incarceration is uncertain.It also reminds sentencing judges that a\nconditional sentence can provide significant deterrence if sufficiently\npunitive conditions are imposed and the public is made aware of the severity of\nthe sanctions.[20]On the evidence before me, I am satisfied that\nthe accused is not presently a danger to the community and does not need to be\nseparated from the community for that reason.I am further satisfied that he\nis genuinely remorseful and it is very likely that this incident has changed\nhim for the better.[21]I therefore conclude that deterrence of the\naccused is not a significant matter of concern.Section 718.2 of the Code\nstates that an offender should not be deprived of his or her liberty if less\nrestrictive sanctions may be appropriate.As mentioned the court is required\nto consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment.My task is\ntherefore to determine whether a conditional sentence can be designed for this\naccused such that it will adequately and appropriately address the principles\nof denunciation and general deterrence.[22]Although numerous cases were referred to by\ncounsel, many others exist.The best that can be said is that these cases\nprovide guidance to a judge in my position but notwithstanding that I must\nremember that each case has its own facts and each offender his or her own\ncircumstances.I confirm that I have reviewed and considered all the cases\nwhich have been referred to me notwithstanding that I have not made reference\nto all of them in this decision.[23]As almost always there are both mitigating and\naggravating circumstances in this case.The nature and amount of the drugs are\ndefinitely an aggravating factor.On the other hand, his youth, reflecting\nimmature judgment, is a major mitigant.[24]I am satisfied that the goals of denunciation\nand general deterrence can be met by permitting the accused to serve his\nsentence in the community subject to appropriate stringent conditions.In so\ndoing, I conclude that a conditional sentence will be fully consistent with the\nobjectives of section 718.2.Accordingly, I sentence Mr. Tran to the maximum\nconditional sentence, 2 years less a day to be served in the community with respect\nto the trafficking charge, followed by 12 months of unsupervised probation.[25]In addition to the compulsory conditions set out\nin s. 742.3 (1) of the Code, the accused shall be kept under house\narrest for the first 12 months of his sentence.[26]He is further ordered to report to his\nSupervisor within two (2) working days and thereafter as directed.[27]He is granted curfew exemptions as follows:i.For the purpose of attending programs and\ntreatment as directed by the Sentence Supervisor and the necessary travel time\nto and from;ii.Time attending to medical or dental appointments\nas may be pre-approved in writing by the Sentence Supervisor;iii.Time doing community service work and the\nnecessary travel time to and from;iv.Emergencies involving the accused’s health;v.A period of four (4) hours per week to attend to\npersonal business matters as may be pre-approved in writing by the Sentence\nSupervisor[28]For the second 12 months less one day of his\nsentence, the accused is also to be provided an exemption from house arrest for\nthe purpose of attending to his employment and/or his education and the\nnecessary travel time to and from as same are pre-approved by his Sentence\nSupervisor.[29]The accused shall also comply with the following\nconditions:i.He is to abstain absolutely from the consumption\nand possession of alcohol, drugs and other intoxicants except as may be\nprescribed by a medical doctor;ii.He is to attend, participate in and successfully\ncomplete such counselling, programming and treatment as may be directed by his\nSentence Supervisor;iii.He is to complete within the first 12 months of\nhis sentence, 150 hours of community service as directed by the Sentence\nSupervisor.The Court recommends that the offender be assigned to community\nservice work that will permit him to see firsthand and to repay directly with\nhis time and efforts, those members of our community, some of whom have become\nhelpless and needy as a result of an addiction to hard drugs;iv.He is to answer the door or telephone in\nresponse to authorities checking his compliance with his house arrest and must\nmaintain a land line for such purpose;v.The accused may possess one cell phone for\nbusiness and personal use and shall make available to the authorities upon\nrequest the records of such cell phone’s use.[30]The Court further orders that the accused attend\nat the Winnipeg Police Service for the purpose of providing DNA samples within\nthirty (30) days from today.[31]There will further be a forfeiture of all items\nseized as well as a ten (10) year weapons and/or ammunition prohibition\npursuant to s. 109 of the Code from this date forward.[32]The conditions of the unsupervised probation I\npreviously mentioned are to be as follows:1.You are to keep the peace and be of good\nbehavior;2.You are to appear before the court when and if\nrequired to do so;3.You are to notify the Court or your Supervisor\nof any change of address or change of name prior to implementing same.[33]The court imposes a 3 month concurrent sentence\nwith respect to the “possess goods” charge.[34]There will also be an order for full costs and\nsurcharges.“Original signed by:CORRIN, BRIAN, P.J."}

Whetung of the Ontario\nCourt of Justice dated January 13, 2004 and the sentence imposed dated March 9,\n2004.ARMSTRONG J.A.:[1]On January 13, 2004, the appellant pleaded guilty to making and\ndistributing child pornography before Justice T. C. Whetung of the Ontario\nCourt of Justice.He was subsequently sentenced on March 9, 2004 to a\npenitentiary term of two years and three years’ probation.He now appeals his\nconvictions and seeks to set aside his guilty plea.He also appeals his\nsentence.[2]For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction,\nbut I would allow the sentence appeal.THE FACTS[3]The appellant and Ms. J. began a dating relationship in August 2000.Ms. J. celebrated her 15th birthday on […], 2000.The appellant was\n22 years old at the time.[4]On March 24, 2001 the appellant and Ms. J. traveled to Toronto with\nanother couple to attend a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey game.They spent the\nnight at a Toronto hotel where the appellant and Ms. J. engaged in consensual\nsex.During this encounter the appellant used a camera, provided by Ms. J., to\ntake photographs of Ms. J. and himself engaging in acts of oral and vaginal\nsex.[5]About two months following the Toronto weekend Ms. J. terminated the\nrelationship.The appellant was devastated by this turn of events.While in\nthe midst of dealing with his devastation, the appellant made a collage.The\ncollage contained photographs that had been taken in Toronto of Ms. J. engaged\nin explicit sexual acts with the appellant.While part of the appellant’s body\nwas shown in the photographs, unlike Ms. J., neither his face nor any other\nidentifying characteristics were apparent.There were additional photographs\nof Ms. J., fully clothed, in the collage.The collage included Ms. J.’s name\nand her place of residence.Beneath the photographs the collage contained the\nfollowing inscription:Weekend away.Hockeytickets: Free“Extra\nShit”: About $250.00Hotel room: $269.00a\nRING (fuckin’ stupid): $500.00telling me you love\nme one weekend and that it’s over the next weekend,and trusting me with\nthese pics….….“PRICELESS”Above the word, “PRICELESS” there\nappeared an exhortation to Ms. J., which included a number of profanities.[6]The collage was scanned into the appellant’s computer and e-mailed to a\nfriend who had apparently been in Toronto at the time the sexually explicit\nphotographs were taken.The appellant also saved the collage to a default\nfolder on his computer that was accessible to two peer-to-peer file sharing\nprograms, described in the evidence as Kazaa and Sexter.Eventually the\ncollage was passed by way of e-mail to others, who included friends and acquaintances\nof Ms. J.By April 2002, the collage came to the attention of Ms. J.Ms. J.\ntelephoned the appellant and confronted him in respect of the collage.At\nfirst he denied having anything to do with the collage, but soon he admitted\nhis involvement because Ms. J. “broke his heart”.[7]In November 2002, a friend of Ms. J., in a fit of anger, e-mailed the\ncollage to Ms. J.’s father The e-mail contained the subject line: “Daddy look\nwhat I’ve become.”Also in November 2002, a student at Ms. J.’s school placed\na printed copy of the collage in Ms. J.’s locker.This led to Ms. J. taking\nthe printed copy of the collage to the school principal.The principal called\nthe police.[8]On January 26, 2003 the appellant was arrested and charged with making,\npossessing and distributing child pornography.The appellant gave a cautioned\nvideotaped statement to the police in which he admitted to taking the photos of\nMs. J., making the collage and e-mailing it to his friend.[9]The provisions of the Criminal Code, S.C. 1993, c. 46, s. 2 under\nwhich the appellant was charged are as follows:163.1(1) In this\nsection, “child pornography” means(a)a\nphotographic, film, video or other visual representation, whether or not it was\nmade by electronic or mechanical means,(i)that shows a person who is or is depicted\nas being under the age of eighteen years and is engaged in or is depicted as\nengaged in explicit sexual activity,…(2)Every person who\nmakes, prints, publishes or possesses for the purpose of publication any child\npornography is guilty of(a) an indictable offence and liable to\nimprison-ment for a term not exceeding ten years; or(b) an offence punishable on summary\ncon-viction.(3)Every person who\nimports, distributes, sells or possesses for the purpose of distribution or\nsale any child pornography is guilty of(a)an indictable offence and liable to\nimprison-ment for a term not exceeding ten years; or(b)an offence punishable on summary\ncon-viction.[10]The appellant retained Paul Burgess as his lawyer.Mr. Burgess appeared\nin court on January 13, 2004, when the appellant entered his guilty plea.Mr.\nBurgess advised the court that the appellant intended to plead guilty to the\nmaking and distribution charges.Counsel for the Crown advised that he\nintended to withdraw the possession charge after the guilty plea.No inquiry\nwas made by the trial judge, pursuant to s. 606 of the Criminal Code, as\nto the voluntary nature of the appellant’s plea.The appellant was arraigned\nand he pleaded guilty.[11]The Crown read a summary of the facts taken from a synopsis prepared by\nthe police.The synopsis was read without prejudice to the ability to call\nevidence on the day of sentencing.The synopsis included a reference to the\neffect that the appellant had posted the collage on Kazaa and Sexter.In\nresponse to a question from the trial judge concerning the number of people who\nmay have accessed the collage by the Internet, counsel for the Crown advised\nthat anybody in the world could access it since it was posted on Kazaa and Sexter.The trial judge then observed: “Yes, that’s my understanding too, there’s\nsimply no limit to the extent of the distribution now.”[12]The trial judge made findings of guilt and adjourned the case in order\nthat a presentence report could be prepared.[13]Richard Kucharski, a probation and parole officer, prepared the\npresentence report.The presentence report presented a very negative picture\nof the appellant.Mr. Kucharski commented on the appellant’s total lack of\nremorse.He indicated that the appellant had failed to tell him that he had\nmade the collage “accessible over the Internet by posting it on the Kazaa and\nSexter sites”.Mr. Kucharski suggested that the appellant misled him\nconcerning counselling that he was receiving from two doctors.The presentence\nreport concluded with a highly questionable reference to a recommendation made\nby Detective Chapman, the investigating officer, to the effect that the\nappellant should serve a custodial sentence followed by a significant period of\nprobation.[14]Mr. Burgess forwarded the presentence report to the appellant for his\ncomment.The appellant prepared a six page, single-spaced response.In that\nresponse he took issue with a number of statements made by Mr. Kucharski.He\nalso attached a copy of a letter of apology dated November 5, 2003, which was\naddressed to Ms. J.He explained that he had never sent the letter of apology\nto Ms. J. because of the no contact restriction attached to his bail order.[15]The appellant also explained in his response to the presentence report\nthat it was not his intention to make the collage available for anyone to\naccess:I saved the file in ‘My\nDocuments’ folder, my intention was not to make it available for anyone for\naccess, this just happened to be the default folder where any of my files\n[were] saved to.This is the folder I used to download files to [and] from the\ninternet.This file was a shared folder but you could only access the\nfolder when I was connected to the internet and was logged in to a program that\nwas used for downloading and uploading files [emphasis in\noriginal][16]Ms. J. prepared a handwritten sixteen page victim impact statement which\nMr. Burgess sent to the appellant for his comment.The victim impact statement\noutlined, in great detail, the understandably devastating impact of the\nappellant’s conduct on Ms. J.’s life.Ms. J. indicated in her statement that,\nwhen she heard that the collage was on Kazaa, she spent hours searching for the\npictures but did not find them.The appellant prepared a seven page response\nto the victim impact statement, which he gave to Mr. Burgess.[17]The sentencing hearing was held before the trial judge on March9, 2004.Mr. Burgess attempted to explain to the trial judge howKazaa and Sexter\noperated and the likely limited distribution that was achieved throughthese\nmedia.However, his sparse knowledge of computer technologyprevented him from\ndoing so.Mr. Burgess advised the trial judge:Your\nHonour, I have a longer explanation which was provided by Mr. Walsh which again\nis complete – complete computer-ease to me.I’m happy to forward it to Your\nHonour if you wish to read it.The trial judge declined the offer.[18]Mr. Burgess sought a conditional sentence on behalf of the appellant.He submitted to the trial judge that the appellant did not realize that the\ncollage would be considered child pornography (something the appellant had also\ntold the author of the presentence report).Mr. Burgess explained that if the\nappellant had known he was committing a criminal offence, he would never have\nmade the collage.[19]Mr. Burgess did his best to deal with the conclusion made by the author\nof the presentence report that the appellant showed no remorse for his actions.\nMr. Burgess called Mr. Kucharski as a witness.However, not much was gained on\nbehalf of the appellant through the cross-examination which followed, as Mr.\nKucharski stood his ground.[20]Counsel for the Crown submitted that this was not a usual case of child\npornography and observed that other cases dealt with commercial distribution to\nsatisfy the greed of some and the prurient, perverted interests of others.Crown counsel sought “a period of incarceration in a real facility”.By the\nlatter comment, I assume counsel meant a penitentiary term.He also sought a\nlengthy period of probation.[21]During the course of sentencing the appellant, the trial judge engaged\nthe appellant in a dialogue.In that dialogue the appellant attempted to\nexplain that he had not posted the collage on either Kazaa or Sexter but that\nhe simply saved it in his default folder.As it happened, he had also used his\ndefault folder to download material from Kazaa or Sexter.As soon as he\nrealized the potential for access by others to the collage through Kazaa and\nSexter, he contacted representatives of Kazaa and Sexter to stop the collage\nfrom being downloaded or uploaded.[22]The trial judge concluded that, because of the age of Ms. J., the\nappellant was in a position of trust in relation to her.[23]The trial judge made the following statements concerning sentence:In the present matter,\nit seems that the production and distribution of the child pornography involved\na desire to humiliate and embarrass and perhaps to ruin the life of the\nvictim.….The\ndistribution of these images would also involve a conscious decision and the\ncreation and distribution were clearly done for a form of gratification by Mr.\nWalsh.I am\nunable to discern the nature of that gratification.I have heard of things\nlike revenge.I have heard of things like a desire to make the victim hurt\nlike he felt he was hurting because she ended the relationship, and there may\nbe other aspects of gratification which are not evident in this matter, but\nnonetheless this matter falls within a form of gratification by distribution of\nwhat happens to be, in the circumstance in which it occurred, the production\nand distribution of child pornography..…There is, in my\nopinion, in this matter a need for a specific deterrent sentence, based upon\nthe contents of the presentence report before me and based upon the lack of\ninsight evidenced in that presentence report.There is a need for a\ngeneral deterrent sentence in this matter.It must be clear to members of the\ncommunity who may have the technical expertise and ability to interfere with\nothers’ lives in these hurtful and shameful ways, as I’ve said before, with a\nsimple key stroke, that they should not do so.[24]The trial judge concluded that a conditional sentence would not address\nthe sentencing principles set out in s. 718.2 of the Criminal Code.In\nthe result, the trial judge concluded that the appropriate sentence was two\nyears in custody on each count to be served concurrently.The trial judge also\ngranted a term of probation for three years which included a condition that the\nappellant not possess or operate any computer or electronic device that is\ncapable of storing information that can be displayed visually or that can\ntransmit electronic information via the Internet.THE APPEAL[25]The appellant seeks to set aside his convictions and requests a new\ntrial.In the alternative, the appellant seeks leave to appeal sentence and a\nreduction in sentence on the basis that his sentence is excessive.THE\nCONVICTION APPEAL[26]The appellant raises a number of issues in the appeal to set aside his\nguilty plea.The issues can be reduced to two main grounds:(i) his pleas of guilty\nwere involuntary; and(ii) he was the victim\nof ineffective representation by counsel.In support of the above grounds of\nappeal he has filed in excess of 800 pages of fresh evidence, and 90 pages of\nfacta.The Validity of the Appellant’s Plea[27]Section 606 of the Criminal Code provides:606. (1) An accused who\nis called on to plead may plead guilty or not guilty, or the special pleas\nauthorized by this Part and no others.(1.1) A court may\naccept a plea of guilty only if it is satisfied that the accused(a)is making the plea\nvoluntarily; and(b)understands(i) that the plea is an admission of the\nessential elements of the offence,(ii) the nature and consequences of the plea,\nand(iii) that the court is not bound by any\nagreement made between the accused and the prosecutor.(1.2) The failure of\nthe court to fully inquire whether the conditions set out in subsection (1.1)\nare met does not affect the validity of the plea.[28]As stated above, no plea inquiry was made by the trial judge.Counsel\nfor the appellant properly acknowledges that the failure to make a plea inquiry\ndoes not necessarily vitiate the plea. However, he submits that, in this case,\nthe absence of a plea inquiry raises an issue as to its validity.Counsel\nsubmits that the record before the sentencing judge indicates that, after the\nplea was entered, there was sufficient reason to doubt its validity and to\ncause the judge to strike the plea and proceed to trial.In support of this\nposition, counsel cites this court’s reasons for judgment in R. v. S.K. (1996), 1995 CanLII 8926 (ON CA), 99 C.C.C.\n(3d) 376 (Ont. C.A.) at page. 382:Rule 10, Commentary 12\nof the Law Society of Upper Canada’s Rules of Professional Conduct deals\nwith plea bargaining and requires that the lawyer be assured, among other\nthings, that the client is prepared to admit the necessary factual and mental\nelements of the guilty plea.Thus, it was proper for the trial judge to assume\nat the time of the plea that the appellant admitted the facts which had been\nput in evidence concerning the four counts but, at the second stage of the\nhearing when it became clear that the appellant denied the facts in evidence,\nthe trial judge should have at least considered exercising his discretion to\nreject the guilty pleas and proceed with the trial [Emphasis added].[29]Counsel submits that comments attributed to the appellant in the\npresentence report, comments made by his counsel during the sentencing hearing,\nand comments made by the appellant to the trial judge all illustrate that the\nappellant denied culpability and significantly challenged the voluntary nature\nof his plea.[30]I do not propose to review in detail all of the comments attributed to\nthe appellant upon which his counsel relies in support of this ground of\nappeal.Reference to a few will provide sufficient examples to understand\ncounsel’s submission.[31]The appellant’s counsel relies on the appellant’s comments to the author\nof the presentence report to the effect that he did not consider the collage to\nbe child pornography and that he did not consider himself to be a child\npornographer.[32]Further, counsel for the appellant relies upon comments made by trial\ncounsel in respect of the alleged posting of the collage on Kazaa and Sexter.Defence counsel quoted the appellant as saying: “I saved the file in ‘My\nDocuments’ folder, my intention was not to make it available for anyone to\naccess, this just happened to be the default folder where any of my files\n[were] saved to”.However, counsel for the appellant correctly points out that\nin an exchange with the trial judge, counsel told the court that “there’s no\ndenial of the fact that it was put on Kazaa and Sexter”.[33]Counsel for the appellant also submits that the appellant’s apology\nletter to Ms. J. raised the defence of artistic and medical merit insofar as\nthe appellant referred to his creating the collage as an attempt to “stop the\npain”.He further argued that references made by Crown counsel and the trial\njudge to the collage as a take off of a MasterCard commercial were indirect\nreferences to the defence of artistic merit.[34]The above references and others form the basis for counsel’s submission\nthat the trial judge should have considered exercising his discretion to reject\nthe guilty plea and proceed to trial.[35]In my view, there is nothing to be taken from a fair reading of the\nrecord that would lead the trial judge to conclude that the appellant was\nclearly denying the facts in evidence which supported his guilt.Indeed, all\nof the constituent elements of the offences were admitted by the appellant at\nthe time of the plea.The fact that he did not consider the collage to be\nchild pornography and that he did not consider himself to be a child pornographer\ndoes not detract from his admission of guilt.He recognized that he had\ncommitted a breach of the Criminal Code but simply disagreed with the\ncharacterization of the offences as offences of child pornography.This is\nillustrated in a statement that he made to the author of the presentence\nreport. The author reported that the appellant “does not believe that he…\nshould be convicted of child pornography even though that is “how the\ngovernments see it’”.[36]The alleged oblique references to artistic and medical merit by Crown\ncounsel and the trial judge are of no help to the appellant.This collage\ncannot be mistaken for a work of art.No reasonable assessment of the\nappellant’s comment that the collage was made “to stop the pain” could have led\nthe trial judge to question the validity of the guilty plea.[37]The appellant also submits that he was pressured into pleading guilty by\nhis counsel.[38]In his affidavit, filed in support of this ground of appeal, the\nappellant states:On January 13th,\n2004, when I arrived at court, I noticed that the court docket listed the\ncreation and distribution of child pornography charges, but not the possession\nof child pornography or the mischief charge.I waited for Mr. Burgess in\ncourt.He entered the courtroom, acknowledged me, and approached the Crown\nattorney.He then walked up to me and asked, “Are you ready to plead guilty?”I told him that I was not going to plead guilty.He responded, “You have to,\nyou said you did it”, and he walked up to the counsel table.That was the last\ntime we spoke that day.He did not give me the option of going to trial.He\ndid not tell me what the penalty might be if I pleaded guilty.He did not tell\nme that I could be going to jail.I had no idea what my options were, what the\nrepercussions would be if I pleaded guilty, or why I had to plead guilty.[39]Shannon Young, the girlfriend of the appellant, was sitting in court\nbeside the appellant on January 13th, 2004.She filed an affidavit\nthat gave a similar version of the conversation between the appellant and his\ncounsel on that occasion.[40]I do not find this evidence convincing.If the appellant did not wish\nto plead guilty and he really believed that he had no option but to do so by\nreason of pressure from his lawyer, it is surprising that he made no reference\nto this pressure until after he was sentenced.[41]The appellant did not complain to his lawyer in subsequent conversations\nbetween the time of his plea on January 13th, 2004 and his\nsentencing on March 9th, 2004.He made no complaint or reference to\nthis issue to the author of the presentence report.His girlfriend, Ms. Young,\nmade no complaint to the appellant’s lawyer in a telephone call to the lawyer\nmade after January 13th, 2004.[42]I am not persuaded by this complaint, contained in the affidavit sworn\nafter the appellant was sentenced to a penitentiary term.In my view the\nevidence, considered as a whole, does not support the conclusion that the\nappellant was forced to plead guilty by his trial counsel.Ineffective Representation of Counsel[43]The appellant alleges that his trial counsel provided ineffective\nrepresentation.He makes several allegations.Central to his complaint of\nincompetence is the allegation that his counsel failed to advise him that if he\npleaded guilty to the offences charged, he was at risk of going to jail.[44]The appellant in his affidavit, filed on this appeal, stated that\nbetween the day he retained his trial lawyer in March or April 2003 and the day\nthat he pleaded guilty on January 13th, 2004 he never spoke to his\nlawyer for more than five minutes at a time on four or five occasions at\ncourt.He said that he tried to arrange for a lengthier interview in the\nlawyer’s office but was unable to do so.The appellant also said that his\nlawyer never returned his phone calls.[45]According to the appellant his lawyer never told him that he could\nreceive a custodial sentence until the day of sentencing, which was long after\nhe had entered his guilty plea.[46]Mr. Burgess denied that he never told the appellant that he could\nreceive a custodial sentence.He also denied that his meetings with the\nappellant were no more than five minutes.Unfortunately, there is very little\ndocumentation in the lawyer’s file concerning his discussions with his client.On this issue there is very little, if anything, that is helpful.What emerges\nfrom the record is that Mr. Burgess is an extremely busy criminal lawyer who\ntestified in cross-examination that he handles as many as eight to ten cases a\nday in the Peterborough court.He did not challenge the appellant’s assertion\nthat all of their meetings were at the courthouse at times when the charges\nagainst the appellant were before the court to be spoken to.[47]On the other hand, it is clear from the record that trial counsel believed,\nand rightly so, that there was no viable defence to the charges of making and\ndistributing child pornography.Counsel’s focus was on his attempt to\nnegotiate a plea bargain, which would keep the appellant out of jail.His\ndiscussions with the Crown attorney were directed towards either a conditional\ndischarge or a conditional sentence.A conditional discharge was out of the\nquestion.He could not get the Crown to commit to any position on sentence\nuntil the Crown saw the presentence report.In the result, if there was to be\na plea it would take place before they knew the Crown’s position on sentence.[48]What appears to have happened is that both lawyer and client, in their\ndiscussions, were placing most of their attention on a conditional sentence with\nthe result that jail was not uppermost in either person’s mind. The lawyer’s\ncommunication with his client could have been much better.Brief meetings at\nthe court house are not the most satisfactory way to communicate, particularly\nwhen counsel is handling as many as eight or ten cases a day.Nevertheless, I\nam not persuaded that Mr. Burgess did not tell the appellant that there was a\nrisk of his going to jail.The onus is on the appellant in this respect.Additional Allegations of Ineffective Representation\nof Counsel[49]The appellant also submits that he was provided with ineffective\nrepresentation of counsel in respect of the following:(i) Counsel failed to\nresearch the law in respect of child pornography and the defence of artistic\nmerit;(ii) Counsel\nmisunderstood the artistic merit defence and failed to give the appellant\nproper advice in regard to it;(iii) Counsel failed to\ninvestigate whether the appellant agreed with the essential elements of the\noffence;(iv) Counsel failed to\ndo more then review the relevant sections of the Criminal Code with the\nappellant to convey what his options were;(v) Counsel failed to\nclarify the Crown’s position on sentencing before his client pleaded guilty:(vi) Counsel failed to\nrecommend that the appellant seek independent legal advice when it became\napparent that the appellant was failing to take responsibility for creating\nchild pornography; and(vii) Counsel failed to\nmove to strike the appellant’s guilty plea when it became apparent that the\nappellant was denying responsibility in his responses to the presentence report\nand the victim impact statement.[50]In a recent judgment of this court Doherty J.A. reviewed the legal\nprinciples relevant to establishing a claim of ineffective representation of\ncounsel.At para. 18 of R.v. Archer (2005), 2005 CanLII 36444 (ON CA), 202 C.C.C. (3d) 60 ,\nhe held:It is\nhelpful to begin with a summary of the applicable legal principles, none of\nwhich are in dispute.An accused who is represented at trial is entitled to\neffective representation by counsel.Ineffective representation may result in\na miscarriage of justice necessitating the quashing of the conviction on\nappeal.Evidence relating to the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel\nwill be received on appeal pursuant to s. 683(1) so that the appellate court\nmay determine whether the representation was ineffective and ultimately whether\nit resulted in a miscarriage of justice:R. v. Joanisse (1995), 1995 CanLII 3507 (ON CA), 102\nC.C.C. (3d) 35 at 43-44, 56-58 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused,\n[1996] S.C.C.A. No. 347;R. v. B.(L.C.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 937 (ON CA), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 353\n(Ont. C.A.).Doherty J.A. further stated\nat paras. 119-120 that three things must be shown by an appellant seeking to\nquash a conviction on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel:First,\nwhere the claim is based on contested facts, the appellant must establish the\nmaterial facts on the balance of probabilities.Second, the appellant must\ndemonstrate that counsel’s acts or omissions amounted to incompetence.Incompetence is measured against a reasonableness standard.That assessment is\nmade having regard to the circumstances as they existed when the impugned acts\nor omissions occurred.Hindsight plays no role in the assessment.Allegations\nof incompetent representation must be closely scrutinized.Many decisions made\nby counsel at trial will come to be seen as erroneous in the cold light of a\nconviction.The reasonableness analysis must proceed upon a “strong\npresumption that counsel’s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional\nassistance”:R. v. G.D.B. (2000), 2000 SCC 22 (CanLII), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 298 (S.C.C.).As this court said in R. v. White (1997), 1997 CanLII 2426 (ON CA), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at 247:An appellate court’s review of\ntrial counsel’s performance should be deferential. … deference is called for\nbecause of the broad spectrum of professional judgment that might be considered\nreasonable.In most cases, even among the most skilled counsel, no two lawyers\nwill defend an accused in the same way.Different defence counsel will use\ndifferent trial strategies and tactics, different approaches to the examination\nand cross-examination of witnesses, different styles in opening and closing\nargument, all of them reasonable.The art of advocacy yields few, if any,\nabsolute rules.It is a highly individualized art.What proves effective for\none counsel may be ineffective for another.Most cases, therefore, offer\ndefence counsel a wide scope for the exercise of reasonable skill and\njudgment.Appellate judges, many of them advocates in their own practices,\nshould not be too quick to conclude that a trial lawyer’s performance was\ndeficient because they would have conducted the defence differently.Third,\nthe appellant must demonstrate that counsel’s ineffective representation caused\na miscarriage of justice.A miscarriage of justice occurs if the appellate\ncourt is satisfied that counsel’s ineffective representation undermined the\nappearance of the fairness of the trial, or the reliability of the verdict.A\nverdict is rendered unreliable where the appellant demonstrates that had\ncounsel performed in a competent fashion, there is a reasonable possibility\nthat the verdict could have been different.[51]At para. 121 of Archer, Doherty J.A. referred to the observation\nof Major J. inR. v.. G.D.B. at 298 that when an allegation\nof lawyer incompetence is made on appeal the court should first consider\nwhether the alleged incompetence resulted in a miscarriage of justice.If the\ncourt is satisfied that there has been no miscarriage of justice, then it is\nunnecessary to assess the conduct of counsel.As Doherty J.A. aptly put it:“This approach recognizes that it is the appellate court’s function to\ndetermine whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred and not to grade\ncounsel’s performance.”[52]I am satisfied that, even if a case could be made out in respect of\nthese additional allegations of incompetence, there was not a miscarriage of\njustice in this case.The case against the appellant was overwhelming.The\nappellant admitted that Ms. J. was under eighteen years of age and that the\nphotos depicted explicit sexual activity.He admitted making the collage and\nadmitted e-mailing it to his friend.[53]In my view there was no air of reality to any possible defence of\nartistic merit as submitted by counsel for the appellant in this appeal.Counsel suggested that the collage was a take off of a MasterCard commercial\nand argued that this gave the collage its artistic merit.I disagree.[54]Counsel for the appellant relied upon the reasons for judgment of\nMcLachlin C.J.C. in R. v. Sharpe (2001), 2001 SCC 2 (CanLII), 150 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.),\nin which she discussed the defence of artistic merit. At para. 63 she stated:I\nconclude that “artistic merit” should be interpreted as including any\nexpression that may reasonably be viewed as art.Any objectively established\nartistic value, however small, suffices to support the defence. Simply put,\nartists, so long as they are producing art, should not fear prosecution under\ns. 163.1(4).[55]In my view there is nothing in the collage in this case “that may\nreasonably be viewed as art”.I do not fault trial counsel for failing to\nconsider this defence.[56]I need not discuss the other allegations of incompetence raised by the\nappellant.As I have already stated, I am satisfied that there was no\nmiscarriage of justice in this case.Therefore, in accordance with the\nobservation of Major J. in R. v. G.B.D., I find it\nunnecessary to consider further the remaining allegations of incompetence.The Sentence Appeal[57]The appellant was twenty-three years old at the time of the offence.His father left the family when he was two years old.He has had minimal\ncontact with his father since that time.His mother was married three times\nafter the appellant’s father left.Her last marital partner was described by\nthe appellant as a “wife-beating alcoholic”.The appellant left home and moved\ninto an apartment.He continued at school on student welfare.He attended\nthirteen different schools.In 2002, the appellant attended Sir Sandford Fleming\nCollege for a two-year computer engineering science program.At the time of\nhis sentencing in March 2004 he was self-employed, building custom computers\nand engaging in computer consulting.[58]At the time of sentencing the appellant had entered into a stable\nrelationship with Shannon Young and was living at the home of her parents, to\nwhom he paid room and board of $330.00 per month.[59]The appellant has one previous conviction for break and enter for which\nhe received a suspended sentence and eighteen months probation.[60]It is clear from the submissions made by Crown counsel and the\nobservations made by the trial judge that the circumstances of this case are\nvastly different from the typical child pornography case.[61]The appellant was granted bail pending appeal by Feldman J.A.In her\nendorsement at para. 12 Feldman J.A. observed:I note\nthat this is not the more typical situation where an offender is using the\nInternet as a business or a hobby to view or distribute child pornography.This was a one time, immature and very unfortunate response to a personal life\nevent.[62]I do not wish to minimize the seriousness of the offences for which the\nappellant was convicted, nor to discount the horrific impact that the offences\nhave had on Ms. J.That said, I am of the view that a penitentiary term of two\nyears is harsh and excessive.It is an unfit sentence for a young man with a\nminor criminal record who committed the offences in the circumstances described\nby Feldman J.A.[63]While the offences call for a custodial sentence, they do not call for a\npenitentiary term.In my view the appellant’s sentence should be reduced to\ntime served which was eight months in custody prior to his being granted\nparole.[64]I would maintain the probation order.Feldman J.A., on the\nrecommendation of the appellant’s parole officer, altered the restriction on\nthe appellant’s use of computers to permit use for employment purposes, not\nincluding self-employment.I would remove the restriction altogether as I see\nminimal chance of a repetition of offences of this kind.DISPOSITION[65]I would dismiss the appeal against conviction.I would grant leave to\nappeal sentence and reduce the two-year term to time already served.I would\nnot interfere with the probation order except to remove the computer and\nelectronic device restriction.RELEASED:March 13, 2006“STG”“R.P.

He finally stopped abusing the older daughter when he felt what\nhe described as “peach fuzz” on her genitals and that shock helped him stop.[11]The older daughter’s earliest memories as a\nchild were of her father sexually abusing her. With regard to frequency, as the\ncrown indicated it is hard to say, but I would suggest a conservative estimate\nwould be at least fifty times over ten years.[12]The older daughter felt she could not say no to\nher father, she was supposed to obey him […].[13]With regard to the younger daughter, she was\ntouched when she was three to five years old, about the time the accused stopped\nabusing the older daughter.She recalls sitting on father’s lap and him\ntouching her genital area.This only occurred a few times as he stopped\nhimself and told his wife about touching the older daughter, but not the\nyounger daughter.[14]His wife forgave him and he did not touch any of\nhis children or anyone else, as far as we know, for over 17 years.[15]The charges arose when the older daughter went\nfor counselling and she reported the abuse to her counselor who contacted authorities.[16]The accused felt that his use of pornography\ncontributed to the offences.[17]The accused is 55 years old, he is a first\noffender, he pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual interference contrary to\ns. 151 of the Criminal Code, against his two daughters between 1990 and\n1999.[18]He has been on an undertaking since the charges\nwere laid and the conditions have been changed over time.[19]He has been the primary income earner in his\nfamily by means of farming.He was raised in a home with both parents and one\nsister.He has a strong sense of family.[…]He has a grade twelve\neducation.[20]His work history includes fishing, farming […] and\nhe is very involved in his church.[21]He has positive supports in the community from\nhis pastor and other community members. His wife and mother both knew about the\nabuse of the girls and both continue to support him.[22]He had a heart attack in 2016 and is taking\nmedication.The testing shows that he has few psychological problems and he\nhas good self control.[23]The Sexual Behaviour Pre-sentence report shows a\nlow risk for sexual recidivism.[24]He is viewed positively by family and church\nmembers.[25]The effect on the older daughter has been\nsignificant – she struggles to trust, has difficulty processing stress and has\npanic attacks.She spent much of her childhood, as she described, screaming\ninside.She has nightmares, low self esteem, struggles with trust on a\nphysical and emotional level with her husband.She is a new mother and looks\nat her child and worries for her daughter and nieces.Her father, she says,\ntook her innocence.She looks at photos and sees pain and confusion in her own\neyes as a child and she describes being destroyed slowly from the inside.She\nalso describes as a child feeling confused and scared and she felt trapped as a\nchild in a situation too big for her, wanting, her father, or daddy as she said,\nto just be a daddy. She describes as being broken inside.[26]The younger daughter testified today.She did\nnot provide a victim impact statement and I would like the crown to find out\nwhy Victim Services did not contact her.She has some vague memories of her\nfather sexually abusing her, but what she describes as positives about her father\noutweigh any wrong that was done to her.Legal\nParametersPrinciples:[27]The legal parameters under the Criminal Code\nprovide for a number of principles for me to consider. The sentence must be\nproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of\nthe offender.Aggravating and mitigating circumstances have to be considered,\nand one of the aggravating circumstances outlined in s. 718.2 of the Criminal\nCode is abuse of a child and abuse when you are in a position of trust or\nauthority, and both of those are present here.[28]Also, the principle of parity is important.The\nsentence has be similar to sentences for similar offences on similar offenders.[29]When consecutive sentences are imposed, the\ncombined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh.At the time when these\noffences were committed s.718.2(d) of the Criminal Code read:(d) an\noffender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may\nbe appropriate in the circumstances; and(e) all\navailable sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the\ncircumstances and consistent with the harm done to victims or to the community\nshould be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the\ncircumstances of Aboriginal offenders;[30]The provision s. 718.3(7)\nof the Criminal Code for consecutive sentences was not in force when the\ncrimes were committed.[31]At the time of the commission of the offence\nthere was not a mandatory minimum sentence and the maximum penalty was ten\nyears.That has been amended since the time of the commission of the offence, and\nthere is now a minimum sentence of twelve months imprisonment and a maximum of\nfourteen years imprisonment.[32]The principles are a codification of the common-law\nprinciples at the time of the offences.It said that the fundamental purpose of\nsentencing is to contribute, along with prevention initiatives, to respect for\nthe law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing\njust sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)To denounce unlawful\nconduct;(b)To deter the offender\nand other persons from committing offences;(c)To separate offenders\nfrom society, where necessary;(d)To assist in\nrehabilitating offenders.Positions of\nCrown and Defence:[33]The crown here is seeking a period of\nincarceration of two to two and one half years for count one, in relation to the\nolder daughter, and six months to one year for count three, in relation to the\nyounger daughter.[34]The defence is seeking a sentence of six to\neighteen months of incarceration to be served in the community, otherwise\ncalled a conditional sentence.Case Law:[35]Both counsel have indicated that the caselaw is\nall over the map.The outline of cases provided by the defence counsel range\nfrom conditional sentences to double digit periods of incarceration.Our Court\nof Appeal in R. v. E.M.W.\n(No. 2), 2011 NSCA 87 (CanLII), an appeal where a conditional\nsentence was requested but not given, after an extensive review of sentences said,\nin para. 37,about a sentence of two years in the submission by defence\ncounsel being demonstrably unfit and outside the range, while eighteen months\nwas inside the range and they disagree that the range is so finally\ncircumscribed.They say from the authorities that two years incarceration is\navailable in appropriate circumstances for mid-range sexual offences without\nintercourse.In that case, they upheld the sentence of two years for sexual\nassault by a man of his daughter for two years with repeated digital penetration.[36]There is other caselaw that both counsel have\nreferred to.As I said, it is really not helpful.There are many cases and\nmany sentences as a result of those cases.Mitigating Circumstances:[37]I have to look at the mitigating and aggravating\ncircumstances, and certainly on the mitigating side the accused plead guilty\nand the victims did not need to testify.The offences occurred seventeen years\nago.The accused stopped himself.He confessed to his wife at the time\nwith regard to the offence against the older daughter.He confessed when he\nwas arrested.He took full responsibility and as Mr. Ferrier said, some of the\nthings known would not be known except for the full responsibility he took.In\nhis confession to the police he did not minimize his involvement.He has no\nrecord, although I have to bear in mind our Court of Appeal in R. v. Weaver,\n[1993] N.S.J. No. 91, said that a clean criminal record “does not relieve the requirement of a\nlengthy prison term for sexual offence against children”.Aggravating Circumstances:[38]There is a breach of trust.One of the people a\nchild should trust the most, their parent, has abused their trust.[39]The age of the children.Starting with the\nabuse for one child, the older daughter, at two and a half and for the younger\ndaughter between three and five.[40]This is a crime of violence by its nature. The\nabuse occurred over a lengthy period of time, on numerous occurrences.[41]The many years, I said over ten years for the\nolder daughter.I have to look at the big impact on the older daughter’s\nlife.The fact that the accused went on to abuse a second child.When I look\nback again, when I look at the threat that if the older daughter said anything\nthat the family would break up.That is a responsibility that should not have\nbeen put on a child.I have to look at the manipulation that the accused used\nwith his manipulation to get the older daughter to fondle his penis.He\nindicated “usually only Mommies get to do this, if you do it right it will grow”.I have to look at the attempted digital penetration of a two-and-a-half-year-old.[42]The concerns I have in the Sexual Behaviour Pre-Sentence\nAssessment, the accused describes himself as a good father and the younger\ndaughter did that today.I am concerned with that because good fathers do not\nsexually abuse their children, and you were not a good father to the older\ndaughter and the younger daughter when you robbed them of their ability to\ntrust and their innocence.Good fathers do not sexually abuse their children.[43]Also, I had concern in the report that there\nseems to be a blaming by both the accused and the accused’s wife for the\nreporting of the offences to authorities, instead of placing the blame where it\nbelongs, with the accused.It appears from the Sexual Behavior Pre-Sentence\nAssessment that it was reported when the older daughter went for counselling\nand the counsellor reported the abuse.[44]There seemed to be some blame placed on your\nsister and what you perceive as her jealousy of you, in encouraging the older daughter\nto report the abuse to authorities.[45]I understand from listening to the accused’s\nwife this morning, and from reading the Pre-sentence Report and the Sexual\nBehaviour Pre-Sentence Assessment, that you and your family would have\npreferred that there had been no report to authorities and you would have\ncontinued to suffer no sanctions for your offences other than what you suffered\nin your family. That is a very self-centered view, as certainly the older\ndaughter went to get assistance that she needed, and probably needed much\nbefore she went.It is not unusual for victims to not report their\nabuse until they are older, maybe not living in the home where the perpetrator\nis, and having gained the strength to report the abuse.[46]The other concern, as outlined, is asking the\nolder daughter to say “no” to you and putting the responsibility on the child\nto control the situation, when that was your responsibility.Principles of Sentencing:[47]The other principle of sentencing is that it has\nto be tailored to the individual.I must look at protection of the public,\ndeterrence and denunciation, and rehabilitation.[48]Because the offences occurred before the\namendments were made for a minimum sentence and the maximum of fourteen years, a\nconditionalsentence is available as a sentence.The R. v.Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), decision\nfrom the Supreme Court of Canada, outlined what I am to consider when I am\nconsidering a conditional sentence.I have to first look at whether the\nappropriate range of sentence, which has to be less than two years, is within\nthe range of appropriate sentences.Then, if less than two years was within\nthe range for the sentence, I have to look at whether the offender is a danger\nto the safety of the community and whether a conditional sentence is consistent\nwith the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing.[49]As I indicated, and counsel indicated, certainly\nthere are sentences all over the place -- probation, conditional sentences and\nsentence ranges from six months to double digit terms of imprisonment.[50]In the R. v. E.M.W., supra, case from our Court of Appeal, a conditional\nsentence was requested of the trial judge and the trial judge gave two years,\nand that was upheld on appeal.In that case, the Court of Appeal reviewed many\ncases from three years suspended sentence to six years in prison.They say\nthat incarceration in the cases they reviewed were sometimes more, and\nsometimes less, than two years depending on the severity of the circumstances\nfor sexual offences on children without intercourse.[51]In R v. S.C.C., 2004 NSPC 41 (CanLII), 2004 NSPC 41,\n(Judge Tufts) he reviewed a number of cases and considerations for conditional sentences\nand determined that less than two years was in the range of appropriate\nsentences for the offence.[52]So, I accept from the Court of Appeal and from\nJudge Tufts in the review of their sentences, and the review that I have done\nwith the cases that were provided by counsel, that less than two years is\nwithin the appropriate range of sentences for the offence.[53]I then look at whether serving the sentence in\nthe community would endanger the safety of the community, and I am satisfied\nhere that leaving the accused in the community would not endanger the safety of\nthe community.[54]However, I also have to consider whether a conditional\nsentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of\nsentencing.[55]Here, for sexual abuse of children, particularly\nby a parent, deterrence, general deterrence, and denunciation are paramount\nconsiderations in the R. v. G.L., 2003 117 O.A.C. 117, the Ontario Court\nof Appeal said at para. 7:This court has repeatedly indicated that a conditional\nsentence should rarely be imposed in cases involving the sexual touching of\nchildren by adults, particularly where, as here, the sexual violation is of a\nvulnerable victim by a person in a position of trust. In addition,\ncircumstances that involve multiple sexual acts over an extended period of time\nand escalating in intrusiveness generally warrant a severe sentence.[56]Justice Abella, when she was on the Ontario\nCourt of Appeal, in 1992 in R. v. G.M., (1992) 1992 CanLII 7399 (ON CA), 58 O.A.C. 390, said at para.\n9:The public can logically be expected to infer from the\nnature of the sentence the extent to which a court views as serious, certain\nconduct by a given individual… Sentences which appear on their face to be\nexceptionally lenient in the circumstances can be presumed to generate neither\ndeterrence nor dununciation.[57]Our Court of Appeal inR. v. H. (E.R.),\n(1987), 81 N.S.R. (2d) 156 (N.S. C.A.), the court stated at p. 157:…Sexual\nabuse of near helpless children by adults, upon whom they should be able to\nrely for protection, should incur sentences which hopefully deter the\nperpetrator and others so inclined and demonstrate society’s revulsion of such\nconduct.Children must be protected; deterrence must be both specific and\ngeneral, with emphasis on the general aspect of deterrence.[58]In R. v. C. (E.M.) (1999), 1999 CanLII 18569 (NS SC), 178 N.S.R.\n(2d) 184, the court said:Child victims are the most helpless in our society. As\nadults we teach them from birth to obey adults and place trust in them.\nChildren are taught to go to an adult when they need help or protection. This\nis especially so of relatives. Who does a child go to for protection when the\nadults in their family betray that trust. Surely these victims must feel alone\nin the world. In the circumstances of this case the only thing the children\ncould expect from E C was a betrayal of that trust as he preyed upon them.[59]In S.C.C., supra, that is Judge\nTufts again, he finds that:conditional sentences are\nrare in sexual assault against young children by a person in authority; they\nusually attract a severe sentence; ordinarily a federal sentence is required;\nand a conditional sentence is the exception, rather than the rule.[60]As the crown cited in the R. v. E.M.W,\nsupra, the court quoted the trial judge and said at para. 42:A man who\nsexually violates his own ten-year-old daughter in these circumstances\ncannot be allowed to serve his sentence by going to work, going out to the\ngrocery store for a few hours on Saturday, watching television from his\nfavourite chair and enjoying the fellowship of friends and family in his home.A\nconditional sentence does not, in these circumstances, provide for punishment\nthat is measured and thoughtful.It would, to put it simply, be the kind\nof sentence that does not speak of justice and compassion but of weakness and\nnaivete.When abuse\nof children is involved, punishment matters.When the abuser is a parent,\npunishment matters a lot.While the restrictions of a conditional\nsentence can indeed be punishment, there are times when they are no replacement\nfor the sound of a shutting jail cell.[61]In this case, the accused, clearly has started\non the path and is well on his way on the path to rehabilitation, but that is only\nspecific deterrence and I have to consider general deterrence as well.[62]Leaving the accused in the community to run […]\nor leaving him in the community not to run […] would not send the message of\nsociety’s revulsion of such conduct.As I indicated, his conduct was a breach\nof trust, an exploitation of children, and a conditional sentence is not\nconsistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing in s. 718\nto s. 718.2 of the Criminal Code, and so I will not be granting a\nconditional sentence to the accused.Ancillary Orders:[63]The crown has asked for ancillary orders and we were\njust discussing s.109 of the Criminal Code, which requires a prohibition\nfrom possessing any prohibited firearm, restricted\nfirearm, prohibited weapon, prohibited device or prohibited ammunition for life\nand any firearm,other than a prohibited firearm or restricted firearm, and\nany cross-bow, restricted weapon, ammunition and explosive substance for ten\nyears.The accused will provide a sample for DNA, as it is a primary\ndesignated offence.With regard to no contact while in custody, the older\ndaughter is not here to indicate her wishes and the crowndid not think it to\nbe a problem.With regard to the Sexual Offender Information Registry Act, the\naccused is placed on that for life.I must consider s. 161, but in light of the\nPre-Sentence reports and in particular the report from Dr. Connors, I do not\nfind it necessary to impose the s. 161.SENTENCE:[64]With regard to the sentence, as I have\nindicated, there are many different sentences.Mr. Ferrier mentioned this\nmorning R. v. I. (Part 2), 1996 NSSC 3, and indicated that that was,\nwhile some of the facts are similar, in that case the offender did not accept\nresponsibility, and certainly that is not the case here for the accused.In\nthat case, it was three years of imprisonment.[65]In the R. v. D.B.S., 2004 NSSC 80 (CanLII), case\nthere was sexual abuse over eight years and there was a five year term.As I\nalready indicated in S.C.C., supra,Judge Tufts reviewed the case law\nand he said at para. 16:There are\nfew crimes that are more serious and have a more devastating effect on its\nvictims than sexual assault against young children by their parents or\nguardians.Both in terms of gravity and moral blameworthiness such crimes\nrepresent serious criminal conduct which requires proportionate criminal\nsanctions.Other factors which impact on this aspect are the following\naggravating features…And he reviews the\nones in that case.In that case, a sentence of two years.[66]In R. v. G.K.N., 2014 NSSC 150 (CanLII), 2014 NSSC 150 (Justice\nCacchione) there were multiple acts of sexual interference from the age of\nseven or eight to thirteen and he reviews the case law and he gives a total\nsentence of eighteen months.That was, in that case, to allow for probation so\nthe person could get the treatment recommended by the report.[67]Then there was R. v. D. (K.), 2004 NSPC 549, referred to by the defence that was occasional, sporadic and\nseparated in time, in a casual nature and that was two years less a day to be\nserved in the community.And R. v. Arsenault, 2004 NSSC 242 (CanLII), which was\na joint recommendation for twelve months to be served in the community.[68]As I indicated, when I am looking at the concerns\nthat I have outlined with regard to the threat of breaking up the family, that\nwould have left the older daughter in the position where she either had to continue to endure the sexual\nabuse or break up her family, which was not an enviable position to put a child\nin.[69]There was the manipulation.The blame for the\nreporting to authorities.The period, ten years. The young age when the abuse\nstarted.This was not spur of the moment, not just an impulse, not that many\ntimes, it was not just impulsive.[70]The offences against the\nolder daughter were the most serious, the most frequent,\nthe longer, the nature of the sexual activity was more severe and the impact on\nthe older daughter was more\nsevere.[71]The rehabilitation started by the accused stopping the abuse and telling his\nwife.Dr. Connors indicates he does not need group sessions, but he could use\nindividual counselling.[72]The relationship that was damaged, the damage to\nthe children, the damage of trust, the damage to their intimacy and their\ninnocence, was exploited for the\naccused’s sexual gratification.[73]There needs to be a message sent to others in the\ncommunity that we will not accept this type of behaviour.[74]Both the crown and defence discussed the level of\nseriousness of the abuse and there are references in the case law to levels of\nsexual abuse.I am hopeful that we are past the days when the degree of\npenetration of the victims’ bodies determines the seriousness of the sexual\nassault or the abuse.The level of the violation of the victim’s sexual\nintegrity is not determined by the degree of penetration.Here, it was\nfrequent and over a long period starting at a very young age, and included various\nforms of sexual abuse that were certainly a major violation of the older daughter’s\nsexual dignity.[75]There is no sentence that I can give that would\ngive the older daughter and the younger daughter back\nwhat was taken from them.They are in no way to blame.Theyare in no way\nresponsible.The blame lays solely with the accused.Theywere innocent children. The older daughter was brave to go forward and\nget counselling, something she should probably have done, or had, manyyears\nago.We normally do not leave it to children to decide if theyneed\ncounselling.I know that the sentence imposed will not heal theirwounds, and\nI hope that the older daughter and\nthe younger daughter will be able to continue on their path to healingwith support of the\npeople in their lives who love and support them.[76]I did consider a longer period, more in keeping\nwith what the crown was asking for.I did, however, have to consider what defence\ncounsel has indicated were the unique facts in this case with regard to the\nlevel of honesty, confession, co-operation, both to the police and to the accused’s spouse, and no offences for\nseventeen years.[77]For count one, which is the sexual interference\ncontrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code regarding the older daughter, I am sentencing you to a\nperiod of incarceration for eighteen months.[78]The sentence for the\nyounger daughter which was less\nfrequent over a much shorter duration,I find that the appropriate sentence is\nsix months imprisonment to run consecutively.[79]I did consider two years less a day with probation,\nbut it did not appear to be necessary to place him on probation.Hopefully,\nwhen you are released you will seek counselling on your own.Justice Mona Lynch"}

V. HARAPIAK, P.J.RESTRICTION ON\nPUBLICATION:No one may publish any information that may identify\na person as having been dealt with under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.See\nthe Youth Criminal Justice Act, s.110(1).[1]Early on the morning of\nSaturday, May 13th, 2006, a white van rolled through a stop sign on\nEbb \u0026 Flow First Nation, setting into motion a chain of events which would\nend in the deaths of Diane Govereau and Alan Flett.[2]The RCMP stopped the van and\nnoticed a can of beer being thrown into the ditch.They noted that both Diane\nGovereau and Alan Flett, being passengers in the van, were intoxicated.They\nremoved the driver, Robin Roulette, because they believed she was impaired.The van was shut off at this point, but the keys remained in the ignition.[3]The 2 officers went back to the\npolice car with Robin Roulette.A 3rd passenger in the van, 16 year\nold F.S.P., had also been drinking.She says the other 2 passengers, Govereau\nand Flett, began to urge her to drive them home.So, with the RCMP parked just\nbehind her, she got into the driver’s seat, and took off.[4]F.S.P. had no license, had been\ndrinking, and appears to have been driving too quickly.She says both Govereau\nand Flett told her to slow down.She tried, on the gravel road, with tragic\nresults.The van landed upside down in the ditch and the 2 passengers, neither\nof whom appeared to have been wearing seatbelts, were thrown out of the\nvehicle.They both died as a result of this accident.[5]The accused bolted.She told\nsomeone that she thought she hurt somebody and that she was scared, so she ran\naway.Within a couple of hours her mother had returned her to the scene and\nshe was charged.[6]F.S.P. pleaded guilty to 2\ncounts of drive impaired cause death, drive dangerously, and take auto without\nowner’s consent, all related to this incident.She also pleaded guilty to an\nunrelated count, failing to comply with a youth sentence by failing to report\nto and be supervised by a youth worker.A pre-sentence report was prepared and\nconsidered, and submissions made by counsel on September 26th,\n2007.I reserved my decision until today’s date.CROWN’S POSITION[7]The Crown asked that the impaired\ndriving cause death counts be noted as being serious violent offences.Serious\nviolent offence is defined, in s. 1 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA),\nas “an offence in the commission of which a young person causes or attempts to\ncause serious bodily harm.”Considering that death resulted from the\ncommission of the offences, defence counsel took no issue with this\ndesignation, and the information was endorsed accordingly.[8]F.S.P’s use of alcohol continues\nto be a problem.The Crown pointed out that she has been charged, with\ndrinking under The Liquor Control Act (LCA) presumably, 3\ntimes since this incident.[9]The Crown provided a case to the\ncourt to assist in sentencing.In that 2004 B.C.C.A. decision R. v. S.S. [2004]\nB.C.J. No. 320, a 17 year old high school student was convicted, after\ntrial, of criminal negligence causing death, and impaired driving causing\ndeath.The offences were found to be serious violent offences under the YCJA.The accused had been drinking at a party and went out, afterwards, with his\nfriend in the passenger seat, and engaged in a street race.He ended up\ncrashing into the public library building and his friend ended up losing his\nlife.He had a history that showed lack of respect for the law and a family who\nappeared to cater to his every whim.The court of appeal upheld the trial\ndecision of a 1 year custody and supervision order, stating that “there could\nhardly be a clearer case for concluding that nothing short of imprisonment\ncould induce a young person to develop a sense of responsibility.”[10]The Crown suggests that this\ncase is persuasive and comparable and that a similar sentence is appropriate to\nhold F.S.P. accountable.DEFENCE POSITION[11]Defence counsel suggests that R.\nv. S.S. (supra) is distinguishable on its facts.Street\nracing is a deliberate high-risk activity which he points out is a significant\nproblem in British Columbia.He notes that, unlike in S.S., this accused is\nextremely remorseful, and has entered a plea of guilty.He filed 2 apology\nletters recently penned by F.S.P. directed to the victims’ families.In them\nshe expresses deep regret, calls her actions “stupid” and describes how she\ncontinues to cry herself to sleep at night thinking about what she has done.She also says she shouldn’t have listened to Diane Govereau and Alan Flett when\nthey urged her to go and she talks about how much she misses the families of\nthe deceased.[12]Counsel acknowledges that the\nconsequences to F.S.P must be meaningful and must account for the serious, irrevocable\nresults of her actions.He points out that a part of the consequence for his\nclient is that she must live with what she has done and that, whatever sentence\nis ordered, she must find a way to come to terms with the knowledge that she\nwas responsible for the deaths of 2 people.[13]Mr. Heinrichs, for F.S.P.,\nreferenced several unreported drive impaired cause death cases from the Brandon\narea from the last 7 years.In all 3 cases each accused apparently received a\nconditional sentence of 2 years less a day.He urges the court to find case\nlaw such as this more instructive than the street-racing decision from the\nBCCA.He acknowledges that, with the SVO designation, the youth sentence of\ndeferred custody, which is similar to a conditional sentence order, is\nunavailable to this court.He suggests that a very restrictive and lengthy\nprobation regime could be crafted that would be very similar to adult\nconditional sentence orders.[14]After her counsel had finished\nsubmissions I asked F.S.P. if she had anything to say.She found it very\ndifficult to speak.We eventually took a break to allow her to gather her\nthoughts.When we returned she still found it very difficult to speak, but\nobviously thought it was important that she did.She got up and said that she\nwas sorry, and she wished this had never happened.VICTIM IMPACT[15]A number of the deceaseds’\nfamily members have taken an active interest in these proceedings, and were in\ncourt for the sentencing and are in court again today.I reviewed a victim\nimpact statement that was prepared by Diane Govereau’s son.He spoke about his\nstruggles with depression, his use of alcohol to deal with his grief, and the\ndifficulty his children face with the ongoing absence of their grandparents.He still feels angry and hurt and wants F.S.P. to be held accountable for her\nactions.[16]It is a terrible thing, to lose\na family member suddenly and unexpectedly the way that the Govereau and Flett\nfamilies did.It is a loss that, regrettably, cannot be put right by anything\nthat is in my power to do today.I want to acknowledge that before I turn to\nthe determination of an appropriate consequence for F.S.P..THE\nOFFENDER[17]Sentencing, under the YCJA,\nis a very individualized process.It is about the particular offender before\nthe court and his or her particular offence and challenges.Justice Charron\nnoted, in the 2006 Supreme Court decision R. v. B.W.P. that “the means of\npromoting the long-term protection of the public describe an individualized\nprocess by focusing on underlying causes, rehabilitation, reintegration and\nmeaningful consequences for the offender.” (R. v. B.W.P. 2006 SCC 27 (CanLII), 209 C.C.C. (3d) 97)\nEssentially, I must consider F.S.P.’s circumstances and this particular offence\nto arrive at a meaningful consequence for her.[18]F.S.P. recently turned 18 years\nold.She is a part-time high school student in Brandon, who works part-time at\nthe local Superstore and lives with her mother.She helps care for the younger\nchildren in the home and does not present any behavioral problems.She is not\na strong student academically, but, according to her teacher, “attends school\nfaithfully, behaves appropriately, works hard and is not hesitant to ask for\nhelp when she needs it.”Her teacher was surprised to learn of the criminal\nproceedings and considers F.S.P. to be a “nice person”.[19]As a direct result of this\nincident, and the rift that developed between the families involved, F.S.P.’s\nfamily had to leave the community of Ebb and Flow.She moved, first to Portage\nla Prairie, and then to Brandon.During this time of transition she lost\ncontact with her probation officer, resulting in the other charge before the\ncourt, but subsequently resumed contact and complied with conditions until the\norder expired in May, 2007.[20]F.S.P. first tried alcohol when\nshe was 14 or 15 years old but has never been a regular drinker.Her AFM\nworker sees her as a high risk user because when she does drink she has little\ncontrol over her drinking.Her mother thinks she drinks “to follow the\ncrowd.”F.S.P. says she has only drunk alcohol 3 times since this incident,\nand was caught and charged by the police each time.As she doesn’t crave\nalcohol she does not believe she has a problem with drinking but acknowledges\nthat she cannot drink and behave responsibly.Her AFM worker sees her as being\nin the contemplative stage of change, and considers her to be a cooperative and\ncommunicative youth.The worker would like to meet with her weekly.F.S.P.\nhas voluntarily attended counseling at the Child and Adolescent Treatment\nCentre in Brandon to deal with her grief over these offences and other personal\nissues.She had lived with Ms Govereau and Mr. Flett in the past, and seems to\nhave been quite close to their families at one point.[21]The probation officer is of the\nopinion that F.S.P. is not criminally oriented, but has made immature and\nirresponsible choices with tragic results.He finds her to be genuinely\nremorseful and urges a non-custodial sentence.RELATED\nCASELAW[22]The Supreme Court of Canada,\nwhile considering the definition of “violent offence” under the YCJA,\nnoted that the unavailability of deferred custody orders for serious violent\noffences “suggests that Parliament intended that young persons who commit\nserious violent offences should generally receive actual – i.e. not deferred –\ncustodial sentences.”(R. v. C.D. 2005 SCC 78 (CanLII), 203 C.C.C. (3d) 449, para.\n20)This may be a general proposition, but it is not an absolute rule.This\ncourt has the discretion to impose quite lenient sentences for serious violent\noffences, depending upon the circumstances of the offence and the offender, so\nlong as they are consistent with the principles of sentencing laid out in the YCJA.Assuming custodial sentences for youth found guilty of serious violent offences\nwould render the dozens of sentencing factors and custody considerations\nsurplusage, and would run counter to the “individualized process” articulated\nby Justice Charron in R. v. B.W.P. (supra).[23]When Parliament removed the\npossibility of a deferred custody order for serious violent offences it\ndirected that, if custody is appropriate, that sentence must be served in an\ninstitution, not in the community.This direction does not supplant the\nrequirement of youth court judges to determine if custody is appropriate.[24]Youth convicted of driving\noffences which caused death have sometimes received less than a custodial\nsentence for serious violent offences.I will review several cases which deal\nwith this issue; 2 of which resulted in non-custodial sentences, and 1 which\nresulted in a custodial sentence.R. v. S.M.B. 2003 BCPC 191 (CanLII), [2003] BCJ No. 1350[25]In this case the young person\nwas the driver of a vehicle which caused an accident, killing 3 people and\ninjuring 5.Judge Grandison, of the British Columbia Provincial Court, drew a\ndistinction between the accused and the conduct.He said, at paragraph 27,\nthat “although this young person has committed a violent act, he is not\nperceived to be an otherwise violent person; neither before nor since this\nparticular tragic event.”Save for the single offence on her record, the same\ncan be said for this accused. These types of cases are difficult for the court,\npresented, through operation of the SVO definition, with a serious violent\noffence but not with a serious violent offender. Judge Grandison ordered\nprobation for 2 years, with an absolute curfew, and 240 total hours of\ncommunity service work, along with a 5 year driving prohibition.R. v. K.L.M 2004 BCPC 200 (CanLII), [2004] BCJ No. 1396[26]The impaired young person in\nK.L.M. was responsible for a head-on collision, killing the driver of the other\ncar and seriously injuring his passenger.K.L.M.’s father had attempted\nsuicide earlier that day, leaving her in a distraught state.R. v. S.S. [2004]\nB.C.J. No. 320 (supra) was distinguished due to S’s\nreluctance to take responsibility and to begin rehabilitation.K.L.M. behaved\nwell on release.The Court found that the sentence on a serious violent\noffence can be custodial where the non-custodial environment wouldn’t be\nconducive to rehabilitation, the accused has a history of non-compliance,\ncustody would be more conducive to rehabilitation, the character and attitude\nof accused are impediments to rehabilitation, custody is necessary to promote\nresponsibility and acknowledge harm, and there are aggravating circumstances which\noutweigh mitigating circumstances, leaving custody as the only meaningful\nconsequence.I will consider these factors more carefully later in these\nreasons.After considering this list, the court ordered 2 years probation,\nfirst year being on absolute curfew, 2nd year less restrictive, 240\nhours community service work and a 5 year driving prohibition.R. v. V.F. [2005] O.J. no. 5917[27]The accused, while impaired,\ndrove his unsafe vehicle at 4 times the legal speed limit up a steep hill\nfrequented by local thrill seekers in Thunder Bay, Ontario.He lost control\nand crashed into a utility pole.One of his passengers died.The accused was\nfrom a good family and had no prior criminal involvement.The offence was\ndesignated as a serious violent offence.The Court grappled with the\ndifficulties presented statutorily by an SVO designation and the consequent\nunavailability of deferred custody orders.Justice Fraser of the Ontario Court\nof Justice analyzed at length the differences between deferred custody orders\nand probation orders and their respective abilities to “carry strict punitive\nconditions of community supervision” and found that the real difference “lies\nin the consequences for a breach of a condition imposed.”He concluded that\nthe “deferred custody and supervision order is tailored for use in a situation\nwhere the youth to be sentenced needs greater individual deterrence against\nfuture misconduct.”[28]The BC caselaw was reviewed and\nit was acknowledged that youth in similar circumstances in BC are receiving\nnon-custodial sentences.The Court found, however, that in Ontario the\nseriousness of this offence could only be met by a custodial sentence.The\nyoung person was sentenced to 60 days open custody followed by 30 days in the\ncommunity, along with a 4 year driving prohibition.[29]The court in R. v. V.F. focused,\nin the end, on the principle of proportionality with this statement:“…the\nseriousness of this offence dictates that nothing less than custody is a\nproportionate response.”[30]Proportionality has long been a\nfundamental principle of sentencing which takes into account both the\nseriousness of the offence andthe degree of responsibility of the accused.In the 1996 decision. R. v. C.A.M. then Chief Justice Lamer wrote that “it is a\nwell-established tenet of our criminal law that the quantum of sentence imposed\nshould be broadly commensurate with the gravity of the offence committed and\nthe moral blameworthiness of the offender.” (R. V. C.A.M. 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R.\n500)[31]I must answer the question,\nthen, whether custody is the only proportionate response to this offence?ANALYSIS[32]It is an everyday occurrence, in\nthis court, to sentence people for driving impaired.A case I routinely refer\nto is that of R. v. Bernshaw, (1995 CanLII 150 (SCC), [1995] 1 S.C.R.\n254), a 1995\ndecision of the Supreme Court of Canada.In that case Justice Cory stated that\n“Every year drunk driving leaves a terrible trail of death, injury, heartbreak\nand destruction.From the point of view of numbers alone, it has a far greater\nimpact on Canadian society than any other crime.In terms of the deaths and\nserious injuries resulting in hospitalization, drunk driving is clearly the\ncrime which causes the most significant social loss to the country.”(para\n16)On most days when I read out this citation in court I tell people how\nlucky they are that nobody got hurt.Every time someone gets behind the wheel\nof a vehicle when their ability to operate it is impaired they take a terrible\nchance, with their own life, and those of others.Today is an example of the\ndevastating consequences when luck runs out.My task is to determine an\nappropriate sentence.A Meaningful\nConsequence[33]The purpose of sentencing under\nthe YCJA is “to hold a young person accountable for an offence through\nthe imposition of just sanctions that have meaningful consequences for the\nyoung person and that promote his or her rehabilitation and reintegration into\nsociety, thereby contributing to the long-term protection of the public.”[34]That is the gist of s. 38, which\nlays out the purpose of sentencing under the act.This court is to consider a\nnumber of sentencing principles as well.For ease of reference, they are as\nfollows:S. 38(2)A youth justice court that imposes a youth\nsentence on a young person shall determine the sentence in accordance with the\nprinciples set out in section 3 and the following principles:a)the sentence\nmust not result in a punishment that is greater than the punishment that would\nbe appropriate for an adult who has been convicted of the same offence\ncommitted in similar circumstances;b)the sentence\nmust be similar to the sentences imposed in the region on similar young persons\nfound guilty of the same offence committed in similar circumstances;c)the sentence\nmust be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the young person for that offence;d)all available\nsanctions other than custody that are reasonable in the circumstances should be\nconsidered for all young persons, with particular attention to the\ncircumstances of aboriginal young persons; ande)subject to paragraph (c), the\nsentence musti)be the\nleast restrictive sentence that is capable of achieving the purpose set out in\nsubsection (1),ii)be the one\nthat is most likely to rehabilitate the young person and reintegrate him or her\ninto society, andiii)promote a sense of\nresponsibility in the young person and an acknowledgement of the harm done to\nvictims and the community.The following factors must also be\nconsidered:38(2)In determining a youth sentence, the youth\njustice court shall take into account:a)the degree of participation by\nthe young person in the commission of the offence;b)the harm done to victims and\nwhether it was intentional or reasonably foreseeable;c)any reparation made by the young\nperson to the victim or the community;d)the time spent in detention by\nthe young person to the victim or the community;e)the previous findings of guilty\nof the young person; andf)any other aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances related to the young person or the offence that are\nrelevant to the purpose and principles set out in this section.[35]S. 3 of\nthe Act sets out a Declaration of Principle, which I have considered in\nits entirety.Of particular importance in this case, is s. 3(1)(a)(iii), which\nrequires a young person be subject to meaningful consequences, and s.\n3(1)(c)(iii), which directs that measures taken against young persons should\n“be meaningful for the individual young person given his or her needs and level\nof development and, where appropriate, involve the parents, the extended\nfamily, the community and social or other agencies in the young person’s\nrehabilitation and reintegration.”THE APPROPRIATE\nSENTENCE[36]Defence\ncounsel has highlighted, with his review of adult caselaw in the area, the\nprinciple that a youth sentence should not be greater than an adult would\nreceive for a similar offence. In his view an adult in this jurisdiction would\nlikely receive a conditional sentence, so a youth should similarly be able to\nserve their sentence in the community.Adult drive impaired cause death\nsentencing decisions should be approached with caution, in my opinion.Due to\nthe nature of this kind of offence the principles of denunciation and\ndeterrence were paramount in all of the adult decisions I reviewed.(See, as\nexamples,R. v. Proulx 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61,R. v. Dalkeith-Mackie 2003 MBCA 144 (CanLII), [2003]\nM.J. No. 435,R. v. Shave [2005] M.J. No. 16,and R. v.Fineday [2007]\nS.J. No. 59.)These principles do not apply to young offenders under the YCJA.Instead, the court is to focus on the young-offender specific principles of\naccountability and meaningful consequences, principles which must be tied,\ninextricably, to the rehabilitation and reintegration of the young person into\nsociety, to accord with the remainder of the legislation.[37]Judge\nChen, in the R. v. K.L.M. decision, supra, laid out 5 points, based upon\nhis review of the case law, for determining if a serious violent offence should\nresult in a custodial sentence.I found these points a useful framework to\nkeep my analysis focused on YCJA principles and this particular young\nperson as opposed to the inapplicable principles of denunciation and\ndeterrence.They are found at paragraph 38 of his decision and read as follows:“Where the offence is a serious violent offence,\nsuch a sentence can be a custodial sentence, in situations where:1.A non-custodial sentence would\nplace the young person in an environment not conducive to the young person’s\nrehabilitation and reintegration into society;2.the young person has a history\nof not complying with orders of the court;3.a custodial sentence is more\nconducive to the young person’s rehabilitation and eventual integration into\nsociety, than the environment he would be in should a non-custodial sentence be\nimposed;4.the character and attitude\ntowards the law of the young person are impediments to the young person’s\nrehabilitation and a custodial sentence is necessary to promote a sense of\nresponsibility on the part of the young person or to acknowledge the harm done\nto the victim or to the community; and5.the aggravating circumstances of\nthe offence outweigh the mitigating circumstances to such a degree that only a\ncustodial sentence would have meaningful consequences for the young person.”THIS CASE1.Community plan contrary to\nrehabilitation?[38]F.S.P.\nhas accessed counseling services in the community, she has obtained part-time\nwork, she has shown she can be a good and attentive student, and she has\ndeveloped a rapport with both her probation officer and her AFM worker.It\nappears there is a support system in place that could effectively oversee a\ncommunity based sentence.[39]The\naddiction issue that underlies F.S.P.’s impairment of that night must be\neffectively addressed in sentence in order to ensure the long-term protection\nof the public.Although F.S.P. has continued to drink, underage, since the\nincident, this drinking was not done contrary to a court order.Her compliance\nwith court orders, since her living situation stabilized, has been quite good.She has not been criminally re-involved, and she has been going to school.I\nam encouraged by the comment from her teacher, who says she has seen no\nevidence of substance abuse, and the assessment of the AFM worker, who finds\nher to be cooperative and communicative.The AFM assessment that F.S.P. is a\nhigh-risk user is concerning, and must be addressed.In my view the sentence\nmost likely to rehabilitate and reintegrate F.S.P. into society would deal with\nher alcohol issues and her sense of loss and guilt over the deaths that she has\ncaused while leaving her in her home environment.2.History of non-compliance?[40]I have\nconsidered F.S.P.’s failure to comply with her earlier sentence by failing to\nreport.The timing of that sentence was unfortunate.Four days after this\nincident she was sentenced to probation.After that her living situation in\nEbb and Flow First Nation became intolerable.Threats were made, and personal\nproperty was damaged.She was blamed and vilified for causing the deaths of\nDiane Govereau and Alan Flett, and her family felt they had no option but to\nleave the community.Their 2 moves – firstly to Portage la Prairie, and then\nto Brandon, at the same time that she must have been struggling with her own\nguilt and shame, resulted in a lack of compliance.She later became quite\ncooperative with her probation officer.I consider this incident to be the\nproduct of exceptional circumstances, and do not find her earlier failure to\ncomply indicative of her future likelihood to comply.3.Custody more likely to rehabilitate?[41]F.S.P.\ncurrently lives with her mother and her siblings.Her mother is concerned\nabout her daughter’s alcohol use, and has a list of 19 house rules that she\nexpects to be obeyed.There are support systems in place to assist in\nrehabilitation – the probation officer, the AFM worker, and the teacher at\nNeelin High School.All appear optimistic about F.S.P.’s motivation and\npotential to succeed.Placing her in custody would introduce this young women,\nwho, as her probation officer puts it, is “not criminally oriented” to a more\ncriminalized peer group as she struggles with addiction and grief issues.4.Character and\nattitude require custody to promote responsibility?[42]This is\nnot a situation, such as in the S.S. case, where the young person does not\nappreciate the harm done.F.S.P., both in her comments to and demeanor before\nthe court, and in her apology letters, clearly accepts responsibility and\ndeeply regrets her actions.It is my opinion that she will carry the weight of\nguilt and remorse over these deaths with her far longer than she will be\nsubject to the disposition of this Court.The families of Diane Govereau and\nAlan Flett are still reeling over the loss of their loved ones.F.S.P. feels\ntheir loss as well, and the loss of the companionship of the affected family\nmembers.I do not know if family members are prepared to sit down and try to\nexpress, in a victim-offender mediation setting, the extent of this loss to\nF.S.P., but this can be done most effectively via a community disposition as\nwell.6.Aggravating\noutweigh mitigating, requiring custody?[43]F.S.P.\nhas pleaded guilty, and exhibits genuine remorse, which is to her credit.There are some serious aggravating factors, however.The fact that the police\nwere there attempting to conduct an investigation when she got behind the wheel\nand took off that night is highly aggravating as it shows a marked disrespect\nand even contempt for the law.That is further exacerbated by the fact that\nshe did not have a driver’s license, and that she ran away from an accident\nscene where injured parties required immediate care.This, however, must be\nconsidered alongside F.S.P.’s claim that she was told to drive by both of the\ndeceased.Their family members dispute this.They don’t believe they would\nhave done this, with the police in attendance.F.S.P. made this claim that\nvery day, and continues to make it, most recently in her apology letter.She\ndoesn’t overstate the claim – they weren’t aggressive, she said, just nagging,\nand she also, to her detriment, mentions they told her to slow down, that she\nwas going too fast.[44]In her\napology letter to Kimberley Govereau F.S.P. says that “I should have just told\nyour Mom and Dad that we were being stopped and that we would be taken home in\nawhile.”This makes me wonder if Diane Govereau and Alan Flett were fully\naware of why the van was no longer moving.They may have asked to be driven\nhome without comprehending the situation completely.I am satisfied that\nF.S.P. believed the adults in the vehicle wanted her to drive them home, and I\nfind that to be a mitigating factor.The information before the court shows\nF.S.P. to be a follower, a hard worker, a good communicator, and a pleasant\nstudent. This characterization is more consistent with a girl who did as she\nwas asked than a girl who independently drove away from the police against the\nwishes, or without the knowledge, of the adults in the vehicle.Responsibility\nfor her actions, of course, rests squarely on her shoulders.Is\nCustody Necessary?[45]With the\nagreed designation of these offences as serious violent ones counsel conceded\nthat custody is an option for the court.Custody being available is not\nsufficient, however.I must not impose a custodial sentence unless I have\nconsidered “all alternatives to custody raised at the sentencing hearing that\nare reasonable in the circumstances.” (YCJA s. 39(2)) Having considered\nthe purpose and principles of sentencing in the YCJA and having reviewed\nthe factors laid out in R. v. K.L.M. (supra) I am of the view that\ncustody is not the only proportionate response to this crime which would serve\nas a meaningful consequence for F.S.P..Meaningful consequences that would\nbest promote F.S.P.’s rehabilitation and reintegration into the community can\nbe crafted through a community disposition with strict conditions.[46]I have\nconsidered the use of absolute curfews in the non-custodial sentences referenced\nabove.Judge Whelan, of the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan, warned about use\nof “house arrest” in her decision R. v. T.M. 2003 SKPC 162 (CanLII), [2003] S.J. No. 722, as\nfollows:“We must not use house confinement because we are uncomfortable with\nthe shift in the available range of sentences.We should be careful not to\ncreate a sentence which accomplishes by the back door what we cannot in\nprinciple accomplish by the front door.”[47]Would an\nabsolute curfew be simply a replacement for a non-allowable deferred custody\norder – an acknowledgment that “house arrest”, or a form of custody, was\nrequired?I think it would not if an absolute curfew is necessary for\n“securing the young person’s good conduct and for preventing the young person\nfrom repeating the offence or committing other offences.” (YCJA s.\n55(h)) In this case F.S.P.’s ongoing use of alcohol justifies such restrictions\non her movements.Decision[48]F.S.P.\nmade the terrible decision, on May 13th, 2006, to drive while\nimpaired and caused the death of 2 people – 2 people whom had opened their home\nto her in the past and whom she presumably cared about.Having considered all\nof the circumstances, and the efforts she has made to begin to put her life on\ntrack since moving to Brandon, I believe that a custodial sentence would not be\nthe most likely to rehabilitate her.I am convinced, by the facts of this\ncase, F.S.P.’s circumstances, and the line of cases from British Columbia, that\nan appropriate sentence is a 2 year supervised probation order, with strict\nconditions and onerous community service work requirements.F.S.P. -➢You are sentenced to a 2 year\nperiod of supervised probation.Conditions as follows:➢Keep the peace and be of good\nbehavior and appear before the Youth Justice Court when required to do so by\nthe court.➢Report to and be supervised by a\nyouth worker within 2 days of today and as required after that.➢Reside at 733 – 10th Street, in Brandon,\nManitoba with your mother, F.S.P.➢Do not move without permission\nof the court or prior written approval from your youth worker.➢Attend school regularly and obey\nall rules of the school.➢Attend, participate and complete\nIntensive Support and Supervision Program, addiction assessment counseling,\nalcohol dependency counseling and any other counseling and treatment as\nsupervised and directed by your youth worker.➢Attend victim-offender mediation\nwith your victims’ families, if the families are willing to participate in such\nmediation.➢Perform 240 hours of community\nservice work, terms, location, type and time of work to be supervised and\ndirected by a Youth Worker and to be completed by October 24th,\n2008.➢Do not leave the City of Brandon\nwithout the prior permission of your Probation Officer.➢Abstain from the consumption or\npossession of alcohol, other intoxicating substances, non-prescription drugs,\nor prescription drugs, except in accordance with a medical prescription.➢For the first 9 months of your\nprobation observe an absolute curfew and remain in your residence, to include\nhouse and yard.➢Answer the door or telephone for\ncurfew checks by your youth worker or the Brandon Police Service.Exceptions to absolute curfew during first 9 months:➢When in the company of your\nmother.➢With the written permission of\nyour youth worker.➢For the purpose of going\ndirectly to and from and attending meetings with your worker, your place of\nwork or education, or completing your community service work hours.➢Personal needs for a 3 hour\nperiod twice each week, with written approval from your youth worker.➢Medical emergencies for yourself\nor members of your immediate family.Curfew for remaining 15 months:➢Will be from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m.\ndaily.Exceptions:➢With the written permission of your youth worker.➢When in the company of your mother.➢Medical emergency for yourself or members of your\nimmediate family.Driving Prohibition:Driving is a privilege which you have\nabused.I am going to prohibit you from driving until you are older, more\nmature and hopefully have your addiction issues under control.There will be a\n5 year prohibition from driving, pursuant to s. 259 of the Criminal Code,\napplicable by virtue of s. 42 of the YCJA.“ORIGINAL SIGNED BY”Judge\nC.

Wilkins of the Royal\nNewfoundland Constabulary, he threw a cup of water at him.On May 3, 2010 in\nan attempt to commit suicide he set fire to the mattress in his cell.As a result\nof the fire his cell area became filled with thick smoke and the prison had to\nbe evacuated and the fire department called to extinguish it.On the same day\nMr. Power told one of the corrections officers working at the penitentiary that\nhe would “break his arm and kill him”.[3]All of these offences are serious but the most\nserious of them are the armed robbery and the arson charges.ALBERT\nPOWER’S ANTECEDENTS[4]Albert Micheal Power is a 45 year old man with an\nextensive criminal record consisting of over 120 convictions for offences such\nas being unlawfully at large, possessing weapons dangerous to the public peace,\npossessing concealed weapons, assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest,\npossessing controlled drugs, drug trafficking, assault with a weapon, fraud,\nmischief and numerous property offences assaults and over forty breaches of\ncourt orders.Among the most notable of his convictions was on December 21,\n2007 when he was convicted of attempted armed robbery and sentenced by the Supreme\nCourt of Newfoundland and Labrador, Trial Division, to fifty months\nimprisonment.Mr. Power was on parole and still serving the sentence for armed\nrobbery when he committed the armed robbery which is now before this Court.[5]The pre-sentence report (PSR) which was prepared\nby the Adult Probation Officer gives some further insight into Mr. Power’s\nsocial history, education and employment, his plans for the future and the\navailable treatment services which might be of benefit to him.It is clear that\nMr. Power has spent most of his adult life incarcerated and has served federal\nterms of imprisonment at both Dorchester and Springhill penitentiaries.He has a very limited\nwork history due to his frequent terms of imprisonment.Social workers, Ms.\nHeidi Edgar and Ms. Jill Peckford, who work with the Justice Project and whose\ninput was sought for the pre-sentence report also testified at a hearing before\nme.They both stated that Mr. Power is making an effort to build a trusting\nrelationship with them and has been very cooperative and insightful into the\nissues which he feels he faces and have led to his conflicts with the law.It\nappears that Mr. Power sought out these workers and availed himself of the Justice\nProject in an attempt to address these issues.Both Ms. Peckford and Ms. Edgar\nas well as the psychologist at Her Majesty’s Penitentiary, Mr. Sam Martin, reported\nthat Mr. Power is a very intelligent man who has now become aware of some of\nthe issues arising from his own victimization at an early age and how this may\nhave impacted his life.They say that he struggles with his addiction and\ncoping skills when in the community.Mr. Power stated to the author of the\nPSR that he remembers very little about the circumstances surrounding the armed\nrobbery as he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs at the time.The\nauthor observed that “regarding the remainder of the offences, the defendant\ntends to minimize and justify his actions”.Connie Jackman, a Parole Officer\nwith Corrections Canada, reported that Mr. Power completed the National\nSubstance Abuse Program while serving time at Dorchester Penitentiary in 2008.She said that this program is a high intensity substance abuse program but that\ndespite the fact that Mr. Power has also completed multiple substance abuse\nprograms over the years during his involvement with the justice system in\naddition to this particular one, the programming has not impacted Mr. Power’s\nrisk to commit other offences.He has been diagnosed as having a bi-polar disorder\nand this has led to his inability to cope when released into the community.Ms. Jackman stated in the report that “because of his risk for violence his\nparole is always classified as the highest level of supervision in the\ncommunity which is Statute Release with Residence”.The report concludes\nthat “Mr. Power was assessed a very high risk to become involved in further\ncriminal activities” and enumerated some of the criminogenic factors that\nwere areas of concern for Mr. Power as beingaddiction/drug problem;\nanti-social pattern; companions; criminal history and employment/education.[6]In his statement to me at the conclusion of the\nsentencing hearing, Mr. Power asked that in imposing sentence I consider the\nfact that he was victimized as a youth and that I should not give up on someone\nwho is asking for help.He told me that a recent change in medication has\nhelped him and that he would “take the sentence on the chin” whatever it\nis.POSITION\nOF THE PARTIES[7]Crown counsel argues that armed robbery is on the rise\nin our community and is a serious offence.She states that given Mr. Power’s\nextensive record and violent history that general deterrence and protection of\nthe community are key considerations.She urges that a total sentence of 7 ½ years\nimprisonment is appropriate including 6 years for the armed robbery, 6 months\nfor the arson as well as 6 months each for uttering threats and breach of\nprobation.[8]Counsel for Mr. Power suggests that a sentence of 50\nmonths for the armed robbery with other sentences ranging from 7 days for the\nassault on the police officer to 5 months for the arson would be appropriate\nfor a global sentence of 61 months taking into account principles of parity and\ntotality.She emphasizes the need for rehabilitation and Mr. Power’s positive\nprogress with social workers in the Justice Project and evidence of recent\ninsight into the underlying issues before Mr. Power’s conflict with the law.THE\nLAW[9]Section 718 of the Criminal Code of Canada R.S.C.\n1985, c.C­-46, sets out the fundamental purpose of sentencing.It is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for\nthe law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing\njust sanctions.Just sanctions have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of\nthe harm done to victims and to the community.In\naddition to this and in accordance with section 718.1 the sentence which I must\ncraft here is required to be proportionate to the gravity of the offences\ncommitted and the degree of responsibility of the offender.[10]Under section 718.2 I am required to take into\nconsideration certain principles which I summarize as follows:(a)sentences should be increased or decreased to account for any relevant\naggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offences or the\noffender;(b)sentences should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders\nfor similar offences in similar circumstances;(c)where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should\nnot be unduly long or harsh;(d)an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive\nsanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and(e)all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in\nthe circumstances should be considered for all offenders.AGGRAVATING\nAND MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES[11]Both Counsel agree that Mr. Power’s lengthy criminal\nrecord, the fact that he was on parole and probation at the time of the\ncommission of these offences and that some of them occurred while in custody,\nare all aggravating factors.I must be mindful as well of the degree of\nviolence used in carrying out the armed robbery and the threats of violence\nmade toward the nurse and corrections officers.In mitigation there is\nthe fact that Mr. Power pleaded guilty, is seeking counseling for his drug\naddictions, his childhood victimization and the mental health issues which he\nfaces and recognizes may underliehis criminal behaviors. The prospect of\nrehabilitation of an offender must always be considered.ANALYSIS[12]\nJustice Steele of the Court of Appeal wrote\nin R. v. P. (H.J.) (1995), 1995 CanLII 9875 (NL CA), 133 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 20 (Nfld.\nC.A.)\nat para. 14:A criminal record\nsurely indicates diminished prospects for rehabilitation.Furthermore a\ncriminal record, in particular where the offences are similar, is the omen that\nimmediately alerts the sentencing judge to the reality that the offender has\nbecome a serious threat to the community.How great the risk of course,\ndepends on the nature of the offences and the circumstances.Ruby in his Fourth\nEdition at p. 202 observes that courts\noften state that “a second offence is always considered more serious than the\nfirst” and, as the protection of society is the basic purpose of sentencing,\nthe criminal record of a repeat offender is relevant in fixing the measures\nnecessary to protect society.He expresses the point in these terms:The real issue is how\ndangerous the offender may be to society.The criminal record may show that\nthe offender is ‘committed to a criminal way of life’ and therefore a danger to society.The criminal\nrecord may ‘display a settled intention\nto ignore all warnings and continue committing crime’.But there are limits to\nthis doctrine: “Propensity may inhibit mitigation but in the absence of\nstatutory authority it cannot do more’.Nevertheless, the acquisition of such\na record does mark someone as a danger and since the basic purpose of\nsentencing is the protection of society, a criminal record is often ‘relevant\nin determining the measures that will be needed to protect society from this\nparticular individual’.[13]In the case of R. v. Murrin (1980),\n27 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 9 (Nfld. C.A.) the Court considered the sentence\nimposed on a twenty-nine year old offender for conspiracy to commit robbery.He had a lengthy record for property offences, including one prior conviction\nfor armed robbery.The five year sentence imposed by the trial judge was\nincreased to eight years.At paragraph 7 Justice Morgan stated:A person who\nengages in robbery deserves a severe sentence; more especially where a weapon\nis involved.The principle of deterrence calls for a lengthy custodial\nsentence on those who commit armed robbery, not only to deter the actual\noffenders from repeating their crimes, but also to discourage those who would\nbe like minded.A fact of it calls for an even more severe sentence is the\nproclivity of the offender to commit similar criminal acts”.[14]A review\nof the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Fowler of the (N.L.T.D.) in\nthe case of R v. Albert Michael Power (2008), 2008 NLTD 8 (CanLII), 273 Nfld.\n\u0026 P.E.I.R. 88, and the circumstances of the attempted bank robbery while\narmed with an imitation of a gun, clearly demonstrate the principles which must\nbe considered in sentencing for this type of offence.It is also apparent from\nparagraph 10 of that judgment that Mr. Power pleaded before that Court the same\nunderlying criminogenic factors to explain his conduct and mitigate his\nsentence as he did in this case.[15]In the case of R. v. Eugene Thomas,\n[1997] St. J. No. 0494(N.L.T.D.), Mr. Justice Mercer, as he then was,\ncited with approval the reasons of Justice Roberts in R. v. Pardy\n(1994), 1994 CanLII 10448 (NL SCTD), 126 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 218(Nfld. T.D.) wherein he stated:The crown\nemphasized the importance of deterrence of those convicted of armed robbery.In that connection I note that in R. v. Pardy Roberts, J. quoted\nwith approval the following words from the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal:“Public confidence in the administration of justice would be undermined if this\nserious offence of robbery with a weapon is not visited with a substantial term\nof imprisonment.The court has frequently stated that robbery is the type of\ncrime from which the public is entitled to be protected and that the sentence\nimposed must leave no doubt that such conduct will not be tolerated.Small\nshops, confectionaries and taxi operators are particularly vulnerable to this\ntype of attack.Robbery is particularly serious because of its inherent danger\nto human life.Escalation of violence or the threat of violence toward a\nvictim can easily result in death or serious bodily harm, particularly if the\nvictim decides to resist the offender.[16]In the case of R. v. Peters (2000),\n2000 NFCA 55 (CanLII), 194 Nfld. P.E.I.R. 184 (NFCA) upheld a sentence of four years imprisonment for\narmed robbery describing it to be at the low end of the range but fit given the\nnature of the offence having concluded that the trial judge properly took into\nthe account the offender’s attention deficit hyper-activity disorder and\nbipolar illness.[17]In the case of R. v. Rowe, (2008)\n(N.L.C.A.) the Court upheld a sentence of six years for armed robbery as well\nas a consecutive sentence of one year for breach of probation arising from the\ncommission of that offence.ARSON[18]In R. v. Fewer, (2004)\nCarswellNfld 389 (NL.P.C.) Judge R. Leblanc, as he then was, reviewed twenty\narson sentencing judgments issued between 1975 and 2004.He concluded, and I\nagree, that the authority supported the following principles of sentencing as\nbeing applicable to the offence of arson:1.the danger imposed by the\nunpredictable and erratic nature of fire is such that protection of the public\nthrough general deterrence must be the sentencing principle given the greatest\nemphasis by the sentencing court;2.the risk to life that arson\nsubjects emergency personnel and others too, requires an emphasis on the\nsentencing principle of denunciation;3.a period of imprisonment will normally\nbe the appropriate sentence to be imposed and rarely will it be for a period of\nless than two years.Normally, it will be one of three years or more; and4.periods of imprisonment of five\nyears or more may be imposed in cases where the offender has a history of other\narson offences or where someone is harmed.UTTERING THREATS, ASSAULTING\nA PEACE OFFICER AND BREACH OF PROBATION[19]These threats to commit acts of violence and\ncommitting them can be quite frightening and intimidating to the very people\ncharged with the important, public responsibility of caring for those\nincarcerated in our prisons and enforcing court orders and the law generally.There is a need for denunciation and deterrence when sentencing offenders for\nthese sorts of crimes.Sentences for breaching court orders almost always\ninvolve incarceration to denounce this conduct and send a signal to those who\nwould be so inclined.AN\nAPPROPRIATE DISPOSITION[20]A consideration of the circumstances of the offence as\nwell as the antecedents, background and circumstances of the offender leads me\nto the conclusion that a lengthy period of incarceration is necessary to best\nprotect society. A sentence which emphasizes denunciation and deterrence must\nbe imposed. Mr. Power spent a very short period of time in the community after\nbeing released on parole for attempted armed robbery when he committed the\noffence of armed robbery.It is clear from the circumstances that he was\ndetermined to effect his purpose by committing acts of violence and threats of\nviolence against not only to the store clerk but to others who tried to stop\nhim from achieving his criminal goal.While committing this offence he was\nadmittedly under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs in violation of the\nprobation order upon which had been come into force less than one month\nearlier.This, no doubt, gave rise to the damage to the property of Ms. Bonnie\nMoss, the very woman to whom he was ordered to keep the peace. Despite\ntreatment and assistance for his addictions and substance abuse issues, at the\nmost intensive levels, he continues his behaviors. While in custody awaiting\ntrial for this serious offence, Mr. Power endangered the lives of others and\nhis own by setting fire to the mattress in his cell at Her Majesty’s\nPenitentiary.Accepting this as an act of self destruction, it was\nnonetheless, an exceedingly dangerous act which could have resulted in\nextensive damage, serious injury or the death of a great many number of\npeople.Fortunately the fire was extinguished and no one was harmed.[21]The\ngeneral rule is that sentences should be consecutive unless there is a good\nreason to make them concurrent.The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal has recently reaffirmed\nthis principle in R. v. Newhook, 2008 NLCA 28 (CanLII), [2008] N.J. No. 258 (NLCA) when\nthe sentences imposed by a trial judge were re-adjusted to reflect consecutive\nsentences where appropriate and also give deference to totality.The Court\nreviewed and reaffirmed the rules in R. v. Crocker (1991), 1991 CanLII 2737 (NL CA), 93 Nfld. and P.E.I.R. 222 (NLCA) and R.\nv. A.T.S., 2004 NUCJ 4 (CanLII), [2004] N.J. No. 1 (NLCA).[22]In\nimposing sentence for multiple offences I must take into account all of the\nprinciples I have mentioned above as well as the concept of totality.This was\nagain discussed in the case of R. v. Hicks [2007] N.J. No 41\n(NLCA), 268 Nfld \u0026 P.E.I.R.There at paragraph 38 Justice Rowe stated as\nfollows:A fit sentence\nshould be established for each offence then the total of all sentences should\nbe considered to see whether adjustment is needed having regard to the\nprinciple of totality (the purpose of totality principle is to ensure that a\nseries of offences each properly imposed in relation to the offence to which it\nrelates is in total just and appropriate so that if the aggregate sentence is\nsubstantially above the normal level of sentence for the most serious of the\nindividual offences involved, or if the resulting effect is to impose on the\noffender a “crushing sentence” not in keeping with his record and prospects it\nis reduced appropriately.[23]By imposing what would\notherwise be a fit sentence of two years imprisonment for the offence of arson\nand ordering all sentences to be served consecutively would result in an\nexcessive burden on the offender.[24]In this case I have concluded that the appropriate\nsentence is:March\n6, 20101.Armed\nRobbery – 6 years imprisonment2.Assault\nwith a Weapon – 1 year imprisonment (concurrent)3.Breach of Probation for\nfailure to keep the peace and be of good behavior – 6 months imprisonment\n(concurrent)March\n7, 20104.Damage to Property – 3 months\n(consecutive)5.Breach of Probation for\nconsumption of alcohol – 3 months (concurrent)April\n30, 20106.Threat to Robert Dewling – 3\nmonths (consecutive)May\n2, 20107.Assaulting a Police Officer – 1 month\n(concurrent)May\n3, 20108.Arson at HMP – 2 years\nimprisonment (reduced to 6 months based on the principle of totality)\n(consecutive)9.Threats to John Bradbury – 3\nmonths (consecutive)10.Breach of Probation by failing to\nkeep the peace and be of good behavior – 3 months (concurrent)These\nsentences, because of the way in which I have imposed them by making them\nconsecutive or concurrent to each other, reach a total of 7 years 3 months\nwhich, in my view, is appropriate as a global sentence for the overall degree\nof Mr. Power’s culpability and the other principles which I have outlined\nabove. To do otherwise would be to impose a total sentence substantially above\nthe normal level for that offence.Mr.\nPower will be given credit for time served on remand at the rate of 1 to 1 ½\nsince he has been incarcerated since March 7, 2010. I count 7 ½ months time\nserved multiplied by 1.5 which equals approximately 11 months.The credit will\nbe given to the sentence for the armed robbery. Mr. Power’s total sentence will\ntherefore be in effect 76 months imprisonment.ANCILLARY ORDERSThere\nwill also be an order requiring Mr. Power to provide his DNA.Section\n109 Firearms Prohibition order for life.Victim\nfines surcharges taxes waived on all offences given the financial circumstances\nof Mr. Power.There\nwill be no order as to restitution given his inability to pay.Order\nunder section 743.21 in respect of Bonnie Moss, Justin Flemming, Jim Gamberg and\nAugustus Fanning._________________________D.\nMark PikeChief\nJudgeProvincial\nCourt of Newfoundlandand\nLabrador"}

and(ix)Section 117.02 – an offence to fail to produce licencing documentation\nwhen required to do so.[9]As well, the Criminal Code was amended to include\nmandatory minimums for the following offences where a firearm was used:criminal negligence causing death; manslaughter; attempted murder;\nintentionally causing harm with a firearm; sexual assault with a weapon;\naggravated sexual assault; hostage-taking; kidnapping; and extortion.ii)Mandatory Minimums Legitimate\nResponse to Gun Control[10]Mandatory minimum sentences have been accepted as part of Parliament’s\nlegitimate interest in gun control.In R. v. McGuigan, 1982 CanLII 41 (SCC), [1982] 1 S.C.R.284 at p. 19 (Q.L. Version), Dickson J. (as he then was) noted that s. 83 [now\ns. 85], which imposed a mandatory minimum of one year for the use of a firearm\nconsecutive to any sentence arising from the underlying offence was part of “a\ncomprehensive ‘gun control’ legislative scheme intended to discourage the use\nof firearms by the criminal element of our society.”[11]In R. v. Schwartz, 1988 CanLII 11 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 443 at paras 47 and 76, the\nSupreme Court, in upholding the reverse onus provision under then s. 106.7(1) for\na charge of possession of a restricted weapon, noted that since the initial\ninclusion of gun control provisions in the Criminal Code “there have\nbeen successive amendments which without exception have strengthened the\ncontrols upon possession and use of firearms.”Dickson C.J.C. although in\ndissent, noted that what is now Part III of the Criminal Code:represents the latest attempt by Parliament to\nstrike the proper balance between the interest of Canadian society in\nprotecting its members from violent actions and the freedom of individuals to\npossess and use guns for legitimate purposes.It embodies wholly legitimate\nsocietal concerns for stricter regulation and control of guns and other\noffensive weapons.iii)Subsequent\nChallenges to Mandatory Minimum Sentences for Firearms Related Offences[12]A number of challenges have been made to mandatory minimum sentences\nrelated to firearms offences.Most have been rejected.In R. v. Brown,\n1994 CanLII 29 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 749, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected a challenge to s. 85\nand the mandatory imposition of one year custody consecutive to any offence\nwhere a firearm was used.In R. v. Morrissey, 2000 SCC 39 (CanLII), [2000] 2 S.C.R. 90, the\nSupreme Court rejected a challenge to the four-year minimum for criminal\nnegligence causing death involving a firearm.In R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2008]\n1 S.C.R. 96, the Supreme Court rejected a s. 12 Charter challenge to a\nmandatory minimum sentence of four years for manslaughter involving a firearm.In R. v. Wiles, 2005 SCC 84 (CanLII), [2005] 3 S.C.R. 895, the Supreme Court rejected a s. 12 Charter\nchallenge to the imposition of a firearms prohibition imposed for a conviction\nfor production of cannabis.iv)Firearms In\nCanada[13]The Supreme Court of Canada, in 1993, distinguished a firearm from any\nother objects able to be used as a weapon.It said “No matter what the\nintention may be of the person carrying a gun, the firearm itself presents the\nultimate threat of death to those in its presence” [R. v. Felawka 1993 CanLII 36 (SCC), [1993]\n4 S.C.R. 199 at para. 21].[14]The Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. P.(Q.) (2005), 2005 CanLII 30044 (ON CA), 199 C.C.C.\n(3d) 490 at paras. 77 and 78 endorsed the trial judge’s comments as follows\nabout the prevalence of firearms in Toronto:Death by firearms in public places in Toronto\nplague this city and must be deterred, denounced and stopped.Only the\nimposition of exemplary sentences will serve to deter criminals from arming\nthemselves with handguns.In particular, the use of handguns in public places\ncries out for lengthy increased periods or parole eligibility.Society must be\nprotected from criminals armed with deadly handguns.There is no question that our courts have to\naddress the principles of denunciation and deterrence for gun related crimes in\nthe strongest possible terms.The possession and use of illegal handguns in\nthe Greater Toronto area is a cause for major concern in the community and must\nbe addressed.[15]Courts in Toronto and throughout Canada have endorsed this sentiment on\nnumerous occasions since.In R. v. Chin 2009 ABCA 226 (CanLII), [2009] A.J. No. 711 (C.A.) at\npara. 10, the Alberta Court of Appeal found that “carrying a loaded restricted\nor prohibited firearm is an extremely dangerous act for which there is\nabsolutely no justification”.The Parties’ Positions on the Constitutional Validity of s. 244.2(3) of the\nCode[16]The applicant relies, first, upon the case of R. v. Smickle\n2013 ONCA 678 (CanLII), [2013] O.J. No. 5070 where the Ontario Court of Appeal found that (along with\nthe companion case R. v. Nur, 2013 ONCA 677 (CanLII)) a three year minimum\nsentence for possession of a firearm pursuant to section 95 of the Criminal\nCode is unconstitutional; and, second, the fact that Superior Courts have\nan inherent jurisdiction to issue a general declaration of constitutional\ninvalidity, “removing the law from the statute books [Nova Scotia (Workers’\nCompensation Board) v. Martin, 2003 SCC 54 (CanLii) (CanLII); R. v. Ferguson,\n2008 SCC 6 (CanLII)].[17]The applicant maintains that section 244.2 of the Criminal Code\nimposes a grossly disproportionate punishment resulting in a violation of\nsection 12 of the Charter of Rights and cannot be justified under section 1\nof the Charter.The only appropriate remedy, in the circumstances, is\nto strike down the section in accordance with s. 52 of the Constitution Act,\n1982, R.S.C. 1985, App. II, No. 44, Schedule 13, S. 52.[18]The Crown’s response is that the applicant’s actions in possessing a\nloaded illegal handgun and recklessly firing it in the middle of the day in a\nhousing complex with several other people nearby requires a substantial\nsentence and the minimum sentence of 5 years mandated by s. 244.2(3)(i) is\nappropriate.It reflects the growing problem presented by handguns and those\nwho possess and use them.The minimum sentence would not breach ss. 12, 7 or 9\nrights guaranteed to Mr. Abdullahi by the Charter.The Crown maintains\nthat:(i)The offence\nof possession and the reckless firing of such a weapon is inherently serious;(ii)The affect\nof the minimum 5 year sentence is not grossly disproportionate nor even\nexcessive.It does not approach the level of outraging the community’s sense\nof decency; and(iii)The sentence is in accordance with the overarching principle of\nproportionality and other legitimate sentencing principles.The Law[19]The Crown has outlined the relevant statutory and common law principles\nof sentencing and I quote directly from her factum in stating the following:1.Relevant Statutory\nProvisions27.The guiding principles of\nsentencing are found at ss. 718-718.2:Purpose: Section 718The fundamental purpose of sentencing\nis to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the\nlaw and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just\nsanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct(b)to deter\nthe offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from\nsociety, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating\noffenders;(e)to provide\nreparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f)to provide\na sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to\nvictims and to the communityFundamental Purpose:Section 718.1A sentence must be proportionate to the\ngravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.Other Sentencing Principles: Section 718.2A court that imposes a sentence shall\nalso take into consideration the following principles:(a)a sentence should be\nincreased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating\ncircumstances relating to the offence of the offender(b)a sentence should be similar\nto sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in\nsimilar circumstances;(c)where consecutive sentences\nare imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;(d)an offender should not be\ndeprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the\ncircumstances; and(e)all available sanctions\nother than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be\nconsidered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of\naboriginal offenders.2.General Principles28.Sentencing is a highly\nindividualized process; but it is not driven by the discretion of the judge to\nimpose a sentence that he or she sees fit without regard to the principles that\nParliament has seen fit to provide guidance. This guidance also takes the form\nof the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences which reflect the\nlegislature’s views of the seriousness of an offence and category of offenders.\nThe fundamental principle is that of proportionality which reflects the “just\ndesserts” rationale for state-imposed and sanctioned punishment. The sentence\nmust fit the specific crime and the specific offender. As noted in R. v.\nHamilton, infra, the gravity of the offence “refers to the seriousness of\nthe offence in a generic sense as reflected by the potential penalty imposed by\nParliament and any specific features of the commission of the crime which may\ntend to increase or decrease the harm or risk of harm to the community\noccasioned by the offence.” The responsibility of the offender incorporates the\nnotion of an offender’s culpability and any aspects of his or her conduct or\nbackground that may increase or decrease their personal responsibility.Tab 20 – R. v. Hamilton 2004 CanLII 5549 (ON CA), [2004]\nO.J. No. 3252 (C.A.) at paras. 87-94 per Doherty J.A.Tab 21 – R. v. Wilmott, [1967] 1\nC.C.C. (Ont. C.A.) 171 at pp.178-929.In order to comply with the\nproportionality principles as set out in the Code, it must be recognized\nthat the mandatory minimums sets out the “inflationary floor” that a Justice is\nto start from when imposing an appropriate sentence based on the gravity of the\noffence and the degree of the responsibility of the offender, balanced with all\nother sentencing principles. In her concurring opinion in Morrisey,\nArbour J. held that the mandatory minimum sentence for firearms-related\noffences must act as an “inflationary floor” applicable to the so-called best\noffender. Over time, sentences come to reflect the inflationary consequences of\nthe new minimum. It is unwise to simply measure gross proportionality against\nan existing range of sentences because, subject to constitutional limits,\nParliament is entitled to create aggravated forms of existing offences with\nenhanced punishments.Tab 17 - R. v.\nMorrisey, supra at paras. 49, 75-7630.The proportionality principle\ncan lead to different results based upon the nature of the offence. Doherty\nJ.A. noted in R. v. Hamilton, supra:In some circumstances, one side of the\nproportionality inquiry will figure more prominently in the ultimate\ndisposition than the other. For example, where a young first offender is being\nsentenced for a number of relatively serious property offences, the sentence\nimposed will tend to emphasize the features which mitigate the offender’s\npersonal culpability rather than those which highlight the gravity of the\ncrimes: see R. v. Priest, supra. If, however, that same young offender\ncommits a crime involving serious personal injury to the victim, the “gravity\nof the offence” component of the proportionality inquiry will be given\nprominence in determining the ultimate disposition.Tab 20– R. v.\nHamilton, supra at para 94Tab 22– R. v. Priest (1996),\n1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at pp. 297-98 per Rosenberg J.A.31.Other sentencing principles\nincluding retribution and denunciation also have a valid role in imposing\nsentence. Retribution has been defined by Lamer C.J.C. in R. v. M. (C.A.),\nsupra as representing “nothing less than the hallowed principle that\ncriminal punishment, in addition to advancing utilitarian considerations\nrelated to deterrence and rehabilitation, should also be imposed to sanction\nthe moral culpability of the offender.” He distinguished retribution from\nvengeance in the following terms:Retribution in a criminal context, by\ncontrast, represents an objective, reasoned and measured determination of an\nappropriate punishment which properly reflects the moral culpability of the\noffender, having regard to the intentional risk-taking of the offender, the\nconsequential harm caused by the offender, and the normative character of the offender’s\nconduct. Furthermore, unlike vengeance, retribution incorporates a principle of\nrestraint; retribution requires the imposition of a just and appropriate\npunishment, and nothing more.Tab 23– R. v.C.A.M. 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500 at paras 79-8032.Denunciation also plays a\nrelated but different role than retribution. Lamer C.J.C. made the following\nobservations distinguishing the two different principles:Retribution, as well, should be\nconceptually distinguished from its legitimate sibling, denunciation.\nRetribution requires that a judicial sentence properly reflect the moral\nblameworthiness of that particular offender. The objective of denunciation\nmandates that a sentence should also communicate society’s condemnation of that\nparticular offender’s conduct. In short, a sentence with a denunciatory element\nrepresents a symbolic, collective statement that the offender’s conduct should\nbe punished for encroaching on our society’s basic code of values as enshrined\nwithin our substantive criminal law. As lord Justice Lawton stated in R. v.\nSargeant [cite omitted]: “society, through the courts, must show its\nabhorrence of particular types of crime, and the only way in which the courts\ncan show this is by the sentences they pass.” The relevance of both retribution\nand denunciation as goals of sentencing underscores that our criminal justice\nsystem is not simply a vast system of negative penalties designed to prevent\nobjectively harmful conduct by increasing the cost the offender must bear in\ncommitting an enumerated offence. Our criminal law is also a system of values.\nA sentence which expresses denunciation is simply the means by which these\nvalues are communicated. In short, in addition to attaching negative\nconsequences to undesirable behaviour, judicial sentences should also be\nimposed in a manner which positively instills the basic set of communal values\nshared by all Canadians as expressed by the Criminal Code.Tab 23 – R. v. C.A.M. supra at para 81 per Lamer C.J.C.33.Finally, the principle of rehabilitation\ncan be also addressed through mandatory minimum sentences. Offenders would be\nprovided with appropriate programming at the federal institutions to address\ntheir personal needs in anticipation of their reintegration into the community…Sentencing and Judicial Discretion35.The applicant has attempted to\ncharacterize s. 244.2(3)(i) as an attack on judicial discretion in sentencing.This characterization, respectfully, is unfounded for a number of reasons.As\na matter of law, this section is an indictable offence, pursuant to s. 34(1)(a)\nof the Interpretation Act until such time as the Crown elects to proceed\nsummarily.As such, the practical implication for this section is that only\none sentence range is available to the court based upon the statute.Further,\nthe Crown’s election is a matter within its “core” duties and, absent abuse of\nprocess in a specific case, is beyond the review of the courts.As the court\nnoted in R. v. Smythe, infra “[e]nforcement of the law and especially of\nthe criminal law would be impossible unless someone in authority [the Attorney\nGeneral] be vested with some measure of discretionary power”.As well, the\nApplicant inherently acknowledges that the Crown did not elect inappropriately\nin this instance.Tab 24 – R. v. Dudley,\n2009 SC 58 at para 17-18Tab 25 – R. v. Smythe\n1971 CanLII 831 (SCC), [1971] S.C.R. 680Tab 26 – Krieger v. Law Society of\nAlberta 2002 SCC 65 (CanLII), [2002] 3 S.C.R. 372 at para 48 per Iacobucci and Major JJ.36.Further, and most importantly,\njudicial discretion during sentencing is not absolute.As the Supreme Court\nrecently noted in R. v. Nasogaluak, infra, within the context of\nmandatory minimums that judicial discretion is constrained by “the restricted\navailability of certain sanctions in the Code” and that in the absence of\na declaration of unconstitutionality of a sentencing provision, “[a] judge’s\ndiscretion does not extend so far as to override this clear statement of\nlegislative intent.”Tab 27 – R. v.\nNasogaluak 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII) at para. 45per Lebel. J.General\nDeterrence37.General\ndeterrence is enshrined by 718 (b) of the Code and recognized by the\nSupreme Court of Canada as a valid purpose in sentencing, including several\ncases involving challenges to mandatory minimums as cruel and unusual\npunishment.Tab 28 – Sauve v.\nAttorney General of Canada et.al.

Everyone has the right not to be subjected to\nany cruel and unusual punishment.LIFE, LIBERTY AND SECURITY OF PERSON7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and\nsecurity of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in\naccordance with the principles of fundamental justice.DETENTION OR IMPRISONMENT9. Everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily\ndetained or imprisoned.[21]The onus is on the applicant, on a balance of probabilities, to show\nthat his rights have been infringed by the legislation requiring a minimum\nsentence.[22]There was no argument made before me about sections 7 and 9 which were independent\nof the constitutional challenge based on section 12 of the Charter.The\nonly analysis to follow, therefore, is in relation to section 12.[23]In R. v. Smith 1987 CanLII 64 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1045 at paras. 53-54, Lamer J.\ndefined the protection afforded by s. 12 of the Charter asThe criterion which must be applied in order to\ndetermine whether a punishment is cruel and unusual within the meaning of s. 12\nof the Charter is, to use the words of Laskin C.J. in Miler and\nCockriell, supra at p. 688, “whether the punishment prescribed is so\nexcessive as to outrage standards of decency.”In other words, though the\nstate may impose punishment, the effect of that punishment must not be grossly\ndisproportionate to what would have been appropriate.[24]In that judgment, Justice Lamer also commented that mandatory minimum\nsentences were not per se cruel and unusual punishment.[25]Justice Rosenberg, in R. v. MacDonald 1998 CanLII 13327 (ON CA), [1998] O.J. No. 2990 (C.A.)\nat para. 68 defined the term cruel and unusual punishment as a sentence which\nwas “grossly disproportionate to what would have been appropriate.The\npunishment must be so excessive as to outrage standards of decency.A sentence\nthat is merely excessive or even unfit, is not necessarily grossly\ndisproportionate:Further, it is unwise to simply measure gross\ndisproportionality against a current sentencing regime.”[26]In the MacDonald case, a four year minimum jail sentence was upheld for\na youthful first offender who merely showed a BB gun to a robbery victim.[27]The Supreme Court of Canada in Smith also warned that while it is\nproperly a judicial function to decide whether a punishment exceeds\nconstitutional limits set by the Charter, courts “should be reluctant to\ninterfere with the considered views of Parliament and then only in the clearest\nof cases where the punishment prescribed is so excessive when compared with the\npunishment prescribed for other offences as to outrage standards of decency” (R.\nv. Smith, supra at para. 47).The Supreme Court has also suggested that it\nwill be on “rare and unique occasions” when a court will find a breach of s. 12\nof the Charter [Steele v. Mountain Institution 1990 CanLII 50 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R.\n1385 para. 80 per Cory J].Two-Step Analytical Approach[28]To decide whether Mr. Abdullahi’s section 12 rights have been infringed,\nI must first examine “all relevant contextual factors” in light of the\nparticular offender before me [R. v. Morrissey, supra, at\nparas. 27 – 29].The Crown submits that the factors to be considered include\nthe following, but that (as per Lamer C.J.C. sets out in R. v. Latimer\n2001 SCC 1 (CanLII), [2001] 1 S.C.R. 3 at para. 75], “not all of these matters will be relevant to\nthe analysis and none of these standing alone will be decisive to a\ndetermination of gross disproportionality”.(a)The gravity of the offence;(b)The personal characteristics of the offender;(c)The particular circumstances of the case in order to determine what\nrange of sentences would have been appropriate to punish, rehabilitate or deter\nthis particular offender or to protect the public from this particular offender;(d)The actual effect of the punishment on the individual (which includes\nconsideration of things such as parole);(e)The penological goals and sentencing principles upon which the sentence\nis fashioned;(f)The existence of valid alternatives to the punishment imposed. A\ncomparison of punishments imposed for other crimes in the same jurisdiction.[R. v. Smith, supra, at p. 1073; R.\nv. Goltz (1991), 67 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.) supra, at paras\n25-27; R. v. Morrissey, supra, at paras. 27-28].[29]If the sentence is found to be grossly disproportionate for Mr.\nAbdullahi, this court would then analyse whether s. 1 of the Charter justified\nsuch an infringement.If the sentence were not found to be disproportionate\nfor Mr. Abdullahi, I must still go on to consider the constitutionality of the\nsentence with reasonable hypotheticals.If the sentence is grossly\ndisproportionate in a reasonable hypothetical case, then only section 1 of the Charter\ncan save it from being declared unconstitutional [R. v. Morrissey, supra].[30]Any reasonable hypothetical to be considered cannot be “far-fetched or\nonly marginally imaginable as a live possibility … which could commonly arise\nin day-to-day life.”[R. v. Goltz, supra, at para. 69; R. v.\nMorrissey, supra at paras. 30 – 33].Analysis[31]The recent Ontario Court of Appeal cases in R. v. Hussein Jama Nur,\n2013, supra and R. v. Smikle, supra are guidance in the argument\nthat section 244.2(3) is unconstitutional, but the facts in them vary\ntremendously from the facts before me.And, obviously, the charges are quite\ndifferent.Gravity of the Offence and\nParticular Circumstances of This Case[32]This is not a case of simple possession of a loaded, prohibited or\nrestricted firearm.Nor is it simply the discharging of such a weapon.This\noffence took place in the context of a shooting.Not just the applicant, but\nalso Mr. Duale was in possession of a loaded firearm.There is no explanation\nat all as to why they possessed them.Mr. Abdullahi fired three shots with Mr.\nDuale and their wounded companion close by.The video footage of the offence seems\nto show, but is not conclusive, that the shots the applicant discharged were\nfired directly into the air.Mr. Abdullahi took steps to retrace his movements\nto retrieve the bullet casings from the three shots and to conceal his criminal\nintent.Thereafter, video footage showed the applicant running through the\nhousing complex with the loaded firearm in his hand – leading to a possible\ninference that he meant to fire it again or meant to intimidate anyone in his\npath.The housing complex had persons coming and going.Mr. Abdullali posed a\nrisk to them, his companions and the police.[33]The applicant ran from police who had been called to the complex and was\narrested still in possession of the firearm.[34]It can be inferred from the video tape footage of the incident that Mr.\nAbdullahi did not initiate the shooting.Those who did were never arrested.[35]As set out by Doherty J.A. in R. v. Nur, supra at paras. 82-84,\nthe gravity of an offence is measured by the essential elements the Crown must\nprove and not by the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence in\nthe particular case before the Court.While acknowledging the inherent danger\nof all firearms, the seriousness of any firearm offence is the “product of the\nharm targeted by the elements of the crime and the moral culpability required\nto establish guilt … The greater the harm and the higher the moral culpability,\nthe more serious the crime.Crimes that require proof of actual harm to\nothers, especially death, are generally more serious than crimes that prohibit\nother forms of harm.”[36]Mr. Abdullahi’s plea of guilt to count 1 on the Indictment before me is\nan acknowledgement that while armed with a prohibited firearm, he intentionally\ndischarged it while being reckless as to the life or safety of the public.Consequently,\nhe endangered the public.There was a real risk for harm in this case and that\nfact distinguishes it from the Nur and Smickle cases.[37]The Crown contends that the facts of this case cry out for a sentence in\nexcess of the 5 year minimum due to its aggravating features and compares it to\nR. v. Hassan [2012] B.C.J. No. 1049 where the accused was sentenced to 7\nyears for recklessly discharging a prohibited firearm.He shot a bouncer in\nthe leg after having been denied entry into a nightclub.At the time of the\noffence, the accused was on bail and prohibited from possessing a firearm.The\nCrown also compares this case to that of R. v. Alexander [2013] O.J. No.\n1613 where the defendant was sentenced to 7 years for firing a prohibited gun\nat a loss prevention officer chasing him in a mall after he had stolen a bottle\nof perfume.Mr. Alexander had a lengthy record.The court considered his\nhaving the gun at a shopping mall and placing the public at risk as aggravating\nfactors.The defendant was given credit on his sentence due to the jail\nconditions he experienced while in custody and for his positive rehabilitation\nprospects.[38]Although the facts of these cases are not entirely the same as the\napplicant’s case, they are instructive in relation to how serious the charge of\ndischarging a firearm charge is.And the fact that one of Mr. Abdullahi’s\ngroup was shot cannot be ignored.[39]Mr. Abdullahi has a criminal record.As a youth, he was found guilty of\nobstructing a peace officer and failing to comply with a recognizance in 2004.As an adult, he has one conviction in 2010 for obstructing a peace officer.Effect of the Punishment on\nthe Offender[40]In R. v. Morrissey, supra, at paras. 41-42, this court is told to\nconsider how the offender will be personally affected by the actual punishment\nimposed.Parole eligibility is a factor directly related to the applicant’s\nsituation.In fact, if a five year sentence were imposed on today’s date, at a\n1:5 day credit for one day served ratio, Mr. Abdullahi will have served three\nyears of pre-trial custody and would have two years left to be served on his\nsentence.He would be eligible for parole in 8 months.Penological Goals and\nSentencing Principles[41]R. v. Morrissey, supra at para. 43 sets out that in evaluating\nwhether or not a mandatory minimum sentence is cruel and unusual punishment for\nthe offender, the court must “determine whether Parliament was responding to a\npressing problem, and whether its response is founded on recognized sentencing\nprinciples”.The Supreme Court took into account that there had been a\nconsistent and serious problem related to firearms deaths for 20 years prior.It also noted that a penalty emphasizing deterrence, denunciation and\nretribution over the principles of rehabilitation and specific deterrence is\nstill valid under s. 12 of the Charter [para. 46].[42]As previously set out in this judgment, judicial pronouncements about the\nneed to deter and denounce firearm crimes and the criminal activity which\ninvolves the use of firearms in Canada, in general, and, in Toronto, in\nparticular, is abundant.I need not repeat it all here.[43]In all of the circumstances of this case, a sentence of 5 years is not\ngrossly disproportionate.There is no breach of s. 12 in relation to section\n244.2(3) of the Criminal Code.Reasonable Hypothetical[44]Although no hypothetical was proposed in his written submissions, Mr.\nAlawi, for the applicant, set out the following in his oral submissions.The\nhypothetical he proposed was that of a “law abiding citizen with a Firearms\nAcquisition Certificate who properly stored his firearm, but who, during target\npractice at his cottage, shot the gun into the woods surrounding the cottage.”[45]The hypothetical must be “reasonable”.The one proposed here does not\ninclude an illegal firearm as in Mr. Abdullahi’s case.There may not be\nrecklessness nor a risk to the public in the hypothetical proposed, which is\nthe basis of the section in question.It is not a reasonable hypothetical upon\nwhich to conduct the weighing of the possible disproportionality of a 5 year\nminimum sentence for the offence in question.[46]As a result, the application to strike down the section is dismissed.Sentencing[47]The aggravating features of this case have already been set out, but I\nsummarize them here:(1)The offence took place in a residential community with numerous persons\naround, including Mr. Abdullahi’s two male companions.The firearms were in\nsight for the residents to see as the defendant and his companions ran through\nthe housing complex away from the scene of the crime;(2)The offence was in response to a shooting, during which Mr. Abdullahi’s\ncompanion was shot in the leg;(3)Not only was the defendant in possession of an illegal firearm, but his\ncompanion, Mr. Duale, also possessed one;(4)There is no innocent explanation for any of the firearms being present at\nthe scene;(5)Three shots were fired with persons close by;(6)The defendant retrieved the casings to cover his tracks / hide his\ncriminal intent.[48]The mitigating features of Mr. Abdullahi’s case are the following:(1)Mr. Abdullahi has\npleaded guilty.He did not apply for bail.He waived his preliminary\ninquiry.He has shown remorse for his crimes;(2)he did not initiate\nthe shooting, but the fact that he then became further involved in it lessons\nthe mitigating weight of this factor;(3)he has a supportive\nfamily;(4)he has made strides\nwhile in custody to better his education and intends on furthering his\neducation in custody and upon release;(5)his criminal record is\na somewhat minor one.[49]In the circumstances, the minimum sentence of 5 years is appropriate in\nthis case.[50]Mr. Abdullahi has served 2 years and 5 days in custody. On a 1:5 credit\nto one day served calculation, he has served the equivalent of3 years in\ncustody.I am prepared, then, to sentence him to two further years in the\npenitentiary.The sentences are as follows:1.Count\n1 [(s. 244.2(3)] Discharge of Firearm – 5 years less 3 years pre-trial custody\nwith a sentence of 2 years left to be served in the penitentiary;2.Count\n3 [s. 95(2)(a)] – Possession Loaded Prohibited Firearm – 3 years concurrent\nless 3 years pre-trial custody with 1 day left to be served;3.Count\n7 [s. 91(3)(a)] – Possession Over-capacity Handgun Magazine – 3 years\nconcurrent less 3 years pre-trial custody with 1 day left to be served.[51]There shall also be an Order pursuant to s. 109 of the Criminal Code\nfor life.McWatt J.Released: February 14, 2014CITATION:\nR. v.

On January 2, 2015, the\ncomplainant went to the home of Mr. MacKinnon and then went out for the\nevening. The complainant returned to Mr. MacKinnon’s home after midnight. Mr.\nMacKinnon was asleep. Mr. MacKinnon awoke and became angry with the\ncomplainant. The complainant went into the bathroom and Mr. MacKinnon began to\nbang on the bathroom door. This continued for about one hour until Mr.\nMacKinnon calmed down and the complainant left the bathroom.[4]The complainant then began to pack her things to\nleave. Mr. MacKinnon threw the complainant on the couch. He yelled at her and\ntold her that she was not going anywhere. The complainant attempted to leave\nMr. MacKinnon’s home. Mr. MacKinnon grabbed her by the jacket, pulled her\nbackwards and threw her on the couch. Mr. MacKinnon took her keys and phone and\nhid them in the couch. Mr. MacKinnon threw the complainant on the floor.[5]Mr. MacKinnon confined the complainant until\naround 9:00 a.m. on January 3. Over the course of the confinement, he grabbed\nher by the hair, pushed her and held her. He threw her on the couch several\ntimes. The complainant fought back. Mr. MacKinnon removed the complainant’s\nleggings and underwear. At one point, Mr. MacKinnon got on top of the\ncomplainant and she kicked him in the chest. In response, he hit her in the\nhead and she passed out.[6]Mr. MacKinnon confined the complainant in his\nhome throughout the night. She repeatedly attempted to leave. She begged him to\nlet her leave but he refused and confined her so that she could not leave.\nEventually, the complainant was able to go to the bathroom and called 911. Mr.\nMacKinnon began banging on the door. He burst the door down and grabbed the\nphone from the complainant. He grabbed her, pushed her against the wall and then\ntold her to get out. The complainant got out of the apartment. The police then\narrived.IMPACT ON THE VICTIM[7]The complainant filed a victim impact statement.\nThe complainant indicated that the offences have had a significant negative\nimpact on her. The complainant was affected physically as a result of the\nassault. She had pain in her jaw and ears. She had serious headaches and dizzy\nspells.[8]The complainant has also had serious emotional\neffects as a result of the assault and confinement. The complainant has flashbacks\nfrom the incident, and severe anxiety. She suffered from sleep loss. She had to\nrely on prescription sleeping pills to sleep. The complainant has found it\ndifficult to be alone and has increasingly had difficulty in trusting people.\nThe complainant indicated she lost confidence in herself. She has difficulty\nconcentrating or thinking about anything other than the incident. The\ncomplainant has indicated that the incident has also impacted her financially,\nas she found it difficult to work due to the negative impact of the incident on\nher. It is clear that the complainant was seriously impacted by these offences.[9]The complainant’s mother and father both\nprovided victim impact statements and it is clear that they both have been\nnegatively affected by the incident.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER[10]Mr. MacKinnon is 42 years of age. He is not\nmarried but is living with his ex-common law spouse. He and his ex-common law spouse\nco-parent their five year old son although they are not in a relationship. He\nhas a grade 12 education. He has six separate certificates for operating heavy\nequipment. He has been employed his entire adult life and in that regard, has\nbeen a contributing member of society.[11]Mr. MacKinnon has battled with alcohol for most\nof his life. He began to drink alcohol at the age of 14. He became a heavy user\nof alcohol in his early 20’s. He has continued to use alcohol, but to his\ncredit has not consumed alcohol since January 2015.[12]Mr. MacKinnon has suffered from depression and\nanxiety since early adulthood. He has been under the care of a psychiatrist\nfrom time to time. Mr. MacKinnon’s biological father was murdered. He suffered\nduring his childhood from an abusive step-father and he was sexually assaulted.[13]The defence filed a copy of a report by Dr.\nOlabisi, dated December 7, 2015. Dr. Olabisi is a psychiatrist who diagnosed\nMr. MacKinnon with alcohol abuse early remission, marijuana abuse early\nremission and major depressive disorder.[14]Mr. MacKinnon indicated that he had been taking\nthe drug Champix to assist him with the cessation of smoking and that on the\nevening in question he was drinking heavily. He does not remember the evening.[15]Mr. MacKinnon was held in custody from January\n3, 2015 until April 9, 2015. However, Mr. MacKinnon was for a portion of that\nremand time given credit for the remand time in relation to another offence.\nMr. MacKinnon’s remand time to be considered here is 67 days.[16]Mr. MacKinnon has a previous criminal record.1990-04-23WINDSOR, ONT(YOUTH COURT)(1) BE \u0026 THEFTSEC 348(1)(B)CC(2 CHGS)(1-2) PROBATION FOR 18 MOS ON EACH CHG\u0026 150 HRS COMM SERV WORK(2) BREAKING OUT SEC 348(1)(C) CC(WINDSOR PD 1444IY)1991-07-22COMM SERV WORK VARIED ON REVIEW TO 60 HRS1995-11-22WINDSOR, ONT(1) ASSAULT SEC 266 CC(1) 21 DAYS\u0026 SURCHARGE $25 \u0026 PROHIBITED FIREARMS AMMUNITION OR EXPLOSIVESUBSTANCES FOR 5 YRS(2) FAIL TOCOMPLY WITH RECOGNIZANCE SEC 145(3) CC (WINDSOR PS 57282)(2) 7 DAYS CONSEC \u0026 PROBATION 15 MOS1996-11-27WINDSOR, ONTMISCHIEFUNDER $5000 SEC 403(4) CC (2 CHGS) (WINDSOR PS 57282)SUSP SENT \u0026 PROBATION 1 YR1998-05-08WINDSOR, ONTBE \u0026 THEFT SEC 348(1)(B) CC (WINDSORPS 57282)SUSP SENT\u0026 PROBATION 2 YRS[17]Subsequent to the date of the offence here, Mr.\nMacKinnon plead guilty to common assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal\nCode, RSC 1985, c C-46 in relation to an offence committed\non September 25, 2014 and was sentenced to 30 days time served and one year\nprobation.[18]Mr. MacKinnon expressed that he was very\nremorseful and apologized to the complainant.CROWN AND DEFENCE POSITONSa.The Crown[19]It is the Crown’s position that Mr. MacKinnon\nshould receive a sentence between 9 months to 12 months for the conviction for\nunlawful confinement, contrary to s. 279(1) of the Criminal Code;\nthat he should receive a sentence of four to six months consecutive for the\nconviction of assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code; and,\nthat he should receive a sentence of two months consecutive for the breach of\nan undertaking contrary to s. 145(3) of the Criminal Code.[20]As such, it is the Crown’s positon that the total sentence of 15-20\nmonths should be imposed, followed by two years probation with conditions. The\nCrown has relied on several decisions in support of its position including: R\nv Meyers, 2012 SKCA 98 (CanLII), 399 Sask R 261; R v Broesky, 2014 SKCA 36 (CanLII),\n433 Sask R 300; R v Shebanski, 2010 ABCA 92 (CanLII); R v Fagg, 2015 BCSC\n1694 (CanLII); R v Clarke, 2014 NWTSC 53 (CanLII); R v Truong, 2012 ABQB 661 (CanLII), 550\nAR 305 and R v Drodge (2015), 360 Nfld \u0026 PEIR 262 (NL Prov Ct)[21]The Crown has requested that Mr. MacKinnon\nprovide a DNA sample pursuant to s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code. The\nCrown seeks a mandatory firearm prohibition pursuant to s. 109 for a period of\nten years and the imposition of a victim crime surcharge in the amount of\n$600.00.[22]The Crown’s position with respect to the credit\nfor the remand time is that Mr. MacKinnon is not entitled to credit at a rate\nof 1:1.5.b.The Defence[23]The defence’s position is that Mr. MacKinnon should\nbe sentenced to time served, plus a period of two years probation with\nconditions.The defence submits Mr. MacKinnon should get full credit for his\npre-trial custody at 1.5 times for the time spent in custody. The defence\nsuggests that a s. 109 order is not necessary.[24]The defence relies on the following cases in\nsupport of their position on sentencing including R v Levere, 2011 ONCA\n576 (CanLII), R v Oatchess, 2013 SKCA (SentDig) 22, R v Paik, 2013 SKCA\n(SentDig) 23 and R v Severight, 2007 SKCA (SentDig) 7.SENTENCING PURPOSES AND PRINCIPLES[25]Section 718 of the Criminal Code sets out\nthe key objectives of sentencing, which include denouncing unlawful conduct,\ndeterring the offender and other persons from committing offences and where\nnecessary, separating the offender from society. Key objectives also include\nrehabilitation of offenders, providing reparation for harm done to the victim\nand the community and promoting a sense of responsibility in the offender.[26]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code states\nthat a fundamental principle of sentencing is that a sentence must be\nproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of\nthe offender. Section 718.2 sets out that a sentence should be increased or\nreduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances;\nthat similar sentences should be imposed for similar offences and similar\noffenders; and, that the least restrictive sanction should be identified.ANALYSIS[27]It is incumbent upon a judge to sentence in\naccordance with the principles of sentencing beginning with the fundamental\nprinciples spelled out in s. 718.1 of the Criminal Code. The sentence\nmust be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender. The gravity of an offence lies in its nature,\nin its comparative seriousness and in the harm caused in its commission. The\ndegree of responsibility of the offender lies in the context of the offender’s\nmoral culpability in committing the offence.[28]The offence of unlawful confinement and assault\nconstitute grave and serious offences. Here, Mr. MacKinnon and the complainant were\ninvolved in a relationship. Mr. MacKinnon unlawfully confined the complainant\nfor a number of hours and in the course of that confinement assaulted her on\nmore than one occasion. The gravity of this offence is significant and Mr.\nMacKinnon’s degree of moral culpability is significant as well.[29]It is also a requirement pursuant to s. 718.2(b)\nto ensure that any sentence which the court imposes is similar to sentences\nimposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar\ncircumstances. This is known as the principle of parity. The purpose of parity\nis to ensure fairness, by avoiding disproportionate sentences amongst convicted\npersons.[30]I have canvassed the decisions provided to me by\nthe Crown and defence and some other cases which involve similar circumstances\nfor similar offences.R v Snelgrove, 2005 BCCA 51 (CanLII), 207 BCAC 227[31]The 33-year-old offender broke into the\nresidence of his former common-law wife, at approximately 3:30 a.m., where she\nand their four month old daughter resided. He was high on cocaine and wielding\na large stick. The offender was screaming at his ex-partner, calling her an\n“evil bitch” and telling her he was going to “bash her… head in with a stick”.\nHe ran upstairs to where the baby was sleeping, though the victim was able to\nget to the baby first and cradled the baby in her arms. The offender was\nscreaming at his ex-wife to confess, but she did not know to what she was\nsupposed to confess. She remained on the bed holding the baby, terrified to\nleave due to the unpredictability of his anger. At one point, he tore her engagement\nring off her finger. The ordeal lasted approximately thirty minutes and ended\nwhen the victim agreed to follow the offender to his parents’ house with the\nbaby.When in the vehicle, the victim was able to call the police.[32]The offender’s criminal record was not lengthy\nbut “serious and significant”, including convictions for kidnapping, extortion,\nand unlawful confinement. He had spent approximately three years in prison and served\nthe remainder of his ten year sentence in the community. The offender had a good\nupbringing. He had a drug addiction. He attained post-secondary education and\nhad employment opportunities.[33]The court denied the characterization of the\noffender’s intoxicated state as a mitigating factor. Particularly aggravating,\nthe sentencing judge found, was the assault of a domestic partner who had been\ninside her own home, with her child. Other aggravating factors included\nviolence, a previous criminal record for a similar offence, and ongoing drug\nissues with which he had not successfully dealt with. The sentencing judge\nconsidered a fit and proper sentence for the unlawful confinement charge to be\nfour years, with the assault with a weapon charge attracting a concurrent\nsentence of one year, less time served. The offender received 18 months credit\nfor the 10 months he spent on remand.[34]The Court of Appeal varied the sentence. The court\nwas in agreement with the general approach of the trial judge, but because the\noffender was unable to attain access to a high-intensity drug treatment program\nwhile incarcerated, a global sentence of 18 months was imposed, with an\nadditional 18 month probationary period. In their written decision, the Court\nof Appeal acknowledged the offender’s success when free from drugs and alcohol.R v Meyers, 2012 SKCA 98 (CanLII), 399 Sask R 261[35]The offender and victim were in a long-term\nrelationship, having met at their work. The incident occurred in aRegina hotel room. The couple, having been out shopping and drinking allday, returned to\nthe room where an argument ensued. The offender began to choke thevictim; in\nresponse, the victim grabbed the offender’s testicles. He responded by\nrepeatedly punching her in the head. She tried to leave but the offender\ncontinued to throw her back on the bed, telling her he was going to killher. The\nvictim eventually escaped. At trial, the offender was convicted ofassault\ncausing bodily harm, unlawful confinement, two counts of utteringthreats to\ncause death, and failing to comply with a term of a recognizance. Hereceived a\nglobal sentence of 30 months with 6 months credit for time spent onremand. The\noffender appealed both his conviction and his sentence. With respect tohis\nsentence, defence counsel argued that the sentence was unfit and theoffender\nshould have been granted 1.5:1 credit for time spent on remand.[36]The Court of Appeal did not interfere with the\nsentencing judge’s calculation of remand time. With respect to the fitness of\nthe sentence, the court concluded that a 27 month sentence for assault, confinement,\nand the first threatening charge was not unreasonable with the remaining three\nmonths attributable for the remaining charges.R v Palmer, 2014 PESC 3 (CanLII), 346 Nfld \u0026 PEIR 146[37]The offender’s spouse admitted to the offender that\nshe had been unfaithful. The offender became enraged and proceeded to\nphysically abuse her and confine her over the course of the evening. At 5:30\na.m., the victim was able to flee the residence. The offender, a 40-year old\nmale with a dated and unrelated criminal record, was charged with common\nassault, uttering a threat, unlawful confinement, and breach of an undertaking.[38]The court considered the physical and\npsychological impact on the victim, the difference in size between the two\nindividuals, the characterization of the event as one of domestic violence,\nand, as mitigating, the guilty pleas entered by the offender. A three month\nsentence was imposed for the assault charge, a concurrent one month\nsentence was imposed for the threat charge, a consecutive five month sentence\nwas imposed for the confinement charge, and a consecutive one month sentence\nwas imposed for the breach of undertaking, for a total sentence of nine months.R v Sanderson, 2010 NWTSC 59 (CanLII), [2011] 5 WWR 91[39]Two spouses began arguing at their residence. During\nthe argument, the victim’s mother arrived to pick up the couples’ 18 month old\nchild. This angered the offender, who pinned the victim up against the wall. The\nvictim ran from the house; he dragged her into the house and locked the door. When\nthe police arrived, the offender was on top of the victim, holding her down. At\nthe time the offender was on probation for a previous assault on the same\nvictim. At trial, he was convicted of unlawful confinement and common assault. He\nwas sentenced to eight months incarceration for the unlawful confinement charge\nand five months confinement for the assault charge, to run consecutively. Defence\ncounsel appealed the sentence on the basis that the sentence was not proportionate\nto the gravity of the offence.[40]The appeal court recognized as aggravating the\nfact that the offences were committed against the offender’s domestic partner\nand was just one in a string of convictions for spousal assault. The sentencing\njudge erred, however, in failing to consider the ‘jump’ principle, as well as\nby factoring the presence of psychological harm in absence of evidence to\nsupport such inference. The appeal court granted the appeal and substituted a\nsentence of five months incarceration for the unlawful confinement charge, to\nbe served consecutive to five months incarceration for common assault.R v Nolan, 2009 ONCA 727 (CanLII)[41]The victim was the offender’s wife of 19 years\nand; the confinement took place within the context of marital breakdown. The\noffender tied the victim to her bed, covered her mouth with duct tape, punched\nher in the face, cut her underwear off, and threatened to cut her vagina. He\ntried to have sex with her while she was tied up but was unsuccessful. He later\npleaded guilty to the charges of sexual assault and unlawful confinement.[42]The offender, at the time of the offence, was on\nbail for charges of assault with a weapon and threatening bodily harm. The\nsentencing judge imposed a sentence of 100 days incarceration and 1 year\nprobation. The Crown appealed on the basis that the sentence was outside the\nacceptable range.[43]The Court of Appeal agreed that the sentence was\nbeyond the accepted range in these circumstances and would have imposed a 21 month\nsentence of incarceration for the charges of sexual assault and unlawful\nconfinement. However, because the offender had already served his custodial\nsentence and was doing well in the community, employed and supporting his\nchildren, the court deemed it contrary to the principles of justice to\nre-incarcerate him. As such, a conditional sentence of 21 months plus 1 year\nprobation, with credit given for the time spent in custody, was substituted.R v McNeil, (1994) 97 Man R (2d) 183 (Man CA)[44]An 18 year old girl pleaded guilty to one charge\nof unlawful confinement and one charge of assault. These charges arose out of\nan incident where a group of teenagers handcuffed, gagged, and threatened a 16 year\nold girl in an apartment. The accused struck the girl in the face once. Eventually,\nthe group abandoned the victim; one member returned to free her.[45]The offender was sentenced to one year\nimprisonment on the unlawful confinement charge and six months concurrent on\nthe assault charge. She appealed this sentence. The Court of Appeal recognized\nthat there were signs that the accused was attempting to improve her life and\nreduced the global sentence to time-served, being four and one half months, along\nwith the two year probationary order.R v Oxford, 2010 NLCA 45 (CanLII), 257 CCC (3d) 484[46]The police attended a residence after being\ninformed the offender was intoxicated and causing problems. The offender told\npolice to go away and would not let the owner of the residence, who was there\nwith one other male, leave. The owner, who had previously been in a\nrelationship with the offender, communicated to police that the offender had a\nknife. The owner made several attempts to leave but the offender continued to\npull her away. Eventually, the police were able to get the owner and the other\nmale out of the apartment and arrested the offender. The offender pleaded guilty\nto one count unlawful confinement, one count possession of a weapon for a\ndangerous purpose, one count breach of undertaking, and two counts breach of\nprobation.[47]The Crown and the defence submitted a joint\nsentencing proposal that the offender be credited for the nine months served on\nremand and sentenced to a further ten months incarceration with two months\nprobation. Defence counsel pointed out that with respect to the unlawful\nconfinement charge, as it was of brief duration and with minimal force, it\nwould attract a sentence at the lower end of the range, which he identified as\nthree to six months. The sentencing judge rejected the joint submission,\nimposing further imprisonment for two years followed by three years of\nprobation. Specifically, the unlawful confinement charge attracted a 12 month\nsentence, with the sentencing judge noting that had the Crown proceeded by way\nof indictment, he would have imposed a period of two years imprisonment. Both\nthe Crown and the defence appealed the sentence, requesting the Court of Appeal\nto impose the joint submission in its place.[48]The offender did have a criminal record for\nviolent offences, though the most recent of which had occurred in 1994. No\nconvictions since that time (theft, impaired driving, failure to complies) were\nviolent in nature. The victim testified that she was not afraid of the offender\nand wished their relationship to recommence.[49]Upon review of the unlawful confinement\nsentence, the Court of Appeal agreed that a one year sentence for unlawful\nconfinement, based on the circumstances at issue, was inappropriate:97Without minimizing the\nseriousness of the offence in this case, it must be recognized that these\nhigher sentences for unlawful confinement (one and three years) relate to far\nmore grievous offences than here. Accordingly, we have concluded that the\nsentence of one year for unlawful confinement in this case would be unfit,\nbeing unduly severe having regard to sentencing precedents, the agreed facts\nand the evidence of Ms. Buckley given at the judicial interim release hearing,\nand bearing in mind that the Crown chose to proceed by way of summary\nconviction. Instead, a sentence of six months would be a fit sentence, a\nfortiori it would not be unacceptable in the context of a joint submission.[50]In addition, the offender was sentenced to a\nperiod of four months for the possession of a weapon charge, one month for the\nbreach of an undertaking charge, two months for the breach of probation/summary\nconviction charge and six months for breach of probation/indictable charge. All\nterms, in this case, were to be served consecutively.R v Berry, 2006 ABCA 275 (CanLII), 397 AR 379[51]The offender and two others picked up the victim\nagainst his will from a movie theatre parking lot for the purposes of forcing\nhim to repay the sum of $20,000.00 he allegedly owed to the offender’s son. One\nof the men assaulted the victim with a pipe when he tried to resist being put\nin the vehicle. The vehicle was thereafter pulled over and the offender later\npled guilty to charges of unlawful confinement and assault.[52]The offender had an unrelated criminal record\nthat included convictions for mischief, false pretences, fraud, forgery, and\ntheft. He did not accept responsibility for his crimes (and had pled guilty\nonly because a plea bargain was offered). The sentencing judge imposed a\nconditional sentence order of two years less a day on both charges, to be\nserved concurrently. The Crown appealed on the basis that: (a) there was no\nparity between that sentence and the one handed down to his co-accused; (b) the\ncontext of the offence was not properly considered; and (c) the sentencing\njudge failed to heed the principle of general deterrence.[53]The Court of Appeal agreed that the sentence was\nunfit. The principle of parity was relevant in this decision, though so too\nwere other factors, such as the respondent’s age, his criminal record, and his\nfailure to take responsibility for the crime. As such, a global sentence\n(common assault and unlawful confinement) of 30 months incarceration was\nimposed, with credit given for time served through the conditional sentence\norder. This case can be differentiated on its facts. While the victim was not\nconfined for a significant period of time, nor was the assault of an\naggravating nature, the court expressly addressed the need to condemn vigilante\nactions.R v Rahaman, 2007 ONCJ 523 (CanLII)[54]The offender, a former boyfriend, approached his\nex-girlfriend as she was getting off the bus on her way to work. He escorted\nher to his car, where he displayed a knife and kept her confined for several\nhours, questioning her about a recent trip she had taken. At one point, the\noffender slapped the victim’s face. He grabbed her neck and pushed her against\nthe car window, choking her. Five hours after he had picked her up, he dropped\nher off. The offender was charged with common assault, unlawful confinement,\nand carrying a knife for the purposes of committing an offence.[55]The court identified as aggravating the planned\nand deliberate nature of the attack, the domestic relationship\ncharacterization, as well as the significant impact the incident had on the\nvictim. The offender did not have a record and was gainfully employed. In\naddition, the court deemed as mitigating the guilty pleas. A global nine month\nsentence was imposed, followed by two years probation, mandatory completion of\na sanctioned domestic violence counselling program, a ten year weapons prohibition,\nand the provision of a DNA sample.[56]The following cases are relevant to the breach\nof recognizance offences. These cases provide me with a range of sentences for\nsimilar offences committed by similar offenders in similar circumstances.R v Séguin, 2012 QCCQ\n7213 (CanLII)[57]Here, the sentencing judge was addressing guilty\npleas to unlawful confinement, assault causing bodily harm, and three s. 145(3)\ncharges. R. Paul Nadin-Davis, Canadian Sentencing Digest 2013 (Scarborough:\nCarswell, 2013) at para 37A.3 indicates that the offender received concurrent\nsix month sentences for each of the confinement and assault charges and one month\nsentences for each of the s. 145(3) charges, served concurrent to each other\nbut consecutive to the six month sentence.R v Lonechild, 2008 ABPC 263 (CanLII), 450 AR 146[58]Here, the sentencing judge was addressing the\ncharges of sexual assault, choking, unlawful confinement, uttering a\nthreat to cause death, mischief, and three s. 145(3) charges, one being for\nhaving consumed alcohol. For the s. 145(3) charges, the offender received\nconsecutive sentences of one month imprisonment on each charge, though served\nconcurrent to the other sentences.R v Oxford, 2010 NLCA 45 (CanLII), 257 CCC (3d) 484[59]This decision was included above; the breach of\nundertaking charge attracted a one month consecutive sentence.R v Palmer, 2014 PESC 3 (CanLII), 346 Nfld \u0026 PEIR 146[60]This decision is also included above; the breach\nof undertaking conviction, which accompanied convictions for assault, uttering\na threat, and unlawful confinement, also attracted a one month consecutive\nsentence.[61]It is clear from the jurisprudence that in\nrelation to the principle of parity an appropriate sentence must include a\nperiod of incarceration for these offences.[62]I now turn to the next principle to be\nconsidered in the Criminal Code in s. 718.2(a) which is that a sentence\nmust be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or\nmitigating circumstances relating to the offence and the offender.[63]The aggravating circumstances here include that\nthe assault was perpetrated by Mr. MacKinnon on the complainant with whom he\nhad a relationship. It is also aggravating that the confinement took place over\nthe course of several hours and that Mr. MacKinnon repeatedly and on multiple\noccasions stopped the complainant from leaving his home when she attempted to\ndo so. Also aggravating is the fact that Mr. MacKinnon has a previous criminal\nrecord including a previous conviction for assault and several convictions for\nfailing to comply with a recognizance.[64]It is aggravating that the emotional\nconsequences to the complainant are significant.[65]There are some mitigating circumstances. Mr.\nMacKinnon has entered a guilty plea. Mr. MacKinnon has been a functioning and\ncontributing member of society and has been employed over the course of his\nadult life. Mr. MacKinnon has the support of his former partner. He continues\nto co-parent and support his five year old son. Mr. MacKinnon has\naccepted responsibility for his actions and has expressed his remorse. Mr.\nMacKinnon also indicates that he always intended to plead guilty but proceeded\nto the preliminary inquiry as a result of the fourth count on the indictment\nwhich was ultimately stayed by the Crown. Although Mr. MacKinnon has a previous\nrecord it has been some 17 years since his last conviction. He has lived since\nthe previous conviction as a law abiding citizen. Mr. MacKinnon was on very\nstrict conditions for a period of eight months and he complied with all of the\nconditions of his release during that period of time.[66]The next principle that must be considered is\nss. 718.2(d) and (e), that the offender should not be deprived of liberty if\nless restrictive sanctions may be appropriate.CONCLUSION[67]In considering a proper and fit sentence for this\noffence, I have considered the particular facts and circumstances of this\noffence, the gravity of the offence, the level of moral culpability of Mr.\nMacKinnon, the need to denounce and deter this type of criminal conduct, the\nneed for public protection, the aggravating and mitigating factors, the\njurisprudence with respect to the sentences imposed on similar offenders in\nsimilar situations for similar offences, and the objectives and principles of\nsentencing.[68]I am of the view that a fit and proper sentence\nfor the offence of unlawful confinement is a period of eight months\nincarceration and for the offence of assault, a period of three months\nincarceration to be served consecutive to the eight months. I am of the further\nview that both of these sentences should be followed by a period of probation\nfor two years with conditions. I am of the view that for the offence of breach\nof recognizance a fit and proper sentence is a period of incarceration for one\nmonth to be served consecutively to the other sentences.[69]Section 719 of the Criminal Code provides\nthat in determining the sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of an\noffence the court may take into account any time spent in custody by the person\nas a result of the offence.[70]Mr. MacKinnon was charged earlier with an offence\nof assault arising out of an incident on September 27, 2014. On October 16,\n2014 he was released on his own recognizance in relation to that charge. On\nJanuary 3, 2015, he was arrested on the charges of unlawful confinement and assault\nherein. The Crown opposed his release on these charges and it sought to revoke\nhis previous release on the earlier charge. On January 14, 2016, a show cause\nhearing was held on the within charges and a revocation hearing was held on the\nother charge. Mr. MacKinnon was detained in custody on the within charges on\nthe secondary ground, pursuant to ss. 524(4) or (8).[71]Mr. MacKinnon was held on remand for a total of\n97 days. On March 16, 2015 he entered a guilty plea on the other matter and was\nsentenced to 30 days time served. That is, 30 days of the 97 days he spent on\nremand were attributed to his sentence on the other assault conviction. Thereafter\nMr. MacKinnon’s counsel brought an application for release and on April 9, 2015\nMr. MacKinnon was released on these charges. The Crown submits that Mr.\nMacKinnon should be given 67 days credit for time spent on remand. The Crown\nsuggests that Mr. MacKinnon is not entitled to 1:1.5 credit for the remand\nbecause he was detained pursuant to ss. 524(4) and (8) of the Criminal Code.[72]Section 719(3) of the Criminal Code\nstates:719(3) In\ndetermining the sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of an offence, a\ncourt may take into account any time spent in custody by the person as a result\nof the offence but the court shall limit any credit for that time to a maximum\nof one day for each day spent in custody.719(3.1)Despite subsection (3), if the circumstances justify it, the maximum is one and\none-half days for each day spent in custody unless the reason for detaining the\nperson in custody was stated in the record under subsection 515(9.1) or the\nperson was detained in custody under subsection 524(4) or (8).[73]Here, Mr. MacKinnon was detained on these\ncharges under subsection 524(4) or (8) and thus is entitled only to credit at\nthe rate of one for one (R v Chambers, 2014 YKCA 13 (CanLII), 316 CCC (3d) 44; R v Ibrahim, 2015\nMBCA 62 (CanLII), 327 CCC (3d) 86; R\nvAkintunde, 2015 ONCA 597 (CanLII),328 CCC (3d) 72). Counsel on behalf of Mr. MacKinnon argued that the case of R v\nWebley, 2015 ONSC 3857 (CanLII) [Webley] was authority for the proposition\nthat Mr. MacKinnon was entitled to the 1:1.5 credit because he was ultimately\nreleased after a bail review, which meant, in effect, that Mr. MacKinnon should\nhave been released earlier and should not have been detained. Counsel argued\nthat when the s. 524 order was vacated it provided Mr. MacKinnon with the right\nto the enhanced credit. A clear reading of Webley satisfies me that the\nissues before the court in Webley do not stand for the proposition\nsuggested.[74]I would note that the constitutionality of s.\n719(3.1) has been challenged in the case of R v Safarzadeh-Markhali,\n2014 ONCA 627 (CanLII), 316 CCC (3d) 87.Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted and the matter was\nheard by the Supreme Court on November 4, 2015 and the decision was reserved. There\nwas no constitutional challenge to the section brought by Mr. MacKinnon before\nthis Court. In due course, the Supreme Court of Canada will rule on the\nconstitutionality of the section.[75]Mr. MacKinnon committed the within offences of\nunlawful confinement and assault while on recognizance and pursuant to the Criminal\nCode this Court is limited to granting credit for time spent on remand\nfollowing the cancellation of his recognizance on a 1:1 basis. Mr. MacKinnon is\nentitled to credit for 67 days spent on remand.[76]Having regard to all of the above, I sentence\nMr. MacKinnon to a period of incarceration of eight months in relation to the\nconviction for unlawful confinement and I sentence him to a period of three\nmonths incarceration to be served consecutively for the offence of assault. I\ngive Mr. MacKinnon credit for 67 days spent on remand and as such in relation\nto those two offences Mr. MacKinnon is sentenced to a total period of\nincarceration of 8 months and 23 days. I further sentence Mr. MacKinnon on both\nof those charges to aperiod of probation for two years, following the\ncompletion of his sentences herein, the terms of the probation are:1.Keep the peace and be of good behaviour;2.Appear before the court when required to do so\nby the court;3.Notify the court or probation officer in advance\nof any change of name or address and promptly notify the court or probation\nofficer of any change of employment or occupation;4.Report to a probation officer at 2nd\nFloor, 1942 Hamilton Street, Regina, Saskatchewan, ph. (306) 787-3808 within\ntwo working day of his release from jail and after that as told to do so by his\nprobation officer or designate;5.Live at 156 Froom Crescent, Regina, Saskatchewan\nand not change that residence without the prior written permission of his\nprobation officer or designate or the court;6.Not possess or consume alcohol or drugs that\nhave not been prescribed for him by a medical doctor and not enter or be in any\nplace in which the main purpose is the sale of alcohol, such as bars or liquor\nstores;7.Participate in an assessment and complete\nprogramming for addictions, which may include in-patient and out-patient\ntreatment, as told to do so by his probation officer;8.Participate in assessment(s) and complete\nprogramming for anger management and personal counselling; and9.Have no contact of any kind in any way, directly\nor indirectly with K.P.[77]In relation to the offence of breach of\nrecognizance, I impose a period of one month incarceration to be served\nconsecutive to the other two sentences. As such, he will serve a global\nsentence of 9 months and 23 days.Ancillary\nOrders[78]The Crown also sought an order pursuant to s. 487.051 for the taking of\nDNA samples. Pursuant to s. 487.051(2), the court shall\nmake such an order unless the offender has established that the impact of such\nan order on their privacy and security would be grossly disproportionate to the\npublic interest. Mr. MacKinnon did not seek such an exemption. There will be an\norder pursuant to s. 487.051 authorizing the taking of a number of bodily\nsubstances that is reasonably required for the purposes\nof forensic DNA from Mr. MacKinnon in accordance with this section.[79]There will also be an order pursuant to s. 109 of the Criminal Code\nprohibiting Mr. MacKinnon from possessing any firearm, crossbow, prohibited\nweapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition\nand explosive substances for ten years.[80]Mr. MacKinnon shall pay\na victim surcharge of $200.00 payable on each offence for a total of $600.00\npayable forthwith, and in default six days. He may serve the default concurrent\nwith the sentence imposed.J.C.L. DAWSON"}

Drouin (M.G.).[1][11]If an individual is a serving\nprisoner at the time a new sentence is imposed, the totality principle can have\npotential influence.However, if it is to be applied in circumstances of\nmultiple domestic assaults, the approach set out in R. v. McCarthy[2]\nserves as an instructive example.[12]In that case, the offender was\nsentenced for a number of assaults upon one domestic partner whilst serving a\nsentence for assault on a different partner.The predicate assault charges\nwere for the most part distinct incidents, completely separated in time and\nplace, and could not, in the Court of Appeal’s view, be considered as a single\ncriminal enterprise.Therefore, they merited consecutive sentences, in respect\nof each other, and in respect of the sentence being served.Once the\nappropriate consecutive sentences were individually determined, they could be\nviewed in their totality, and if appropriate, reduced to a single global\nsentence that effected justice in all the circumstances.[13]That approach was not employed,\nand the brief reasons preceding the imposition of sentence make no mention of\nthe totality principle or its implication in the sentencing process.[14]The sentence did not impart to the respondent the critical lesson that\noffenders must not breach court orders, or their undertakings to the court,\nwhile on release.This is of particular concern in cases involving domestic\nviolence where the breaches involve repetition and escalation of the very\nconduct for which the offender was arrested:See R. v. Bates.[3]An offender who perpetuates domestic\nviolence in repeated and flagrant disregard of court orders should expect some\nexacerbation, rather than moderation, in sentence.[15]The appeal is allowed and a 24-month\nsentence for the predicate assaults is substituted.It shall be served\nconsecutively to the sentence imposed in Provincial Court.It comprises a\nsentence of 18 months for Count #4, and a sentence of 6 months for Count #1,\nconsecutive to each other, and consecutive to the sentence being served.[16]The sentence of 6 months,\nconcurrent, on Count #3, (s. 145(3)) will remain unchanged.We would\nordinarily have made this sentence consecutive as well.In leaving that aspect\nundisturbed, it is intended to give some recognition to the fact that the respondent’s\npenitentiary term will offer suitable programming and meaningful prospects for\nrehabilitation.[1]\n(1994), 1994 CanLII 4622 (SK CA), 125 Sask.

It was alleged and admitted that on June 7, 2011, he robbed Afsaneh\nAghajani, a bank teller, and Roberta Boughton, an innocent cyclist, outside the\nbank. He had in his possession a knife for the purpose of committing an offence.Issue[2]The issue on sentence is whether I should\nimpose a penitentiary sentence in the range of three years as submitted by the\nCrown or whether I should impose a sentence of time served as submitted by the\nDefence. In addition, Defence Counsel submitted I ought to consider enhanced\ncredit for pre-trial detention while the Crown argued that would be\ninappropriate. Even though Busch consented to his detention, Crown Counsel submitted\nthat had he conducted a bail hearing he likely would have been detained because\nof his record. Defence Counsel submitted that with an appropriate plan and because\nof recent gaps in his record, he may have been eligible for release.[3]Busch has been in pre-trial detention since\nJune 7, 2011, a period of one year and one month or 13 months as of today’s\ndate.[4]Both Crown and Defence Counsel clearly\narticulated their respective positions about the appropriate sanction. Even\nthough the ranges of sentence being proposed were quite disparate their\nsubmissions were very helpful. I was referred to jurisprudence which was said\nto support their respective positions. In addition to Counsel’s submissions I\nhad Busch’s Criminal Record to consider, a Pre-Sentence Report, a Psychiatric\nReport and Update, a letter from Sound Times Support Services and a Victim\nImpact Statement.Facts[5]At approximately 10 a.m. on June 7, 2011, Busch\nentered the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce at 245 Carlton St., Toronto,\nwearing a baseball cap on his head, a hoodie over that, gloves on his hands and\nsunglasses. He bypassed the customer line and went directly behind a teller’s\nwicket. He approached the teller demanding money and brandished a knife while\ndoing so. He stated, \"you have 3 seconds to give me money or I will\nstab you\". As he counted to three the teller opened the drawer and Busch\nremoved a quantity of cash and placed it in a bag.[6]Busch fled the bank followed by a bank\ncustomer. Busch approached a cyclist, and demanded her bicycle. When she refused,\nhe knocked her off and tried to take the bike. Busch then approached another\ncyclist who he knocked from her bike and a struggle ensued. He then grabbed a\ncab and threatened to stab the driver if he did not drive away. Busch then got\nout of the cab. The customer who initially followed Busch from the bank hailed\na police cruiser and identified Busch. He was arrested shortly thereafter and found\nin position of $5100.Criminal Antecedents[7]There are 22 discrete entries on Busch’s criminal\nrecord between 1981 and 2009. He was convicted of 95 offences during that\nperiod. The vast majority are property related and include 64 convictions for\nbreak and enter, ten for theft, five for possession of stolen property and one\nfor possession of house-breaking instruments for a total of 80.There are nine\nconvictions for breaches of bail and or probation. There are three convictions\nfor unlawfully at large and escape lawful custody. He has a single conviction\nfor obstruct police and very recently, two convictions for uttering threats.[8]There were no convictions registered for the\nyears 1985, 1988 to 1989, 1998, 2000 to 2001, 2003 to 2004 and 2006 to 2008.[9]In 1987, Busch was sentence to two years for\nthree theft charges. In 1990, he was sentence again to two years for 14 break and\nenter charges. In 1991, he was given a consecutive 18-month sentence to time being\nserved for six break and enter charges. After being released on statutory\nrelease in 1992, he was recommitted as a parole violator in 1993. In 1994, he\nreceived an 11-month sentence for break and enter, which was consecutive to\ntime being served. In 1996, he was sentence to two years less a day in addition\nto 13 weeks of pre-trial detention. These appear to be the longest sentences\nimposed.[10]Since 1999, there has been an apparent\ndecline in the number of convictions and shorter and less intrusive sentences have\nbeen imposed. There are only three discrete entries consisting of 20\nconvictions including seven break and enter offences , two theft charges, two\npossession of stolen property offences, two threatening charges and seven\noffences relating to breaches of bail and or probation. The only actual jail sentences\nimposed was one of nine months in 2005 for break and enter offences. In 2009,\nthe last entry on his record prior to the commission of the index offences s , he\nwas granted a conditional sentence of six months. This related to two offences\nof uttering threats and a breach of probation. These are the only offence of\nviolence on his record until the commission of the index offences s s.Jurisprudence Relied Upon by the Crown and the Defence[11]While the Crown acknowledged that Busch had a\nvery difficult and traumatized life, it was submitted that his chronic recidivism,\npoor response to supervision in the past and the element of planning and\ndeliberation involved in the commission of the index offences s meant that the\nCourt ought to emphasize denunciation and deterrence in determining a fit\nsentence.[12]I was referred to several trial judgments\nwhich were upheld on appeal in support of the general proposition that robbery\nwas a serious offence of violence which in most circumstances demanded the\nimposition of a penitentiary sentence.[13]In Slater, [2008] O.J.No 4519, the\n37-year-old accused was found guilty of robbery after a trial. Slater told a\nteller he had a gun and she complied with his demand for money.Slater had an\nupbringing characterized by physical abuse. He left school after grade nine and\nengaged in substance abuse from age 12 onward. He was addicted to opiates. Slater\nhad an extensive criminal record that included nine robberies, and seven bank\nrobberies.He was sentenced to 8.5 years imprisonment. On appeal at [2010]\nO.J.No. 2143, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the sentence as being measured\nand, indeed, observed it was within the range suggested by trial counsel.[14]Counsel to Busch distinguished this case on\nthe basis that there was no mitigating guilty plea, no psychiatric issues and\nSlater had a significant prior record including nine robberies.[15]In Wolynec, 2005 CarwellOnt 10269,\nthe accused was convicted after trial of seven bank robberies and one attempt\nrobbery. The robberies occurred within a short time period in 2001-2002 and\ntypically involved the presentation of a hold-up note to a teller indicating that\nhe had a gun. Wolynec was almost 52 years of age with a lengthy criminal\nhistory of some 70-odd convictions dating back to when he was 16 years old. He\nhad spent most of his adult life in custody. Wolynec had serious health\nproblems including hepatitis B, C, and D, as well as cirrhosis of the liver.[16]While noting, Wolynec had a myriad of\nproblems that placed him at high risk of re-offending, including a lengthy\ncriminal record, his antisocial personality disorder, problems with drugs and\nalcohol, the trial judge concluded that his most pronounced problem was the\ndegree of institutionalization that has occurred due to the amount of timehe\nhad spent been in prison.[17]A total sentence of 13 years imprisonment\nwas imposed. The Ontario Court of Appeal, at 2007 CarswellOnt 7734, noted that\nWolynec extensive criminal record included a ten-year sentence for bank\nrobberies. In upholding the sentence as being proportional, the Court of Appeal\nmentioned the regrettable circumstances of Wolynec’s institutionalization and\nthe fact he was a risk to reoffend.[18]Busch’s Counsel submitted that his client’s\nrisk of reoffending contrasted sharply with the assessment about Wolynec’s\nlikelihood to reoffend.As was the case in Slater, Wolynec did not have\nthe benefit of a guilty plea to which Busch was entitled. Moreover, Busch was\nnot institutionalized. For the past 16 year or so, he has only been in jail for\na relatively short period of time and he has supported a family.[19]In Lascelle 2006 CarswellOnt 7250, the\naccused pled guilty to four bank robberies, two at the same bank but involving\nfour different tellers, who were all traumatized. It appeared that Lascelle was\nmotivated to commit these offences to relieve his financial pressure or\nobligations. A sentence of four years was imposed without any credit for dead\ntime nor was there any mention of any criminal antecedents.[20]Defence counsel submitted that there was no\ndirect evidence by way of victim impact statement that the teller robbed by\nBusch was traumatized. Crown Counsel submitted that could be inferred. Defence\nCounsel pointed to the fact that Roberta Boughton was relatively circumspect\nabout the impact this offence had on her. I took from his submission that it\nwould be speculative if not dangerous to draw an inference that the teller in\nthis case was traumatized without the benefit of a victim impact statement or\nother direct evidence.[21]In Cotterell 2003 CarswellOnt6288, the\naccused plead guilty to the offence of robbery and admitted he walked up to a bank\nteller and handed her a note which indicated he had a weapon and that he wanted\nmoney. It was not clear whether the note referred to a gun. He was wearing a\nhooded sweatshirt at the time. The teller suffered from post-traumatic stress\ndisorder and nightmares. The Crown sought a sentence in the range of three\nyears, which was at the upper limit of the two- to three-year range suggested\nby the defence. It was acknowledged that the motivation for the robbery was\nsimply greed. Cotterell used the money to purchase electronic equipment and\nfood. While a Criminal Record was filed, there was little reference to its specific\ncontents other than an acknowledgment that it was starting to grow.It did not\ninclude any previous convictions for robbery.[22]Counsel distinguished Cotterell on\nthe basis that there was no mental health concern as there is in this case and\nno evidence that the teller was traumatized.As well, and, no less significant,\nwas the fact that the motivation for Cotterell offence was simply greed whereas\nBusch’s motivation, albeit misguided, was to find money to support his child’s\nrequirement for dental surgery. While Defence Counsel argued that Busch moral\nblameworthiness was less than Cotterells’, the Crown submitted that a financial\nmotivation to commit the offence for whatever reason ought not to diminish\nBusch’s level of culpability to any great extent.[23]Finally, the Crown relied upon a case called\nKaddoura, [2001] O.J.No. 3687, where the accused entered a bank wearing\na mask. He threatened a teller with violence and indicated he had a bomb in his\npocket. Kaddoura had a previous conviction for assault and a psychiatric\nillness. He was also addicted to cocaine. The Ontario Court of Appeal, at\n[2003] O.J.No. 224, upheld a 30-month sentence and in a brief endorsement observed\nthat the trial judge was correct in imposing a sentence ...to reflect this\nsociety’s repulsion and disapproval of the conduct committed by the accused.\nIn assessing Kaddoura’s level of culpability, the trial judge relied upon the\noffender’s degree of planning and deliberation, which was reflected by the fact\nthat he wore a hood and pantyhose as well as the fact that he appeared to have\nbomb.[24]Busch’s Counsel distinguished Kaddoura, in\npart, on the basis that the level of planning in that case was more extensive\nand that Busch’s planning was minimal and without deliberation. Moreover, in Counsel’s\nsubmission the trial judge emphasized the fact that Kaddoura had made a bomb. Counsel\nsubmitted that the existence of a bomb posed a significantly greater threat to\nthe public at large than a knife.[25]Busch’s Counsel referred to a series of case\nthat included: Strelocke, [2009] O.J.No. 2796; Perez, [1999]\nO.J.No. 559; Vaillancourt, [1999] O.J.No. 2502 and Lyn [2007]\nO.J.No. 3380 for the proposition that a penitentiary sentence is not required\nin all cases of bank robberies. The Crown submitted that in all these cases a\ndeparture from the normal penitentiary range of sentence was likely justified\nbecause the offender had no record or a minor one. Busch in the Crown’s\nsubmission could not rely on that mitigating circumstance.[26]To a great extent Counsel to Busch framed\nhis submission in the context of the Ontario Court of Appeal’s comments in Robinson,\n[1974] O.J. No. 545. At paragraph 18 Brooke J.A. speaking for the Court talked\nabout the difficulty of applying the principle of deterrence or punishing\noffenders with mental illness. While the emphasis must be on the protection of\nthe public, where the offender poses a danger to the community that protection\nmay be first achieved by curing the offender.[27]Defence Counsel pointed out that the Ontario\nCourt of Appeal reaffirmed this notion in Batisse, 2009 ONCA 114 (CanLII), [2009] O.J.No. 452 at\npara 38, where it was held that deterrence and punishment assume less\nimportance where the offender’s mental health problems played a central role in\nthe commission of the offence. Counsel submitted that Dr. Colleton’s assessment\nconfirmed that Busch’s mental health issues were a contributing factor in the\ncommission of the offences before the Court.[28]To the point of the proportionality enquiry,\nthe Court in Batisse held that severe punishment of persons with mental\nillnesses would be disproportionate to their degree of responsibility. E.E.\nGillese J.A writing for the Court in Batisse at para 38wrote: In\nsuch circumstances, the primary concern in sentencing shifts from deterrence to\ntreatment as that is the best means of ensuring the protection of the public\nand that the offending conduct is not repeated. This is especially so where a\nlengthy prison term may be regarded as counterproductive.[29]While Busch’s Counsel submitted that this\nwas precisely the approach to be taken in the matter before this Court, Crown\nCounsel pointed to the failure of Busch to consistently take his medication and\nhis failure to see ortake the advice of psychiatristsshould not instill\nconfidence that the could be treated effectively in the community.Victim Impact Statement of Roberta Boughton[30]The victim impact statement of Roberta\nBoughton indicated that being attacked out on the street, in broad daylight was\nsomewhat traumatic. Immediately after the incident, she experienced an increase\nin her anxiety and stress levels. Her heightened sense of vulnerability and\narousal lasted for hours and made it difficult to focus on her job. She also felt\nless trusting and secure while riding her bike but it did not approach anything\nlike the level of post-trauma stress disorder. She had no fear about future\ncontact, which I took to mean with the offender. Boughton did not suffer any\ninjury or financial loss.[31]Boughton also reflected on the experience of\nthe crime itself, as she put it. She recalled the agitated and disjointed\neffort of the offender to stop vehicles and climb into them. She commented on\nthe fact that the offender stayed so long on the scene that the police were\nable to arrest him without much investigation. From her perspective, the\noffender had no escape plan and was simply acting on impulse. She thought with\nsadness that the offender likely had mental health and addiction issues.[32]Boughton indicated that she never felt she\nwas in any personal danger because the offender was not aggressive apart from\npushing her bike over and he showed no weapon nor did he utter any threats.[33]The bank teller did not provide a victim\nimpact statement but the Crown submitted it was a reasonable inference to draw at\nthe very least that she was frightened and terrified by the experience.Report of Dr. Colleton[34]Dr. Colleton is a forensic psychiatrist and\nhas been a part-time member of the medical staff at CAMH since July 2002. He\nalso holds a lecturing position at the University of Toronto and is a\nconsulting psychiatrist to the Roy McMurtry Youth Centre in Brampton and the\nCanadian Mental Health Association in Peel Region. He has appeared before the\nConsent and Capacity Board, the Ontario Review Board and Old City Hall Mental\nHealth Court. He has a broad experience conducting court-ordered evaluations or\nassessments, assessing criminal responsibility and fitness to stand trial.[35]Dr. Colleton was retained to provide a\npsychiatric diagnosis, the possible contribution of a psychiatric disorder to\nBusch’s actions on June 7, 2011, treatment recommendations related to his\nrelease and a risk assessment for violence. The report is extensive and very\nthorough.[36]At the time of Dr. Colleton’s interview, Busch\nwas 47 years old. Following his arrest and detention, Busch experienced severe\ndepression and lost 30 pounds within two weeks. He was prescribed\nanti-depressant medication. He has been in protective custody primarily because\nof his macular degeneration. He has suffered about 75% visual loss and is\nlegally blind. He cannot read or write as a consequence. In addition to anti-depressant\nmedication, he is on a daily dose of methadone for opioid addiction and takes\ncholesterol medication.[37]He apparently met with a psychiatrist for\nthe first time about 15 years ago. He was referred for the purpose of dealing\nwith his sexual abuse history and ongoing anger problems. He also dealt with\nthose issues on at least two occasions when he was incarcerated at the Ontario\nCorrectional Institute or OCI in Brampton in the 1990’s. Dr. Colleton noted\nwith some irony that Busch was in custody at OCI with Gordon Stuckless.\nStuckless, a former employee of Maple leaf Gardens, along with John Paul Roby\nhad sexually molested a number of young boys. Busch was one of John Paul Roby's\nvictims when he was 12 years old. Stuckless was sentenced to custody in 1997. Busch\nwas incarcerated with him and actually met with Stuckless. He found the\nconfrontation helpful and somewhat of a turning point in his life. Dr. Colleton\nnoted at page 4 of his report that ....following this incarceration, Mr.\nBusch was out of custody for most of the next 16 years, with few legal\nproblems, in contrast to the prior 16 years. That observation is borne out\nby his Criminal Record as already noted.[38]Dr. Colleton noted that Busch had\nexperienced a number of traumatic episodes over the course of his life. Not\nonly was he sexually abused by John Paul Roby at age 12,on two occasions he\nwitnessed physical violence by his father as a young child and found his father\ndead (apparently by suicide) when he was six years of age. At age 22, he\nwitnessed a cellmate who hung himself and who he unsuccessfully tried to\nrevive. He also witnessed an inmate stabbed through the throat. Not\ninsignificantly, Busch was the victim of an anal rape while in custody. Busch\nbelieves that the molestation by Roby had the worst impact on his life. He\nturned to drugs to deal with the emotional fallout from those events.[39]Counsel to Busch referred the Court to the\nreasons for sentence in R. v. Roby, [2000] O.J.No. 5868 and, in\nparticular, the review of Dr. Voysey’s evidence at paras. 141 to 145. Dr.\nVoysey described the first direct impact on Roby’s 13 victims as simple stress.\nThe next direct effect was the syndrome called post-traumatic stress disorder. He\ntestified that this often involved flashbacks. In addition, the victims\nexperienced a group of conditions known as adjustment disorders, depressed\nmood, chronic depression and chronic anxiety over years. While not making a\ndiagnosis of each victim, Dr. Voysey indicated that these facets of\npost-traumatic stress disorder were strikingly present in the statement of\nfacts relied upon in Roby and manifested in quite a few of the victim\nimpact statements.[40]Dr. Colleton examined the possibility of\nwhether Busch’s traumatic life experiences and, in particular, the attacks by\nRoby met the criteria of post-traumatic stress disorder. While he could not\nconclude he met that criteria in full, he expressed the opinion that he has\nsome trauma-related symptomatology, including intrusive memories and dreams of\nhis sexual abuse, a non-specific sense of insecurity and dreams about the\nstabbing and hanging of inmates.[41]Dr. Voysey also described drug and alcohol\naddiction as one of the direct life effects on Roby’s victims. Dr. Colleton\nconducted an extensive review of Busch’s drug and alcohol use and concluded\nthat he had an extensive history of intravenous drug use during his adolescence\nwhen he used OTC stimulant medication and cocaine. He also noted that Busch\nalso used cocaine intravenously between 2003 and 2005 when he was primarily\nusing crack cocaine. Busch, according to Dr. Colleton, attributes many of his\nlegal problems to his drug use. As well, it had a deleterious effect on his school,\nhis employment and his health. In particular, he contracted Hepatitis C because\nof his intravenous drug use. Dr. Colleton concluded that Busch has had a\nsignificant and longstanding history of substance abuse. He met the criteria\nfor cocaine dependency in the past and his use of prescription medication met\nthe criteria for opioid dependence, which is currently being treated with\nmethadone. That said, Dr. Colleton observed that substance abuse has not been a\nsignificant issue in the years prior to his arrest in June 2011 and the only\ncurrent technical issue is his opioid dependence.[42]Dr. Voysey was also cited in Roby at\npara. 144 for the proposition that there is a strong, positive correlation\nbetween sexual abuse and subsequent depression, although he could not say it\nwas provable as causal. Dr. Colleton indicated that Busch considered depression\na greater problem than his drug abuse. According to Dr. Colleton, Busch\ngreatest period of depression was in late 2010 and early 2011. Dr. Colleton\nwrote at page 6 of his report that Busch’s ... mood was very depressed and\nhe felt like he had nothing left in life. He had no appetite and was losing\nweight. He felt sluggish and unmotivated. He was sleeping more than normal. His\nthinking felt slowed. He was suicidal at one point and thought about jumping in\nfront of a subway train.[43]Dr. Colleton saw Busch regarding his\neligibility for Mental Health Diversion at Old City Hall Court on April 20,\n2011, a few weeks prior to the robbery offences. He was accepted into the\nprogram. He learned after his interview with Dr. Colleton that his eye\ncondition was worst than previously diagnosed and he likely would become blind.\nAccording to Dr. Colleton, Busch became quite depressed and experienced\nsuicidal thoughts. He was not working or doing anything constructive or\nstructured with his time and he did not see a psychiatrist or start taking anti-depressant\nmedication as Dr. Colleton recommended.[44]Dr. Colleton concluded that Busch likely\nsuffers from a major depressive disorder. He identified the onset of this\ncondition in adolescence. He noted that his depression has likely been affected\nby alcohol and drugs use as well as life stressors, such as incarceration. On\nthe other hand, abstinence from drug and alcohol use, treatment with anti-depressant\nmedication and his relationship with his children has had a positive influence.[45]Dr. Voysey was also cited at para. 145 in Roby\nabout indirect effects of sexual abuse on relationships and lack of self-confidence.\nIn Dr. Colleton’s review of Busch relationship history, he indicated that Busch\nconsiders that his depression has contributed to problems in his relationship\nwith Tracy Cameron with whom he has had three children. When depressed he often\ndid not communicate or left the family home for days at a time. Dr. Colleton’s\ninterview with Cameron confirmed that Busch’s depression and drug use had a\nnegative impact on their relationship. She also confirmed that two days prior\nto his arrest on the index offences s, Busch learned he was legally blind.[46]Busch apparently suffers from anxiety and\ndepression and has over the years experienced panic attacks. Dr. Colleton,\nhowever, concluded that the attacks were not severe enough to support a\ndiagnosis of a panic disorder nor was there any evidence he suffered from a\ngeneralized anxiety disorder. He suffers from some suicidal ideation but Dr.\nColleton described it as relatively infrequent and superficial except for one\noccasion in 2010 when he contemplated jumping in front of a subway as a result\nof being charged with shoplifting.[47]Even though Busch described his memory as\npoor, Dr. Colleton found that he had very good recall for details about various\naspects of his history.[48]Busch has apparently suffered from gout for\nthe past 20 years and has a coronary artery disease, which was identified after\na heart attack at age 38. He has had a successful angioplasty with no adverse\nsymptoms. As previously mentioned he has hepatitis C, which was caused by\nintravenous drug use, which was diagnosed 22 years ago. As well, he suffers\nfrom macular degeneration and asteroid strikes, which were diagnosed six years\nago.[49]While he was not prepared to diagnose Busch\nas having a full personality disorder, Dr. Colleton formed the opinion that\nBusch had some maladaptive personality traits including occasional suicidal\nideation, a sense of emptiness and occasional impulsivity. He wrote at page 25\nto 26 of his report that Busch’s ...antisocial personality traits are\nlimited mainly to recurrent arrests, primarily for property related offences\nand some degree of impulsivity and irresponsibility.[50]Dr. Colleton was clear that at the time of\nthe index offencesBusch retained the capacity to know that his actions were\nboth morally and legally wrong. That said, Dr. Colleton at page 26 of his\nreport wrote that Busch ...suffers from a major depressive disorder but was\nuntreated prior to the index offencesand was quite depressed at that time.\nHis depression likely contributed in a non-specific fashion to his\ndecision-making and the impulsive nature of his actions, although stress and\npersonality factors were contributory as well. In response to the Court’s\nconcern about what Dr. Colleton was actually saying, Counsel arranged for a\nsupplemental report to be filed with the Court. In the supplemental report, he\ndescribed the various symptoms of depression and wrote that he did not ...think\nit’s reasonable to conclude that his depression was non-contributory. He\nwent on to explain that it was contributory in a less concrete fashion than in\nan NCR situation. While acknowledging there was some degree of speculation in\ntrying to articulate the role that his depression played in the commission of\nthe index offences , Dr. Colleton suggested the following as a reasonable\nhypothesis: Buschhas struggled over many hears to be a good provider to\nhis family. In 2011, prior to this offence, he was dealing with significant\nhealth concerns (progressive visual loss most significantly) that would further\ndiminish his capabilities. He then learned that one of his children required\nexpensive dental surgery. Without in any way excusing his actions, the robbery\nimpressed as an impulsive and desperate act intended to address what probably felt\nlike an overwhelming situation at the time. His depression likely amplified his\nfeelings of failure and poor self-worth; diminished his ability to think\nthrough the key consequences of his actions; and rendered him more likely to\nsee a desperate act as reasonable in the moment. He may not have really thought\nabout the likely outcomes at the time and if he had, he may have been more\nlikely to dismiss them out a sense of hopelessness and pessimism.[51]Dr. Colleton concluded that despite his long\nhistory of criminal activity that Busch was not substantially an anti-social\nindividual. Having regard to the fact that the vast majority of Busch’s\noffences were property related, Dr. Colleton concluded that the index offences s\nwere outliers. The only other violence on his record was convictions for\nuttering threats, which occurred in the context of his belief that the victim\nhad sexually assaulted his daughter. Having conducted risk assessment\nevaluations and even though his score on one of those test was moderately high,\nhe concluded that Busch was a relatively low risk for violent re-offence.[52]Dr. Colleton had a number of recommendations\nabout how this risk could best be managed in the community.Pre-Sentence Report[53]Under the heading Character/Behaviour/Attitude,\nthe probation officer wrote: The subject also presented as sad, pathetic,\npassive and helpless. The offender presented as an individual that has been\nvictimized so many times that he has lost the ability to assert himself in a\nproductive pro-social manner.[54]The report also described Busch as a chronic\nrecidivist and stated the obvious, that previous community supervision did not\nappear effective or instructive.[55]In all other respect, the report mirrors the\ninformation that was provided by Dr. Colleton about Busch’s background and\ncircumstances although not in as much detail. The information provided by Busch\nto the probation officer is consistent with the information he provided to Dr.\nColleton.Letter from Sound Times Support Service[56]Sound Time Support Service, a community\nsupport group funded by the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care, provided a\nletter of support in which it was indicated that Busch came to their\norganization in March 2011 seeking help. Busch has applied for housing and the\nletter indicated that upon his release they are prepared to assist in finding\nsecure housing for him. The probation officer who spoke with Charlie Boyer, a\ncommunity service worker and the author of the letter from Sound Times Support\nService, expressed the belief that Busch committed the index offences s because\nhe was severely depressed and felt that he was desperate. Dr. Colleton\nconfirmed in a brief letter he had from Charles Boyer that Busch self-reported\na diagnosis of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder when he approached\ntheir organization in March 2011.The Principles of Sentencing[57]The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v.\nIpeelee, 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII), [2012] S.C.J. No. 13 at para. 36 has recently reaffirmed that ...the\nfundamental principle of sentencing is that the sentence must be proportionate\nto the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\nWhatever weight is given to other objectives and principles of sentence\noutlined in the Criminal Code ...the resulting sentence must respect\nthe fundamental principle of proportionality. A sentence that reflects the\ngravity of the offence is closely tied to denunciation, justice for victims and\nthe confidence of the public in the criminal justice system. That said, a\nproportional sentence should not exceed that which is appropriate having regard\nto the moral blameworthiness of the offender. This second aspect of\nproportionality serves as a restraining or limiting mechanism and is designed\nto provide justice to the offender. Neither aspect of the proportionality\nenquiry is elevated at the expense of the other. See: Ipeelee, supra at\npara.37.[58]Indeed, the notion of restraint in\nsentencing has particular significance where incarceration is a potential\ndisposition. Restraint not only means that imprisonment is a sanction of last\nresort but it also means that the sentencing court should seek the least\nintrusive and least quantum which will achieve the overall purpose of being an\nappropriate and just sanction.See: R. v. Hamilton, 2004 CanLII 5549 (ON CA), [2004] O.J.No. 3252\n(Ont.C.A.) at para.95.[59]In Ipeelee, which dealt principally\nwith Gladue principles, the Supreme Court reiterated that sentencing\njudges are not prevented from considering background or systemic factors or\nalternative approaches to sentencing for non-aboriginal offenders and that sentencing\nis an individualized process. Therefore, the parity principle is not to be\napplied in a formalistic way and operates only to reduce disparities that\ncannot be justified. The Supreme Court indicated …that a sanction that takes\naccount of the underlying causes of the criminal conduct may be more\nappropriate than one only aimed at punishment. See:Ipeelee, supra,\nat para.73. The Court also adopted the following language of Professor Quigley\nin relation to the principle of parity …uniformity hides inequity, impedes\ninnovation and locks the system in its mindset of jail. See: Ipeelee,\nsupra, at para. 79. The idea that systems often finds itself locked in a\nmindset of jail has itself become a formalistic approach when sentencingrepeated offenders and I take from the Supreme Court direction in Ipeelee\nthat the sentencing court ought to resist the knee jerk temptation to impose jail\nwithout regard to the idea, also expressed in Ipeelee, that imprisonment\nmay not be conducive to individual and social healing,[60]Justice Doherty\nnoted in Hamilton, supra, that ...the gravity of the offence may\npoint in a different sentencing direction than the culpability of the\nindividual offender. (See: para. 93).In this context there must be a\nbalancing of both sides of the proportionality enquiry recognizing that factors\nwhich mitigate the offender’s culpability may require more emphasis than\nfactors that emphasize the gravity of the offence and vice versa. Fixing a sentence that is consistent with Section 718.1 is\nparticularly difficult where the gravity of the offence points strongly in one\nsentencing direction and the culpability of the individual offender points\nstrongly in a very different sentencing direction.The sentencing judge must\nfashion a disposition from among the limited options available, which take both\nsides of the proportionality inquiry into account.As indicated in R. v.\nPriest (1996), 1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA), 110\nC.C.C. (3d) 289 at 297 ((Ont.C.A.) ...factors which may accentuate the gravity of the crime cannot\nblind the trial judge to factors mitigating personal responsibility. Equally,\nfactors mitigating personal responsibility cannot justify a disposition that\nunduly minimizes the seriousness of the crime committed. See: Hamilton,\nsupra, at para. 93.[61]Background or systemic factors relating to a\nparticular offender may reduce or diminish his or her level of culpability. The\nmoral blameworthiness, for example, of offenders suffering from mental illness\nis significantly reduced because the offender is viewed as less reprehensible.\nSee: R. v. Pegg (1987), 24 O.A.C. 74 (OCA). Offenders with\nmental health issues often cope poorly in prison. See:R. v. Brown\n(1972), 8 C.C.C. (2d) 13 (Ont. C.A.) and a reduced sentence may ensure that the\noffender receives needed psychiatric treatment.See: R. v. Wallace (1973),\n11 C.C.C. (2d) 95 (Ont.C.A.). The principles of general and specific deterrence\nhave at least reduced significance if no relevance at all. See: R. v. Robinson (1974), 19\nC.C.C. (2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Valiquette (1990), 1990 CanLII 3048 (QC CA), 60 C.C.C. (3d)\n325 (Que. C.A.).Sentence[62]Robbery is a very serious offence largely\nbecause it involves the threat or actual application of violence in the course\nof stealing from the victim. Bank robberies tend to be regarded as more serious\nthan robberies of individuals or small commercial businesses and as a class attract\nsome of the highest sentences for this offence. Despite the general seriousness\nwith which bank robberies are regarded the courts nonetheless remain responsive\nto individual circumstances and in the past when such orders were available for\nthese type of offences, conditional sentence have been imposed.[63]This is a particular difficult case in which\nto fashion a fit sanction having regard to my conclusion that the gravity of\nthe offences points in a different sentence direction than the moral\nblameworthiness of Busch.[64]Busch’s lengthy record is at first blush an\naggravating factor in my sentence analysis. In that context, I am aware that it\nis the practise to punish repeat or persistent offenders more severely than\nthose who have not previously offended. In R. v. McArthur 2004 CanLII 8759 (ON CA), [2004],\nO.J.No. 721, the Ontario Court of Appeal noted that a lengthy record was\nusually indicative of a person who was a danger to the public, which usually\nresults in a heavier sentence. That said, the length of the record, however, is\nnot everything and the Court has to assess the seriousness of the record by the\nlength of sentences imposed in the past and, in particular, the length of\nsentence imposed for similar offences committed in the past. A pattern of\nsimilar offences committed in the past can be indicative of an offender\ndedicated to a life of crime and therefore more of a danger because previous\nattempts to deal with the individual have failed.[65]Busch, of course, has no prior convictions\nfor robbery. Indeed, he has no prior convictions for violence save for two\ncounts of threatening which occurred in the context of a mistaken belief that\nthe victim had sexually assaulted one of his children.There is nothing about\nhis criminal antecedents from which one could reasonably infer a life dedicated\nto violent crime and the use of force. Indeed, Dr. Colleton has indicated, as I\nhave already noted in these reasons, that Busch is at a relatively low risk to\nreoffend violently. I accept that opinion. Indeed, the resort to the use of\nviolence would appear to be of out of character and I likewise accept Dr.\nColleton’s observation that Busch’s conduct in relation to the index offenceswas\nmore likely an impulsive response to feelings of desperation fuelled by his\ndepression.[66]While Busch has a lengthy criminal record\nand has served significant periods of time in jail for break and enter, I think\nit can be said that his criminal activity over a period of 16 years prior to\nthe commission of the index offences s has decreased significantly both in\nterms of the nature of offences committed and the sentences imposed. Indeed, as\npreviously noted, there are only three discrete entries out of 22 since 1997.\nClearly, the frequency of offences being committed dropped drastically in that\nperiod and the only period of actual imprisonment imposed was one of nine months\nin 2005. Even the most hardened cynic would acknowledge that there has been a\nsteady decline in criminogenic behaviour and the commission of the index\noffences s stands out in stark contrast to the pattern of behaviour established\nover that 16-year period.[67]I do not conclude on this record that Busch\nis more of a danger because previous efforts to deal with Busch have failed and\nI find that the steady decline in the commission of offences has a mitigating\neffect. On the totality of the evidence, I find the robberies to be isolated\nand impulsive acts and they do not fit neatly into any relevant pattern\nestablished by his prior record of criminal conduct.[68]There is little doubt in my mind that Busch’s\nsexual victimization at the age of 12 has had a profound impact on his sense of\nself and wellbeing. Add to that experience the further trauma he experienced in\njail, there can be little doubt that any mortal could survive without damage.\nLikewise, I am satisfied that his victimization led directly to substance abuse\nwhich further impaired his ability to function as a law abiding member of the\ncommunity. He has in later years suffered a heart attack, been diagnosed with\nhepatitis C and is now said to be legally blind. Dr. Colleton has diagnosed\nBusch as suffering from a major depressive disorder. Considering the history of\nsexual and physical abuse, his substance abuse issues, and his mental health\ndiagnosis, I am satisfied that his level of moral blameworthiness is\nsignificantly diminished.[69]I am mindful that there were aspect of his\nconduct that suggested a degree of planning but I find that there was little deliberation.\nI find support for that conclusion in Dr. Colleton’s opinion. His conduct is\nmore consistent with being impulsive, as Dr. Colleton suggested, than being an act\nof considered deliberation. This context lessens his level of moral\nblameworthiness.[70]While the author of the Pre-Sentence Report did\nnot consider Busch a good candidate for community supervision, I find that Dr.\nColleton’s assessment of Busch’s ability to respond to community supervision\nmore nuanced and positive. Indeed, Busch’s efforts to deal with his issue of\nsexual and substance abuse offer some reasonable prospects that with proper\ncommunity support he can manage, if not overcome, many of the issues he faces.\nIt is not insignificant, in my view, that when he met Gordon Stuckless he had a\nminor breakthrough in dealing with his victimization by Roby. As I read Dr. Colleton’s\nreport and Busch’s response to that encounter, it represented a turning point\nin Busch’s life and for the better part of the next 16 years, he had fewer and\nless significant encounters with the criminal justice system. Likewise\nsubstance abuse and, in particular, cocaine use has not been an issue for many\nyears. Indeed, as Dr. Colleton pointed out, his only real issue at this time is\nopioid dependence and is currently in ongoing methadone treatment to deal with\nthat issue.[71]Notwithstanding the commission of very\nserious index offences s and the existence of a long record of convictions, I\nam satisfied on the totality of the evidence that Busch is a good candidate for\nreform.The principle of rehabilitation remains important, particularly when\nthe principles of denunciation, deterrence and separation do not trump the\nlong-term requirements of community safety, as best ensured by the\nrehabilitation of an individual. Given the isolated nature of the index\noffences s, albeit grave, given the level of declining criminal activity over\nthe past 16 years, given the reasonable prospect of Busch responding to\ncommunity supervision and support, and given his diminished level of\nculpability, the gravity of the offence does not displace leniency to enable\nrehabilitation.Accordingly, when I balance Busch’s diminished level of\nculpability against the gravity of the offences I am persuaded that a sentence\nof time served after giving enhanced credit for pre-trial detention meets the test\nor requirements of proportionality in this case. In these unique circumstances,\nI conclude that the pre-trial custody, about which I will say more in a moment,\nserves the principle of denunciation in this case.[72]Busch has spent 13 months in pre-trial detention,\nwhich is the equivalent of 19 and one half months in pre-trial detention. I\nfind it appropriate on the basis of Johnson to grant enhanced credit.\nWhile there was no indication on the Information that Busch was detained in\ncustody on the basis of his record, I do not accept the argument that because\nof his record, had he not consented to his detention, he likely would have been\ndetained. Given his background as outlined in these reasons and, in particular,\nthe decline in criminal activity in recent years, he may well have been\nreleased had there been a proper plan of release in place.[73]Accordingly, the information will be\nendorsed to reflect the fact that Busch spent 19 and one half months in\npre-trial custody. I am suspending the passing of sentence and placing Busch on\nprobation for a period of three years. He shall report forthwith to the adult\nprobation office and thereafter as directed and be amendable to their supervision.\nBusch shall reside at an address approved by his probation officer and shall\nnot change his residence except with the written permission of his probation officer\nunless he is removed from his residence for cause. Busch shall seek and\nmaintain psychiatric counselling as well as any other form of counselling\nrecommended to him by his probation officer. He shall sign all necessary\nreleases to enable his probation officer to monitor and confirm his attendance and\nparticipation in any form of counselling, treatment or assessment. Busch shall\ntake any anti-depressant medication as prescribed by a qualified physician/psychiatrist\nand shall provide proof that he is doing so to the satisfaction of his\nprobation officer. He shall abstain from the possession, consumption and\npurchase of alcohol and all non-medically prescribed drugs. He shall have no\ncontact directly or indirectly with Afsaneh Aghajani, Roberta Boughton and\nKatherine Easton, nor shall he attend at or be on the premises of the Canadian\nImperial Bank of Commerce located at 245 Carlton Street, in the City of\nToronto. He shall have no weapons in his possession as defined in the Criminal\nCode of Canada.Released:June\n25, 2012Signed:\n“Justice S. Ford Clements”"}

Savage)for the Respondent-and -))Appeal heard andHARVEY JOHN GIESBRECHT)Decision pronounced:)March 1, 2016(Accused)Appellant))Written reasons:)March 18, 2016BURNETT JA(for the\nCourt):[1]The\naccused appeals the sentence imposed following a joint sentence recommendation\n(JSR) that was not accepted by the sentencing judge.Leave to appeal sentence\nand judicial interim release were previously granted by M. A. Monnin JA (2015\nMBCA 88 (CanLII)).[2]The\nappeal was allowed at the conclusion of the hearing on March 1, 2016, with\nbrief reasons to follow.These are those reasons.[3]The\naccused owned a funeral home in Beausejour, Manitoba.Between October 2003 and\nJuly 2009, the accused entered into contracts and received payments for\nprearranged funerals.The monies received by the accused were not placed into\ntrust accounts in accordance with The Prearranged Funeral Services Act,\nCCSM c F200, but were used by him to pay for personal living expenses and\nfuneral arrangements for other individuals (not the 21 victims).The total\namount defrauded was $85,567.72.[4]The\naccused entered guilty pleas to 14 charges of fraud under $5,000 and 7 charges\nof fraud over $5,000.[5]Crown\nand defence counsel jointly recommended a jail sentence of two years less a day\nto be served conditionally in the community, followed by three years of\nsupervised probation (which addressed the accused’s ongoing obligation to pay\nrestitution), and a “freestanding” order of restitution.The sentencing judge\nexpressed concern with the JSR and provided both the Crown and the accused an\nopportunity to submit case law and to make further submissions.[6]Ultimately,\nthe sentencing judge rejected the JSR and sentenced the accused to nine months of\nincarceration followed by two years of supervised probation.The terms of the\nprobation order included:repayment of restitution in the sum of $500 a month\nwhen employed; a requirement to report to Probation Services for any\ncounselling that it might direct; a requirement to notify all prospective\nemployers about his conviction; and an order of restitution in favour of the\nvictims.[7]Shortly\nbefore the hearing of the appeal, the accused filed a motion to introduce fresh\nevidence.Counsel agreed that the Court could review the proposed evidence,\nand, following submissions, a decision on the fresh evidence was reserved, and\nthe appeal was argued.In\nour view, the appeal can be determined without considering the fresh evidence.[8]The\naccused argues that the sentencing judge erred in refusing an adjournment\nrequest (made four days before the second sentencing hearing) and that he erred\nin rejecting the JSR.[9]We\nare not at all persuaded that the sentencing judge erred when he\nrefused the adjournment.The initial request for an adjournment was denied on\nthe basis that the accused’s counsel (not counsel on this appeal) was still on\nthe record.The matter was revisited on the second sentencing date, and the\naccused confirmed that he wanted counsel of record “to continue to represent me\nhere this afternoon.”In these circumstances, it can hardly be said that the\nsentencing judge failed to exercise his discretion in a judicial way or that\nthere was a miscarriage of justice.[10]The\nfailure to accept the JSR is more problematic.There is considerable authority\nfrom this Court and others that a sentencing judge should depart from a joint\nsubmission only when there are cogent reasons for doing so (see, for example, R\nv Sharpe (KD), 2009 MBCA 50 (CanLII) at para 19, 240 ManR (2d) 52, quoting R v\nSinclair (EJ), 2004 MBCA 48 (CanLII), 184 ManR (2d) 1).Here the sentencing judge\nappears to have rejected the JSR on the basis that it was not the product of a\ntrue plea bargain because “the quid pro quo is lacking . . . as [the accused]\nwas always intending to plead guilty” and on the basis that the proposed\nsentence was not “appropriate for these crimes.”[11]In\nour view, the sentencing judge erred when he restricted his analysis to the\naccused’s intentions and when he rejected the recommended sentence.[12]Defence\ncounsel did tell the sentencing judge that there were a number of difficulties\nand exigencies with respect to some of the charges but that it was never the\naccused’s position that he would challenge those charges.However counsel also\nsaid that, but for the JSR, the accused would not have entered guilty pleas.[13]Significantly,\nboth Crown and defence counsel made it clear in their sentencing submissions\nthat the Crown anticipated difficulties in prosecuting its case.The Crown\ntold the sentencing judge that it had no sworn video statements from any of the\nvictims, that 3 of the 21 victims had passed away, that it was experiencing\nsome difficulty contacting and obtaining cooperation from the remaining victims\nand that problems had arisen on the part of the police and the Crown in furthering\nboth the investigation and the prosecution.In fact, Crown counsel said, “The\nissue really becomes which counts, how many counts the Crown could make out\nbecause of the passage of time and the deterioration of the case as a result of\nthe passage of time.”[14]Clearly\nthe quid pro quo in this case included the uncertainty of conviction in light\nof the anticipated difficulties in the Crown’s case as well as the opportunity\nto avoid further delay and cost.We would also observe that the JSR was\nnegotiated by experienced and competent counsel and that the JSR contemplated\nan apparently viable plan for restitution (as well as an immediate payment of\n$4,000).[15]For\nthese reasons, we are of the view that the sentencing judge erred when he\nconcluded that the JSR was not the product of a true plea bargain and, in\nparticular, that the quid pro quo was lacking.[16]We\nare also of the view that the sentencing judge erred when he concluded that the\nsentence contemplated by the JSR was not appropriate.It is well established\nthat if the proposed sentence reflected in a true plea bargain falls within the\nrange of sentence established by precedent, it should not be rejected by a\nsentencing judge unless there are cogent reasons for doing so.Here the\nsentencing judge acknowledged that a conditional sentence of two years less a\nday fell within the range of acceptable sentences, but he said that he wanted\n“to send this guy to jail.”In so doing, he erred.[17]In Sinclair,\nSteel JA made it clear that (at para 17):Reasons for departing from the proposed sentence must\nbe more than an opinion on the part of the sentencing judge that the sentence\nwould not be enough.The fact that the crime committed could reasonably\nattract a greater sentence is not alone reason for departing from the proposed\nsentence.And while a conditional\nsentence may fall at the lower end of the range, a more lenient sentence may\nwell be appropriate where an accused forgoes his/her right to trial and enters\na guilty plea, particularly where the Crown’s case has some flaws or weaknesses\n(see Sinclair at para 13).[18]The\nsentencing judge concluded that an institutional sentence was required to send\na message of denunciation and deterrence.We disagree.The JSR contemplated a\njail sentence of two years less a day to be served conditionally in the\ncommunity, with an absolute curfew and significant monthly payments for\nrestitution. As Freedman JA observed in R v Lamirande (D), 2006 MBCA 71 (CanLII),\n205 ManR (2d) 245 (at para 28):It is, by this point, trite to observe that the courts\nin this country have explicitly recognized that an appropriately crafted\nconditional sentence may well satisfy the principles of both denunciation and\ndeterrence (see R. v. Proulx (J.K.D.), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61; 249 N.R. 201;\n142 Man.R. (2d) 161; 212 W.A.C. 161; 2000 SCC 5).There may, of course, be\ncases where the nature of the offence or the circumstances of the offender\nrequire a court to send an offender to jail in order properly and effectively\nto express society’s condemnation, or to achieve the required deterrent effect.There is nothing on the facts here that suggests that in this case these\nobjectives, which could be accomplished by a jail sentence, could not also be\nachieved by a suitably restrictive conditional sentence.Incarceration is not\nnecessary to realize those objectives, having regard to the stringency of the\nconditions that will be imposed.[19]To\nsummarize, the JSR was the product of a true plea bargain, there was a quid pro\nquo and the sentence contemplated by the JSR was within the sentencing range,\nand therefore not unfit.[20]In\nthese circumstances, the appeal must be allowed.The sentence imposed by the\nsentencing judge is replaced with a conditional sentence of 2 years less a day,\nwith credit for time served (42 days) on a 1:1 basis.As we were told at the\nappeal hearing that the accused has paid full restitution, we decline to order\nthe probationary period contemplated by the JSR.[21]In\naddition to the statutory conditions set out in section 742.3(1) of the Criminal\nCode, the following conditions are imposed:1.The accused is to report to his\nsupervisor within 72 hours.2.The accused will reside at the\naddress provided by his counsel to this Court or, with the approval of his\nsupervisor, at another address in the Province of Alberta.3.The accused shall be under house\narrest and bound by an absolute curfew for the duration of the sentence,\nsubject only to the following exceptions:(a)time attending employment and related activities, and\nthe necessary travel time to and from;(b) time attending programs and treatment as directed by\nhis supervisor, and the necessary travel to and from;(c)time attending to necessary medical, dental or legal\nappointments, as may be pre-approved by his supervisor, or attending to\npersonal medical emergencies, and the necessary travel time to and from;(d) three consecutive hours once each week, as\npre-approved by his supervisor, for the purpose of attending to necessities of\nliving; and(e)such other occasions or circumstances as may be\napproved by his supervisor, including time performing community service and\ntime attending such meetings with his supervisor as may be required by his\nsupervisor.4.The accused shall perform 200\nhours of community service within 15 months of today’s date (i.e., March 1,\n2016).5.The accused shall answer the door\nor telephone in response to authorities checking his compliance with house\narrest.6.The accused shall pay a victim\nsurcharge of $200 within 7 days.JAJAJA"}

Perkins, 2015\nONCA 521 (CanLII), 2015 CarswellOnt 10349 (Ont. C.A.). The applicant\nseeks to reopen the sentence appeal on these charges on the basis of a change\nin circumstances that occurred a year after the appeal was adjudicated on the\nmerits. Specifically, the applicant was successful in having convictions for\ndomestic assault and breach of probation x2 overturned in July 2016 (the\n“domestic assault conviction”): R. v. Perkins, 2016\nONCA 588 (CanLII), 2016 CarswellOnt 12019 (Ont.\nC.A.).[2]The applicant argues that this court should find\nthat it has jurisdiction to reopen his sentence appeal on the sexual\nassault/voyeurism conviction and that it is in the interests of justice to\nreopen his sentence appeal, based on the fresh evidence of his domestic assault\nconviction having been quashed. He argues that he should be credited a further\neight months of pre-sentence custody toward his sentence on the sexual\nassault/voyeurism conviction, the portion of his pre-sentence custody which was\nused up on the domestic assault conviction. He further argues that the trial\njudge on the sexual assault/voyeurism case considered the domestic assault\nconviction as an aggravating factor in determining sentence on the sexual\nassault/voyeurism conviction and would have come to a different result, had the\ndomestic assault conviction not been considered.[3]For the reasons set out below, we would dismiss\nthe application to reopen the sentence appeal.B.Facts[4]The applicant was arrested for domestic assault\nand two counts of breach of probation on May 12, 2011 (the “domestic assault\ncharge”). On June 8, 2011, while in custody, he was charged with sexual\nassault, voyeurism, choking with intent and two counts of breach of probation,\nin relation to a different complainant (the “sexual assault/voyeurism charges”).\nOn August 23, 2011, the applicant was convicted of the domestic assault charge.\nHe was sentenced on February 3, 2012 to eight months in jail. A little less\nthan eight months of pre-sentence custody was taken into consideration in\nsentencing him on the domestic assault charge.[5]On March 18-20, 2013, the applicant had his\ntrial on the sexual assault/voyeurism charges. He was convicted of the charges\non May 8, 2013. On July 26, 2013, he was sentenced to six years in jail. The\ntrial judge took into account 17 “real” months of pre-sentence custody, which\ndid not include the eight months of pre-sentence custody previously credited on\nthe domestic assault conviction.[6]On September 4, 2013, the applicant filed a\nNotice of Appeal appealing both conviction and sentence on the domestic assault\nconviction. On November 28, 2013, he filed a Notice of Appeal appealing both\nconviction and sentence on the sexual assault/voyeurism charges.[7]On July 10, 2015, this court dismissed the\napplicant’s sexual assault/voyeurism conviction appeal and allowed the sentence\nappeal only to the extent of increasing the credit that he received for the 17\nmonths of pre-sentence custody served up to the full 1.5:1 credit as required\nby R. v. Summers, 2014\nSCC 26 (CanLII), 2014 CarswellOnt 4479, 2014 CarswellOnt 4480\n(S.C.C.).[8]On July 22, 2016, this court allowed the\napplicant’s conviction appeal on the domestic assault charge and concluded that\nit would not be in the best interests of justice to order a new trial, in light\nof the fact that the applicant had already served his sentence of eight months\nin jail.C.issues(1)Does the court have jurisdiction to reopen the\nsentence appeal on the sexual assault/voyeurism conviction?(a)Parties’ Positions[9]The applicant recognizes that he has already had\nhis sentence appeal decided on its merits and, pursuant to Rhingo (1997), 1997 CanLII 418 (ON CA), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 89\n(Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused September 18, 1997, his appeal right\nhas been exhausted. However, the applicant argues that the court should expand\nthe scope of this court’s jurisdiction to reopen an appeal beyond the limits\nset out in Rhingo because of what he describes as a “procedural\nirregularity” – the order in which his appeals were heard – resulting in the\nsentencing judge on the sexual assault/voyeurism conviction taking into account\na conviction for domestic assault which was ultimately quashed. In the\nalternative, the applicant argues that s. 683(3) of the Criminal Code allows\nfor the incorporation of civil powers into the criminal appeal context. Reading\ns. 683(3) together with Rule 59.06(2) of the Rules of Civil Procedure,\nwhich allows a party to make a motion to have an order set aside or varied\non the ground of fraud or facts arising or discovered after it was made, the\napplicant argues there is an alternative route to jurisdiction to reopen an\nappeal decided on its merits.[10]The respondent argues that once an appeal\nhas been heard on its merits and a formal order entered, the court is functus\nofficio. The remedy the applicant seeks, the reopening of his sentence\nappeal to take into account a change in circumstances which occurred a year\nafter the appeal was determined on its merits, is inconsistent with the\nprinciples identified in Rhingo, ignores the court’s status as functus\nofficio, and usurps a function reserved for the Supreme Court of Canada or\nthe Minister of Justice in limited circumstances. The respondent further\nsubmits that s. 683(3) cannot establish a statutory right to reopen an appeal\nthat has been decided on its merits. The respondent argues that, when read in\nthe context of the entire section, s. 683(3) serves only to expand the\nprocedural powers of this court that are necessary to adjudicate appeals, but\ncannot expand the rights of parties to appeal. Interpreting s. 683(3) to permit\nan appeal of a final order of the court of appeal on the basis of a civil rule\nof procedure is inconsistent with Parliament’s express grant of limited appeal\nrights set out in s. 675(1) and s. 691(1) of the Criminal Code.(b)Analysis(i)The scope of the power to reopen an appeal as\nset out in R. v. Rhingo[11]The case law is well-settled that this court’s\njurisdiction to reopen an appeal is limited to cases which have not been heard\nand decided on the merits. Charron J.A. recognized in Rhingo that\nthere is no statutory authority to reopen an appeal that has been heard on the merits,\nnor can the power to reopen an appeal that has been heard and decided on the\nmerits be found in the inherent or ancillary powers of the court to control its\nown process: Rhingo, at paras. 30-38. Charron J.A. set out the sound\npolicy reasons for limiting the power to reopen appeals to those that have not\nbeen heard on the merits at para. 34:[…] An unlimited discretion to reopen appeals\nthat have been heard on their merits is not only unjustifiable as an ancillary\npower of the court, but would do significant harm to the criminal justice\nsystem. Finality is an important goal of the criminal process. Statutory rights\nof appeal provide a carefully crafted exception to the general rule that trial\ndecisions are final. By providing broad rights of appellate review in criminal\nmatters, Parliament recognized that fairness and justice interests require that\nthe accused have a full opportunity to challenge a conviction even through that\nopportunity will prolong the process. Once those broad appellate rights have\nbeen exercised and the merits of the appeal decided, then absent an appeal to a\nhigher court, finality concerns must become paramount. […] The appellate\nprocess cannot become or even appear to become a never-closing revolving door\nthrough which applicants come and go whenever they propose to argue a new\nground of appeal.[12]This court in R. v. G.B (application by\nGogiatzis, Christodoulou, Churchill, Cusato and D.M.), (2003),\n2003 CanLII 46485 (ON CA), 169 O.A.C. 33, 172 C.C.C. (3d) 340, 2003 CarswellOnt 494\n(Ont. C.A.), considered the decision in Rhingo and, while concluding\nthat Rhingo did not apply in the context of that case, reiterated at\npara. 20 that there is no authority in Canada entitling a party to apply to a\ncourt to have a conviction set aside on the basis of newly discovered evidence\nafter all appeal rights have been exhausted and the final court is functus\nofficio.[13]Numerous other appellate courts have similarly\nrecognized that there is no jurisdiction to reopen an appeal heard on the\nmerits: R. v. Widdifield, 2016\nBCCA 412 (CanLII),\n2016 CarswellBC\n2932 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Purdy,\n2010 BCCA 43 (CanLII); R. v. Akinbiyi, 2008 SKCA 92 (CanLII), 2008 CarswellSask 486\n(S.K.C.A.).[14]The applicant argues that Rhingo defined\nthe scope of the court’s power to reopen an appeal narrowly because it was\naddressing only the facts at issue on the applications before the court (one\nwhich sought to reopen the appeal in order to supplement arguments advanced at\nthe first appeal and the other to reopen to attack a procedural decision made\nat the first appeal). He argues that his circumstances are different than those\naddressed in Rhingo, in that they arise from a “procedural\nirregularity” - the order in which his appeals were heard. He also argues that\nthe policy considerations in Rhingo that a “revolving door” or\n“unlimited discretion” to reopen appeals would erode the principle of finality\nare not in play in his case because of the unique facts of this case, where the\neffect of the timing of his appeals rendered his sexual assault sentence and\nappeal thereof to be based on inaccuracies.[15]A fair reading of Rhingo does not\nsupport the applicant’s position that the scope of the power to reopen appeals\nset out in that case was narrowly defined because it spoke only to the facts in\nissue on the applications before the court in that case. On the contrary,\nCharron J.A. approached her analysis in the broadest of terms, first canvassing\nthe fundamental principle of the exceptional nature of an appeal, then\nconducting a comprehensive review of both the statutory provisions within the Criminal\nCode governing rights of appeal and the inherent and ancillary powers of\nthe court to control its own process. She recognized that the power of the\nappellate court to control its own process includes the jurisdiction to reopen\nan appeal which has not been heard on the merits, but that there is no authority,\neither under express statutory terms under the Criminal Code or in the\ncourt’s inherent powers, to reopen a case that has been heard on the merits.\nThe specific basis upon which each applicant in Rhingo sought to reopen\nhis case was largely irrelevant to the analysis because the decisive factor was\nthat both were seeking to reopen their appeals after the appeals had been\ndecided on the merits.[16]Second, it is noteworthy that Charron J.A., at\nparas. 49-53, reviewed this court’s decision in R. v. Logan (1988), 27\nO.A.C. 154 (Ont. C.A.), in which this court granted an application to reopen an\nappeal against sentence on the basis that the original appeal panel committed\nan error in its treatment of the applicant’s parole eligibility period. There,\nthe court did not engage in a jurisdiction analysis, and the Crown took the\nposition that the court had jurisdiction to reopen the appeal. As such, the\ndecision has little precedential value on the question of jurisdiction, but\nCharron J.A. nevertheless stated, at para. 52:There is no question but that the appeal from\nsentence had been disposed of on the merits at the time Logan and Dunbar\napplied to the court to have the matter reconsidered. However, in the end\nresult, the judgment of the court was not changed and, strictly speaking, it\nwas not necessary to decide the issue of jurisdiction. The appeal was reopened\non consent of the Crown, and, although it is clear that consent can never serve\nto confer upon the court a jurisdiction it does not have, it may explain why\nthe issue was not fully canvassed at the time.In any event, I find it necessary, for the\nreasons stated earlier, to depart from the principle implied by the court’s\nassumption of jurisdiction in Logan. In my view, since\nthe court did not have the jurisdiction to change its earlier decision\npertaining to the appeal from sentence, the better course would have been to\nsummarily dismiss the application for want of jurisdiction. [Emphasis\nadded.][17]Therefore, it is clear that Charron J.A.’s\nanalysis applies across all appeal matters, including appeals of sentence,\nwhich have been determined on their merits. While there has been recognition by\nthis court, subsequent to Rhingo, that the court has jurisdiction to\nreopen a sentence appeal where the court did not have all the information which\nexisted at the time of the appeal to fully and properly adjudicate the issue on\nthe merits, as in the cases of R. v. De La Cruz, 2003 ONCA 822 at\npara. 4 and R. v. Edwards, (2015),\n2015 ONCA 537 (CanLII), 2015 CarswellOnt 10844 (Ont. C.A.) at paras.\n4-5, it is an entirely different thing to suggest that the court should reopen\nan appeal to consider new events and circumstances which did not exist at the\ntime, but which now exist. Therefore, there is no support in the jurisprudence\nfor the applicant’s suggestion that the scope of the power to reopen appeals\ndecided on the merits should be expanded.[18]The second thread of the applicant’s argument,\nthat expanding the scope of the power to reopen would not erode the principle of\nfinality or confer new substantive or procedural rights because of the unique\nfactual scenario arising from the “procedural irregularity” which occurred, is\nalso not persuasive. The order in which the applicant’s appeals were heard by\nthis court does not constitute a procedural irregularity. The timing and order\nof proceedings in this court was within the control of the applicant and the\napplicant made no motion to have the matters heard in a particular order.[19]Further, the applicant’s case does not present a\nparticularly unique circumstance. He was convicted of a crime, used up a\nportion of his pre-sentence custody on being sentenced for that crime, and his\nconviction for that crime was subsequently overturned. Virtually any applicant\nwho finds success in overturning a conviction could make the very same argument\nthe applicant advances now. There would be no finality if an applicant can come\nback, after the court has disposed of a sentence appeal, and request that the\ncourt reopen his appeal because a separate conviction on another matter has\nbeen overturned. The applicant’s requested remedy raises the exact concerns\naddressed in Rhingo about the erosion of finality if appeals which\nhave been decided on their merits are reopened.(ii)Jurisdiction based on s. 683(3) of the Criminal\nCode and Rule 69.06(2)(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure[20]As to the alternate route of jurisdiction\nthrough a combined reading of s. 683(3) of the Criminal Code and Rule\n59.06(2)(a) of the Rule of Civil Procedure, the applicant argues that\nthe quashing of his domestic assault conviction constitutes “facts arising\nafter the court’s ruling on his sexual assault appeal”. This court in R. v.\nCodina, 2009 ONCA 970 at para. 8, already expressed a reservation about\nusing the Rules of Civil Procedure to extend the statutory criminal\njurisdiction of the court of appeal beyond the jurisdiction expressly granted\nin the Criminal Code. Indeed, when this court has resorted to using a\nRule to reopen an appeal, it has been to correct an error. For example, in R.\nv. Kohl, 2009\nONCA 254 (CanLII), 2009 CarswellOnt 1509, (sub nom. R. v. K. (K.)) 244\nC.C.C. (3d) 124 (Ont. C.A.) at\npara. 12, the court invoked s. 683(3) and Rule 59.06(1) to strike what it later\nconcluded based on additional information, was an impermissible probation\norder.[21]We agree with the reservation the court expressed\nin Codina that s. 683(3) of the Criminal Code can be read as\nextending the statutory criminal jurisdiction of the court of appeal beyond the\njurisdiction expressly granted by Parliament in the Criminal Code.\nWhen the words of s. 683(3) are read in the context of the entire section, it\nis clear that Parliament intended that the court of appeal have the same\nevidentiary and procedural powers necessary to adjudicate criminal appeals as\nit does for civil appeals. Section 683(1) sets out the powers of the court of\nappeal to make orders of a procedural nature in order to facilitate the adjudication\nof an appeal, where it is in the interests of justice to make such procedural\norders. Section 683(3) expressly expands the scope of the procedural orders the\ncourt of appeal can make, beyond those enumerated in subsection (1), to include\nany power which can be exercised in civil matters. Section 683(3) reads:A court of appeal may exercise, in relation to\nproceedings in the court, any powers not mentioned in subsection (1) that may\nbe exercised by the court on appeals in civil matters, and may issue any\nprocess that is necessary to enforce the orders or sentences of the court […].[22]Both subsection (1) and (3) have, as their clear\nintention, to give the court of appeal powers to make orders to facilitate the\nhearing of an appeal. Neither of the express provisions within the Criminal\nCode setting out the rights of appeal (s. 675 and s. 691(1)) contemplate\nan appeal to the court of appeal to review the dismissal of an appeal. Appeals\nfrom this court’s decisions lie with the Supreme Court of Canada or, in limited\ncircumstances, to the Minster of Justice for review on the grounds of a\nmiscarriage of justice.[23]Reading s. 683(3), together with Rule\n59.06(2)(a), to permit this court to reconsider its own decisions on the merits\nencroaches on Parliament’s exclusive jurisdiction to determine rights of appeal\nof convicted persons. As the respondent notes, several appellate courts have\nrecognized that jurisdiction in criminal matters cannot be grounded in\nprovincial legislation: see R. v. De Jong, [1996] B.C.J.\nNo. 682 (B.C. C.A.) at para. 25; R.\nv. Budgen, [1992] N.J. No. 15 (C.A.) at pp. 4-5.(iii)Conclusion on jurisdiction[24]This court does not have jurisdiction to reopen\nthe sentence appeal.(2)If the court had jurisdiction, would the\ninterests of justice require the applicant’s sentence appeal be reopened?(a)Parties’ Positions[25]The applicant argues that with the fresh\nevidence of his domestic assault conviction having been quashed, it is likely\nthat the sentencing hearing on the sexual assault/voyeurism conviction would\nhave produced a different result. He asserts it would be unjust for him to\nremain incarcerated, given that he would now be eligible for release had the\npre-sentencing custody which was used up on the domestic assault conviction\nbeen counted toward his sentence on the sexual assault/voyeurism conviction.\nThe applicant submits that public confidence in the administration of justice\nwould be undermined if he were not granted credit on the sexual\nassault/voyeurism conviction for the pre-sentence custody served on the\nnow-quashed domestic assault conviction.[26]The appellant submits the quashing of the\ndomestic assault conviction constitutes “fresh evidence” which satisfies the\ntest set out in R. v. Palmer, 1979 CanLII 8 (SCC), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, and that his\nsentence appeal has merit. If the court accepts that he is entitled to be\ncredited the pre-sentence custody used on the domestic assault conviction, then\nhe has served his time. Moreover, he argues that the trial judge on the sexual\nassault/voyeurism charges considered the domestic assault conviction in\nconstructing a fit sentence on the sexual assault/voyeurism conviction. He\nnotes Justice Rosenberg’s obiter comments in R. v. Wilson, 2008\nONCA 510 (CanLII), 2008 CarswellOnt 3715, 240 O.A.C. 59, 236 C.C.C. (3d) 285\n(Ont. C.A.), at para. 48: “If the sentencing judge had taken the prior\nconviction into account as a serious aggravating circumstance, the fact that\nthe accused was later found to be innocent of that offence would be a relevant\nconsideration.”[27]The applicant further argues that this court’s recent decision in R.\nv. Pammett, 2016 ONCA 979 (CanLII), has no application to this case because it is\ndistinguishable on the facts. In Pammett, the appellant\nsought to receive additional credit for pre-sentence custody deducted from his\nsix year sentence for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking,\npossession of proceeds of crime, and one count of failing to comply with a\nprobation order because he accumulated pre-sentence custody on unrelated\ncharges that were ultimately stayed. The applicant argues that the\ndistinguishing feature in Pammett is that in that case, when the\noffender was being sentenced on his charges, he had not yet stood trial on the\nother charges (which were ultimately stayed). The sentencing judge did not\nconsider the matters that had not yet been adjudicated as an aggravating factor\nin sentencing the offender.[28]The respondent states that this court’s decision\nin Wilson is dispositive of the applicant’s claim that he is entitled\nto reopen his appeal based on the position that he should be credited with the\npre-sentence custody that was credited to his sentence on the quashed domestic\nassault conviction. This court recognized in Wilson that it will not\nalways be the case that an accused will receive full credit for time spent in\ncustody and that accused parties cannot be permitted to “bank” time spent in\ncustody. Further, the respondent argues that the trial judge, while noting the domestic\nassault conviction when imposing sentence, clearly focused on the applicant’s\nprior sexual assault conviction and a voyeurism conviction, along with the\ninformation in the pre-sentence report, in arriving at a sentence. It cannot be\nsaid that the domestic assault conviction added significantly to the weight of\ncircumstances that caused the trial judge to conclude that the applicant was a\nhigh risk to reoffend and that a sentence of six years was warranted.[29]The respondent further submits that this court\nin Pammett followed the decision in Wilson that time spent in\ncustody by an offender on unrelated charges cannot be “banked”. In cases where\nthe offender, on appeal, has been given credit for pre-sentence custody served\nin relation to another offence (such as R. v. Reid, 2005 CanLII 14964 (ON CA), [2005] O.J. No. 1790 (C.A.) and\nR. v. Tsui, 2005 ONCA 623), that time had not been credited to a\nsentence imposed following a conviction, and the withdrawal of the charges had\ntaken place prior to the hearing of the appeal. Moreover, this court stated at\npara. 27 of Pammett that “a sentencing judge is entitled to take into\naccount time spent serving another sentence as part of the complete picture for\nunderstanding a particular offender.”(b)Analysis(i)Pre-sentence credit for time spent on unrelated charges[30]This court’s majority opinion in Wilson,\ntogether with the decision in Pammett, is dispositive of this\nissue. As Justice Rosenberg noted at paras. 42-43 of Wilson, to give\neffect to the submission that an accused is entitled to receive credit for time\nserved on another matter which is ultimately dismissed, or for which he is\nacquitted, is tantamount to allowing offenders to “bank” time spent in custody.\nAs he stated at para. 45:But, at the end of the day, when it comes time\nto sentence an offender the court can only take into account the factors that\nrelate to the particular offence under consideration. The fact that an\noffender, like the applicant, still happens to be in the appeal system when a\nflaw in relation to a totally unrelated conviction comes to light is not, in my\nview, a principled reason to give that offender credit for the time he or she\nspent serving the sentence for that unrelated conviction.[31]As noted earlier in this analysis, this case\nraises the exact concern about offenders “banking” pre-sentence custody which\nJustice Rosenberg commented on at para. 43 of Wilson.[32]Further, and as the respondent points out in its\nsupplemental submissions, it is unclear from the record whether the applicant\nconsented to his detention on the sexual assault/voyeurism charges, the\ndomestic assault charge, or any of the other charges which he was apparently\nfacing at the time. There is a lack of information as to why the applicant was\ndetained and on which of his charges he was in custody. As such, it is unclear\nwhether it can be said, conclusively, that the eight months in custody was time\nspent on both the sexual assault/voyeurism charges and the domestic assault\ncharge. It cannot be said, as was the case in Reid and Tsai, that\n“the accused was refused bail on the second set of charges (the charges that\nwere later withdrawn) because he was already on bail for the first set of\ncharges. Thus, in part, the time spent in custody for the withdrawn set of\ncharges could be attributed to the first set of charges”: Wilson at\npara. 50.[33]Further, while it is the unfortunate reality, as\nJustice Rosenberg recognized in Wilson, that there may be instances\nwhere pre-sentence custody cannot ultimately be applied to any sentence, in\nthis case, the applicant’s domestic assault conviction was overturned and no\nnew trial was ordered, in light of the fact that he had served his eight month\nsentence. In the circumstances of this case, the time the applicant served on\nthe domestic assault charge led the court to conclude that it was not in the\nbest interests of justice to order a new trial, the remedy which would\nordinarily flow from a conviction being quashed.(ii)The trial judge’s use of domestic assault\nconviction[34]Finally, while there can be no question that the\ntrial judge at least considered the domestic assault conviction when assessing\na fit sentence for the applicant, it cannot be said that any aggravating factor\nthe trial judge considered did not exist without the domestic assault\nconviction. For example, he noted in his Reasons for Sentence that the sexual\nassault/voyeurism charges were not an isolated incident and referred to the May\n2011 domestic assault. However, the evidence to support this conclusion (that\nthis was not an isolated incident) did not rest solely on the May 2011 domestic\nassault conviction. In particular, and as the trial judge reviewed in his\nreasons, the applicant sexually assaulted and confined a co-worker. He\nthreatened that complainant with death and punched her in the abdomen to force\nsexual intercourse. He surreptitiously recorded another woman in 2008 and\nbreached court orders in relation to using a computer to communicate with two\nother girls. He received a global sentence, after a plea, of seven years. He\nwas sentenced to 21 months jail in 2010 for assault causing bodily harm when he\npunched a domestic partner in the abdomen, fracturing her renal cortex, and a\nfurther month in jail for failing to comply with a probation order. There was\nsignificant evidence that the applicant’s conduct in the case before the court\nwas not an “isolated incident”.[35]The trial judge’s conclusion that the applicant\nwas a “repeat offender” with “multiple victims all of whom remain fearful of\nhim” was fully supported on the information provided to him in the pre-sentence\nreport, quite apart from the domestic assault conviction. The trial judge’s\nconclusion that the applicant was a high risk for recidivism, necessitating a\nsix year sentence, was entirely appropriate, even when the domestic assault is\nremoved from consideration. The applicant’s criminal antecedents, and in\nparticular, the similar level of severity between this sexual assault and the\nearlier sexual assault which attracted a seven year jail sentence, fully\nsupport the trial judge’s conclusion on sentence.(iii)Conclusion on interests of justice[36]It would not be in the interests of justice,\neven if the court had jurisdiction to reopen the applicant’s sentence appeal on\nthe sexual assault/voyeurism conviction, to reopen the appeal. The basis of the\nappeal, that the applicant should be given credit for pre-sentence custody\nserved on another charge the conviction for which was ultimately overturned, is\nnot supported by the case law. A fair reading of the trial judge’s reasons\nreflects that he relied quite minimally on this conviction in any event. It did\nnot materially impact his assessment of the appropriate sentence in this case.D.disposition[37]For the reasons given, the application to reopen\nthe sentence appeal heard and dismissed by this court on July 29, 2015 is\ndismissed.Released: “JM” FEB 22 2017“G.R.\nStrathy C.J.O.”“J.C. MacPherson J.A.”“M.L. Benotto J.A.”[1] The applicant appealed both his conviction and sentence.\nBoth were dismissed."}

Fox for Her Majesty the Queen.Mr.\nG. Kearney for Mr. Stone.JUDGMENT OF GORMAN, P.C. J.(SENTENCE)INTRODUCTION:[1]Mr. Stone has entered pleas\nof guilty to the offences of theft (four counts) and breach of probation (four\ncounts), contrary to sections 334(b) and 733.1 of the Criminal Code of\nCanada, RSC 1985 (the Criminal Code). The Crown proceeded by way of\nsummary conviction in relation to all counts.[2]The sole issue for\ndetermination is the imposition of an appropriate sentence for these offences.For\nthe reasons that will follow herein, I have concluded that the imposition of a\nperiod of twelve months imprisonment, to be served on conditional basis, is an appropriate\nsentence in the circumstances of this case.Let me explain my reasons for this\nconclusion by commencing with a review of the circumstances of the offences\ncommitted by Mr. Stone.THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT THE\nSENTENCE HEARING[3]During the time period of\nJune 17, 2009 to July 9, 2009, Mr. Stone committed four thefts.During this\ntime period he was bound by a probation order which was in effect as of January\n1, 2009 and which required, among other things, that he “keep the peace and be\nof good behaviour.”[4]On June 17, 2009, Mr. Stone\nstole a number of magazines from a grocery store.[5]On July 2, 2009, Mr. Stone,\nwhile traveling on a bus, stole an I-Pod and three Nintendo games from a fellow\npassenger.Before Mr. Stone reached his destination; he was identified as the\nthief and arrested by the police.The stolen items were located on his person.One of the other conditions contained in the probation order issued on January\n1, 2009, required Mr. Stone to notify this bus line in advance of any intention\nto travel on it (Mr. Stone had been convicted of fraudulently obtaining\ntransportation from this bus company).He failed to do so.[6]On July 9, 2009, while at a Doctor’s\noffice, Mr. Stone attempted to steal some rubber gloves and did steal some\nsyringes and alcohol swabs.On the same date, he stole some insoles for shoes from\na drug store.[7]Having set out the\ncircumstances of the offences committed by Mr. Stone, it is now time to\nconsider his personal circumstances.MR. STONE’S PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES[8]Mr. Stone is twenty-five\nyears of age.He is unemployed and in receipt of income assistance.[9]Mr. Stone was born in Corner Brook. The pre-sentence report indicates\nthat his “family\nlife was rife with many maladaptive factors.His father was a heavy drinker\nwith multi-substance abuse issues who was very abusive towards Mr. Stone’s mother.Mr. Stone witnessed this abuse as a younger person.”[10]Since his adolescent years,\nMr. Stone has used a number of different drugs and substances.The\npre-sentence report indicates that he “has abused a variety of illicit\nsubstances and prescription medications for several years, including I.V. use\nsince his early teens - cannabis; morphine and cocaine.Many of his associates\nhave been like-minded individuals. Mr. Stone’s father has also provided drugs\nto Mr. Stone: this has ceased, as Mr. Stone’s father is participating in a\nMethadone Treatment Program.” The pre-sentence report also states:By his mid-teens, Mr. Stone had left school\nand his use of illicit substances and prescription medications has been\nchronic.There has never been any significant interval of sobriety until\nrecently.Mr. Stone has had other personal adjustment concerns including low\nself-esteem; communication issues; periods of emotional instability and\nimpulsive decision-making with negative consequences.[11]Mr. Stone has applied to be\nenrolled in an adult basic education program and is enrolled in a methadone\ntreatment program. The pre-sentence report concludes that he is a suitable\ncandidate for community supervision:While there are risks that Mr. Stone may\nnot be compliant with community supervision assessed on the basis of his past\ncriminal behaviour and his current risks\\needs, there are some positive\nelements that may help mitigate those risks.Notwithstanding his patterns of\nrelapsing into substance abuse, Mr. Stone is participating in addictions\nprograms and counselling.His only involvement at this time is his\nparticipation in the Methadone.[12]Mr. Stone has a\nnumber of previous convictions for the offences of theft and breach of\nprobation.He has also been convicted of the offences of assault and uttering\nthreats, but he has never illustrated any history or pattern of violence.[13]Having set out the\ncircumstances of the offences committed by Mr. Stone and his personal\ncircumstances, it is now time to turn to the positions of the parties.THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES[14]Both counsel recommended that\na period of imprisonment be imposed.Their dispute concerns the question as to\nwhere that period of imprisonment should be served.THE CROWN[15]The Crown seeks a period of\nnine to twelve months incarceration.Mr. Fox argues that the public must be\nprotected from Mr. Stone’s ongoing criminal behaviour and that only a period of\nincarceration will achieve this sentencing objective.For the offence of\nbreach of probation involving Mr. Stone’s failure to notify the bus company of\nhis intention to be a passenger, a period of four months incarceration is\nsought.MR. STONE[16]Mr. Stone seeks a period of\ntwelve months imprisonment to be served on a conditional basis.Mr. Kearney submits\nthat the Court should place its primary emphasis on rehabilitation.He referred\nto Mr. Stone’s attempts to deal with his addictions and the positive steps in\nthat direction that Mr. Stone is presently making.[17]Prior to considering these\nsubmissions, this is a convenient time to set out the statutory principles of\nsentencing which must be applied.THE CRIMINAL CODE'S SENTENCING PROVISIONS[18]Section 718 of the Criminal\nCode states that the fundamental purpose of sentencing “is to contribute…to\nrespect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society.”\nThis is to be achieved by imposingsentences which have, among others,\nthe following objectives:- separating offenders\nfrom society, where necessary;- denouncing unlawful\nconduct;- general deterrence;- rehabilitation; and- the promoting of a\n“sense of responsibility in offenders, andacknowledgement of the\nharm done to victims and the community.”[19]Section 718.2(d) states that\n“an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions\nmay be appropriate in the circumstances” and section 718.2(e) states that “all\navailable sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the\ncircumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention\nto the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.”[20]Section 718.1 of the Criminal\nCode states that any sentence imposed must be “proportionate to the gravity\nof the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.”THE RANGEOF SENTENCE FOR THE OFFENCES\nCOMMITTED BY MR. STONE[21]The range of sentence for breach\nof probation/undertaking offences varies widely depending on the nature of the\nbreach and the offender’s criminal record (in R. v. Newhook (2008), 2008 NLCA 28 (CanLII), 276 Nfld. \u0026\nP.E.I.R. 190 (N.L.C.A.), for instance, the Court of Appeal concluded\nthat periods of three months imprisonment for breaching conditions in an\nundertaking involving alcohol possession and contact with a complainant should\nbe upheld, though it described the latter sentence as being “low”).For the\ntype of breaches of probation committed by Mr. Stone, who has a history of\nbreaching court orders, sentences of one; six; and twelve months imprisonment have\nbeen recently imposed (see R. v. Boland (2009), 2009 NLTD 89 (CanLII), 287 Nfld. \u0026\nP.E.I.R. 269 (N.L.S.C.), six months imprisonment for failing to keep the peace\nand be of good behaviour); R. v. Sheppard (2006), 2006 NLTD 48 (CanLII), 255 Nfld. \u0026\nP.E.I.R. 207 (N.L.S.C.), six months imprisonment for failing to keep the peace\nand be of good behaviour; R. v. Poker (2006), 2006 NLTD 154 (CanLII), 261 Nfld. \u0026\nP.E.I.R. 1 (N.L.S.C.), twelve months imprisonment for failing to keep the peace\nand be of good behaviour; and R. v. Gibson, [2010] N.J. No. 30\n(S.C.), one month imprisonment for failing to keep the peace and be of good\nbehaviour).The upper end of this range has been extended to period of two\nyears imprisonment (see R. v. Murphy (2009), 2009 NLTD 138 (CanLII), 289 Nfld. \u0026\nP.E.I.R. 333 (N.L.S.C.)).[22]The range of sentence for the\ntypes of thefts committed by Mr. Stone is difficult to determine because of the\nfew written sentencing judgments for this type of offence.However, the range\nof sentence would appear to be from fourteen days to three months imprisonment when\nthe offender has a lengthy criminal record for such offences (see R. v.\nGale, [2006] N.J. No. 87 (P.C.)).AN APPLICATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES TO\nTHIS CASE[23]Considering the circumstances\nof the offences committed by Mr. Stone and his personal circumstances, I have\nconcluded that the following individual sentences are appropriate:1. June 17, 2009, for the\ntheft from the grocery store, a period of one month imprisonment and for the\naccompanying breach of probation, a period of one month imprisonment;2. July 2, 2009, for the\ntheft of the items on the bus, a period of two months imprisonment. I have\nconcluded that this is an appropriate sentence because the victim was a person\nand because of the valuable nature of the items stolen.For the two breaches\nof probation arising out of this offence, a period of one month imprisonment on\neach; and3. July 9, 2009, for the\ntheft from the drug store, a period of one month imprisonment.For the theft\nfrom the doctor’s office, a period of three months imprisonment. I have\nconcluded that this is an appropriate sentence because of the need to stress\ngeneral deterrence in relation to thefts from such a location and because of\nthe potentially dangerous nature of some of the items stolen. For the breach of\nprobation offence arising out of this latter theft, a period of two months imprisonment\nbecause of the serious nature of the underlying offence.[24]The next question to be answered\nis: should these sentences be served on a concurrent or consecutive basis?CONCURRENT AND CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES[25]The thefts committed by Mr.\nStone are separate and distinct offences and require the imposition of\nconsecutive sentences (see R. v. Crocker (1991), 1991 CanLII 2737 (NL CA), 93 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R.\n222 (N.L.C.A.)).In general terms, consecutive sentences should always\nbe imposed for breach of probation/undertaking offences (see R.\nv. Driscoll (2006), 2007 NLTD 1 (CanLII), 262 Nfld. \u0026\nP.E.I.R. 108 (N.L.S.C.), at paragraph 26 and Newhook,\nat paragraph 20) because they constitute separate and distinct offences\nregardless of the nature of the substantive offence committed. In addition, an\noffender who commits a substantive offence while on probation should normally\nreceive a lengthier overall period of imprisonment then an offender who commits\nsuch an offence, but is not bound by a probation order at the time.[26]If consecutive periods of\nimprisonment are held to be appropriate here, this would result in a period of twelve\nmonths imprisonment being imposed. Is this a proportionate sentence? The answer\nto this question requires a consideration of the totality principle of\nsentencing.THE TOTALITY PRINCIPLE OF SENTENCING[27]Section 718.2(c)\nof the Criminal Code requires judges in imposing sentence to ensure that\nwhen consecutive sentences are imposed that “the combined sentence” is not\n“unduly long or harsh.”In R. v. P.J.B., [2010] A.J. No.\n145 (C.A.), in considering this principle of sentencing, Mr. Justice Watson\nwrote (at paragraph 8):...The Supreme Court has made it clear that,\nsubject to a specific direction by Parliament in the Criminal Code that\na sentence must be consecutive, it is within the discretion of a trial judge to\nmake a prison term run consecutively or concurrently: s. 718.4(3) of the Criminal\nCode; R. v. McDonnell, 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, [1997] S.C.J. No. 42 (QL),\nat paras. 44 to 46. The sentencing judge is to consider whether an accumulation\nof sentences is unduly long or harsh, but the fundamental principle is to\nachieve a result that is proportional to the gravity of the offences committed\nand the degree of responsibility of the offender; s. 718.1 of the Criminal\nCode; R. v. Wharry, (2008) 437 A.R. 148, [2008] A.J. No. 945 (QL),\n2008 ABCA 293 (CanLII) at paras. 34 to 36.[28]Considering the number of\noffences committed by Mr. Stone; his previous convictions; and the need to\nstress general deterrence when dealing with breaches of court orders, I am\nsatisfied that a period of twelve months imprisonment is neither unduly long\nnor harsh.I am also satisfied that it is consistent with the sentence imposed\nin Gibson (six months for four offences: theft; possession of\nstolen goods; and two breaches of probation) when the significantly greater\nnumber of offence committed by Mr. Stone is considered.[29]The last question to be\nanswered is: should Mr. Stone be allowed to serve this period of imprisonment\nin the community?WHEN CAN A CONDITIONAL SENTENCE BE\nIMPOSED?[30]In order to impose a\nconditional period of imprisonment, the offence committed must fall within the\nparameters of section 742.1 of the Criminal Code.That section states:If a person is convicted of an offence, other than a\nserious personal injury offence as defined in section 752, a terrorism offence\nor a criminal organization offence prosecuted by way of indictment for which\nthe maximum term of imprisonment is ten years or more or an offence punishable\nby a minimum term of imprisonment, and the court imposes a sentence of\nimprisonment of less than two years and is satisfied that the service of the\nsentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and\nwould be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing\nset out in sections 718 to 718.2, the court may, for the purpose of supervising\nthe offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the\nsentence in the community, subject to the offender’s compliance with the\nconditions imposed under section 742.3.[31]Thus, in order to impose a\nconditional sentence, a Court must be satisfied that (1) the offence committed\nis not a “serious personal injury offence”, prosecuted by way of indictment and\nfor which the maximum term of imprisonment is a period of ten years or more;\n(2) that there is no minimum term of imprisonment applicable; (3) that a period\nof imprisonment of less than two years is appropriate; (4) that the offender\ndoes not constitute a danger to the public; and (5) that such a sentence is consistent\nwith the fundamental principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code.[32]The first three criteria are\nclearly established, but considering Mr. Stone’s criminal record, particularly\nhis failure to comply with other court orders, there is a significant danger\nthat he will fail to comply with a conditional sentence order and that he will\ncommit additional offences.These factors weigh heavily against the imposition\nof a conditional sentence (see R. v. Wilson (2009), A.R. 373\n(C.A.), at paragraph 37 and R. v. Melvin, 2010 NSCA 5 (CanLII), at\nparagraph 9).However, if Mr. Stone commits an offence while serving a period\nof imprisonment in the community it is likely to be an offence involving a relatively\nminor theft. Though the public requires protection from property crimes, a\ndistinction between minor property crimes and crimes of violence can be made\nwhen considering the imposition of a conditional sentence and in weighing the\nrisk of re-offence.The risk of the latter type of offence being committed will\nalmost always result in a denial of a request by an offender to serve her or\nhis period of imprisonment in the community.There is always some risk that an\noffender will commit an offence while serving a conditional sentence.That\nrisk, however, must be assessed with regard to the type of harm which might be\ninflicted on the community or one of its members by a re-offence.Here, I am\nsatisfied that with the imposition of stringent conditions, including a “house\narrest” condition, the risk of serious harm to the public occurring as a result\nof acts of violence or serious property crime being committed is sufficiently negligible\nand manageable to allow for a conditional period of imprisonment to be imposed.[33]I am also satisfied that the\nimposition of a conditional sentence is consistent, in the unique circumstances\nof this case, with the principles of sentencing enshrined in the Criminal\nCode.I conclude that such a sentence will satisfy the sentencing\nprinciples of specific and general deterrence and promote Mr. Stone’s\nrehabilitation. I have decided to place my primary emphasis in this case on the\nsentencing principle of rehabilitation because I am satisfied that Mr. Stone’s\nrehabilitation is a realistic possibility. His present progress with the\nmethadone treatment program illustrates that this is not one of those cases\nwhere an offender talks about rehabilitation, but does not take any significant\nsteps to promote it.This does not mean, however, that every repeat offender\nwith an addiction problem is immune from a period of incarceration being\nimposed. I would not have imposed a conditional sentence in this case, but for\nmy conclusion concerning the likelihood of rehabilitation occurring and the\nrelatively minor nature of the thefts committed by Mr. Stone.As I pointed out\nin Gale:Though the Court has sympathy for the addiction\ndifficulties faced by Mr. Gale, it must ensure that Mr. Gale takes responsibility\nfor his actions and the sentence it imposes must clearly state that resort to\nserious criminal behaviour to satisfy an addiction is not acceptable. Simply\nput, a drug addiction is not an excuse for serious criminal behaviour,\nparticularly long standing criminal behaviour (see R. v. A.D.P., 2005 BCCA 625 (CanLII), [2005] B.C.J. No. 2737\n(C.A.)) and it does not lessen the requirement that the Court apply the\nsentencing principles of deterrence and denunciation to serious criminal\nconduct.CONCLUSION[34]For the reasons provided\nherein, Mr. Stone is sentenced to a period of twelve months imprisonment, to be\nserved on a conditional basis. I will allow counsel to speak to the nature and\nterms of the conditions which should be included in this order before imposing\nthem.Upon completion of the conditional period of imprisonment, Mr. Stone\nwill be bound by a probation order for a period one year.In addition to the\nstatutory conditions prescribed by the Criminal Code, Mr. Stone must (1)\nreport to a probation officer as required; (2) comply with all instructions or\nrecommendations he receives from his probation officer; and (3) actively\nparticipate in any treatment or counselling programs arranged or recommended by\nhis probation officer.Considering Mr. Stone’s financial situation, the\nimposition of victim fine surcharges is hereby waived.[35]Judgment accordingly."}

A. SeguFor\nthe CrownK.\nD. Hill and B. R. PfefferleFor\nthe AccusedSENTENCING DECISIONQ. D. AGNEW, J[1]Darrel Donald Stupnikoff pled guilty on February 28, 2013 to one count\nof possessing child pornography and one count of making child pornography\navailable contrary to ss. 163.1(3) and (4) of the Criminal Code.[1]On that date, I heard submissions from Crown counsel and defence counsel, as\nwell as from Mr. Stupnikoff himself.[2]It is trite to say that every sentencing is unique, as every sentence\nmust be tailored to the individual defendant.Nonetheless, there are two\naspects of the present matter which are unusual.The first is that Mr. Stupnikoff\nis a second-time offender, having been convicted in 2005 of possession of child\npornography.The second unusual aspect is the sheer size of the collection of\nchild pornography amassed by Mr. Stupnikoff in a relatively short period of\ntime.[3]These factors, and perhaps others, may have contributed to the\nconsiderable disparity in the sentencing positions of the Crown and defence.The Crown urges me to sentence Mr. Stupnikoff to seven years incarceration;\ndefence seeks a sentence of two years less a day and three years probation (in\naddition to five months of remand time spent to this date).[4]The accused is 58 years old.He is married and his spouse, who is aware\nof these charges, has apparently been supportive, as indeed she apparently was\nwhen he was previously convicted.They have no children.He is a\nlong-distance trucker and, other than his predilection for child pornography,\nhe appears to be a stable and law-abiding individual.Except for the previous\nconviction referred to, he has no criminal record.[5]When the accused was convicted in 2005 of possession of child\npornography, a pre-sentence report was prepared which was filed as an exhibit\nin the sentencing hearing with respect to the current charges.That report\nprovided information with respect to the accused’s\nbackground, and discussed risk factors and strategies to reduce the same, to\ntry to prevent a recurrence of the accused’s\nbehaviour.[6]As a side note, the report also illustrates the dangers of placing too\nmuch reliance on risk assessments.The accused was assessed in 2005 on the\nbasis of the STATIC-99 test.Based on his score on that test together with\nother risk factors, the writer of the report believed that the likelihood of\nthe accused sexually re-offending was approximately 9% in five years and 13% in\nten years.In fact, Mr. Stupnikoff began collecting child pornography again\npractically the instant he was no longer under the supervision of the justice\nsystem.I point this out not by way of criticism of the report writer, but as\na reflection of the fact that even low probabilities sometimes occur.It must\nbe remembered that such assessments deal in likelihoods, not certainties.[7]On October 13, 2005, the accused was convicted of one count of\npossession of child pornography, and sentenced to an eighteen month conditional\nsentence.During the term of that sentence he was required to attend, and did\nattend, sexual offender programming.He was very compliant, did everything\nexpected of him and appears to have been a model participant.However, when\nhis period of supervision ended, he chose not to continue with the voluntary\nsupport programme.Indeed, when he was interviewed by police with respect to\nthe current offences, he acknowledged to them that he had begun collecting\nchild pornography again virtually as soon as his conditional sentence order had\nexpired, and has been doing so ever since.[8]When the accused pled guilty to possession of child pornography in 2005,\nhe had 8,544 images and videos of child pornography.When he was arrested in\n2012 on his present charges, his collection was almost ten times as large.He\nhad accumulated it in slightly over five years.Police have not yet reviewed\nall of the images and videos found on his two computers and four external hard\ndrives, but rather used software tools to compare those files with known child\npornography images and videos.Using such tools, they have determined that the\naccused had in his possession, at the time he was arrested, 80,393 images or\nvideos containing child pornography.[2]The harm of possessing child pornography[9]The accused seems to lack insight into the harm which is done by\ndownloading, possessing and viewing child pornography.When arrested, he\nminimized his culpability by stating to police that he never offended\nhands-on:he only downloaded.When he addressed the Court at his sentencing hearing,\nhe apologized to his wife, friends and other people for the disappointment and\nembarrassment that he had caused them; he did not make any mention of the\nchildren whose images appear in his extensive collection.[10]Unfortunately, the accused is not alone in his failure to\nrecognize his possession of child pornography as a serious matter.By\ninteresting coincidence, the day before the sentencing hearing in this matter a\nuniversity professor apparently voiced similar thoughts.Professor Tom\nFlanagan of the University of Calgary is reported to have said, with respect to\nthe idea of jailing people who view child pornography, “[i]t is a real issue of person liberty and\n[sic] to what extent we put people in jail for doing something in which they do\nnot harm another person.”[3]Ihasten to say that I do not know whether or not Professor Flanaganactually\nmade those remarks, and they are not directly relevant to this accusedin any\nevent.However, they echo what appears to be the accused’s view ofthe harm, or lack\nthereof, which is involved with downloading and viewing childpornography.Furthermore, this attitude is one which has beenheard before in\nthese cases: the harm has already been done to the child; the accusedhas not\ndone anything to the child by viewing the images; what is wrong withwatching\nimages of something that has already happened?Obviously thisjustification\nwould apply equally to downloading child pornography, making itavailable to\nothers, and all similar offences other than the original sexual assaulton the\nchild.What, really, is the harm?[11]Because this is a frequently-encountered question, I will be as clear as\nI can be in answering it.It is important that Mr. Stupnikoff, and others who\nmay be tempted to excuse their viewing of child pornography with this same\njustification, understand exactly what the harm is.[12]As has been said before, possession of child pornography creates the\nmarket for child pornography.[4]Whether\nmoney changes hands or not, child pornography appears to respond to the simple\nlaw of supply and demand: people like the accused, although not creators of\nchild pornography, create a demand for child pornography and thus stimulate its\nproduction.It is in this very real and important way that the remarks\nattributed to Professor Flanagan are wrong when he allegedly said that people\nwho view child pornography “do\nnot harm another person”.[13]Placing the conversation in terms of economic analysis makes it seem\nvery dry and theoretical, and indeed quite sanitized.Talking of supposed harm\nas a matter of supply and demand, postulating probable market responses to demand\nby consumers: this discussion could be taking place in a dusty classroom,\ncomplete with chalkboards and an afternoon sun making listeners doze in their\nchairs.[14]This is a matter which is far from dry, academic or unrelated to real\npeople.To put the matter in more concrete terms, because of the accused and\npeople like him there are almost certainly children, including infants,\ntoddlers, and babies, somewhere in the world, right this instant, being raped.At the very moment that you, the reader, are reading this, unspeakable horrors,\nwhich will scar these children physically and mentally for life, are being\nvisited upon them for the pleasure of Darrel Stupnikoff and others like him.The bodies of these children are too small to accept the adult erections, or\nother items, being forced into them.The flesh of these children is being torn\napart, their blood is being spilt, because Mr. Stupnikoff and his ilk enjoy\nwatching it.[15]Nor is the harm confined to the acts themselves, horrible as those are.Among the images of child pornography which I have had to view as a member of\nthis Court, including in the present matter, I have seen any number which\ninvolved children with expressions on their faces that are, in context,\ndisturbing in a completely different way.[16]Raising children is a difficult task, with many pitfalls and problems.In one sense, however, it is very easy: children simply want to be loved.In\ngeneral, children respond to being loved, and repay that love with trust, love\nand a desire to please.Many of the images I have seen, including in this\ncase, are not of children being forced.Some children, even in the midst of\nthe most appalling imagery, are looking at the person holding the camera with\nthe same expression they might have when giving a parent a home-made birthday\ncard: “Look what I did\nfor you.Are you pleased with me?Did I make you happy?”In some ways, these\nimages are among the hardest to view, because the child seems to have been\nmanipulated into acts which many adults would find repulsive, in an attempt to\nmake the person behind the camera happy, to love them more.[17]The depth of the betrayal implicit in those images is almost\ninconceivable.The lifelong consequences of that betrayal can only be\nimagined.Yet it is that betrayal which Mr. Stupnikoff has helped to create,\nby his demand for child pornography.The harm of making available child pornography[18]The harm in possessing child pornography is then compounded by\ndistributing or making available this material.Obviously, this either\nactually or potentially places the material in the hands of still more\nviewers.The effects of having evidence of such abuse in the hands of others\nhas been the subject of considerable judicial comment.In R. v. Kwok[5],\nthe Court received a victim impact statement from a girl (“M.A.”) whose abuse had been recorded and\ndistributed.To quote the judge in that case, who in turn quotes M. A.:.\n. .the statement is a poignant description of the particularly heinous\nvictimization of children that occurs when their degradation is photographed\nand placed on the Internet. I am confident that these feelings would be shared\nby any child, or indeed adult, who was treated in this way. M.A.'s statement\nreads, in part,The absolute worse (sic) thing about everything that happened\nto me was that Matthew [her abuser] put my pictures on the internet. He traded\nthem with other people like baseball cards. What kind of people want to see\npictures of a little girl being abused in this way? ... I know that these\npictures will never end and that my \"virtual abuse\" will go on\nforever.[6][19]“What kind of\npeople want to see pictures of a little girl being abused in this way?”Well, Mr. Stupnikoff\nwants to see it.As M.A. eloquently describes, her virtual abuse at the hands\nof Mr. Stupnikoff and those like him will never end.[20]Even the possibility that distribution might occur is traumatic.As\nstated by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. D.G.F.[7]:Obviously sexual abuse of a child by a parent is likely to\nhave a significant psychological effect on the child. However, the additional\ntrauma is caused by the child knowing that her photos are out in the public\ndomain where unknown numbers of people around the world may be able to access\nthem, and, in this case, know the child's name. It was unclear on the evidence\nwhether anything transmitted in the conversation with the officer to a chat\nroom that was immediately disabled could be available to be seen in the future.\nHowever, the victims have ongoing fear and uncertainty regarding what remains\naccessible on the internet and to whom. It amounts to ongoing psychological\nvictimization of all the children involved.[21]The idea that viewing child pornography is a harmless matter would be\nlaughable, were it not so tragically harmful and wrong.Mr. Stupnikoff has\nhelped create the market for this harm, by collecting it, and has fed the\nmarket, by making child pornography available.He has managed to sin on both\nsides of the supply and demand equation.Making available charge - evidentiary issue[22]The essence of the “possession\nfor the purpose of distribution”\ncharge is that Mr. Stupnikoff allowed others to upload child pornography from\nhis computer, via the file-sharing program which he also used for downloading.This program, called “eMule”, was the subject of some\nconfusion at the sentencing hearing.Mr. Stupnikoff advised his counsel, who\nadvised me, that the setting used by Mr. Stupnikoff for allowing uploading,\nnamely 20 KB/second, was not the maximum setting: that is, that he deliberately\nchose to restrict the speed at which others could obtain files from him.Furthermore, he asserted through counsel, he only set an upload speed at all\nbecause the eMule program will not allow downloads unless it is also set to\nallow uploads.Defence counsel hurriedly consulted with one of the police\nofficers involved in investigations of this nature, and advised me that the\nofficer had confirmed this information.Crown counsel also accepted this.[23]This information seemed to be offered in mitigation: Mr. Stupnikoff\nwould have me believe that he deliberately made it difficult for others to\nobtain child pornography from him, and that the only reason he made it possible\nat all was so that he could continue his own collecting.[24]I accept that this is counsel’s\nunderstanding.Still, I am puzzled by Exhibit P-5, which shows screen captures\nfrom the eMule program.One, showing Mr. Stupnikoff’s customized settings, shows 1,000 KB/second\nas the download capacity limit, and 20 KB/second as the upload capacity limit.Immediately to the right of those two numbers are sliders, which appear to\nallow the user to vary those capacities.Both sliders are set all the way to\nthe right, which in normal computer usage would mean that both are set to\nmaximum capacity; yet Mr. Stupnikoff says that in fact this is the minimum\nupload speed which would still have allowed him to download.By convention, a\nslider set to the minimum would be all the way to the left, not the right;\nfurthermore, by convention sliders immediately under and above each other would\noperate in the same way.In other words, I would have expected that if the\nslider moved all the way to the right sets a minimum for uploading, the\ncorresponding slider for downloading, immediately above it, would be set up the\nsame way, with the minimum setting being all the way to the right.Since the\ndownload slider is all the way to the right, and the download speed is shown as\n1,000 KB/second, this would mean that 1,000 KB/second is the minimum download\nspeed the eMule program will allow.This seems unlikely, particularly in light\nof the information referred to below regarding default settings.[25]This statement of Mr. Stupnikoff’s,\nthat he had to set an upload speed in order to download, sits awkwardly beside\nthe other screen capture on P-5.That screen capture shows the default\nsettings for the eMule program.It shows that the program, when installed,\nautomatically sets itself to download at a speed of 96 KB/second, and upload at\na speed of 0 KB/second.On the face of it, then, this file-sharing program\nseems to be set by default to download files at a certain speed without\nallowing any uploading at all; yet this is completely contrary to the\ninformation provided by Mr. Stupnikoff, apparently confirmed by the police and\naccepted by all counsel.[26]Parenthetically, I note that the default settings do not include the\nsliders referred to above, so it is not possible to compare them with Mr.\nStupnikoff’s\ncustomized settings.[27]On the face of P-5, then, Mr. Stupnikoff’s\nstatement is incorrect.I have to consider the fact that it has been presented\nto me both by his own counsel and by the Crown.Of course, P-5 has been put\nforward in the same manner.If I considered the issue to be of sufficient\nimportance, I would reconvene the sentencing hearing and ask counsel to explain\nthe apparent contradiction.It may be, for example, that I am misunderstanding\nP-5, or that I misheard counsel.I have concluded that I do not need to hear\nfurther from counsel on this point.The information was offered in mitigation;\nthe mitigation, if any, is extremely minor.The best that can be said for Mr.\nStupnikoff’s position\nis that he required other lovers of child pornography to wait a bit longer to\nsatisfy their urges; he was not, however, willing to give up his own\ndownloading in order to prevent others from obtaining files from him.Aggravating and mitigating factors[28]In mitigation is Mr. Stupnikoff’s\nguilty plea.There is no suggestion that there were significant flaws in the\nCrown’s case that\nmight have jeopardized a conviction, nor of course were there vulnerable\nwitnesses who were thus spared the ordeal of testifying in court.Nonetheless,\nMr. Stupnikoff was entitled to put the Crown to the proof of its case, with the\nalways-present possibility that something might have come up that could have\nresulted in a not-guilty verdict; as Mr. Stupnikoff gave up that possibility,\nhe is entitled to some credit for his decision.[29]He is employed, with a supportive spouse.[30]Mr. Stupnikoff was only marginally cooperative with police, and that\nonly once it was clear that he was well and truly caught.No accused is\nrequired to cooperate with police; however, by choosing not to do so, Mr.\nStupnikoff is also not entitled to any credit in terms of mitigation.[31]There are two factors which are significantly aggravating.The first is\nthe size of Mr. Stupnikoff’s\ncollection of child pornography.The second, and more significant, factor is\nthat this is a second offence.As indicated above, Mr. Stupnikoff was\nconvicted in 2005 of possession of child pornography.He duly attended\nprogramming as directed until the end of his sentence, and was a model\nparticipant.He participated, he did the work: he did everything expected of\nhim.He discussed with program staff the possibility of re-offending, and was\nalive to that risk.Then, as soon as he was freed from court-ordered\nconditions, he dropped the programming entirely.He chose not to participate\nin the voluntary, “maintenance” support group, and instead\nvirtually immediately began collecting child pornography again.It certainly\nappears that he was simply waiting for his time to expire; he could hardly wait\nto begin re-offending.Indeed, this time he went further:rather than simply\ncollecting, as he had been convicted in 2005 of doing, he was now sharing it\nwith others.Precedents for sentencing[32]The amount of child pornography is often cited in sentencing decisions\ninvolving child pornography.Mr. Stupnikoff’s\ncollection, at roughly 80,000 files, is the second-largest I have noted in the\ncase reports, although it is dwarfed by the 880,000 sexually explicit images\nand videos of children found in R. v. Allen[8].I do not propose to make an extensive review of past cases, comparing the\nnumber of images or videos and the sentences given, for three reasons.[33]Firstly, it is my perception that sentences for these types of offences\nhave been moving upward recently, partly as a result of recent amendments to\nthe Criminal Code, and partly perhaps as a result of the increasing\nfrequency with which such charges seem to be appearing before the courts.Cases more than a few years old may therefore be of less assistance in deciding\nsentences now.Amendments to the Code which increased the minimum\npunishment are presumably acting in the inflationary way referred to by the\nSupreme Court of Canada in R. v. Morrisey[9]\n(referring to firearms offences, but with comments applicable to any change in\nmandatory minimum sentences):.\n. . the mandatory minimum sentences for firearms‑related offences must\nact as an inflationary floor, setting a new minimum punishment applicable to\nthe so‑called \"best\" offender whose conduct is caught by these\nprovisions. The mandatory minimum must not become the standard sentence imposed\non all but the very worst offender who has committed the offence in the very\nworst circumstances. The latter approach would not only defeat the intention of\nParliament in enacting this particular legislation, but also offend against the\ngeneral principles of sentencing designed to promote a just and fair sentencing\nregime and thereby advance the purposes of imposing criminal sanctions.[34]Furthermore, as has been recognized by other courts, the jurisprudence\nin this area is tending toward greater penalties.See, for example, the\ncomments of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. D.G.F.[10][35]Secondly, it is also my perception that the size of these collections\nhas been growing.I speculate that this is a reflection of the increasing\navailability of high-speed internet access and the concurrent plunge in the\nprice of digital storage media:the ability to download (and upload) child\npornography has greatly increased at the same time as the cost of storing it\nhas greatly declined.Older cases, where those factors were not present, may\nnot be of as much assistance as a result.Similarly, at one time the nature of\nthe material in the collection was of significance in sentencing: some were\nlargely of simple nudity, and therefore not as aggravating as others, such as\nthose which focussed on or included bondage, torture or bestiality.With large\ncollections such as Mr. Stupnikoff’s,\nI believe those factors are no longer as important: with larger collections,\nthere are likely to be images or videos of all kinds.Certainly, Mr.\nStupnikoff’s was\nsignificantly worse than mere nudity, containing even in the relatively-random\nselection shown to me scenes of penetration and bondage.Again, decisions\nfrom even several years ago may therefore not be directly relevant.[36]Thirdly, the size of an accused’s\ncollection cannot give rise to any suggestion of “tariff\nsentencing”, of a\ncertain amount of jail time for every hundred images, for example.In addition\nto any other issues, the idea becomes unworkable at both the bottom and top\nends of the quantity scale.It is not viable to suggest that, as Mr.\nStupnikoff now is convicted of having ten times the amount of child pornography\nhe had previously, he should receive a sentence ten times as long; or that, as\nhe had one-tenth the amount of Mr. Allen, that he should receive a sentence\none-tenth as long.Even attempting to assign tariffs on the basis of a\nlogarithmic progression would quickly become unworkable.[37]In my view, the amount of child pornography is relevant, but not in a “tariff” way.It gives scope to\nthe harm I referred to earlier.If collecting creates demand, than larger\ncollections create greater demand; if every viewing or downloading compounds\nthe original harm done, then larger amounts of child pornography equate to larger\namounts of compounding.Additionally, the fact that Mr. Stupnikoff collected\nover 80,000 unique files in just over five years speaks to the degree of\ninterest, or obsession, which Mr. Stupnikoff has in child pornography.This is\nclearly part of the circumstances of the offender which must be taken into\naccount in sentencing.Finally, an accused could theoretically face a separate\ncount of possession for each image or video of child pornography: in Mr.\nStupnikoff’s case,\nover 80,000 potential charges, not even considering any “make available”\ncharges.The logistics alone would be overwhelming, not to mention that the\ntotality principle would make any such charging decision pointless.However, a\nhigher sentence for a greater number of files is warranted to reflect this\nlegal jeopardy.The fact that Mr. Stupnikoff had 80,000 files is perhaps\nlittle different than if he was found with 60,000 or 90,000 files; yet it is\nsignificantly different than if he had instead accumulated 100 files of child\npornography.[38]Having said that, I propose to examine two categories of precedents: (1)\ndecisions involving repeat child-pornography offenders, and; (2) recent\nSaskatchewan decisions.Repeat offenders[39]I have been able to locate very few child pornography sentencing\ndecisions involving a repeat offender.Given the sadly-large number of\nreported decisions on child pornography, I simply may have been unable to\nlocate them.There are some which have come to my attention, however.[40]The oldest of these cases is R. v. Schneider[11],\na 2008 case from the Ontario Court of Justice.Mr. Schneider had been\nconvicted in 1995 of making child pornography, and given a suspended sentence.He was convicted in 2008 of one count of accessing child pornography.As stated\nby Wong J. in referring to the prior conviction:Although\nthe offence was committed over 13 years ago, it is alarming that Mr. Schneider\nwould ever even consider possessing child pornography again. Convictions such\nas those related to child pornography carry with them such stigma, public\nhumiliation, and revulsion, that the courts typically expect an offender once\nfound guilty to never re‑offend. It is difficult to think of any other\nCriminal Code offences for which there is such general consensus and public\ncondemnation. Yet, Mr. Schneider was not deterred when he was found guilty and\nsentenced in 1995 to a period of probation. It is necessary, therefore, for\nthis Court today to send the message to Mr. Schneider clearly and unequivocally\nthat society will not tolerate his crime.[12][41]Mr. Schneider had a total of 689 videos and 85 images of child\npornography.[42]Crown and defence agreed that three years probation was appropriate, but\ndiffered on the amount of time the accused should spend in custody.The Crown’s position was six to 12\nmonths, while defence argued for a 90-day intermittent sentence.The Court,\nafter referring to the previous conviction as the “most aggravating”[13]\nfactor in deciding the sentence, ordered six months in custody (less 10 days\nfor time served), followed by three years of probation.[43]R. v. Wanamaker[14] is a 2011\ndecision from the Alberta Court of Queen’s\nBench.Mr. Wanamaker was found guilty, after trial, of possessing and\naccessing child pornography.His collection was comprised of 38 videos and “thousands” of images, apparently all\nof young girls dressed and posed provocatively, and four images of\npost-pubescent female children in sexually-explicit poses.He had been\nconvicted in 2007 of possession of child pornography, and sentenced to 22\nmonths.He also had a record for other offences, including incest and\nbreaching probation.The Court sentenced Mr. Wanamaker to two years less a\nday, plus three years probation.It appears from the discussion in the case\nthat this term was imposed because it was the longest the trial judge felt able\nto impose while still imposing probation.[15]In order to give this term of imprisonment, the Court explicitly gave no credit\nfor eight months’\nremand time, although this was expressed as a feature of “denunciation”.[16]The effective length of incarceration, even crediting pretrial detention at\n1:1, was in essence two years, eight months.The refusal to give credit for\npretrial custody was held on appeal to be an error, and the sentence reduced\naccordingly.[17][44]Next in time is another Ontario Court of Justice case, R. v.\nTackaberry, also from 2011.The accused had a record for sexual assaults\non children, both as a youth and as an adult, although the last was from 1997.In 2008, he received a sentence of 18 months for possession of child\npornography.He pled guilty in 2011 to two counts of possession of child pornography,\narising from his possession of 150 images and two videos.A joint submission\nwas accepted for two years custody, in addition to over 16 months of remand\ntime, a designation as a long-term offender anda long-term supervision order\nfor eight years.[45]In R. v. Marks[18], a 2011 oral\ndecision from the Ontario Court of Justice, the accused had been convicted in\n2007 of possession of child pornography, making child pornography and two\ncounts of distributing child pornography.At that time, he had been sentenced\nto one year in jail, followed by three years of probation.The probation\nincluded no pornography.In 2010, he was found in possession of approximately\n1,000 photographs and 10 videos of child pornography, as well as adult\npornography.He pled guilty to possession of child pornography and breach of\nprobation.The accused had apparently taken a number of steps to attempt to\ndeal with issues driving his use of child pornography.The Court acceded to a\njoint submission for two years less a day, followed by three years probation.[46]The Ontario Court of Justice gave a decision in 2012 in R. v.\nHutchings.[19]Mr.\nHutchings pled guilty to one count of possession of child pornography, one\ncount of accessing the same, two counts of distributing, and two counts of\nbreach of probation.The breaches were of conditions relating to computer\nuse.Mr. Hutchings had been convicted in 2010 for a single count of possession\nof child pornography, for which he had received a sentence of 4 ½ months in custody and\nthree years probation.It appears that he began collecting child pornography\nwithin a month of his release on probation, and in less than a year had\naccumulated over 60,000 unique images and “several\nhundred” videos.Including remand time, the accused was sentenced to a total of three years.Of\nthat figure, three months seems to be directly attributable to the breaches of\nprobation[20];\neffectively, therefore, the comparable sentence for the purposes of Mr.\nStupnikoff’s\nsentencing was 33 months.There are two striking parallels between Mr.\nHutchings’ situation\nand that of Mr. Stupnikoff: the fact that the offending behaviour resumed very\nquickly, and the size of the collection amassed.There are also differences,\nincluding the fact that Mr. Hutchings began re-offending while still on\nconditions, whereas Mr. Stupnikoff waited until he was off conditions.Recent Saskatchewan decisions[47]In 2009, Gabrielson J. of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen’s Bench gave an oral\ndecision in R. v. Johannson[21].Mr.\nJohannson pled guilty to three counts of possession of child pornography and\nwas convicted after trial of two counts of making child pornography available.He was 28, and had no record. This was one of the first cases in Saskatchewan\nof “make available” via file-sharing, and\narose by the accused failing to change the settings on his file-sharing\nprogram.The sharing took place over approximately one and a half years.Mr.\nJohannson’s collection\nwhen apprehended amounted to 46 files, of a nature not extreme for this type of\noffence.He was sentenced to a total of one year imprisonment and three years\nprobation.[48]R. v. Tomacek is another 2009 Saskatchewan Queen’s Bench decision.As the\ndecision involved simply whether or not an order should be made under s. 161 of\nthe Criminal Code, there are not a lot of circumstances set out.The\naccused pled guilty to making available video and still images of child\npornography over roughly a three-week period, and a joint submission was\naccepted by the Court of one year of incarceration followed by two years of\nprobation.[49]With respect to both of the above cases, I note that the one year\npenalty was the minimum allowed by the Criminal Code.[50]There are three cases reported from Saskatchewan in 2012, beginning with\nthe Court of Appeal’s\ndecision in R. v. Benson.[22]Mr. Benson\nwas 18, and was convicted after trial in 2010 of two counts of possession of,\nand one count of making available, child pornography.The accused had no\nrecord, and had a “large\nquantity”[23]\nof child pornography.The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge’s sentence of 15 months and\nthree years probation.[51]The first Court of Queen’s\nBench decision from Saskatchewan last year was R. v. Pattison[24].Mr. Pattison was 22, with no related record.He had been viewing child\npornography since he was 14, and was found to have 4,380 child pornography files.He pled guilty to 53 counts, which involved possession of child pornography,\nmaking it available to others, distribution of it, accessing it and producing\nit, the latter by way of written material he authored.He was an active\nsharer, catering to specific requests from others for certain types of child\npornography.He was sentenced to a total of five years, less five months for\nremand credit.[52]Following Pattison by just over a month was R. v. Lorenz[25],\nanother decision of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen’s Bench.The accused, who was 42, pled guilty\nto a single count of possession of child pornography.He was found in\npossession of 449 unique photographs and nine unique videos, all of child\npornography.He also admitted to having viewed and deleted a vast amount of\nchild pornography.Mr. Lorenz, although acknowledging through his guilty plea\nthat his actions were criminal, did not seem to understand that any actual harm\nhad been done by his viewing of child pornography, and seemed to have no\nremorse.There are obvious parallels with the case at bar.Mr. Lorenz was\nsentenced to nine months’\nincarceration and three years of probation.[53]In reviewing the above cases, I have also of course had the advantage of\ntheir summaries of other cases, which I have noted but not cited directly in\nthis decision.[54]As can be seen, some of the decisions referred to were the result of\njoint submissions.I do not consider them to have the same precedential value\nas cases in which the sentencing judge came to their own decision as to an\nappropriate penalty.As is well-known both to counsel and to the Court, a\njoint submission is to be given very serious consideration by the sentencing\njudge, and rejected only if it would be clearly inappropriate, such as where it\nis demonstrably unfit, would be contrary to the public interest or would bring\nthe administration of justice into disrepute.[26]The range of “not clearly\ninappropriate” can be\nquite broad, such that the sentence imposed by virtue of a joint submission may\nbe significantly different than what the Court would have imposed in its\nabsence.Since a sentence imposed as a result of a joint submission is\ntherefore not the result of unfettered judicial reasoning, I think it should be\ngiven less weight as a precedent.[55]Counsel have referred me to a number of other cases, and I have reviewed\nadditional cases as well.Although I do not propose to refer to the details,\nin deciding this matter I have had reference to the following, in addition to\nthe decisions cited elsewhere in this decision: R. v. Pelich[27];\nR. v. L.A.W.[28]; R. v.\nHouston[29]; R. v.\nJohansen[30]; R. v.\nP.M.V.[31]; R. v.\nBock[32]; R. v.\nHilderman[33]; R. v.\nButler[34]; R. v.\nBlatchley[35]; R. v.\nClayton[36]; and R.\nv. Dean[37].Conclusion[56]In reaching my decision, I have considered all of the above matters, as\nwell as the sentencing provisions outlined in sections 718, 718.01, 718.1 and\n718.2 of the Criminal Code.I have concluded that, particularly for a\nsecond-time offender, the principles of denunciation and deterrence must be\nuppermost in the Court’s\nmind.[57]Mr. Stupnikoff has never been incarcerated: his previous sentence was a\nconditional sentence, which he served without breach.It was completely unsuccessful\nin getting the message through to him.He took all of the programming, did all\nthe work, was assessed at a very low likelihood to re-offend, and could not\nwait to get off of conditions and begin collecting child pornography again.This time around he went further, making it available to others as well.[58]Over the course of the next several years, he dedicated a large part of\nhis time and effort to collecting child pornography, amassing what is by\ncurrent standards an extremely large collection.In so doing, he re-victimized\nevery child depicted, and encouraged the abuse of still more children.He went\non to make various of his files available to others for download, compounding\nthe re-victimization.His remorse, such as it is, is directed to his wife and\nfriends, for the embarrassment he has caused them.The children whose betrayal\nand mutilation he has encouraged have received not a word from him.Despite\nall of the effort devoted to and by him following his last conviction, he has\nno understanding of the harm of collecting or passing on child pornography, and\nno empathy, no compassion for his victims.His attitude is shared by many\npeople.[59]There has been a clear signal from Parliament that sentences for child\npornography need to be higher.There is a clear trend in the courts along the\nsame lines.Mr. Stupnikoff needs to be deterred from repeating these offences\nyet again, and others need to understand that should they choose to commit such\noffences, the consequences will be significant; if they choose to offend again,\nthe consequences will be severe.[60]Parliament has said that the maximum sentence for the offence of making\navailable child pornography is ten years.Considering all of the above, the\nappropriate sentence for Mr. Stupnikoff is five years incarceration on that\ncharge, and I sentence him accordingly.With respect to the charge of\npossession of child pornography, I sentence him to a concurrent term of four\nyears incarceration.After credit for five months of remand time, Mr.\nStupnikoff has four years, seven months left to serve.[61]The Crown has asked for an order under s. 161 of the Criminal Code\nfor life; defence argues for an order for less than this.In favour of his\nposition is the fact that Mr. Stupnikoff has never been convicted of any\noffences against children personally, nor are there any allegations that he has\ndone anything of that nature.In addition, he is of an age where the courts\nsometimes expect that sexual offending may start to decrease due to age.On\nthe other hand, he now has two convictions within a short period, suggesting\nthat his sexual urges with respect to children are not in fact decreasing.I\nbelieve it appropriate that the duration of the order should be 15 years.As\nit begins to run once Mr. Stupnikoff is released from custody, he will be in\nthe range of 70 years old when it ceases.I believe that this will be sufficient\nfor the protection of the public, and in particular children, for whose benefit\ns. 161 exists.[62]I therefore make the following orders:(a)taking of DNA pursuant to s.\n487.051(a) of the Criminal Code;(b)a lifetime Sex Offender\nInformation Registration Act order pursuant to s. 490.012 of the Criminal\nCode;(c)an order pursuant to s. 161(1)(a)\n- (c) of the Criminal Code for a period of 15 years;(d)a forfeiture order in the terms of\nthe draft order filed, defence having consented to the same.[63]As Mr. Stupnikoff is going to be incarcerated for a considerable period\nof time, I waive the usual surcharges.________________________Q.D.\nAgnew, J[1]S. 163.1(3) Every person who transmits, makes available, distributes, sells,\nadvertises, imports, exports or possesses for the purpose of transmission,\nmaking available, distribution, sale, advertising or exportation any child\npornography is guilty of(a) an indictable offence and liable\nto imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years and to a minimum punishment\nof imprisonment for a term of one year; or(b) an offence punishable on summary\nconviction and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years\nless a day and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of six\nmonths.S. 163.1 (4) Every person who possesses any child\npornography is guilty of(a) an indictable offence and is\nliable to imprisonment for a term of not more than five years and to a minimum\npunishment of imprisonment for a term of six months; or(b) an offence punishable on summary\nconviction and is liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 18 months\nand to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of 90 days.[2]The accused had a total of approximately 1.5 million image and\nvideo files; obviously, the possibility exists that there is more child\npornography within the roughly 1.4 million files which have not yet been\nexamined.Since nothing is known of those other files, however, they play no\nrole in this sentencing.[3]The Globe and Mail, March 1, 2013, p. A3.See also CBC TV, The\nNational, February 28, 2013.Professor Flanagan is reported also to be a\nCBC commentator and a columnist for The Globe and Mail.[4]R. v.

That decision also contained the following comments specifically\nwith respect to the harm done by child pornography (at paragraph 158):The very existence of\nchild pornography, as it is defined by s. 163.1(1) of the Criminal Code,\nis inherentlyharmful to children and to society.This harm exists\nindependently of dissemination or any risk of dissemination and flows directly\nfrom the existence of the pornographic representations, which on their own\nviolate the dignity and equality rights of children.The harm of child\npornography is inherent because degrading, dehumanizing, and objectifying\ndepictions of children, by their very existence, undermine the Charter\nrights of children and other members of society.Child pornography eroticises\nthe inferior social, economic, and sexual status of children.It preys on\npreexisting inequalities.[5][2007]\nO.J.

Castellani,)for the accused))))HEARD:March 29, 2004wolder J.:[1]The defendant, Steven Jack Minns, stands\nbefore me today to be sentenced for robbing an Esso gas bar attendant on the\nlate evening of August 5, 2003 in Oakville, Ontario.The Crown asks that the\ndefendant be sentenced to custody for a period of 12 months.Counsel for the\ndefendant asks this court to consider suspending sentence and placing him on\nprobation or, in the alternative, considering a conditional sentence.background[2]On the late evening of August 5, 2003, the\ndefendant, who had been involved with the use of crack cocaine since late 2001,\nwas coming off a cocaine high when he decided that he wanted to obtain more\ncrack cocaine.He had no more money.He then decided to get the necessary\nmoney by holding up a local Esso gar bar.He did so by placing a plastic bag\nover his right hand suggesting that he had a gun in the bag and threatened to\nshoot the gas station attendant if the gas station attendant did not hand over money\nto him.As a result, the gas station attendant handed over approximately $150\nto the defendant.The defendant was subsequently identified as a result of\nimages taken through the video security camera and in November 2003, he was\narrested for this offence.The defendant accepted responsibility for his role\nin this offence and pleaded guilty.history of defendant[3]The defendant, his wife and a family friend,\nJanet Hamilton, all testified on behalf of the defendant at the sentencing\nhearing.In addition, I have considered the pre-sentence report prepared for\nthe court and the Victim Impact Statement prepared by the victim of this\noffence.[4]The defendant is 43 years of age.He has\nbeen married to his wife, Cindy Minns, for 16 years.They have one child of\nthis relationship, a four-year-old daughter.Up to 2001, the family fared\nrelatively well in that the defendant had full time employment earning $30,000\nto $40,000 per year while his wife worked full time as a medical secretary and\ntranscriptionist earning about $40,000 per year.In the past, the defendant\nhad had some negative experiences with excessive consumption of alcohol.On\nAugust 31, 1988, he was convicted of impaired driving, receiving a fine and a\n12 month driving prohibition.He was again convicted about 7 years later on\nJune 15, 1995 for driving with more than 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100\nmillilitres of blood for which he was fined and received a further 12-month driving\nprohibition.In 1981, he received his first criminal conviction for mischief\nfor which he received two years probation.[5]The record therefore demonstrates that the\ndefendant already had a criminal record which reflected his abuse of a\npotentially addictive substance, namely alcohol.[6]In late 2001, the defendant was introduced\nto the use of crack cocaine by a friend.He so enjoyed the high that it gave\nhim that he continued the use of crack cocaine on a regular, though infrequent,\nbasis.At first he used it about once per month, but by February 2003, he had\nincreased his usage to every third day.By that time, the respondent’s wife\nlearned about his use of cocaine as a result of the economic impact that it was\nhaving upon the family.Each use was costing him at least $100 and was\ndepleting the family finances.In addition to depleting the family finances,\nhis cocaine use started affecting his judgment.The defendant quit his job.His wife removed his debit and credit cards and his access to cash so that he\ncould not continue his habit.In addition, the defendant started participating\nin the Credit Valley Hospital Alcohol and Drug Treatment Program operated by\nDr. Gange.Notwithstanding that he had entered the Alcohol and Drug Treatment\nProgram, the defendant experienced several relapses.Each time that he relapsed,\nhe managed to somehow find enough money to continue to purchase cocaine for his\nown use.On the day of the offence, the defendant had obtained and used a hit\nof crack cocaine and was coming off a high.He felt the need to acquire more\ncrack cocaine so he could continue in his state of euphoria.He claims that\nthis was the first time that his craving for the drug had developed to such an\nextent that he felt the urgent need to use a second dose of crack cocaine\nduring the same day.Since he had no cash or access to money and since he\ncould not hope to get any money for his continuing drug habit from his wife,\nhe, while still under the influence of the use of cocaine, impulsively\nformulated a plan to get money by robbing the Esso gas bar.He then acted on\nthe plan by obtaining a plastic bag which he put over his hand, entered the gas\nbar and demanded money from the gas bar attendant, threatening to shoot him if\nhe failed to hand over the money.The attendant handed over the money and the\ndefendant was able to and did secure more cocaine.About two weeks later, the\ndefendant was arrested as a result of having been identified from the video\nsurveillance camera at the Esso gas bar.[7]Once the defendant was arrested for this\noffence, he fully understood the extent of his addiction and he started taking\nthe treatment option seriously.From November 10 to 26, 2003, he attended an\nin-patient substance abuse treatment program at the New Port Centre at the\nNiagara Health System in Port Colborne, General Hospital Site.In addition, he\ncontinued to participate in the alcohol and drug treatment program at the\nCredit Valley Hospital supervised by Dr. Gange and Declan Conway, the\nnurse/therapist.He also started attending Narcotics Anonymous meetings\nregularly. In addition, he started participating in a self-help group called\nCAST (clear and sober thinking).He also became involved with the Unity Church\nof Mississauga and as a result of his involvement with the church, the\ndefendant has been chairing meetings of CAST and hosting sessions at the\nchurch.Therefore, he has taken on a leadership role in helping others deal\nwith addiction to drugs.sentencing options[8]The Crown asks this court to impose a\nstraight custodial sentence of 12 months against the accused for this offence.Counsel for the defendant asks this court to suspend sentence and allow the\ndefendant to be released on a period of probation or, in the alternative, asks\nthe court to consider a conditional sentence which will allow the defendant to\ncontinue his rehabilitation in the community.[9]Considering the seriousness of this\noffence, the impact that it had upon the victim combined with the defendant’s\ncriminal history, I find that a suspended sentence with probation is not a fit\nsentence in this case.I have reserved my decision in order to consider\nwhether a conditional sentence would be a fit sentence in the circumstances of\nthis case and of this particular offender.[10]In asking this court to consider imposing a\nconditional sentence, counsel for the defendant relies upon the Supreme Court\nof Canada’s decision in R. v. Proulx, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII).[11]In the summary on paragraph 127 of the\ndecision, the court stated that:No offences are\nexcluded from the conditional sentencing regime except those with a minimum\nterm of imprisonment, nor should there be presumptions in favour of or against\na conditional sentence for specific offences.[12]Accordingly, I agree that a finding of guilt\nfor robbery, in this case, does not prohibit the court from considering the\nimposition of a conditional sentence upon this accused.[13]In considering the sentencing principles set\nout in section 742.1(b) of the Criminal Code, I am satisfied that the\nconduct of the accused on the night in question was out of character for him\nand was based upon an impulsive decision made while he was still under the\ninfluence of drugs.Based upon the numerous steps that the defendant has taken\nsince his arrest to attempt to rehabilitate himself and to prevent further\nconflict with the law, combined with the fact that he has managed to abstain\nabsolutely from the consumption of both alcohol and drugs since November 2003,\nI am satisfied that the safety of the community would not be endangered by the\ndefendant serving his sentence in the community.I am satisfied that a\nconditional sentence of appropriate length is capable of providing sufficient\ngeneral deterrence in the context of this case in order to make a conditional\nsentence a fit sentence.In coming to this conclusion, I rely upon the decision\nof the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in R. v. Bratzer (2001), 2001 NSCA 166 (CanLII), 160 C.C.C.\n(3d) 272, where the appellate court upheld the lower court’s imposition of a\nconditional sentence in a situation where the accused was charged with three\ncounts of armed robbery of gas stations where, in each case, the business was\nstaffed by a single employee and the accused had accomplices who were armed and\nmasked.In reaching its decision, the Nova Scotia appellate court considered\nand applied section 718.2(d) of the Criminal Code which requires judges\nto impose the least restrictive sanctions appropriate and section 718.2(e)\nwhich requires judges to consider all sanctions other than imprisonment.The\ncourt held that therefore previous cases dealing with armed robbery must be\nlooked at in this light.Therefore while the court, in the context of that\ncase, held that a sentence of two to three years’ imprisonment for a single\noffence of robbery in the context of that case would be an appropriate\nsentence, it held that a conditional sentence for armed robbery did not\nnecessarily amount to a sentence that was unfit.The court, therefore, refused\nto set aside the conditional sentence imposed at trial.[14]I therefore find that, in the context of\nthis case, a conditional sentence is consistent with the fundamental purposes\nand principles of sentencing set out in section 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal\nCode.I’m further satisfied that in the context of the facts of this case\nand this particular defendant, a conditional sentence can provide significant\ndenunciation and deterrence.I find that this is not such a case where the\nneed for denunciation or deterrence is so pressing that incarceration will be\nthe only suitable way in which to express society’s condemnation of the\noffender’s conduct or to deter similar conduct in the future.I have also\ntaken into consideration that this is the first timer that the offender ever\nused any unlawful means to feed his drug habit.[15]In this case, I have considered the Victim\nImpact Statement presented by the victim of this robbery.The victim was only\n18 years of age at the time and the incident had a great impact on him, leaving\nhim shaken and unsettled.He noted that the defendant has apologized to him in\nwriting in a letter sent to him through his manager.The letter of apology has\nrelieved him and it appears from his comments that he has forgiven Mr. Minns\nfor his conduct.[16]The Supreme Court of Canada in Proulx,\nsupra, concluded that a conditional sentence will be better than\nincarceration at achieving a restorative objective of rehabilitation,\nreparations to the victim and the community, and promoting a sense of\nresponsibility in the offender and acknowledging the harm done to the victim\nand the community.In this case, it is my view that a conditional sentence\nwill likely be more appropriate than incarceration in achieving a combination\nof both punitive and restorative objectives in sentencing.In this case,\ntherefore, while denunciation and deterrence are factors that I take into\nconsideration, I find that these factors are not so pressing as to require this\ncourt to remove the alternative conditional sentence as a sentencing option.[17]In summary, therefore, I find that the\naccused was seriously addicted to cocaine prior to the offence.I agree with\nthe Crown that Mr. Minn’s addiction had not advanced to the extent that he was\nusing cocaine each and every day, and that, although he had made some minimal attempts\nat treatment, his addiction was not so severe as to prevent him from still carrying\non with other aspects of his life.However, I find that his addiction was\nserious and had progressed to the point where it had affected his thinking processes\nand his ability to think rationally.From the fact that he had become capable\nof conducting himself in this dangerous and unlawful manner in order to feed\nhis drug habit, combined with the impact that the arrest for the robbery had\nupon him, I find that the defendant, in his own mind, had reached bottom.This motivated him to change and to become committed to use all his and the\ncommunity’s available resources to rehabilitate himself.He therefore entered\nthe drug treatment program, he returned to the Credit Valley Drug and Alcohol\nTreatment Program with a fresh commitment, he has remained alcohol and drug\nfree, he became involved with his church, and he has taken a leadership role in\npromoting addiction self-help groups such as CAST.He has demonstrated a\ncommitment to remain alcohol and drug free and to once more be a constructive,\ncontributing member of his community.His wife has stood by him and continues\nto play a powerful supportive role in his rehabilitation.Under all these circumstances,\nI have concluded that a conditional sentence with sufficiently restrictive\nterms of sufficient length of time will address all the necessary elements of\nsentencing, including general and specific deterrence, together with some\ndenunciation and rehabilitation.Therefore, I find a conditional sentence to\nbe a fit sentence for this offender.[18]Therefore, I impose the following sentence:The offender shall be imprisoned for the term of 12 months.The\ncourt, having considered an order pursuant to section 109 is applicable, herein\norders that the offender serve the imprisonment in the community subject to the\noffender complying with the following conditions, namely:(a)The offender shall:(i)Keep the peace and be of good behaviour;(ii)Appear before the court when required to do so\nby the court;(iii)Report within 2 working days, in person, to a\nsupervisor and thereafter report when required by the supervisor and in the\nmanner directed by the supervisor;(iv)Remain within the province of Ontario unless\nwritten permission to go outside the province is obtained from the Court or the\nsupervisor; and(v)Notify the supervisor in advance of any change\nof name or address and promptly notify the supervisor of any change in\nemployment or occupation.(b)In addition, the offender shall:(i)For the first six months of the conditional\nsentence of imprisonment, not be away from his lawful place of residence at any\ntime or times except in strict accordance with the following exceptions:1.genuine medical emergencies.2.medical/dental/legal i.e. solicitor appointments or court\nappearance requirements and direct travel as between his place of residence and\nthe place of such appointment (or required court appearance) and return.3.appointments to the supervisor, or to attend\nprescribed counselling sessions and direct travel as between his residence and\nthe place of such appointment or session and return.4.appointments to perform required community\nservice work and direct travel as between his residence and the place of\nperformance of such community service work and return.5.reasonably necessarily shopping which shall be\nconducted between the hours of 10:30 a.m. and 12:00 noon on Saturdays and\ndirect travel as between his residence and the place of such shopping and\nreturn and provided such is done in the presence of his wife.6.formal religious observance and direct travel as\nbetween his residence and the place of such formal religious observance and\nreturn.7.remunerative employment now secured or to be\nhereafter secured and direct travel (for the actual hours thereof) as between\nhis residence and the place of employment and return.8.such other absences for special purposes as may\nbe authorized from time to

carry upon\nhis person a copy of his conditional sentence order and any applicable letter\nof permission from the supervisor and produce such to a supervisor or peace\nofficer for inspection upon demand.(iii)Abstain from the consumption of alcohol and other\nintoxicating substances and abstain from the consumption of drugs except in\naccordance with medical prescriptions or except for

again, accepted on the basis of them having been read into\ncourt and agreed to by Mr. Ridgway.[3]By way\nof further background, this matter was before the court earlier.Mr. Ridgway had indicated his intention to proceed and it was adjourned\nover to ensure that a resolution could be reached and that Mr. Ridgway\nunderstood the results of this resolution.[4]The facts,\nvery briefly, as stated, are that on October 11, 2014, Mr. Ridgway was\nobserved operating a motor vehicle in an area that police found was somewhat\nodd.They followed up with an investigation and, ultimately, Mr. Ridgway\nprovided breath samples of 120 and 110 mg%.He was released, required to\nattend in court on December 3rd, and failed to attend.[5]On May\n13, 2015, he failed to attend court.[6]On June\n10, 2015, Mr. Ridgway broke into Northern Industrial Sales, through a concrete\nbrick wall, and took from there a welder and a wrench set that were not\nrecovered.[7]On June\nthe 14, 2015, Mr. Ridgway broke into Yukon Honda and took a number of items:two lawnmowers and two motorbikes in his first entry, and then attempted to\ndrive through the gate on a side-by-side motor vehicle.He ended up being\narrested and gave statements as to what he had done.He indicated that this\noffence had been committed to support his drug habit, and he acknowledged his\nresponsibility for damage to the chain link fence, the all-terrain side-by-side\nvehicle, and the gate.[8]Mr.\nRidgway has a lengthy and extensive criminal record.He is 46 years of age.His record has in excess of 40 theft and break‑and‑entry related\nconvictions, two prior impaired driving offences, and a number of other\noffences.He has served significant periods of time in custody, going back to\nas a youth where he had secure custody sentences.As an adult:12 month\nsentence; 30 month sentence on a robbery, six month sentence on possession of\nproperty charges; two years on break‑and‑enter and theft charges.Interestingly, there is a gap in his record from 2005 to 2013 when Mr. Ridgway\nwas running his own business and doing quite well.He then got into an\naccident and lost the ability to run his business, at which point in time his\nlife went significantly downhill and into substance abuse, which brings him\nbefore the court.[9]There\nwas a Pre‑Sentence Report filed.Mr. Ridgway has had a very difficult\nchildhood.During his childhood, there was abuse and neglect.There is no\ndoubt that being raised in the manner that he was, would have been extremely\ndifficult on a child and would have presented a number of obstacles to\ndeveloping a healthy life.These are obstacles that it appears Mr. Ridgway, at\none point in time, was able to surmount, which gives me hope that he can do it\nagain if he moves forward and just deals with life the best that he can to give\nhimself the best prospects for the future and not try to deal with it by\nnumbing himself to whatever pain exists, because that is not going to be\nhelpful to him.[10]Mr.\nRidgway has some support, but he tends to do a lot of things on his own.He\nshould take advantage of whatever supports are available to him.Mr. Ridgway\nmet with Ms. Bringsley, a psychologist, and she provided a helpful Report\nthat is attached to the Pre‑Sentence Report.The trauma that Mr. Ridgway\nexperienced and was subject to and witnessed as a child, appears to have\ncontinued when in custody during these various times, so it seems to be an\nalmost unbroken line of difficulty, except for a small period of time.He\nsuffers from significant medical issues and the resultant consequences.Ms. Bringsley states that he needs ongoing therapy to assist in managing\nhimself and to ensure he better understands his own behavioural presentation.He acknowledges that he needs treatment/counselling.[11]There\nis a joint submission before me that is, in all, a custodial disposition that\namounts to, I believe, 33½ months custody.That is on the high end of the\nrange for an offender in Mr. Ridgway's circumstances, taking into account the\naggravating and mitigating factors, but still within the range.[12]Crown\nwas also prepared to seek a sentence at the high territorial end after credit\nfor time served, which I note is nine months credit that he is entitled to.[13]Mr. Ridgway,\nbeing familiar with the federal system, and having been at the Whitehorse\nCorrectional Centre for quite a while, feels that in order to get the best\ncounselling that he can and to make the best strides forward in his\nrehabilitation, he would do better in a federal penitentiary.He has asked\nthat the Crown agree with him on a sentence that is longer, in order to allow\nhim to serve it federally.[14]I have\nquestioned Mr. Ridgway on this and I am satisfied that he is making a fully\ninformed decision.Were the sentence out of the range, I would not impose it\nregardless of the agreement of counsel.It is within the range and as such, I\nwill impose a sentence that has been put forward.[15]With\nrespect to the s. 253(1)(b) offence, the sentence will be four months, noted to\nbe his time served.[16]With\nrespect to the failure to appear, the sentence will be one and one half months\nconsecutive, time served.[17]So that\nis five and one half months of the time in custody.[18]With\nrespect to the first break‑and‑enter into Northern Industrial\nSales, that will be 14 months consecutive, of which three and one half\nmonths will be time served.That will leave him with 10½ months, and that is\nconsecutive.And then there would be an additional consecutive sentence of 14\nmonths on the break‑and‑enter into Yukon Honda.That leaves 24½\nmonths custody remaining to be served.[19]There\nwill be victim surcharges of $500.I will make them payable forthwith.I will\nnote you to be in default and I will order that you serve your default time\nconcurrent to the time you are going to be serving in custody, so a warrant of\ncommittal on the default will go forward.[DISCUSSION WITH COUNSEL][20]I am\ngoing to make a DNA order under this.It is minimally intrusive.No other\nancillary orders will go.[21]Crown\nis entering a stay of proceedings on the remaining files.[22]There\nwill be a driving prohibition.[23]All the\nother files to which pleas were not entered will be stayed.[24]There\nis a driving prohibition prohibiting you from operating a motor vehicle on any\nstreet, road, highway, or public place.[DISCUSSION WITH COUNSEL][25]I am\ngoing to make the driving prohibition for two years instead of three, but it is\nin addition to any period of imprisonment.__________________________COZENS T.C.J."}

(Orally)[1]On July 31, 2008, D.A.M. pleaded\nguilty to two charges of touching a part of the body of a person under the age\nof fourteen years for a sexual purpose.The case was adjourned for sentencing\nuntil September 12, 2008 when Judge David Walker sentenced him to four months\nin jail on the fist count involving J.C. and twelve months consecutive on count\nnumber two involving R.B.L.BACKGROUND[2]The facts as related to the Court\nby the Crown and agreed to by Mr. D.A.M.’s lawyer, Joel Hansen, were as\nfollows:MR. DIPAOLO:... both these young ladies are friends to\neach other, about the same age, both live in B[…], and this—both of these\nincidents happened at the same time, basically at the same house literally\nwithin minutes of each event I would say.The Information referring to J.C.,\nshe was thirteen years of age when it happened.The Information regarding\nR.B.L., she was two days shy of her thirteenth birthday when it happened.They\nboth live in the B[…] area.They are friends with an individual by the name of\nJ.S., she is perhaps in her early twenties, but they were acquaintances of hers\nsuch that they could go to her house; they were watching movies on this\nparticular day and finished doing that.One of the young girls became — her\nstomach became upset so she went upstairs and laid in the bed where — bedroom\nwhere — that’s referred to in the file as D.A.M.’s and J.S.’s bedroom, so\nthat’s where they were; they were up there alone for a period of time just\nlaying around on the bed talking in private.THE COURT:This was — who was laying on the bed, the two\ngirls?MR. DIPAOLO:The two girls, Your Honour.THE COURT:The two girls.Okay.MR. DIPAOLO:The two complainants.Mr. D.A.M. sa — came\nin the room a little bit later, sat on the bed and the file indicates that he\nstarted touching the individual referred to as J.C. in count one first, and\nwhat he was doing was touching her breasts, Your Honour, up under her shirt.He — and he was basically between the two girls.One of the indivi — one of\nthe two girls said that Mr. D.A.M. put his hand, this is the second girl\nR.B.L., put his hand in her pants, put his finger in her vagina and tried to,\nin her words, “finger her”, or did “finger her”, and it’s also indicated in her\nstatement that he pulled her pants down and removed her pants and applied his\nmouth to her vaginal area.Both of the young girls were present at this time.The individual referred to as B — R.B.L., she indicates she was afraid during\nthis incident and gave up on telling D.A.M. to stop because he wasn’t stopping\nwhen he said — when she said those words to him, she felt that there was\nnothing she could do to make D.A.M. stop, however, there were no overt threats\nof any nature.That same individual, R.B.L., indicated that the — her friend\nwas still in the room while everything was happening and that she didn’t do\nanything to help her or try to stop D.A.M..This ended when somebody from\ndownstairs called D.A.M. to come back down stairs, and then he left the two\ngirls in the room.And J.C., who is present in court with her parents, also\nindicates that when this happened to her she didn’t like what happened, didn’t\nfeel comfortable saying no to — when this was going on, and both said that they\nbasically endured this until it ended.This is the only time such an incident\nhappened, I am told, between — well, on the part of Mr. D.A.M. against these\ntwo young girls. Mr. D.A.M. … freely admitted to touching J.C. on her breast\narea under her shirt, and he did not say why he stopped touching her, and then\nimmediately started touching R.B.L. as per count two in the facts I’ve related\nto her — to you.He also indicated that “yes” he did touch J.B.L. (sic) — I’m\nsorry, R.B.L., with his fingers in her vagina and also applied his mouth to her\nvagina.He says that the incident only lasted a few minutes before he left the\nroom, and those are the facts in support of those charges, no prior record.[3]A\npre-sentence report was prepared as were four victim impact statements, one\nfrom each complainant and one from each complainant’s mother.The defense had\nno objection to any of those documents forming part of the record for\nsentencing.[4]The Crown\nproceeded by way of summary conviction under section 151(b) of the Criminal\nCode which provides for a minimum sentence of 14 days and a maximum sentence of\n18 months imprisonment.[5]In passing\nsentence Judge Walker considered the facts of these cases, the submissions of\nthe Crown and Defence, the pre-sentence report and the victim impact\nstatements.[6]The Crown\nasked for a sentence greater than the minimum 14 days and the Defence suggested\na total sentence in the range of six months.Judge Walker then considered the\npurposes and principles of sentencing when he stated:… In the imposition of sentence the Court, as it always\ndoes, makes reference to the principles and purposes of sentencing, and it is\nimportant to reflect upon at times like this as the fundamental purpose of\nsentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to\nrespect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by\nimposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives, and\nof those objectives they include “to denounce unlawful conduct”, and\nunquestionably the denunciation of sexual touching of children is of a primary\nimportance and denunciation is one of the two fundamental purposes which I\nintend to address today.The other is that the offender be deterred and that\nother persons be deterred from committing these offences, and that is commonly\nreferred to as “deterrence”, specific, that is to say, Mr. D.A.M., and general\nto others persons in the community.These offences are offensive to the\ncommunity as a whole and to all who are part of the community; that is well met\nby the principle of denunciation.But there are those who might find\nthemselves in this situation, and I think that deterrence, general deterrence,\nis an important factor with respect to imposing a sentence which will act to\ndissuade others from committing these offences.The other purposes which are\nreferred to is to separate offenders from society where necessary, while there\nis a minimum period of incarceration, and also to assist in rehabilitating\noffenders, and that is an important characteristic — an important matter which\nhas been referenced by Mr. Hansen.There is a Section 718.01 where a court\nimposed a sentence for an offence that involves the abuse of a person under the\nage of eighteen years, and I would include this and shall give primary\nconsideration to the objectives, the denunciation and deterrence of such\nconduct, and of course that is appropriate.The sentence must be proportionate\nto the gravity of the offence and the degree of the degree of responsibility of\nthe offender.Well Mr. D.A.M. takes complete responsibility and has complete\nresponsibility for these offences.The Court also will take into consideration\nthe following principles, that it should be increased or reduced to account for\nany relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or\nthe offender, and includes a number of subcategories, but dealing generally\nwith the issue of aggravating or mitigating circumstances it is certainly a\nmitigating factor that Mr. D.A.M. did plead guilty, although as I have stated\npreviously, he did not plead guilty or take responsibility for these acts at\nthe earliest opportunity, and he did not and was not able to express in words\nwhich I found appropriate any degree of remorse for the victims of his\noffences.The Court acknowledges that Mr. D.A.M. may not have the ability to\narticulate such thoughts, and while he might feel some remorse, it does not\nappear that he expresses it and does not hear — appear that he is able to even\nshow that he has remorse, and it does not appear that he has the support of his\npartner in accepting that remorse is an appropriate emotion — or an appropriate\nstatement for him to make.Finally, a sentence should be similar to sentences\nimposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances,\nand where consecutive sentences are imposed the combined sentence should not be\nunduly long or harsh.With respect to these two offences I find them\nrelatively distinct and rela — and while happening at the same time, they’re\nactions were quite, as I say, distinct, and I intend to impose periods of\ncustody of both offences, but I intend to impose a consecutive period of\nimprisonment for the second offence, which I consider to be the more serious of\nthe two offences.[7]Judge\nWalker then referred to other cases where he had passed sentence and then\nsentenced Mr. D.A.M. on the two charges.[8]Mr. D.A.M.\nnow appeals on the basis that the sentences are excessive given that he has no\nprior record.That is the sum total of his submission.LAW[9]The law is\nclear that unless there is an error in principle, an error in law or it is\nshown that the sentence is unreasonable having regard to the fundamental\nprinciples and purposes of sentencing then an appeal court should not vary a\nsentence:see R. v. LeBlanc (2003), 264 N.B.R. (2d) 34 (C.A.).Parliament has given the job of sentencing to sentencing judges to determine\nthe appropriate degree and kind of punishment under the Criminal Code of Canada\nand appeal courts must respect that, even if they disagree with the sentence:see R. v. C.A.M. 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500; R. v. Proulx\n2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] S.C.J. No. 6 and R. v. Shropshire (1995) 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), 4 S.C.R. 227.[10]In this\ncase I find no error in law committed by Judge Walker nor any error in\nprinciple.He carefully considered all the relevant principles and purposes of\nsentencing and the important factors such as the totality of the sentences, Mr.\nD.A.M.’s lack of a prior record and the need to emphasize both denunciation and\ndeterrence in this case due to the nature of the offences.As Drapeau, J.A.,\nas he then was, stated in R. v. R.P. (2001) 2001 NBCA 115 (CanLII), 245 N.B.R. (2d) 179 (C.A.) at para. 18:…Sometimes, as is the case here, the crime is so abhorrent\nthat a lengthy prison term is warranted in order to express society’s aversion\nto it, even in the case of a first offender.There is clearly no doubt that\nretribution and denunciation are legitimate objectives of sentencing in these\ncases, just as much as are deterrence and rehabilitation.See in this respect\nR. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R., 500, at\nparagraphs 79-82.[11]I further\nfind that the sentences are not clearly unreasonable or demonstrably unfit\nhaving regard to the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing.Judge\nWalker was faced with two very young girls who were both victims and both\nwitnesses.He had to consider the effect of this crimes on them and their\nfamilies along with the considerations in Mr. D.A.M.’s favour.[12]He was\naware of and considered other cases involving similar circumstances that he had\ndone and tailored the sentences to be consistent with those.[13]As for the\ntotality of the sentences, he clearly considered that as he did the related\nissue of whether the sentences should be concurrent or consecutive.He had the\ndiscretion to decide if they should be consecutive and while the circumstances\nare such that he could have made them concurrent, I find no error on his part\nin deciding to make them consecutive.[14]Sentencing\nis not an exact science so the same set of facts may yield different sentences\nfrom different judges.The question is not whether the particular sentence is\nright or wrong but rather whether it is clearly unreasonable in the\ncircumstances.[15]In my\nview, the sentences imposed by Judge Walker in this case are not clearly\nunreasonable in these circumstances and I therefore dismiss this appeal.__________________________________William T.

When returning to her home, she was heard saying “I got you, you fucking\nbastard”.There was also evidence indicating that she had stabbed the victim\non the arm before he left the townhouse.At the time of the stabbing, the\naccused had a blood‑alcohol content of between 155 and 165 milligrams of\nalcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.At the sentencing hearing, the judge took into account\nseveral mitigating factors.The accused was a young mother and, apart from an\nimpaired driving conviction, she had no criminal record.Her family was\nsupportive and, while on bail,she had attended alcohol abuse counselling and\nupgraded her education.The accused was provoked by the victim’s insulting\nbehaviour and remarks.At the time of the offence, the accused had a\nhyperthyroid condition which caused her to overreact to emotional situations.She showed some signs of remorse and entered a plea of guilty.The sentencing\njudge also identified several aggravating circumstances.The accused stabbed\nthe deceased twice, the second time after he had fled in an attempt to escape.From the remarks she made before and after the stabbing it was clear that the\naccused intended to harm the victim.Further, she was not afraid of the\nvictim; she was the aggressor. The judge considered that the principles of\ndenunciation and general deterrence must play a role in the present\ncircumstances even though specific deterrence was not required.He also\nindicated that the sentence should take into account the need to rehabilitate\nthe accused.The judge decided that a suspended sentence or a conditional\nsentence of imprisonment was not appropriate in this case. He noted that there\nwere no special circumstances arising from the aboriginal status of the accused\nand the victim that he should take into consideration.Both were living in an\nurban area off‑reserve and not “within the aboriginal community as\nsuch”.The sentencing judge concluded that the offence was a very serious one,\nfor which the appropriate sentence was three years’ imprisonment.The majority\nof the Court of Appeal dismissed the accused’s appeal of her sentence.Held:The appeal should be dismissed.The considerations which should\nbe taken into account by a judge sentencing an aboriginal offender have been\nsummarized at para. 93 of the reasons for judgment. The following is a reflection\nof that summary.Part XXIII of the Criminal Code codifies\nthe fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing and the factors that\nshould be considered by a judge in striving to determine a sentence that is fit\nfor the offender and the offence.In that Part, s. 718.2(e)\nmandatorily requires sentencing judges to consider all available sanctions\nother than imprisonment and to pay particular attention to the circumstances of\naboriginal offenders. The provision is not simply a codification of existing\njurisprudence.It is remedial in nature and is designed to ameliorate the\nserious problem of overrepresentation of aboriginal people in prisons, and to\nencourage sentencing judges to have recourse to a restorative approach to\nsentencing. There is a judicial duty to give the provision’s remedial purpose\nreal force.Section 718.2(e) must be read in the context of the\nrest of the factors referred to in that section and in light of all of\nPart XXIII.In determining a fit sentence, all principles and factors set\nout in that Part must be taken into consideration.Attention should be paid to\nthe fact that Part XXIII, through certain provisions,has placed a new\nemphasis upon decreasing the use of incarceration.Sentencing is an individual process and in each case\nthe consideration must continue to be what is a fit sentence for this accused\nfor this offence in this community.The effect of s. 718.2(e),\nhowever, is to alter the method of analysis which sentencing judges must use in\ndetermining a fit sentence for aboriginal offenders.Section 718.2(e)\ndirects judges to undertake the sentencing of such offenders individually, but\nalso differently, because the circumstances of aboriginal people are unique.In sentencing an aboriginal offender, the judge must consider:(a) the unique\nsystemic or background factors which may have played a part in bringing the\nparticular aboriginal offender before the courts; and (b) the types of\nsentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate in the\ncircumstances for the offender because of his or her particular aboriginal\nheritage or connection.In order to undertake these considerations the\nsentencing judge will require information pertaining to the accused.Judges may\ntake judicial notice of the broad systemic and background factors affecting\naboriginal people, and of the priority given in aboriginal cultures to a\nrestorative approach to sentencing.In the usual course of events, additional\ncase‑specific information will come from counsel and from a pre‑sentence\nreport which takes into account the systemic or background factors and the\nappropriate sentencing procedures and sanctions, which in turn may come from\nrepresentations of the relevant aboriginal community.The offender may waive\nthe gathering of that information. The absence of alternative sentencing\nprograms specific to an aboriginal community does not eliminate the ability of\na sentencing judge to impose a sanction that takes into account principles of\nrestorative justice and the needs of the parties involved.If there is no alternative to incarceration the length\nof the term must be carefully considered.The jail term for an aboriginal\noffender may in some circumstances be less than the term imposed on a non‑aboriginal\noffender for the same offence. However,s. 718.2(e) is not to be\ntaken as a means of automatically reducing the prison sentence of aboriginal\noffenders; nor should it be assumed that an offender is receiving a more\nlenient sentence simply because incarceration is not imposed.It is also\nunreasonable to assume that aboriginal peoples do not believe in the importance\nof traditional sentencing goals such as deterrence, denunciation, and\nseparation, where warranted.In this context, generally, the more serious and\nviolent the crime, the more likely it will be as a practical matter that the\nterms of imprisonment will be the same for similar offences and offenders,\nwhether the offender is aboriginal or non‑aboriginal.Section 718.2(e) applies to all aboriginal\npersons wherever they reside, whether on‑ or off‑reserve, in a\nlarge city or a rural area.In defining the relevant aboriginal community for\nthe purpose of achieving an effective sentence, the term “community” must be\ndefined broadly so as to include any network of support and interaction that\nmight be available, including one in an urban centre.At the same time, the\nresidence of the aboriginal offender in an urban centre that lacks any network\nof support does not relieve the sentencing judge of the obligation to try to\nfind an alternative to imprisonment.In this case, the sentencing judgemay have erred in\nlimiting the application of s. 718.2(e) to the circumstances of\naboriginal offenders living in rural areas or on‑reserve. Moreover, he\ndoes not appear to have considered the systemic or background factors which may\nhave influenced the accused to engage in criminal conduct, or the possibly\ndistinct conception of sentencing held by the accused, by the victim’s family,\nand by their community.The majority of the Court of Appeal, in dismissing the\naccused’s appeal, also does not appear to have considered many of the relevant\nfactors.Althoughin most cases such errors would be sufficient to justify\nsending the matter back for a new sentencing hearing, in these circumstances it\nwould not be in the interests of justice to order a new hearing in order to\ncanvass the accused’s circumstances as an aboriginal offender.Both the\nsentencing judge and all members of the Court of Appeal acknowledged that the\noffence was a particularly serious one.For that offence by this offender a\nsentence of three years’ imprisonment was not unreasonable. More importantly,\nthe accused was granted,subject to certain conditions,day parole after she\nhad served six months in a correctional centre and, about a year ago, was\ngranted full parole with the same conditions.The results of the sentence with\nincarceration for six months and the subsequent controlled release were in the\ninterests of both the accused and society.Cases CitedReferred to:Rizzo\n\u0026 Rizzo Shoes Ltd.

C-46, pertaining to sentencing came into force.These\nprovisions codify for the first time the fundamental purpose and principles of\nsentencing.This appeal is particularly concerned with the new s. 718.2(e).It provides that all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are\nreasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with\nparticular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.This appeal\nmust consider how this provision should be interpreted and applied.I.Factual Background2The appellant, one of nine children, was born in McLennan, Alberta in\n1976.Her mother, Marie Gladue, who was a Cree, left the family home in 1987\nand died in a car accident in 1990.After 1987, the appellant and her siblings\nwere raised by their father, Lloyd Chalifoux, a Metis.The appellant and the\nvictim Reuben Beaver started to live together in 1993, when the appellant was\n17 years old.Thereafter they had a daughter, Tanita.In August 1995, they\nmoved to Nanaimo.Together with the appellant’s father and two of her\nsiblings, Tara and Bianca Chalifoux, they lived in a townhouse complex.By\nSeptember 1995, the appellant and Beaver were engaged to be married, and the\nappellant was five months pregnant with their second child, a boy, whom the\nappellant subsequently named Reuben Ambrose Beaver in honour of his father.3In the early evening of September 16, 1995, the appellant was\ncelebrating her 19th birthday.She and Reuben Beaver, who was then 20, were\ndrinking beer with some friends and family members in the townhouse complex.The appellant suspected that Beaver was having an affair with her older sister,\nTara.During the course of the evening she voiced those suspicions to her\nfriends.The appellant was obviously angry with Beaver.She said, “the next\ntime he fools around on me, I’ll kill him”. The appellant told one of her\nfriends that she wanted to test Beaver, and asked her friend to “hit on Reuben\nto see if he would go with her”, but the friend refused.4The appellant’s sister Tara left the party, followed by Beaver.After\nhe had left, the appellant told her friend, “He’s going to get it.He’s really\ngoing to get it this time.”The appellant, on several occasions, tried to find\nBeaver and her sister.She eventually located them coming down the stairs\ntogether in her sister’s suite.The appellant suspected that they had been\nengaged in sexual activity and confronted her sister, saying, “You’re going to\nget it.How could you do this to me?”5The appellant and Beaver returned separately to their townhouse and they\nstarted to quarrel.During the argument, the appellant confronted him with his\ninfidelity and he told her that she was fat and ugly and not as good as the\nothers.A neighbour, Mr. Gretchin, who lived next door was awakened by\nsome banging and shouting and a female voice saying “I’m sick and tired of you\nfooling around with other women.”The disturbance was becoming very loud and\nhe decided to ask his neighbours to calm down.He heard the front door of the\nappellant’s residence slam.As he opened his own front door, he saw the\nappellant come running out of her suite.He also saw Reuben Beaver banging\nwith both hands at Tara Chalifoux’s door down the hall saying, “Let me in.Let\nme in.”6Mr. Gretchin saw the appellant run toward Beaver with a large knife in\nher hand and, as she approached him, she told him that he had better run.Mr.\nGretchin heard Beaver shriek in pain and saw him collapse in a pool of blood.The appellant had stabbed Beaver once in the left chest, and the knife had\npenetrated his heart.As the appellant went by on her return to her apartment,\nMr. Gretchin heard her say, “I got you, you fucking bastard.”The appellant\nwas described as jumping up and down as if she had tagged someone.Mr. Gretchin\nsaid she did not appear to realize what she had done.At the time of the\nstabbing, the appellant had a blood‑alcohol content of between 155 and\n165 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.7On June 3, 1996, the appellant was charged with second degree murder.On February 11, 1997, following a preliminary hearing and after a jury had been\nselected, the appellant entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter.8There was evidence which indicated that the appellant had stabbed Beaver\nbefore he fled from the apartment.A paring knife found on the living room\nfloor of their apartment had a small amount of Beaver’s blood on it, and a\nsmall stab wound was located on Beaver’s right upper arm.9There was also evidence that Beaver had subjected the appellant to some\nphysical abuse in June 1994, while the appellant was pregnant with their\ndaughter Tanita.Beaver was convicted of assault, and was given a 15‑day\nintermittent sentence with one year’s probation.The neighbour, Mr. Gretchin,\ntold police that the noises emanating from the appellant’s and Beaver’s\napartment suggested a fight, stating: “It sounded like someone got hit and\nfurniture was sliding, like someone pushed around” and “The fight lasted five\nto ten minutes, it was like a wrestling match.”Bruises later observed on the\nappellant’s arm and in the collarbone area were consistent with her having been\nin a physical altercation on the night of the stabbing.However, the trial\njudge found that the facts as presented before him did not warrant a finding\nthat the appellant was a “battered or fearful wife”.10The appellant’s sentencing took place 17 months after the stabbing.Pending her trial, she was released on bail and lived with her father.She\ntook counselling for alcohol and drug abuse at Tillicum Haus Native Friendship\nCentre in Nanaimo, and completed Grade 10 and was about to start Grade 11.After the stabbing, the appellant was diagnosed as suffering from a hyperthyroid\ncondition, which was said to produce an exaggerated reaction to any emotional\nsituation.The appellant underwent radiation therapy to destroy some of her\nthyroid glands, and at the time of sentencing she was taking thyroid\nsupplements which regulated her condition.During the time she was on bail,\nthe appellant pled guilty to having breached her bail on one occasion by\nconsuming alcohol.11At the sentencing hearing, when asked if she had anything to say, the\nappellant stated that she was sorry about what happened, that she did not\nintend to do it, and that she was sorry to Beaver’s family.12In his submissions on sentence at trial, the appellant’s counsel did not\nraise the fact that the appellant was an aboriginal offender but, when asked by\nthe trial judge whether in fact the appellant was an aboriginal person, replied\nthat she was Cree.When asked by the trial judge whether the town of McLennan,\nAlberta, where the appellant grew up, was an aboriginal community, defence\ncounsel responded: “it’s just a regular community”.No other submissions were\nmade at the sentencing hearing on the issue of the appellant’s aboriginal\nheritage. Defence counsel requested a suspended sentence or a conditional\nsentence of imprisonment.Crown counsel argued in favour of a sentence of\nbetween three and five years’ imprisonment.13The appellant was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment and to a\nten-year weapons prohibition.Her appeal of the sentence to the British\nColumbia Court of Appeal was dismissed.II.Relevant\nStatutory Provisions14It may be helpful at this stage to set out ss. 718, 718.1 and 718.2\nof the Criminal Code as well as s. 12 of the Interpretation Act,\nR.S.C., 1985, c. I‑21.Criminal\nCodePurpose\nand Principles of Sentencing718.[Purpose]The fundamental\npurpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention\ninitiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and\nsafe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing\noffences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the\ncommunity; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and\nacknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.718.1[Fundamental principle]A\nsentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender.718.2[Other sentencing principles]A\ncourt that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following\nprinciples:(a)a sentence should be increased or reduced to account\nfor any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the\noffence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,(i)evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or\nhate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex,\nage, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation or any other similar\nfactor,(ii)evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused\nthe offender’s spouse or child,(iii)evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused\na position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, or(iv)evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at\nthe direction of or in association with a criminal organizationshall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;(b)a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on\nsimilar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;(c)where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined\nsentence should not be unduly long or harsh;(d)an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less\nrestrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and(e)all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are\nreasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with\nparticular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.Interpretation\nAct12.Every enactment is deemed remedial, and\nshall be given such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as\nbest ensures the attainment of its objects.III.Judicial HistoryA.Supreme Court of British Columbia15In his reasons, the trial judge took into account several mitigating\nfactors.The appellant was only 20 years old at the time of sentence, and\napart from an impaired driving conviction, she had no criminal record.She had\ntwo children and was expecting a third although he considered her pregnancy a\nneutral factor.Her family was supportive and she was attending alcohol abuse\ncounselling and upgrading her education.The appellant was provoked by the\ndeceased’s insulting behaviour and remarks.At the time of the offence, the\nappellant had a hyperthyroid condition which caused her to overreact to\nemotional situations.The appellant showed some signs of remorse and entered a\nplea of guilty.16On the other hand, the trial judge identified several aggravating\ncircumstances.The appellant stabbed the deceased twice, the second time after\nhe had fled in an attempt to escape.Also, the offence was of particular\ngravity.From the remarks she made before and after the stabbing it was very\nclear that the appellant intended to harm the deceased.Further, the appellant\nwas not afraid of the deceased; indeed, she was the aggressor.17The trial judge considered that specific deterrence was not required in\nthe circumstances of this case.However, in his opinion the principles of\ndenunciation and general deterrence must play a role.He was of the view that\nthe sentence should also take into account the need to rehabilitate the\nappellant and give her some insight both into her conduct and the effect of her\npropensity to drink.The trial judge decided that in this case it was not\nappropriate to suspend the passing of sentence or to impose a conditional\nsentence.18The trial judge noted that both the appellant and the deceased were\naboriginal, but stated that they were living in an urban area off-reserve and\nnot “within the aboriginal community as such”.He found that there were not\nany special circumstances arising from their aboriginal status that he should\ntake into consideration.He stated that the offence was a very serious one,\nfor which the appropriate sentence was three years’ imprisonment with a\nten-year weapons prohibition.B.Court of Appeal for British Columbia (1997), 1997 CanLII 3015 (BC CA), 98\nB.C.A.C. 12019The appellant appealed her sentence of three years’ imprisonment, but\nnot the ten-year weapons prohibition.She appealed on four grounds, only one\nof which is directly relevant, namely whether the trial judge failed to give\nappropriate consideration to the appellant’s circumstances as an aboriginal\noffender.The appellant also sought to adduce fresh evidence at her appeal\nregarding her efforts since the killing to maintain links with her aboriginal\nheritage.The fresh evidence showed that the appellant had applied to become a\nfull status Cree, and that she had obtained that status for her daughter\nTanita.She had also maintained contact with Beaver’s mother, who is a status\nCree, and who was in turn assisting the appellant with the status applications.20The Court of Appeal unanimously concluded that the trial judge had erred\nin concluding that s. 718.2(e) did not apply because the appellant\nwas not living on a reserve.However, Esson J.A. (Prowse J.A. concurring)\nfound no error in the trial judge’s conclusion that, in this case, there was no\nbasis for giving special consideration to the appellant’s aboriginal\nbackground.Esson J.A. noted that the appellant’s actions involved\ndeliberation, motivation, and “an element of viciousness and persistence in the\nattack”, and that the killing constituted a “near murder” (p. 138).He found that,\non the facts presented in this case, it could not be said that the sentence, if\na fit one for a non‑aboriginal person, would not also be fit for an\naboriginal person.Esson J.A. concluded therefore that the trial judge did not\nerr in not giving effect to the principle set out in s. 718.2(e) of\nthe Criminal Code and dismissed the appeal.Although it is not entirely\nclear from the reasons of Esson J.A., he appears also to have dismissed the\nappellant’s application to adduce fresh evidence regarding her efforts to\nmaintain links with her aboriginal heritage.21Rowles J.A. (dissenting) reviewed many reports and parliamentary debates\nand determined that the mischief that s. 718.2(e) was designed to\nremedy was the excessive use of incarceration generally, and the\ndisproportionately high number of aboriginal people who are imprisoned, in\nparticular.She stated that s. 718.2(e) invites recognition and\namelioration of the impact which systemic discrimination in the criminal\njustice system has upon aboriginal people.She referred to the importance of\nacknowledging and implementing the different conceptions of criminal justice\nand of appropriate criminal sanctions held by many aboriginal peoples,\nincluding, in particular, the conception of criminal justice as involving a\nstrong restorative element.22In this case, Rowles J.A. agreed that the crime committed by the\nappellant was serious.The circumstances surrounding the offence were tragic\nfor everyone, including the appellant’s children.Yet, the circumstances of\nthe offence included provocation, superimposed on an undiagnosed medical\nproblem affecting the appellant’s emotional stability.The offender was young\nand emotionally immature.She had an alcohol problem but no history of other\ncriminal conduct or acts of violence.The success the appellant enjoyed while\non bail awaiting trial showed that she was likely to be a good candidate for\nfurther rehabilitation.Rowles J.A. also referred favourably to the fresh\nevidence which showed that the appellant was taking steps to maintain links\nwith her aboriginal heritage.23Rowles J.A. concluded that a sentence of three years’ imprisonment was\nexcessive.The principles of general deterrence and denunciation had to be\nreflected in the sentence, but the sentence could have been designed to advance\nthe appellant’s rehabilitation through a period of supervised probation.Rowles J.A. would have allowed the appeal and reduced the sentence to two years\nless a day to be followed by a three-year period of probation.IV.Issue24The issue in this appeal is the proper interpretation and application to\nbe given to s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code.The provision\nreads as follows:718.2A court that imposes a sentence shall\nalso take into consideration the following principles:. . .(e)all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are\nreasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with\nparticular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.The question\nto be resolved is whether the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal\nerred in finding that, in the circumstances of this case, the trial judge\ncorrectly applied s. 718.2(e) in imposing a sentence of three\nyears’ imprisonment.To answer this question, it will be necessary to\ndetermine the legislative purpose of s. 718.2(e), and, in\nparticular, the words “with particular attention to the circumstances of\naboriginal offenders”.The appeal requires this Court to begin the process of\narticulating the rules and principles that should govern the practical\napplication of s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code by a trial\njudge.V.AnalysisA.Introduction25As this Court has frequently stated, the proper construction of a\nstatutory provision flows from reading the words of the provision in their\ngrammatical and ordinary sense and in their entire context, harmoniously with\nthe scheme of the statute as a whole, the purpose of the statute, and the\nintention of Parliament.The purpose of the statute and the intention of\nParliament, in particular, are to be determined on the basis of intrinsic and\nadmissible extrinsic sources regarding the Act’s legislative history and the context\nof its enactment: Rizzo \u0026 Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), 1998 CanLII 837 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27,\nat paras. 20‑23; R. v. Chartrand, 1994 CanLII 53 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 864, at\np. 875; E. A. Driedger, Construction of Statutes (2nd ed. 1983), at\np. 87; Driedger on the Construction of Statutes (3rd ed. 1994), by\nR. Sullivan, at p. 131.26Also of importance in interpreting federal legislation is s. 12 of\nthe federal Interpretation Act, which provides:12.Every enactment is deemed\nremedial, and shall be given such fair, large and liberal construction and\ninterpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objects.27Section 718.2(e) has already received judicial consideration in\nseveral provincial appellate court decisions:see, e.g., R. v. McDonald\n(1997), 1997 CanLII 9710 (SK CA), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 418 (Sask. C.A.); R. v. J. (C.) (1997), 1997 CanLII 14650 (NL CA), 119\nC.C.C. (3d) 444 (Nfld. C.A.); R. v. Wells (1998), 1998 ABCA 109 (CanLII), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 129\n(Alta. C.A.); R. v. Hunter (1998), 1998 ABCA 141 (CanLII), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 121 (Alta. C.A.); R.\nv. Young (1998), 1998 CanLII 17787 (MB CA), 131 Man. R. (2d) 61 (C.A.).This is the first occasion on\nwhich this Court has had the opportunity to construe and apply the provision.28With this introduction, we now wish to discuss the wording of\ns. 718.2(e) and the scheme of Part XXIII of the Criminal\nCode, as well as the legislative history and the context behind\ns. 718.2(e), with the aim of determining and describing the\ncircumstances of aboriginal offenders.This discussion is followed by a\nframework for the sentencing judge to use in sentencing an aboriginal\noffender.The reasons then deal with the specific facts and sentence in this\ncase.B.The Wording of Section 718.2(e) and the Scheme of\nPart XXIII29The interpretation of s. 718.2(e) must begin by considering\nits words in context.Although this appeal is ultimately concerned only with\nthe meaning of the phrase “with particular attention to the circumstances of\naboriginal offenders”, that phrase takes on meaning from the other words of\ns. 718.2(e), from the purpose and principles of sentencing set out\nin ss. 718‑718.2, and from the overall scheme of Part XXIII.30The respondent observed that some caution is in order in construing\ns. 718.2(e), insofar as it would be inappropriate to prejudge the\nmany other important issues which may be raised by the reforms but which are\nnot specifically at issue here.However, it would be equally inappropriate to\nconstrue s. 718.2(e) in a vacuum, without considering the\nsurrounding text which gives the provision its depth of meaning.To the extent\nthat the broader scheme of Part XXIII informs the proper construction to\nbe given to s. 718.2(e), it will be necessary to draw at least some\ngeneral conclusions about the new sentencing regime.31A core issue in this appeal is whether s. 718.2(e) should be\nunderstood as being remedial in nature, or whether s. 718.2(e),\nalong with the other provisions of ss. 718 through 718.2, are simply a\ncodification of existing sentencing principles.The respondent,\nalthough acknowledging that s. 718.2(e) was likely designed to\nencourage sentencing judges to experiment to some degree with alternatives to\nincarceration and to be sensitive to principles of restorative justice, at the\nsame time favours the view that ss. 718‑718.2 are largely a\nrestatement of existing law.Alternatively, the appellant argues strongly that\ns. 718.2(e)’s specific reference to aboriginal offenders can have\nno purpose unless it effects a change in the law.The appellant advances the\nview that s. 718.2(e) is in fact an “affirmative action” provision\njustified under s. 15(2) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.32Section 12 of the Interpretation Act deems the purpose of the\nenactment of the new Part XXIII of the Criminal Code to be remedial\nin nature, and requires that all of the provisions of Part XXIII,\nincluding s. 718.2(e), be given a fair, large and liberal\nconstruction and interpretation in order to attain that remedial objective.However, the existence of s. 12 does not answer the essential question of\nwhat the remedial purpose of s. 718.2(e) is.One view is that the\nremedial purpose of ss. 718, 718.1 and 718.2 taken together was precisely\nto codify the purpose and existing principles of sentencing to provide more\nsystematic guidance to sentencing judges in individual cases. Codification,\nunder this view, is remedial in and of itself because it simplifies and adds\nstructure to trial level sentencing decisions: see, e.g., McDonald, supra,\nat pp. 460‑64, per Sherstobitoff J.A.33In our view, s. 718.2(e) is more than simply a re‑affirmation\nof existing sentencing principles.The remedial component of the provision\nconsists not only in the fact that it codifies a principle of sentencing, but,\nfar more importantly, in its direction to sentencing judges to undertake the\nprocess of sentencing aboriginal offenders differently, in order to endeavour\nto achieve a truly fit and proper sentence in the particular case.It should\nbe said that the words of s. 718.2(e) do not alter the fundamental\nduty of the sentencing judge to impose a sentence that is fit for the offence\nand the offender.For example, as we will discuss below, it will generally be\nthe case as a practical matter that particularly violent and serious offences\nwill result in imprisonment for aboriginal offenders as often as for\nnon-aboriginal offenders.What s. 718.2(e) does alter is the\nmethod of analysis which each sentencing judge must use in determining the\nnature of a fit sentence for an aboriginal offender.In our view, the scheme\nof Part XXIII of the Criminal Code, the context underlying the\nenactment of s. 718.2(e), and the legislative history of the\nprovision all support an interpretation of s. 718.2(e) as having\nthis important remedial purpose.34In his submissions before this Court, counsel for the appellant\nexpressed the fear that s. 718.2(e) might come to be interpreted\nand applied in a manner which would have no real effect upon the day‑to‑day\npractice of sentencing aboriginal offenders in Canada.In light of the tragic\nhistory of the treatment of aboriginal peoples within the Canadian criminal\njustice system, we do not consider this fear to be unreasonable.In our view,\ns. 718.2(e) creates a judicial duty to give its remedial purpose\nreal force.35Let us consider now the wording of s. 718.2(e) and its place\nwithin the overall scheme of Part XXIII of the Criminal Code.36Section 718.2(e) directs a court, in imposing a sentence, to\nconsider all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in\nthe circumstances for all offenders, “with particular attention to the\ncircumstances of aboriginal offenders”.The broad role of the provision is\nclear.As a general principle, s. 718.2(e) applies to all\noffenders, and states that imprisonment should be the penal sanction of last\nresort.Prison is to be used only where no other sanction or combination of sanctions\nis appropriate to the offence and the offender.37The next question is the meaning to be attributed to the words “with\nparticular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders”.The phrase\ncannot be an instruction for judges to pay “more” attention when sentencing\naboriginal offenders.It would be unreasonable to assume that Parliament\nintended sentencing judges to prefer certain categories of offenders over\nothers.Neither can the phrase be merely an instruction to a sentencing judge\nto consider the circumstances of aboriginal offenders just as she or he would\nconsider the circumstances of any other offender.There would be no point in\nadding a special reference to aboriginal offenders if this was the case.Rather, the logical meaning to be derived from the special reference to the\ncircumstances of aboriginal offenders, juxtaposed as it is against a general\ndirection to consider “the circumstances” for all offenders, is that sentencing\njudges should pay particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal\noffenders because those circumstances are unique, and different from\nthose of non‑aboriginal offenders.The fact that the reference to\naboriginal offenders is contained in s. 718.2(e), in particular,\ndealing with restraint in the use of imprisonment, suggests that there is\nsomething different about aboriginal offenders which may specifically make\nimprisonment a less appropriate or less useful sanction.38The wording of s. 718.2(e) on its face, then, requires both\nconsideration of alternatives to the use of imprisonment as a penal sanction\ngenerally, which amounts to a restraint in the resort to imprisonment as a\nsentence, and recognition by the sentencing judge of the unique circumstances\nof aboriginal offenders.The respondent argued before this Court that this\nstatutory wording does not truly effect a change in the law, as some courts\nhave in the past taken the unique circumstances of an aboriginal offender into\naccount in determining sentence.The respondent cited some of the recent\njurisprudence dealing with sentencing circles, as well as the decision of the\nCourt of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Fireman (1971), 1971 CanLII 450 (ON CA), 4 C.C.C. (2d) 82,\nin support of the view that s. 718.2(e) should be seen simply as a\ncodification of the state of the case law regarding the sentencing of\naboriginal offenders before Part XXIII came into force in 1996.In a\nsimilar vein, it was observed by Sherstobitoff J.A. in McDonald, supra,\nat pp. 463‑64, that it has always been a principle of sentencing\nthat courts should consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment\nthat are reasonable in the circumstances.Thus the general principle of\nrestraint expressed in s. 718.2(e) with respect to all offenders\nmight equally be seen as a codification of existing law.39With respect for the contrary view, we do not interpret s. 718.2(e)\nas expressing only a restatement of existing law, either with respect to the\ngeneral principle of restraint in the use of prison or with respect to the\nspecific direction regarding aboriginal offenders.One cannot interpret the\nwords of s. 718.2(e) simply by looking to past cases to see if they\ncontain similar statements of principle.The enactment of the new\nPart XXIII was a watershed, marking the first codification and significant\nreform of sentencing principles in the history of Canadian criminal law. Each\nof the provisions of Part XXIII, including s. 718.2(e), must\nbe interpreted in its total context, taking into account its surrounding\nprovisions.40It is true that there is ample jurisprudence supporting the principle\nthat prison should be used as a sanction of last resort.It is equally true,\nthough, that the sentencing amendments which came into force in 1996 as the new\nPart XXIII have changed the range of available penal sanctions in a\nsignificant way.The availability of the conditional sentence of imprisonment,\nin particular, alters the sentencing landscape in a manner which gives an\nentirely new meaning to the principle that imprisonment should be resorted to\nonly where no other sentencing option is reasonable in the circumstances.The\ncreation of the conditional sentence suggests, on its face, a desire to lessen\nthe use of incarceration.The general principle expressed in s. 718.2(e)\nmust be construed and applied in this light.41Further support for the view that s. 718.2(e)’s expression\nof the principle of restraint in sentencing is remedial, rather than simply a\ncodification, is provided by the articulation of the purpose of sentencing in\ns. 718.42Traditionally, Canadian sentencing jurisprudence has focussed primarily\nupon achieving the aims of separation, specific and general deterrence,\ndenunciation, and rehabilitation.Sentencing, like the criminal trial process\nitself, has often been understood as a conflict between the interests of the\nstate (as expressed through the aims of separation, deterrence, and\ndenunciation) and the interests of the individual offender (as expressed\nthrough the aim of rehabilitation).Indeed, rehabilitation itself is a\nrelative late‑comer to the sentencing analysis, which formerly favoured\nthe interests of the state almost entirely.43Section 718 now sets out the purpose of sentencing in the following\nterms:718.The fundamental purpose of\nsentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to\nrespect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by\nimposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from\ncommitting offences;(c)to separate offenders from\nsociety, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating\noffenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims\nor to the community; and(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and\nacknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.[Emphasis\nadded.]Clearly,\ns. 718 is, in part, a restatement of the basic sentencing aims, which are\nlisted in paras. (a) through (d).What are new, though, are\nparas. (e) and (f), which along with para. (d) focus upon\nthe restorative goals of repairing the harms suffered by individual victims and\nby the community as a whole, promoting a sense of responsibility and an\nacknowledgment of the harm caused on the part of the offender, and attempting\nto rehabilitate or heal the offender.The concept of restorative justice which\nunderpins paras. (d), (e), and (f) is briefly discussed\nbelow, but as a general matter restorative justice involves some form of\nrestitution and reintegration into the community.The need for offenders to\ntake responsibility for their actions is central to the sentencing process: D.\nKwochka, “Aboriginal Injustice: Making Room for a Restorative Paradigm” (1996),\n60 Sask. L. Rev. 153, at p. 165.Restorative sentencing goals do not usually\ncorrelate with the use of prison as a sanction.In our view, Parliament’s\nchoice to include (e) and (f) alongside the traditional\nsentencing goals must be understood as evidencing an intention to expand the\nparameters of the sentencing analysis for all offenders.The principle of\nrestraint expressed in s. 718.2(e) will necessarily be informed by\nthis re‑orientation.44Just as the context of Part XXIII supports the view that\ns. 718.2(e) has a remedial purpose for all offenders, the scheme of\nPart XXIII also supports the view that s. 718.2(e) has a\nparticular remedial role for aboriginal peoples.The respondent is correct to\npoint out that there is jurisprudence which pre‑dates the enactment of\ns. 718.2(e) in which aboriginal offenders have been sentenced\ndifferently in light of their unique circumstances.However, the existence of\nsuch jurisprudence is not, on its own, especially probative of the issue of\nwhether s. 718.2(e) has a remedial role.There is also sentencing\njurisprudence which holds, for example, that a court must consider the unique\ncircumstances of offenders who are battered spouses, or who are mentally\ndisabled.Although the validity of the principles expressed in this latter\njurisprudence is unchallenged by the 1996 sentencing reforms, one does not find\nreference to these principles in Part XXIII.If Part XXIII were\nindeed a codification of principles regarding the appropriate method of\nsentencing different categories of offenders, one would expect to find such\nreferences.The wording of s. 718.2(e), viewed in light of the\nabsence of similar stipulations in the remainder of Part XXIII, reveals\nthat Parliament has chosen to single out aboriginal offenders for particular\nattention.C.Legislative History45Support for the foregoing understanding of s. 718.2(e) as\nhaving the remedial purpose of restricting the use of prison for all offenders,\nand as having a particular remedial role with respect to aboriginal peoples, is\nprovided by statements made by the Minister of Justice and others at the time\nthat what was then Bill C‑41 was before Parliament.Although these\nstatements are clearly not decisive as to the meaning and purpose of\ns. 718.2(e), they are nonetheless helpful, particularly insofar as\nthey corroborate and do not contradict the meaning and purpose to be derived\nupon a reading of the words of the provision in the context of Part XXIII\nas a whole:Rizzo \u0026 Rizzo Shoes, supra, at paras. 31 and 35.46For instance, in introducing second reading of Bill C‑41 on\nSeptember 20, 1994 (House of Commons Debates, vol. IV, 1st Sess., 35th\nParl., at pp. 5871 and 5873), Minister of Justice Allan Rock made the\nfollowing statements regarding the remedial purpose of the bill:Through this bill, Parliament provides the\ncourts with clear guidelines . . . ..\n. .The bill also defines various sentencing\nprinciples, for instance that the sentence must be proportionate to the gravity\nof the offence and the offender’s degree of responsibility.When\nappropriate, alternatives must be contemplated, especially in the case of\nNative offenders.. . .A general principle that runs throughout Bill C‑41\nis that jails should be reserved for those who should be there.Alternatives\nshould be put in place for those who commit offences but who do not need or\nmerit incarceration....Jails and prisons will be there for those who\nneed them, for those who should be punished in that way or separated from\nsociety. . . .[T]his bill creates an environment which encourages\ncommunity sanctions and the rehabilitation of offenders together with\nreparation to victims and promoting in criminals a sense of accountability for\nwhat they have done.It is not simply by being more harsh that we\nwill achieve more effective criminal justice.We must use our scarce resources\nwisely.[Emphasis added.]The Minister’s\nstatements were echoed by other Members of Parliament and by Senators during\nthe debate over the bill: see, e.g., House of Commons Debates, vol. V,\n1st Sess., 35th Parl., September 22, 1994, at p. 6028 (Mr. Morris Bodnar);\nDebates of the Senate, vol. 135, No. 99, 1st Sess., 35th Parl., June 21,\n1995, at p. 1871 (Hon. Duncan J. Jessiman).47In his subsequent testimony before the House of Commons Standing\nCommittee on Justice and Legal Affairs (Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence,\nIssue No. 62, November 17, 1994, at p. 62:15), the Minister of Justice\naddressed the specific role the government hoped would be played by s. 718.2(e):[T]he reason we referred specifically there to aboriginal persons is\nthat they are sadly overrepresented in the prison populations of Canada.I\nthink it was the Manitoba justice inquiry that found that although aboriginal\npersons make up only 12% of the population of Manitoba, they comprise over 50%\nof the prison inmates.Nationally aboriginal persons represent about 2% of\nCanada’s population, but they represent 10.6% of persons in prison.Obviously\nthere’s a problem here.What we’re trying to do, particularly having\nregard to the initiatives in the aboriginal communities to achieve community\njustice, is to encourage courts to look at alternatives where it’s consistent\nwith the protection of the public ‑‑ alternatives to jail ‑‑\nand not simply resort to that easy answer in every case.[Emphasis added.]48It can be seen, therefore, that the government position when Bill C‑41\nwas under consideration was that the new Part XXIII was to be remedial in\nnature. The proposed enactment was directed, in particular, at reducing the use\nof prison as a sanction, at expanding the use of restorative justice principles\nin sentencing, and at engaging in both of these objectives with a sensitivity\nto aboriginal community justice initiatives when sentencing aboriginal\noffenders.D.The Context of the Enactment of Section 718.2(e)49Further guidance as to the scope and content of Parliament’s remedial\npurpose in enacting s. 718.2(e) may be derived from the social\ncontext surrounding the enactment of the provision.On this point, it is worth\nnoting that, although there is quite a wide divergence between the positions of\nthe appellant and the respondent as to how s. 718.2(e) should be\napplied in practice, there is general agreement between them, and indeed\nbetween the parties and all interveners, regarding the mischief in response to\nwhich s. 718.2(e) was enacted.50The parties and interveners agree that the purpose of s. 718.2(e)\nis to respond to the problem of overincarceration in Canada, and to respond, in\nparticular, to the more acute problem of the disproportionate incarceration of\naboriginal peoples.They also agree that one of the roles of s. 718.2(e),\nand of various other provisions in Part XXIII, is to encourage sentencing\njudges to apply principles of restorative justice alongside or in the place of\nother, more traditional sentencing principles when making sentencing\ndeterminations.As the respondent states in its factum before this Court,\ns. 718.2(e) “provides the necessary flexibility and authority for\nsentencing judges to resort to the restorative model of justice in sentencing\naboriginal offenders and to reduce the imposition of jail sentences where to do\nso would not sacrifice the traditional goals of sentencing”.51The fact that the parties and interveners are in general agreement among\nthemselves regarding the purpose of s. 718.2(e) is not\ndeterminative of the issue as a matter of statutory construction.However, as\nwe have suggested, on the above points of agreement the parties and interveners\nare correct.A review of the problem of overincarceration in Canada, and of\nits peculiarly devastating impact upon Canada’s aboriginal peoples, provides\nadditional insight into the purpose and proper application of this new\nprovision.(1)The Problem of\nOverincarceration in Canada52Canada is a world leader in many fields, particularly in the areas of\nprogressive social policy and human rights.Unfortunately, our country is also\ndistinguished as being a world leader in putting people in prison.Although\nthe United States has by far the highest rate of incarceration among\nindustrialized democracies, at over 600 inmates per 100,000 population,\nCanada’s rate of approximately 130 inmates per 100,000 population places it\nsecond or third highest: seeFederal/Provincial/Territorial Ministers\nResponsible for Justice, Corrections Population Growth: First Report on\nProgress (1997), Annex B, at p. 1; Bulletin of U.S. Bureau of Justice\nStatistics, Prison and Jail Inmates at Midyear 1998 (March 1999); The\nSentencing Project, Americans Behind Bars: U.S. and International Use of\nIncarceration, 1995 (June 1997), at p. 1.Moreover, the rate at\nwhich Canadian courts have been imprisoning offenders has risen sharply in\nrecent years, although there has been a slight decline of late: see Statistics\nCanada, “Prison population and costs” in Infomat: A Weekly Review\n(February 27, 1998), at p. 5.This record of incarceration rates\nobviously cannot instil a sense of pride.53The systematic use of the sanction of imprisonment in Canada may be\ndated to the building of the Kingston Penitentiary in 1835.The penitentiary\nsentence was itself originally conceived as an alternative to the harsher\npenalties of death, flogging, or imprisonment in a local jail.Sentencing\nreformers advocated the use of penitentiary imprisonment as having effects\nwhich were not only deterrent, denunciatory, and preventive, but also\nrehabilitative, with long hours spent in contemplation and hard work\ncontributing to the betterment of the offender:see Law Reform Commission of Canada,\nWorking Paper 11, Imprisonment and Release (1975), at p. 5.54Notwithstanding its idealistic origins, imprisonment quickly came to be\ncondemned as harsh and ineffective, not only in relation to its purported\nrehabilitative goals, but also in relation to its broader public goals.The\nhistory of Canadian commentary regarding the use and effectiveness of\nimprisonment as a sanction was recently well summarized by Vancise J.A.,\ndissenting in the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in McDonald, supra,\nat pp. 429‑30:A number of inquiries and commissions have been\nheld in this country to examine, among other things, the effectiveness of the\nuse of incarceration in sentencing.There has been at least one commission or\ninquiry into the use of imprisonment in each decade of this century since 1914.\n. . .. . . An examination of the recommendations of\nthese reports reveals one constant theme: imprisonment should be avoided if\npossible and should be reserved for the most serious offences, particularly\nthose involving violence.They all recommend restraint in the use of\nincarceration and recognize that incarceration has failed to reduce the crime\nrate and should be used with caution and moderation.Imprisonment has\nfailed to satisfy a basic function of the Canadian judicial system which was\ndescribed in the Report of the Canadian Committee on Corrections entitled:\n“Toward Unity: Criminal Justice and Corrections” (1969) as “to protect society\nfrom crime in a manner commanding public support while avoiding needless injury\nto the offender”.[Emphasis added; footnote omitted.]55In a similar vein, in 1987, the Canadian Sentencing Commission wrote in\nits report entitled Sentencing Reform:A Canadian Approach, at\npp. xxiii‑xxiv:Canada does not imprison as high a portion of its\npopulation as does the United States.However, we do imprison more people than\nmost other western democracies.The Criminal Code displays an apparent\nbias toward the use of incarceration since for most offences the penalty\nindicated is expressed in terms of a maximum term of imprisonment.A number of\ndifficulties arise if imprisonment is perceived to be the preferred sanction\nfor most offences.Perhaps most significant is that although we regularly\nimpose this most onerous and expensive sanction, it accomplishes very little\napart from separating offenders from society for a period of time.In the\npast few decades many groups and federally appointed committees and commissions\ngiven the responsibility of studying various aspects of the criminal justice\nsystem have argued that imprisonment should be used only as a last resort\nand/or that it should be reserved for those convicted of only the most serious\noffences.However, although much has been said, little has been done to move\nus in this direction.[Emphasis added.]56With equal force, in Taking Responsibility (1988), at p. 75,\nthe Standing Committee on Justice and Solicitor General stated:It is now generally recognized that imprisonment\nhas not been effective in rehabilitating or reforming offenders, has not been\nshown to be a strong deterrent, and has achieved only temporary public\nprotection and uneven retribution, as the lengths of prison sentences handed\ndown vary for the same type of crime.Since imprisonment generally offers the public\nprotection from criminal behaviour for only a limited time, rehabilitation of\nthe offender is of great importance.However, prisons have not generally\nbeen effective in reforming their inmates, as the high incidence of recidivism\namong prison populations shows.The use of imprisonment as a main response to a\nwide variety of offences against the law is not a tenable approach in practical\nterms.Most offenders are neither violent nor dangerous.Their behaviour\nis not likely to be improved by the prison experience.In addition, their\ngrowing numbers in jails and penitentiaries entail serious problems of expense\nand administration, and possibly increased future risks to society.Moreover,\nmodern technology may now permit the monitoring in the community of some\noffenders who previously might have been incarcerated for incapacitation or\ndenunciation purposes.Alternatives to imprisonment and intermediate\nsanctions, therefore, are increasingly viewed as necessary developments.\n[Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.]The Committee\nproposed that alternative forms of sentencing should be considered for those\noffenders who did not endanger the safety of others.It was put in this way,\nat pp. 50 and 54:[O]ne of the primary foci of such alternatives must be on techniques\nwhich contribute to offenders accepting responsibility for their criminal\nconduct and, through their subsequent behaviour, demonstrating efforts to\nrestore the victim to the position he or she was in prior to the offence and/or\nproviding a meaningful apology.. . .[E]xcept where to do so would place the community at undue risk, the\n“correction” of the offender should take place in the community and\nimprisonment should be used with restraint.57Thus, it may be seen that although imprisonment is intended to serve the\ntraditional sentencing goals of separation, deterrence, denunciation, and\nrehabilitation, there is widespread consensus that imprisonment has not been\nsuccessful in achieving some of these goals.Overincarceration is a\nlong-standing problem that has been many times publicly acknowledged but never\naddressed in a systematic manner by Parliament.In recent years, compared to\nother countries, sentences of imprisonment in Canada have increased at an\nalarming rate.The 1996 sentencing reforms embodied in Part XXIII, and\ns. 718.2(e) in particular, must be understood as a reaction to the\noveruse of prison as a sanction, and must accordingly be given appropriate\nforce as remedial provisions.(2)The Overrepresentation of\nAboriginal Canadians in Penal Institutions58If overreliance upon incarceration is a problem with the general\npopulation, it is of much greater concern in the sentencing of aboriginal\nCanadians.In the mid-1980s, aboriginal people were about 2 percent of the\npopulation of Canada, yet they made up 10 percent of the penitentiary\npopulation.In Manitoba and Saskatchewan, aboriginal people constituted\nsomething between 6 and 7 percent of the population, yet in Manitoba they\nrepresented 46 percent of the provincial admissions and in Saskatchewan 60 percent:see M. Jackson, “Locking Up Natives in Canada” (1988-89), 23 U.B.C. L. Rev.\n215 (article originally prepared as a report of the Canadian Bar Association\nCommittee on Imprisonment and Release in June 1988), at pp. 215‑16.The situation has not improved in recent years.By 1997, aboriginal peoples\nconstituted closer to 3 percent of the population of Canada and amounted to 12\npercent of all federal inmates: Solicitor General of Canada, Consolidated\nReport, Towards a Just, Peaceful and Safe Society: The Corrections and\nConditional Release Act -- Five Years Later (1998), at pp. 142‑55.The situation continues to be particularly worrisome in Manitoba, where in 1995‑96\nthey made up 55 percent of admissions to provincial correctional facilities,\nand in Saskatchewan, where they made up 72 percent of admissions.A similar,\nalbeit less drastic situation prevails in Alberta and British Columbia:\nCanadian Centre for Justice Statistics, Adult Correctional Services in\nCanada, 1995‑96 (1997), at p. 30.59This serious problem of aboriginal overrepresentation in Canadian\nprisons is well documented.Like the general problem of overincarceration\nitself, the excessive incarceration of aboriginal peoples has received the\nattention of a large number of commissions and inquiries: see, by way of\nexample only, Canadian Corrections Association, Indians and the Law\n(1967); Law Reform Commission of Canada, The Native Offender and the Law\n(1974), prepared by D. A. Schmeiser; Public Inquiry into the\nAdministration of Justice and Aboriginal People, Report of the Aboriginal\nJustice Inquiry of Manitoba, vol. 1, The Justice System and Aboriginal\nPeople (1991); Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, Bridging the\nCultural Divide (1996).60In “Locking Up Natives in Canada”, supra, at pp. 215‑16,\nJackson provided a disturbing account of the enormity of the disproportion:Statistics about crime are often not well\nunderstood by the public and are subject to variable interpretation by the\nexperts.In the case of the statistics regarding the impact of the criminal\njustice system on native people the figures are so stark and appalling that the\nmagnitude of the problem can be neither misunderstood nor interpreted away.Native people come into contact with Canada’s correctional system in numbers\ngrossly disproportionate to their representation in the community.More than\nany other group in Canada they are subject to the damaging impacts of the\ncriminal justice system’s heaviest sanctions.Government figures ‑‑\nwhich reflect different definitions of “native” and which probably\nunderestimate the number of prisoners who consider themselves native ‑‑\nshow that almost 10% of the federal penitentiary population is native\n(including 13% of the federal women’s prisoner population) compared to about 2%\nof the population nationally. . . .Even more disturbing, the\ndisproportionality is growing.In 1965 some 22% of the prisoners in Stony\nMountain Penitentiary were native; in 1984 this proportion was 33%.It is\nrealistic to expect that absent radical change, the problem will intensify due\nto the higher birth rate in native communities.Bad as this situation is within the federal system,\nit is even worse in a number of the western provincial correctional systems.\n. . .A study reviewing admissions to Saskatchewan’s correctional\nsystem in 1976‑77 appropriately titled “Locking Up Indians in\nSaskatchewan”, contains findings that should shock the conscience of everyone\nin Canada.In comparison to male non‑natives, male treaty Indians were\n25 times more likely to be admitted to a provincial correctional centre while\nnon‑status Indians or Métis were 8 times more likely to be admitted.If\nonly the population over fifteen years of age is considered (the population\neligible to be admitted to provincial correctional centres in Saskatchewan),\nthen male treaty Indians were 37 times more likely to be admitted, while male\nnon‑status Indians were 12 times more likely to be admitted.For women\nthe figures are even more extreme: a treaty Indian woman was 131 times more\nlikely to be admitted and a non‑status or Métis woman 28 times more\nlikely than a non‑native.The Saskatchewan study brings home the implications\nof its findings by indicating that a treaty Indian boy turning 16 in 1976 had a\n70% chance of at least one stay in prison by the age of 25 (that age range\nbeing the one with the highest risk of imprisonment).The corresponding figure\nfor non‑status or Métis was 34%.For a non‑native Saskatchewan boy\nthe figure was 8%.Put another way, this means that in Saskatchewan, prison\nhas become for young native men, the promise of a just society which high\nschool and college represent for the rest of us.Placed in an historical\ncontext, the prison has become for many young native people the contemporary\nequivalent of what the Indian residential school represented for their parents.[Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.]61Not surprisingly, the excessive imprisonment of aboriginal people is\nonly the tip of the iceberg insofar as the estrangement of the aboriginal\npeoples from the Canadian criminal justice system is concerned.Aboriginal\npeople are overrepresented in virtually all aspects of the system.As this\nCourt recently noted in R. v. Williams, 1998 CanLII 782 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1128, at para. 58,\nthere is widespread bias against aboriginal people within Canada, and “[t]here\nis evidence that this widespread racism has translated into systemic\ndiscrimination in the criminal justice system”.62Statements regarding the extent and severity of this problem are\ndisturbingly common.In Bridging the Cultural Divide, supra, at\np. 309, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples listed as its first\n“Major Findings and Conclusions” the following striking yet representative\nstatement:The Canadian criminal justice system has failed the Aboriginal peoples\nof Canada ‑‑ First Nations, Inuit and Métis people, on‑reserve\nand off‑reserve, urban and rural ‑‑ in all territorial and\ngovernmental jurisdictions.The principal reason for this crushing failure is\nthe fundamentally different world views of Aboriginal and non‑Aboriginal\npeople with respect to such elemental issues as the substantive content of\njustice and the process of achieving justice.63To the same effect, the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba described\nthe justice system in Manitoba as having failed aboriginal people on a “massive\nscale”, referring particularly to the substantially different cultural values\nand experiences of aboriginal people: The Justice System and Aboriginal\nPeople, supra, at pp. 1 and 86.64These findings cry out for recognition of the magnitude and gravity of\nthe problem, and for responses to alleviate it.The figures are stark and\nreflect what may fairly be termed a crisis in the Canadian criminal justice\nsystem.The drastic overrepresentation of aboriginal peoples within both the\nCanadian prison population and the criminal justice system reveals a sad and\npressing social problem.It is reasonable to assume that Parliament, in\nsingling out aboriginal offenders for distinct sentencing treatment in\ns. 718.2(e), intended to attempt to redress this social problem to\nsome degree.The provision may properly be seen as Parliament’s direction to\nmembers of the judiciary to inquire into the causes of the problem and to\nendeavour to remedy it, to the extent that a remedy is possible through the\nsentencing process.65It is clear that sentencing innovation by itself cannot remove the\ncauses of aboriginal offending and the greater problem of aboriginal alienation\nfrom the criminal justice system.The unbalanced ratio of imprisonment for\naboriginal offenders flows from a number of sources, including poverty,\nsubstance abuse, lack of education, and the lack of employment opportunities\nfor aboriginal people.It arises also from bias against aboriginal people and\nfrom an unfortunate institutional approach that is more inclined to refuse bail\nand to impose more and longer prison terms for aboriginal offenders.There are\nmany aspects of this sad situation which cannot be addressed in these reasons.What can and must be addressed, though, is the limited role that sentencing\njudges will play in remedying injustice against aboriginal peoples in Canada.Sentencing judges are among those decision‑makers who have the power to\ninfluence the treatment of aboriginal offenders in the justice system.They\ndetermine most directly whether an aboriginal offender will go to jail, or\nwhether other sentencing options may be employed which will play perhaps a\nstronger role in restoring a sense of balance to the offender, victim, and\ncommunity, and in preventing future crime.E.A Framework of Analysis for the Sentencing Judge(1)What Are the “Circumstances of\nAboriginal Offenders”?66How are sentencing judges to play their remedial role?The words of\ns. 718.2(e) instruct the sentencing judge to pay particular\nattention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders, with the implication\nthat those circumstances are significantly different from those of non‑aboriginal\noffenders.The background considerations regarding the distinct situation of\naboriginal peoples in Canada encompass a wide range of unique circumstances,\nincluding, most particularly:(A)The unique systemic or background factors\nwhich may have played a part in bringing the particular aboriginal offender\nbefore the courts; and(B)The types of sentencing procedures and\nsanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender\nbecause of his or her particular aboriginal heritage or connection.(a)Systemic and Background\nFactors67The background factors which figure prominently in the causation of\ncrime by aboriginal offenders are by now well known.Years of dislocation and\neconomic development have translated, for many aboriginal peoples, into low\nincomes, high unemployment, lack of opportunities and options, lack or\nirrelevance of education, substance abuse, loneliness, and community\nfragmentation.These and other factors contribute to a higher incidence of\ncrime and incarceration.A disturbing account of these factors is set out by\nProfessor Tim Quigley, “Some Issues in Sentencing of Aboriginal Offenders”, in Continuing\nPoundmaker and Riel’s Quest (1994), at pp. 269‑300.Quigley ably\ndescribes the process whereby these various factors produce an\noverincarceration of aboriginal offenders, noting (at pp. 275-76) that “[t]he\nunemployed, transients, the poorly educated are all better candidates for\nimprisonment.When the social, political and economic aspects of our society\nplace Aboriginal people disproportionately within the ranks of the latter, our\nsociety literally sentences more of them to jail.”68It is true that systemic and background factors explain in part the\nincidence of crime and recidivism for non‑aboriginal offenders as well.However, it must be recognized that the circumstances of aboriginal offenders\ndiffer from those of the majority because many aboriginal people are victims of\nsystemic and direct discrimination, many suffer the legacy of dislocation, and\nmany are substantially affected by poor social and economic conditions.Moreover, as has been emphasized repeatedly in studies and commission reports,\naboriginal offenders are, as a result of these unique systemic and background\nfactors, more adversely affected by incarceration and less likely to be\n“rehabilitated” thereby, because the internment milieu is often culturally\ninappropriate and regrettably discrimination towards them is so often rampant\nin penal institutions.69In this case, of course, we are dealing with factors that must be\nconsidered by a judge sentencing an aboriginal offender.While background and\nsystemic factors will also be of importance for a judge in sentencing a non‑aboriginal\noffender, the judge who is called upon to sentence an aboriginal offender must\ngive attention to the unique background and systemic factors which may have\nplayed a part in bringing the particular offender before the courts.In cases\nwhere such factors have played a significant role, it is incumbent upon the\nsentencing judge to consider these factors in evaluating whether imprisonment\nwould actually serve to deter, or to denounce crime in a sense that would be\nmeaningful to the community of which the offender is a member.In many\ninstances, more restorative sentencing principles will gain primary relevance\nprecisely because the prevention of crime as well as individual and social\nhealing cannot occur through other means.(b)Appropriate Sentencing\nProcedures and Sanctions70Closely related to the background and systemic factors which have\ncontributed to an excessive aboriginal incarceration rate are the different\nconceptions of appropriate sentencing procedures and sanctions held by\naboriginal people.A significant problem experienced by aboriginal people who\ncome into contact with the criminal justice system is that the traditional\nsentencing ideals of deterrence, separation, and denunciation are often far\nremoved from the understanding of sentencing held by these offenders and their\ncommunity.The aims of restorative justice as now expressed in paras. (d),\n(e), and (f) of s. 718 of the Criminal Code apply to\nall offenders, and not only aboriginal offenders.However, most traditional\naboriginal conceptions of sentencing place a primary emphasis upon the\nideals of restorative justice.This tradition is extremely important to the\nanalysis under s. 718.2(e).71The concept and principles of a restorative approach will necessarily\nhave to be developed over time in the jurisprudence, as different issues and\ndifferent conceptions of sentencing are addressed in their appropriate\ncontext.In general terms, restorative justice may be described as an approach\nto remedying crime in which it is understood that all things are interrelated\nand that crime disrupts the harmony which existed prior to its occurrence, or\nat least which it is felt should exist.The appropriateness of a particular\nsanction is largely determined by the needs of the victims, and the community, as\nwell as the offender.The focus is on the human beings closely affected by the\ncrime. See generally, e.g., Bridging the Cultural Divide, supra,\nat pp. 12‑25; The Justice System and Aboriginal People, supra,\nat pp. 17‑46;Kwochka, supra; M. Jackson, “In Search of the\nPathways to Justice: Alternative Dispute Resolution in Aboriginal Communities”,\n[1992] U.B.C. L. Rev. (Special Edition) 147.72The existing overemphasis on incarceration in Canada may be partly due\nto the perception that a restorative approach is a more lenient approach to\ncrime and that imprisonment constitutes the ultimate punishment.Yet in our\nview a sentence focussed on restorative justice is not necessarily a “lighter”\npunishment.Some proponents of restorative justice argue that when it is\ncombined with probationary conditions it may in some circumstances impose a\ngreater burden on the offender than a custodial sentence.See Kwochka, supra,\nwho writes at p. 165:At this point there is some divergence among\nproponents of restorative justice.Some seek to abandon the punishment\nparadigm by focusing on the differing goals of a restorative system.Others,\nwhile cognizant of the differing goals, argue for a restorative system in terms\nof a punishment model.They argue that non‑custodial sentences can have\nan equivalent punishment value when produced and administered by a restorative\nsystem and that the healing process can be more intense than incarceration.Restorative justice necessarily involves some form of restitution and\nreintegration into the community.Central to the process is the need for\noffenders to take responsibility for their actions.By comparison,\nincarceration obviates the need to accept responsibility.Facing victim and\ncommunity is for some more frightening than the possibility of a term of\nimprisonment and yields a more beneficial result in that the offender may\nbecome a healed and functional member of the community rather than a bitter\noffender returning after a term of imprisonment.73In describing in general terms some of the basic tenets of traditional\naboriginal sentencing approaches, we do not wish to imply that all aboriginal\noffenders, victims, and communities share an identical understanding of\nappropriate sentences for particular offences and offenders.Aboriginal\ncommunities stretch from coast to coast and from the border with the United\nStates to the far north.Their customs and traditions and their concept of\nsentencing vary widely.What is important to recognize is that, for many if\nnot most aboriginal offenders, the current concepts of sentencing are\ninappropriate because they have frequently not responded to the needs,\nexperiences, and perspectives of aboriginal people or aboriginal communities.74It is unnecessary to engage here in an extensive discussion of the\nrelatively recent evolution of innovative sentencing practices, such as healing\nand sentencing circles, and aboriginal community council projects, which are\navailable especially to aboriginal offenders.What is important to note is\nthat the different conceptions of sentencing held by many aboriginal people\nshare a common underlying principle: that is, the importance of community‑based\nsanctions.Sentencing judges should not conclude that the absence of\nalternatives specific to an aboriginal community eliminates their ability to\nimpose a sanction that takes into account principles of restorative justice and\nthe needs of the parties involved.Rather, the point is that one of the unique\ncircumstances of aboriginal offenders is that community‑based sanctions\ncoincide with the aboriginal concept of sentencing and the needs of aboriginal\npeople and communities.It is often the case that neither aboriginal offenders\nnor their communities are well served by incarcerating offenders, particularly\nfor less serious or non-violent offences.Where these sanctions are reasonable\nin the circumstances, they should be implemented.In all instances, it is\nappropriate to attempt to craft the sentencing process and the sanctions\nimposed in accordance with the aboriginal perspective.(2)The Search for a Fit Sentence75The role of the judge who sentences an aboriginal offender is, as for\nevery offender, to determine a fit sentence taking into account all the\ncircumstances of the offence, the offender, the victims, and the community.Nothing in Part XXIII of the Criminal Code alters this fundamental\nduty as a general matter.However, the effect of s. 718.2(e),\nviewed in the context of Part XXIII as a whole, is to alter the method of\nanalysis which sentencing judges must use in determining a fit sentence for\naboriginal offenders.Section 718.2(e) requires that sentencing\ndeterminations take into account the unique circumstances of aboriginal\npeoples.76In R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at p. 567, Lamer\nC.J. restated the long-standing principle of Canadian sentencing law that the\nappropriateness of a sentence will depend on the particular circumstances of\nthe offence, the offender, and the community in which the offence took place.Disparity of sentences for similar crimes is a natural consequence of this\nindividualized focus.As he stated:It has been repeatedly stressed that there is no such thing as a\nuniform sentence for a particular crime. . . . Sentencing is an\ninherently individualized process, and the search for a single appropriate\nsentence for a similar offender and a similar crime will frequently be a\nfruitless exercise of academic abstraction.As well, sentences for a\nparticular offence should be expected to vary to some degree across various\ncommunities and regions of this country, as the “just and appropriate” mix of\naccepted sentencing goals will depend on the needs and current conditions of\nand in the particular community where the crime occurred.77The comments of Lamer C.J. are particularly apt in the context of\naboriginal offenders.As explained herein, the circumstances of aboriginal\noffenders are markedly different from those of other offenders, being\ncharacterized by unique systemic and background factors.Further, an\naboriginal offender’s community will frequently understand the nature of a just\nsanction in a manner significantly different from that of many non‑aboriginal\ncommunities.In appropriate cases, some of the traditional sentencing\nobjectives will be correspondingly less relevant in determining a sentence that\nis reasonable in the circumstances, and the goals of restorative justice will\nquite properly be given greater weight.Through its reform of the purpose of\nsentencing in s. 718, and through its specific directive to judges who\nsentence aboriginal offenders, Parliament has, more than ever before, empowered\nsentencing judges to craft sentences in a manner which is meaningful to\naboriginal peoples.78In describing the effect of s. 718.2(e) in this way, we do\nnot mean to suggest that, as a general practice, aboriginal offenders must\nalways be sentenced in a manner which gives greatest weight to the principles\nof restorative justice, and less weight to goals such as deterrence,\ndenunciation, and separation.It is unreasonable to assume that aboriginal\npeoples themselves do not believe in the importance of these latter goals, and\neven if they do not, that such goals must not predominate in appropriate\ncases.Clearly there are some serious offences and some offenders for which\nand for whom separation, denunciation, and deterrence are fundamentally\nrelevant.79Yet, even where an offence is considered serious, the length of the term\nof imprisonment must be considered.In some circumstances the length of the\nsentence of an aboriginal offender may be less and in others the same as that\nof any other offender.Generally, the more violent and serious the offence the\nmore likely it is as a practical reality that the terms of imprisonment for\naboriginals and non‑aboriginals will be close to each other or the same,\neven taking into account their different concepts of sentencing.80As with all sentencing decisions, the sentencing of aboriginal offenders\nmust proceed on an individual (or a case-by-case) basis:For this\noffence, committed by this offender, harming this victim, in this\ncommunity, what is the appropriate sanction under the Criminal Code?What understanding of criminal sanctions is held by the community?What is the\nnature of the relationship between the offender and his or her community?What\ncombination of systemic or background factors contributed to this particular\noffender coming before the courts for this particular offence?How has the\noffender who is being sentenced been affected by, for example, substance abuse\nin the community, or poverty, or overt racism, or family or community\nbreakdown?Would imprisonment effectively serve to deter or denounce crime in\na sense that would be significant to the offender and community, or are crime\nprevention and other goals better achieved through healing?What sentencing\noptions present themselves in these circumstances?81The analysis for sentencing aboriginal offenders, as for all offenders,\nmust be holistic and designed to achieve a fit sentence in the circumstances.There is no single test that a judge can apply in order to determine the\nsentence.The sentencing judge is required to take into account all of the\nsurrounding circumstances regarding the offence, the offender, the victims, and\nthe community, including the unique circumstances of the offender as an\naboriginal person.Sentencing must proceed with sensitivity to and\nunderstanding of the difficulties aboriginal people have faced with both the\ncriminal justice system and society at large.When evaluating these\ncircumstances in light of the aims and principles of sentencing as set out in\nPart XXIII of the Criminal Code and in the jurisprudence, the judge\nmust strive to arrive at a sentence which is just and appropriate in the\ncircumstances.By means of s. 718.2(e), sentencing judges have\nbeen provided with a degree of flexibility and discretion to consider in appropriate\ncircumstances alternative sentences to incarceration which are appropriate for\nthe aboriginal offender and community and yet comply with the mandated\nprinciples and purpose of sentencing.In this way, effect may be given to the\naboriginal emphasis upon healing and restoration of both the victim and the\noffender.(3)The Duty of the Sentencing\nJudge82The foregoing discussion of guidelines for the sentencing judge has\nspoken of that which a judge must do when sentencing an aboriginal offender.This\nelement of duty is a critical component of s. 718.2(e).The\nprovision expressly provides that a court that imposes a sentence should\nconsider all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in\nthe circumstances, and should pay particular attention to the\ncircumstances of aboriginal offenders.There is no discretion as to whether to\nconsider the unique situation of the aboriginal offender; the only discretion\nconcerns the determination of a just and appropriate sentence.83How then is the consideration of s. 718.2(e) to proceed in\nthe daily functioning of the courts?The manner in which the sentencing judge\nwill carry out his or her statutory duty may vary from case to case.In all\ninstances it will be necessary for the judge to take judicial notice of the\nsystemic or background factors and the approach to sentencing which is relevant\nto aboriginal offenders.However, for each particular offence and offender it\nmay be that some evidence will be required in order to assist the sentencing\njudge in arriving at a fit sentence.Where a particular offender does not wish\nsuch evidence to be adduced, the right to have particular attention paid to his\nor her circumstances as an aboriginal offender may be waived.Where there is\nno such waiver, it will be extremely helpful to the sentencing judge for\ncounsel on both sides to adduce relevant evidence.Indeed, it is to be\nexpected that counsel will fulfil their role and assist the sentencing judge in\nthis way.84However, even where counsel do not adduce this evidence, where for\nexample the offender is unrepresented, it is incumbent upon the sentencing\njudge to attempt to acquire information regarding the circumstances of the\noffender as an aboriginal person.Whether the offender resides in a rural\narea, on a reserve or in an urban centre the sentencing judge must be made\naware of alternatives to incarceration that exist whether inside or outside the\naboriginal community of the particular offender.The alternatives existing in\nmetropolitan areas must, as a matter of course, also be explored.Clearly the\npresence of an aboriginal offender will require special attention in pre‑sentence\nreports.Beyond the use of the pre‑sentence report, the sentencing judge\nmay and should in appropriate circumstances and where practicable request that\nwitnesses be called who may testify as to reasonable alternatives.85Similarly, where a sentencing judge at the trial level has not engaged\nin the duty imposed by s. 718.2(e) as fully as required, it is\nincumbent upon a court of appeal in considering an appeal against sentence on\nthis basis to consider any fresh evidence which is relevant and admissible on\nsentencing.In the same vein, it should be noted that, although s. 718.2(e)\ndoes not impose a statutory duty upon the sentencing judge to provide reasons,\nit will be much easier for a reviewing court to determine whether and how\nattention was paid to the circumstances of the offender as an aboriginal person\nif at least brief reasons are given.(4)The Issue of “Reverse\nDiscrimination”86Something must also be said as to the manner in which s. 718.2(e)\nshould not be interpreted.The appellant and the respondent diverged\nsignificantly in their interpretation of the appropriate role to be played by\ns. 718.2(e).While the respondent saw the provision largely as a\nrestatement of existing sentencing principles, the appellant advanced the\nposition that s. 718.2(e) functions as an affirmative action\nprovision justified under s. 15(2) of the Charter.The respondent\ncautioned that, in his view, the appellant’s understanding of the provision\nwould result in “reverse discrimination” so as to favour aboriginal offenders\nover other offenders.87There is no constitutional challenge to s. 718.2(e) in these\nproceedings, and accordingly we do not address specifically the applicability\nof s. 15 of the Charter.We would note, though, that the aim of\ns. 718.2(e) is to reduce the tragic overrepresentation of\naboriginal people in prisons.It seeks to ameliorate the present situation and\nto deal with the particular offence and offender and community.The fact that\na court is called upon to take into consideration the unique circumstances\nsurrounding these different parties is not unfair to non‑aboriginal people.Rather, the fundamental purpose of s. 718.2(e) is to treat\naboriginal offenders fairly by taking into account their difference.88But s. 718.2(e) should not be taken as requiring an automatic\nreduction of a sentence, or a remission of a warranted period of incarceration,\nsimply because the offender is aboriginal.To the extent that the appellant’s\nsubmission on affirmative action means that s. 718.2(e) requires an\nautomatic reduction in sentence for an aboriginal offender, we reject that\nview.The provision is a direction to sentencing judges to consider certain\nunique circumstances pertaining to aboriginal offenders as a part of the task\nof weighing the multitude of factors which must be taken into account in\nstriving to impose a fit sentence.It cannot be forgotten that s. 718.2(e)\nmust be considered in the context of that section read as a whole and in the\ncontext of s. 718, s. 718.1, and the overall scheme of\nPart XXIII.It is one of the statutorily mandated considerations that a sentencing\njudge must take into account.It may not always mean a lower sentence for an\naboriginal offender.The sentence imposed will depend upon all the\nfactors which must be taken into account in each individual case.The weight\nto be given to these various factors will vary in each case.At the same time,\nit must in every case be recalled that the direction to consider these unique\ncircumstances flows from the staggering injustice currently experienced by\naboriginal peoples with the criminal justice system.The provision reflects\nthe reality that many aboriginal people are alienated from this system which\nfrequently does not reflect their needs or their understanding of an\nappropriate sentence.(5)Who Comes Within the Purview\nof Section 718.2(e)?89The question of whether s. 718.2(e) applies to all\naboriginal persons, or only to certain classes thereof, is raised by this\nappeal.The following passage of the reasons of the judge at trial appears to\nreflect some ambiguity as to the applicability of the provision to aboriginal\npeople who do not live in rural areas or on a reserve:The factor that is mentioned in the Criminal\nCode is that particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal\noffenders should be considered.In this case both the deceased and the accused\nwere aboriginals, but they are not living within the aboriginal community as\nsuch.They are living off a reserve and the offence occurred in an urban\nsetting.They [sic] do not appear to have been any special\ncircumstances because of their aboriginal status and so I am not giving any\nspecial consideration to their background in passing this sentence.It could be\nunderstood from that passage that, in this case, there were no special\ncircumstances to warrant the application of s. 718.2(e), and the fact\nthat the context of the offence was not in a rural setting or on a reserve was\nonly one of those missing circumstances.However, this passage was interpreted\nby the majority of the Court of Appeal as implying that, “as a matter of\nprinciple, s. 718.2(e) can have no application to aboriginals ‘not\nliving within the aboriginal community’” (p. 137).This understanding of the\nprovision was unanimously rejected by the members of the Court of Appeal.With\nrespect to the trial judge, who was given little assistance from counsel on\nthis issue, we agree with the Court of Appeal that such a restrictive\ninterpretation of the provision would be inappropriate.90The class of aboriginal people who come within the purview of the\nspecific reference to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders in\ns. 718.2(e) must be, at least, all who come within the scope of s. 25\nof the Charter and s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.The\nnumbers involved are significant.National census figures from 1996 show that\nan estimated 799,010 people were identified as aboriginal in 1996.Of this\nnumber, 529,040 were Indians (registered or non‑registered), 204,115\nMetis and 40,220 Inuit.91Section 718.2(e) applies to all aboriginal offenders wherever\nthey reside, whether on- or off-reserve, in a large city or a rural area.Indeed it has been observed that many aboriginals living in urban areas are\nclosely attached to their culture.See the Royal Commission on Aboriginal\nPeoples, Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples,\nvol. 4, Perspectives and Realities (1996), at p. 521:Throughout the Commission’s hearings, Aboriginal\npeople stressed the fundamental importance of retaining and enhancing their\ncultural identity while living in urban areas.Aboriginal identity lies at the\nheart of Aboriginal peoples’ existence; maintaining that identity is an\nessential and self‑validating pursuit for Aboriginal people in cities.And at\np. 525:Cultural identity for urban Aboriginal people is\nalso tied to a land base or ancestral territory.For many, the two concepts\nare inseparable.... Identification with an ancestral place is important to\nurban people because of the associated ritual, ceremony and traditions, as well\nas the people who remain there, the sense of belonging, the bond to an\nancestral community, and the accessibility of family, community and elders.92Section 718.2(e) requires the sentencing judge to explore\nreasonable alternatives to incarceration in the case of all aboriginal\noffenders.Obviously, if an aboriginal community has a program or tradition of\nalternative sanctions, and support and supervision are available to the\noffender, it may be easier to find and impose an alternative sentence.However, even if community support is not available, every effort should be\nmade in appropriate circumstances to find a sensitive and helpful alternative.For all purposes, the term “community” must be defined broadly so as to include\nany network of support and interaction that might be available in an urban\ncentre.At the same time, the residence of the aboriginal offender in an urban\ncentre that lacks any network of support does not relieve the sentencing judge\nof the obligation to try to find an alternative to imprisonment.VI.Summary93Let us see if a general summary can be made of what has been discussed\nin these reasons.1.Part XXIII of the Criminal Code\ncodifies the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing and the factors\nthat should be considered by a judge in striving to determine a sentence that\nis fit for the offender and the offence.2.Section 718.2(e) mandatorily requires\nsentencing judges to consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment\nand to pay particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.3.Section 718.2(e) is not simply a\ncodification of existing jurisprudence. It is remedial in nature.Its purpose\nis to ameliorate the serious problem of overrepresentation of aboriginal people\nin prisons, and to encourage sentencing judges to have recourse to a restorative\napproach to sentencing.There is a judicial duty to give the provision’s\nremedial purpose real force.4.Section 718.2(e) must be read\nand considered in the context of the rest of the factors referred to in that\nsection and in light of all of Part XXIII.All principles and factors set\nout in Part XXIII must be taken into consideration in determining the fit\nsentence.Attention should be paid to the fact that Part XXIII, through ss.\n718, 718.2(e), and 742.1, among other provisions, has placed a new emphasis\nupon decreasing the use of incarceration.5.Sentencing is an individual process and in\neach case the consideration must continue to be what is a fit sentence for this\naccused for this offence in this community.However, the effect of\ns. 718.2(e) is to alter the method of analysis which sentencing\njudges must use in determining a fit sentence for aboriginal offenders.6.Section 718.2(e) directs sentencing\njudges to undertake the sentencing of aboriginal offenders individually, but\nalso differently, because the circumstances of aboriginal people are unique.In sentencing an aboriginal offender, the judge must consider:(A)The unique systemic or background\nfactors which may have played a part in bringing the particular aboriginal offender\nbefore the courts; and(B)The types of sentencing procedures and\nsanctions which may be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender\nbecause of his or her particular aboriginal heritage or connection.7.In order to undertake these considerations\nthe trial judge will require information pertaining to the accused.Judges may\ntake judicial notice of the broad systemic and background factors affecting\naboriginal people, and of the priority given in aboriginal cultures to a\nrestorative approach to sentencing.In the usual course of events, additional\ncase‑specific information will come from counsel and from a pre‑sentence\nreport which takes into account the factors set out in #6, which in turn may\ncome from representations of the relevant aboriginal community which will\nusually be that of the offender.The offender may waive the gathering of that\ninformation.8.If there is no alternative to incarceration\nthe length of the term must be carefully considered.9.Section 718.2(e) is not to be taken\nas a means of automatically reducing the prison sentence of aboriginal\noffenders; nor should it be assumed that an offender is receiving a more\nlenient sentence simply because incarceration is not imposed.10.The absence of alternative sentencing\nprograms specific to an aboriginal community does not eliminate the ability of\na sentencing judge to impose a sanction that takes into account principles of\nrestorative justice and the needs of the parties involved.11.Section 718.2(e) applies to all\naboriginal persons wherever they reside, whether on- or off-reserve, in a large\ncity or a rural area.In defining the relevant aboriginal community for the\npurpose of achieving an effective sentence, the term “community” must be\ndefined broadly so as to include any network of support and interaction that\nmight be available, including in an urban centre.At the same time, the\nresidence of the aboriginal offender in an urban centre that lacks any network\nof support does not relieve the sentencing judge of the obligation to try to\nfind an alternative to imprisonment.12.Based on the foregoing, the jail term for\nan aboriginal offender may in some circumstances be less than the term imposed\non a non‑aboriginal offender for the same offence.13.It is unreasonable to assume that\naboriginal peoples do not believe in the importance of traditional sentencing\ngoals such as deterrence, denunciation, and separation, where warranted.In\nthis context, generally, the more serious and violent the crime, the more\nlikely it will be as a practical matter that the terms of imprisonment will be\nthe same for similar offences and offenders, whether the offender is aboriginal\nor non‑aboriginal.VII.Was There an Error Made in This Case?94From the foregoing analysis it can be seen that the sentencing judge,\nwho did not have the benefit of these reasons, fell into error.He may have\nerred in limiting the application of s. 718.2(e) to the\ncircumstances of aboriginal offenders living in rural areas or on-reserve.Moreover, and perhaps as a consequence of the first error, he does not appear\nto have considered the systemic or background factors which may have influenced\nthe appellant to engage in criminal conduct, or the possibly distinct\nconception of sentencing held by the appellant, by the victim Beaver’s family,\nand by their community.However, it should be emphasized that the sentencing\njudge did take active steps to obtain at least some information regarding the\nappellant’s aboriginal heritage.In this regard he received little if any\nassistance from counsel on this issue although they too were acting without the\nbenefit of these reasons.95The majority of the Court of Appeal, in dismissing the appellant’s\nappeal, also does not appear to have considered many of the factors referred to\nabove.However, the dissenting reasons of Rowles J.A. discuss the relevant\nfactors in some detail.The majority also appears to have dismissed the\nappellant’s application to adduce fresh evidence.The majority of the Court of\nAppeal may or may not have erred in ultimately deciding to dismiss the fresh\nevidence application.The correctness of its ultimate decision depends largely\nupon the admissibility of the fresh evidence and its relevance to the weighing\nof the various sentencing goals.However, assuming admissibility and\nrelevance, it was certainly incumbent upon the majority to consider the\nevidence, and especially so given the failure of the trial judge to do so.Moreover,\nif the fresh evidence before the Court of Appeal was itself insufficient to\ninform the court adequately regarding the circumstances of the appellant as an\naboriginal offender, the proper remedy would have been to remit the matter to\nthe trial judge with instructions to make all the reasonable inquiries\nnecessary for the sentencing of this aboriginal offender.96In most cases, errors such as those in the courts below would be\nsufficient to justify sending the matter back for a new sentencing hearing.It\nis difficult for this Court to determine a fit sentence for the appellant\naccording to the suggested guidelines set out herein on the basis of the very\nlimited evidence before us regarding the appellant’s aboriginal background.However, as both the trial judge and all members of the Court of Appeal\nacknowledged, the offence in question is a most serious one, properly described\nby Esson J.A. as a “near murder”.Moreover, the offence involved domestic\nviolence and a breach of the trust inherent in a spousal relationship.That\naggravating factor must be taken into account in the sentencing of the\naboriginal appellant as it would be for any offender.For that offence by this\noffender a sentence of three years’ imprisonment was not unreasonable.97More importantly, the appellant was granted day parole on August 13,\n1997, after she had served six months in the Burnaby Correctional Centre\nfor Women.She was directed to reside with her father, to take alcohol and\nsubstance abuse counselling and to comply with the requirements of the\nElectronic Monitoring Program.On February 25, 1998, the appellant was\ngranted full parole with the same conditions as the ones applicable to her\noriginal release on day parole.98In this case, the results of the sentence with incarceration for six\nmonths and the subsequent controlled release were in the interests of both the\nappellant and society.In these circumstances, we do not consider that it\nwould be in the interests of justice to order a new sentencing hearing in order\nto canvass the appellant’s circumstances as an aboriginal offender.99In the result, the appeal is dismissed.Appeal dismissed.Solicitor for the appellant:Gil D. McKinnon, Vancouver.Solicitor for the respondent:The Ministry of the\nAttorney General, Vancouver.Solicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Canada:The\nDepartment of Justice, Ottawa.Solicitor for the intervener the Attorney General for Alberta:Alberta Justice, Calgary.Solicitors for the intervener the Aboriginal Legal Services of\nToronto Inc.: Kent Roach and Kimberly R.

Millerfor\nthe CrownMaria Pappas, Q.C.for\nthe accusedJUDGMENTGUNN J.November 22, 2013[1]The accused has entered guilty pleas\nto the following two charges:1.That he did on or about the 2nd\nday of April, 2012 at or near Punnichy, steal from Brenda Kraemer, a bottle of\nwhiskey while armed with an offensive weapon to wit a knife, contrary to Section\n344(1) of the Criminal Code; and2.That he did on the same date with intent\nto commit the indictable offence of robbery have his face masked, contrary to\nSection 351(2) of the Criminal Code.[2]The accused was arrested on these\ncharges on April 2, 2012 and he has remained in custody on these charges since\nthat date. That equates to approximately 19 months and three weeks.PROCEDURAL\nHISTORY[3]The accused first appeared in\nProvincial Court on these charges April 3, 2012. There were seven adjournments\nby consent to September 11, 2012 when the accused waived his right to have a\npreliminary hearing. On a couple of occasions on these adjournments, there is a\nnotation that it was adjourned to obtain alternate counsel. Mr. Taniskishayinew\nhas been represented throughout by Legal Aid, but not by the same office. The\nindictment was filed with the court on November 7, 2012.[4]The matter was heard in the Court of\nQueen’s Bench at the pre-trials on December\n14, 2012 and adjourned to February 21, 2013. At that time guilty pleas were\nentered to the two counts earlier referenced. Sentencing was adjourned to\nOctober 30, 2013 as counsel were waiting for the release of a decision from the\nSaskatchewan Court of Appeal which would have a significant effect on the\nsentencing proceedings.FACTS[5]An amended agreed statement of facts\nwas presented to the court. The facts presented were the following:On April\n01, 2012, at approximately 3:30 p.m. the accused, Clarence Taniskishayinew,\nentered into the KC Corner Store in Punnichy, Saskatchewan. He went in alone.\nHe was wearing a black and white skeleton Halloween mask and at that point,\nBrenda Kraemer, the manager of the convenience store, could only observe that\nthe accused had something in his hand, but couldn’t tell what it was. Ms. Kraemer was the lone clerk in\nthe store and had been working behind the counter. He approached the counter\nand she asked him what he wanted to buy. The accused said, “This is a robbery and I have a knife.” She asked him if he was joking. He then told the\nclerk, “I want a forty.”\nShe said she would call the police. He came around the counter to where she was\nstanding and showed her the knife saying, “See\nI have this knife, this is a robbery, I want a 40\" and then pointed it\nat her. He was within arms’ reach of her.\nShe handed him a forty-ounce bottle of Wiser’s\nwhiskey and he turned and walked out.As he was\nleaving, an adult male and three small children were coming into the store.\nBrenda Kraemer told the adult “He has a knife\nand he’s robbing the place”.\nThe adult male went outside to try to locate the accused. She followed. She was\non the phone with dispatch.Constable\nTrevor Loeb located the accused a short distance away from the store within\nminutes of the complaint. Constable Loeb first observed him walking on the\nstreet with both hands in his bunny hug pockets. The officer stopped and got\nout of his vehicle, said “Police, stop where you are”, drew his pistol and yelled at the accused, “Police, take your hands out of your pockets slow and\nraise your hands over your head” The accused\ndid not comply, saying, “No, what are you going to do about it, I will take you\non.” Constable Loeb, being unsure as to what weapons the\naccused had, raised his service pistol and pointed it at the accused saying “Police, take your hands out of your pockets slowly.” The accused said, “You\ngot me” and took one of his hands out of his pocket and\nraising it to his side, he then removed the bottle of liquor that was poking\nout of his bunny hug with his other hand and raised it to his side. Loeb\nordered the accused to place the bottle on the ground slowly and move back from\nit. The accused said “If I’m going down, I’m going to have some.” He then opened the bottle of Wiser’s\nwhiskey and took a big drink from it. The officer again ordered him to put the\nbottle on the ground. The accused said, “Take\nme out, you’re going to have to take me out.” Constable Loeb told that (sic) accused that he would\nbe forced to use OC spray, and told the suspect to lower the bottle to\nthe ground, raise his arms in the air and drop to his knees. At that point, the\naccused complied and put the bottle of alcohol down raising his hands above his\nhead and moved to his knees. Loeb ordered him down to his stomach and the\naccused complied. Loeb told him to spread out his arms and legs. He complied.\nLoeb cuffed the accused while he was on the ground. Upon searching the accused,\nthe police located a Halloween skeleton mask, a black glove and the forty-ounce\nof Wiser’s that was near full. No knife was located either on\nthe accused or in the area. The accused was heavily intoxicated. The accused\nrequired assistance to stand up and to walk to the police vehicle. He was\narrested, transported to cells, and lodged....[Emphasis in Original]THE\nACCUSED[6]He is 43 years old. He had a\nsignificant criminal history at the time of these offences, commencing in 1987\nand ending in 2008. The record contains 23 previous convictions. Included in\nthese 23 convictions are four robbery charges registered in 1987, two in 2003\nand 2005, four theft charges, and four assault related charges. The Crown provided\nsome details with respect to three of the robbery charges. In 2002 the accused\nrobbed a Shell Service station using a knife as his weapon. Five days later in\n2002, the accused entered a 7-11 store just after midnight and pointed a knife\nat a clerk demanding money and cigarettes. In the February 2005 robbery, the\naccused approached a parked vehicle in a 7-11 parking lot and threatened the\ndriver and passenger with a knife. For the 2002 robberies, the accused was\nsentenced to two years on each charge consecutive to each other. He was\nsentenced to three years on the 2005 robbery.[7]The accused was born in Wadena,\nSaskatchewan. He is an aboriginal man, the youngest of four children. The\naccused’s father died approximately three\nyears ago. The accused’s mother is still alive, but the accused has no contact with\nher. The accused was removed from his home when he was 6 months of age due to\nhis parents’ alcoholism.Although the accused was too young to observe much in his\nhome prior to his removal, his elder siblings have all been perpetrators or\nvictims of serious violence. The accused was raised in foster homes, numbering\nat least five —and then moved to Ranch Ehrlo where he stayed from age 13 to age 16. He\nsuffered physical, sexual and emotional abuse in the foster homes and again\nlater at Boys School. The accused attended residential schools where he was\nalso abused.[8]The accused has completed his GED\ngrade 12 while in custody. The accused began to drink alcohol at the age of\neight and it was a serious problem by age 16. He started using drugs at the age\nof 10 and has used marihuana, cocaine and morphine by injection. He has tried\nvarious treatment programs over the years, but has had mixed success. He last\nused hard drugs in 1999, but the longest he has remained sober has been two\nmonths prior to this incarceration.[9]The accused was involved in a long\nterm spousal relationship with Melanie Lavalee for 13 years until she died of\nan overdose in 2000. This was a stormy relationship fraught with substance abuse,\npoverty and violence. The accused had three children. His eldest daughter died\nat the age of 17 from an aneurysm. His other two children are 24 and 16\nrespectively.[10]Not long before the commission of these\noffences, the accused participated in the Residential School Mediation process.\nThis ignited some memories which the accused had been able to suppress. The\nmediation process was an extremely stressful process for him. The timing of the\nprocess was unfortunate in that it coincided with the anniversaries of the\ndeaths of his daughter and his wife. He drank to cope.[11]The accused was highly intoxicated at\nthe time of this offence and he has no real memory of it.POSITION\nOF THE CROWN[12]The Crown seeks a sentence of 6 ½ years less remand time, computed on\na one to one basis.POSITION\nOF THE ACCUSED[13]The accused seeks a sentence of four to\nsix years less remand time, computed on a 1.5 to one basis.[14]In support of his position with respect\nto remand credit, Mr. Taniskishayinew’s counsel indicated that he wanted to\nplead guilty immediately. She indicates the case was delayed for a number of\nreasons which should not be attributed to the accused. Others were initially\nunder investigation; conflicts in terms of representation had to be sorted out\nwithin the Legal Aid system and when the Crown indicated the accused was being\nflagged as a possible dangerous offender the process slowed considerably.\nCounsel submits that none of the time the accused has spent in custody can be\nattributed to him.[15]He has been housed in a 12' by 8' cell\nwhich he has had to share with another inmate. He has been in 19.5 to 23 hour\nlock up for much of the time he has been in custody. This is to be compared\nwith serving prisoners who are in lock up for one hour during the day and\novernight.[16]The accused has spent his time in\nproductive ways. He has taken stress management. He has been studying the\nbible. He has taken upgrading to improve his marks. He has continued with his\nResidential School Claim and had his hearing.[17]The accused filed a number of\ncertificates with the court evidencing the positive steps he has taken while in\ncustody. These include the following:Stress Management completed June 20, 2012Basic Series Bible Study Correspondence completed November 15, 2012Ultimate Questions Level 1 Course 1 completed November 20, 2012GED Test results for Language Arts, Writing; Science; and Social Studies\nNovember 26, 2012The Christian Way in Marriage completed December 4, 2012Growing Through Bible Study completed December 4, 20128 Courses by Home Bible Studies completed December 14, 2012[18]The accused invites the court to take\ninto account the Gladue (R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, 171\nD.L.R. (4th) 385) principles as the accused is an aboriginal\noffender who has been adversely affected by family breakdown, substance abuse\nand poverty.[19]The accused also submits that the\nsentences for the two offences should run concurrently, rather than having one\nsentence be served consecutive to the other.[20]The accused’s daughter filed a letter with the\ncourt in support of her father.It expresses her love for him and it notes\nthat she has seen positive changes in her dad.Perhaps one of the most\nimportant things it expresses is that she supports him now and that she plans to\nbe a support to him when he is released. Mr. Taniskishayinew has a reason to\ncontinue on his current path of improvement. He has a daughter and a\ngranddaughter waiting for him. He has a reason to be on the outside —rather than on the inside where he\nhas spent so much of his adult life. Perhaps now this will help him to keep at\nbay the demons which have so often in the past led him to trouble.[21]Mr. Taniskishayinew prepared a\nstatement for the court which provides as follows:I am here today\nto apologise (sic) victim and throw myself on the mercy of the court. I admit\nwhat I’ve done was wrong and with out (sic) excuse. Im (sic)\ntruely (sic) sorry. I recognise (sic) my criminal record and feel there are\nmitagating (sic) factors as to why I am continuously in front of the court\ncharged with these serious offences. This current charge as well as my previous\nconvictions were perpetrated while under the influence of alcohol. Im (sic) not\nsuggesting to the court that alcohol is an excuse nor would I use it as one. I\nabuse alcohol as a coping mechanism to deal with a few issues. One being the\nsexuall (sic) abuse I suffered at the hands of those entrusted by the\nGovernments of Canada and this province to care for me when I was a child. As\nwell the deaths of my wife, my eldest daughter and the incarceration of my son\non a charge of manslaughter. On March 12, 2012 I attended mediation to discuss\nwhat happen (sic) to me at the hands of Ron Sawa while I was at Boys’ School. The culmination of these memories and having\nno one I felt I could trust, or turn to, too (sic) express these awful\nmemories. I turned to alcohol and drank to blackout. I realize now that this\nwas the wrong approach in dealing with my problem. I’ve been living with the shame of what happened to me in\nfoster care, residential school and finally boys school since age 5. I am now\n43 and looking at another period of incarceration because of the way I’ve chosen to deal with my past. Bringing to light my\npast experiences is a positive step forward for me and I plan on getting past\nthese issues by being more honest in programs offered in jail and after I get\nout. My time on remand has not been wasted. I’ve completed a stress management course. I’ve also retaken most of my GED Exams to improve my\nmarks. I have math to complete which I will do in the penitentiary. I am also\nactively doing bible study courses.In coming to\nterms with my past I’ve come come (sic) to realise (sic) that I’ve essentially become like my abusers. I take full\nresponsibility and feel true remorse. I can now identify with my victim and the\ntrama (sic) I’ve put her through. I took more than a bottle of\nalcohol from her I took her sense of safety and ultimetly (sic) her ability to\ntrust freely in others as well. My hope for her is she is able to move beyond\nthis and once again I am sorry to my victim, and to the court and my family for\nwhat I did.Thank you.DISCUSSION[22]Sentencing is a very difficult task for\ntrial judges. In sentencing the court must always consider the principles of\nsentencing set forth in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (“Criminal Code”). The provisions which I consider to\nbe particularly relevant are the following:718.The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to\ncontribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and\nthe maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions\nthat have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other\npersons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from\nsociety, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating\noffenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm\ndone to victims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of\nresponsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and\nto the community....718.1A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity\nof the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.718.2A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into\nconsideration the following principles:...(b)a sentence shall be similar to\nsentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in\nsimilar circumstances;(c)where consecutive sentences are\nimposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;(d)an offender should not be\ndeprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the\ncircumstances; and(e)all available sanctions other\nthan imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered\nfor all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal\noffenders.[23]The Court of Appeal in this province\nhas on numerous occasions made it very clear that offences of robbery involving\nweapons will be met with serious consequences.Clerks in convenience stores\nare particularly vulnerable as they are often young, often alone and they work\nlate into the evening. People who commit robberies on these vulnerable\nindividuals will be dealt with harshly by the court. The accused does not take\nissue with this principle and acknowledges that a penitentiary term is mandated\nand that three years would ordinarily be the bottom of the range for such an\noffence.Denunciation and deterrence are very important sentencing principles\nin this case.[24]There are aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances. The mitigating circumstances are the following: The accused\nwaived his preliminary hearing and entered a guilty plea thereby obviating the\nnecessity of the clerk in the store having to relive her experiences during two\ncourt proceedings; the accused presented a heart felt and thoughtful apology to\nthe victim and to the court; the accused has used his time productively while\nincarcerated. And although his voluntary consumption of alcohol is not a\nmitigating factor per se, I will take into account his extreme\nintoxication at the time of these events. There are also aggravating factors.\nThe accused has a lengthy and serious record including four previous offences\nfor robbery. The circumstances of the offence itself are aggravating as it was\nan offence of violence committed at a convenience store on a vulnerable victim.\nThe Crown notes that a man entered the store with his children during the\nrobbery. This is also an aggravating circumstance. The fact of the accused’s extreme intoxication is a serious\nconcern as he does not even remember the event. As stated by Justice Tallis in R.\nv. Cappo (J.D.), (1994), 190 Sask. R. 309, [1994] S.J. No. 263\n(QL),a decision of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, at para. 6 “... robbery involves inherent danger\nto human life because escalation of violence towards the victim can easily\nresult in death or serious bodily harm particularly where a weapon is involved.” One can only speculate on the\npotential for harm to the clerk or to the other customers, including the\nchildren, in circumstances where the accused here had a weapon, but was so\nintoxicated that he was essentially suffering a black out.[25]I have great sympathy for the personal\ncircumstances of the accused. His experiences in his birth family, in the\nfoster care system and in the residential school system have done nothing to\npromote a healthy life style. They have in contrast contributed to his need to\nself medicate with alcohol and drugs when experiencing times of trouble and\nstress. He candidly admits that two months is the longest he has abstained from\nalcohol except when in custody. The trouble is that not only does the accused\ndrink, but he commits offences when he drinks and some of those offences\ninvolve personal danger to others.[26]The accused has taken positive steps\nwhile in custody on this occasion. He has completed his GED. He has improved\nhis marks on other subjects. He has taken home study courses. Hopefully he will\nmake good use of the additional time he must spend in custody.[27]In recognition of his serious previous\nrecord and the circumstances of this offence involving yet another convenience\nstore robbery, I am satisfied that a sentence of 6 ½ years is appropriate in the\ncircumstances.ENHANCED\nCREDIT[28]The next question to be addressed is\nwhat credit should be afforded to the accused for the time he has spent in\ncustody awaiting his sentencing.[29]The potential credit to be applied\nfor the time in custody turns on the interpretation of s. 719\n(3) and s.\n719(3.1) of the Criminal\nCode. Section 6 of the Prisons and Reformatories Act, R.S.C.\n1985, c. P-20 also has\nsome relevance. The sections of the Criminal Code provide as follows:719.(3)In determining the sentence to be imposed on\na person convicted of an offence, a court may take into account any time spent\nin custody by the person as a result of the offence but the court shall limit\nany credit for that time to a maximum of one day for each day spent in custody.719.(3.1)Despite subsection (3), if the\ncircumstances justify it, the maximum is one and one-half days for each day\nspent in custody unless the reason for detaining the person in custody was\nstated in the record under subsection 515 (9.1) or the person was detained in custody\nunder subsection 524(4) or (8).[30]Pursuant to s.\n719(3.1), any opportunity for enhanced pre-sentence custody credit would be\nunavailable for those offenders whose circumstances are caught by s. 515(9.1)\nor 524(4) or 524(8). These would include any accused who a justice has ordered\ndetained pending his or her trial “primarily\nbecause of his previous conviction” (515(9.1)). And it would include any\naccused persons who were released on bail and then subsequently ordered to be\ndetained pending their trials as a result of a justice finding that they were\nalleged to have committed a fresh indictable offence or had contravened or were\nabout to contravene the terms of their original release orders. (ss. 524(4) and\n524(8)). It is clear thatss. 515(9.1) and 524(4) or 524(8) are not applicable\nto Mr. Taniskishayinew.Section 719\nwas part of Bill C-25, the Truth in Sentencing Act, S.C.\n2009, c. 29 (the “Act”) introduced by Parliament in March\nof 2009. The Act applies to persons charged with a criminal offence\nafter February 22, 2010, the day on which the Act came into force. The Act\nintroduced four substantive amendments to the Criminal Code, which are designed to limit the\namount of credit that may be assigned on sentencing to pre-trial and\npre-sentence custody and to increase the transparency of sentencing decisions.\n(See: para. 2, R. v. Summers, 2013 ONCA 147 (CanLII), 297 C.C.C. (3d) 166).[31]The interpretation of these sections\nhas been the subject of some conflicting decisions across the country. This conflict\nis described by Justice Cronk, J.A. in Summers at\nparas. 48 and 49:48In Carvery, [R. v. Carvery, 2012 NSCA 107 (CanLII), leave to\nappeal to the S.C.C. granted on April 11, 2013] at paras. 22-23, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal characterized the\nexisting jurisprudence regarding the meaning of s. 719(3.1) of the Code as falling into\n\"two general camps\": those cases holding that enhanced credit for\npre-sentence custody under s. 719(3.1) is available only where exceptional circumstances\nwarranting credit at a rate greater than 1:1 are demonstrated, and those cases\nholding that exceptional circumstances need not be shown to justify enhanced\ncredit under s.\n719(3.1).49This is\nan apt depiction of the divide in the reported trial level decisions across\nCanada regarding the interpretation of this provision. To this I would add that\nthe available appellate level decisions to date — Carvery and Stonefish —have endorsed\nthe interpretive result in the second line of cases: a showing of exceptional\ncircumstances is not required to ground enhanced credit under s. 719(3.1).[32]The issue simply put is whether s.\n719(3.1), properly interpreted, contemplates that only exceptional\ncircumstances can justify enhanced credit, and that a remand offender’s loss of remission and parole\neligibility during pre-sentence custody does not qualify as an exceptional\ncircumstance within the meaning of s. 719(3.1).[33]This\nwas the issue before the Ontario Court of Appeal in Summers, supra, described at paras. 1-3 inclusive:1For\ndecades, the courts have recognized that time spent by offenders in remand\ncustody before trial merits potential credit on sentencing due to the\nfrequently onerous conditions of remand detention, the lack of programming\navailable to offenders during such detention, and the unavailability of\nremission and parole eligibility for time spent on remand. As a result, for\nmany years, crediting on sentencing for pre-trial and pre-sentence custody, in the discretion of the sentencing judge, has been a\nmainstay of Canadian sentencing law.2In March 2009, Parliament introduced Bill C-25, the Truth\nin Sentencing Act, S.C. 2009, c. 29\n(the \"Act\"). The Act applies to persons charged with a criminal\noffence after February 22, 2010, the day on which the Act came into force.\n[footnote omitted] The Act introduced four substantive amendments to the Criminal\nCode, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (the \"Code), which are designed to limit\nthe amount of credit that may be assigned on sentencing to pre-trial and pre-sentence custody and to increase the transparency of\ncrediting decisions.3This\nCrown sentence appeal raises an important issue of statutory interpretation\nregarding two of the amendments introduced under the Act. The narrow question\nis whether a sentencing judge has discretion under s. 719(3.1) of the Code to\ncredit pre-trial\nor pre-sentence custody at a ratio greater than 1:1, up to a maximum of 1.5:1\n(\"enhanced credit\"), to account for an accused's loss of remission\nand parole eligibility while in remand custody.[34]Justice Cronk, with Pepall, J.A. and\nTulloch, J.A. concurring, came to the following conclusion at para. 8:8... the\nCode allows\na sentencing judge to credit pre-sentence custody at a ratio up to, but not\nexceeding, 1.5:1 for each day spent in pre-sentence\ncustody where, on consideration of all relevant circumstances, such credit is\nnecessary to achieve a fair and just sanction in accordance with the statutory\nscheme for sentencing and punishment set out in the Code. On a proper record,\nthe relevant circumstances that may justify this enhanced credit include\nineligibility for remission and parole while in remand custody. ...[35]Justice Cronk considered the overall\nlegislative purpose and scheme of the sections and came to this decision based\non a number of factors, some of which I will summarize. Section\n719(3.1) is silent as to the situations that will justify enhanced credit for\npre-sentence custody. The word “circumstances” is not qualified or modified in any\nway. Parliament did describe two circumstances which would dis-entitle an\noffender to enhanced credit. The loss of parole eligibility and remission were\nnot so described. There are other sections of the Criminal\nCode\nin which the phrase “circumstances” is\nqualified by the use of the phrase “compelling\ncircumstances”, “exceptional\ncircumstances”, or “exceptional\ncases”. A consideration of the legislative\nrecord at the time the amendments were being considered does not provide a\nconsistent interpretation in accord with the position taken by the Crown. The\nsections must be considered contextually in keeping with the overall statutory\nscheme for sentencing and punishment set out by the Criminal Code. “...The construction of ss. 719(3) and 719(3.1) ,\ntherefore, must be undertaken in the context of, and in a manner that is\nharmonious, coherent and consistent with, that overall statutory scheme.” (para. 95)[36]The British\nColumbia Court of Appeal came to the opposite conclusion in R. v. Bradbury\n2013 BCCA 280 (CanLII), 298 C.C.C. (3d) 31. In Bradbury, Justices Smith and\nNeilson, with Madam Justice Prowse in dissent concluded that :[48] .... the exception in ss. (3.1) does not require “exceptional”\ncircumstances and that circumstances that will justify enhanced credit must be\npersonal to the individual offender. In my opinion, however, circumstances that\nwould justify enhanced credit must have a qualitative characteristic; that is,\na characteristic that is individual to the offender but also distinct from\nthose characteristics that are universal to, or almost universally held, by\nother similarly situated offenders. Examples of commonly held circumstances\nmight include the lack of programs, the conditions of the remand institution,\nand the loss of remission or parole eligibility. Individual qualitative\ncircumstances might include the imposition of segregated or protective custody\nthrough no fault of the accused, the harsh effect of remand conditions because\nof a particular health issue by an accused, or a delay in the proceedings that\nis not attributable to the accused. Stated otherwise, circumstances to justify\nenhanced credit must be ones that are outside of the common experience of most\noffenders in remand custody.[37]I\nacknowledge that we will in the future have the benefit of the Supreme Court\ndecision in R. v. Carvery 2012 NSCA 107 (CanLII), 321 N.S.R. (2d) 321 to assist\ntrial judges on this difficult issue. I must however deal with Mr.\nTaniskishayinew now. There are no decisions to my knowledge on this issue by\nthe Saskatchewan Court of Appeal. Respectfully, I agree with the decisions\ntaken by the Ontario Court of Appeal, the Manitoba Court of Appeal and the Nova\nScotia Court of Appeal on this issue and conclude that s.719(3.1) does not\npreclude a sentencing court from considering the loss of remission and\neligibility for parole as a circumstance which may be taken into consideration\nby the court in determining what credit may be applied for pre-sentence custody\nto a maximum of 1.5:1.[38]I also\nnote the comments of Justice Cronk in Summers, supra at para. 117:117That said, nothing in these reasons should be understood as suggesting that\nenhanced credit will be available under s. 719(3.1) to every remand offender on\nthe basis of the absence of remission and parole eligibility. There must be\nsome basis in the evidence or the information before the sentencing judge to\nsupport the conclusion that this factor merits enhanced credit for a particular\noffender in a given case.[39]The Prisons\nand Reformatories Act sets out the legislative basis upon which remission\nis granted. The relevant provisions are the following:6.(1)Subject to subsection (7.2), every prisoner serving a sentence, other\nthan a sentence on conviction for criminal or civil contempt of court where the\nsentence includes a requirement that the prisoner return to that court, shall\nbe credited with 15 days of remission of the sentence in respect of each month\nand with a number of days calculated on a pro rata basis in respect of\neach incomplete month during which the prisoner has earned that remission by\nobeying prison rules and conditions governing temporary absence and by actively\nparticipating in programs, other than full parole, designed to promote\nprisoners' rehabilitation and reintegration as determined in accordance with\nany regulations made by the lieutenant governor of the province in which the\nprisoner is imprisoned.[40]The task before\nme now is to assess the information provided to determine whether Mr.\nTaniskishayinew is entitled to any enhanced credit. In R v. Joseph, 2012 BCCA 359 (CanLII), 326\nB.C.A.C. 312, the B.C. Court of Appeal considered the kind of evidence to be\nprovided by an accused person seeking enhanced credit. Justice Harris said the\nfollowing at para. 31:31The [Act] does not explicitly amend the traditional sentencing procedure. There\nis nothing in s. 719 that amends the procedure by implication. There is no\nreason in principle to depart from the general rules applicable to all\nsentencing hearings when a court is asked to decide whether the circumstances\njustify granting enhanced credit.[41]I have received\nsome information setting out the general conditions of Mr. Taniskishayinew’s\nincarceration in terms of the size of his cell, the fact that there was another\ninmate with him and that he was confined to his cell for the majority of each\nday.The Crown did not take issue with this information. The only evidence on\nthe issue of programming came through the accusedand it appears that there\nwas some programming available as Mr. Taniskishayinew took advantage of what\nwas there.[42]The accused\nhas been in custody for 19 months three weeks. The accused was in custody for\napproximately 10 months three weeks prior to entering his guilty plea. The\nexplanation provided for this time period is that issues of conflict needed to\nbe dealt with by his defence counsel. The accused has always been represented\nby Legal Aid. However at the time of the third court appearance in Provincial\nCourt, the record reflects an adjournment “to arrange for alternate counsel”. The same reason was provided at the time of the next\nadjournment. Thereafter in the appearances in Provincial court prior to Mr.\nTaniskishyainew waiving his preliminary hearing, the record reflects an agent\nappearing forMr. Taniskishayinew’s current counsel. Ms. Pappasfirst appeared personally for Mr.\nTaniskishayinew in the Court of Queen’s Bench at which time a date was fixed for his guilty plea to be\nentered. Sentencing was then adjourned for approximately another 8 months while\nthe parties awaited the release of an important decision of the Saskatchewan\nCourt of Appeal which would effectively determine whether or not the Crown\nwould be in a position to seek an assessment pursuant to which Mr.\nTaniskishayinew could be considered as a candidate for dangerous or long term\noffender status.[43]To be clear as\nI consider these time periods there is no suggestion nor do I find that the\nCrown was in any way responsible for any of this delay. Defence counsel asserts\nthat the accused was prepared to plead guilty immediately, but that for the\nreasons discussed, ie. sorting out issues involving the proper assignment of\nlegal representation within the Legal Aid system and some negotiations with the\nCrown prior to the entering of the plea - and waiting for the decision from the\nSaskatchewan Court of Appeal after the plea was entered were the causes of the\ndelay, and that none of that delay should be attributed to the accused\npersonally.[44]In the\ncircumstances I accept the submissions made by counsel for Mr.\nTaniskishayinew.He was not personally responsible for the significant delay\nin bringing this matter to a conclusion.I accept that he has been confined to\na 12' by 8' cell which he shares with another inmate for 19 to 23.5 hours per\nday. Based on the number of programs he has taken, many by correspondence or\nhome study, I am satisfied that had he been a serving prisoner he would have\nqualified for statutory remission as set out in s. 6 of the Prison and\nReformatories Act, quoted supra.[45]Accordingly I\nam prepared to attribute 1.5 days for each day in custody in accordance with\nthe request of the accused. That equates to approximately two years six\nmonths.[46]As I have\nalready indicated a sentence of 6.5 years is appropriate in the circumstances.\nAccordingly I sentence Mr. Taniskishayinew to an additional four years in\ncustody on each of these two charges to be served concurrently.ANCILLARY ORDERS[47]The following\norders are mandatory. I impose an order pursuant to s. 109 of the Criminal\nCode.In addition as this is a primary designated offence I make an order\nin form 5.04 pursuant to s. 487.051 authorizing the taking, from the accused,\nfor the purpose of forensic DNA analysis, of any number of samples of one or\nmore bodily substances that is reasonably required for that purpose by means of\nthe investigative procedures described in s. 487.06(1).J.E.

Thomson))JONATHAN TYLER EDWIN STREIB,))(Accused) Appellant.)Defence:)Daniel P. Ryall)))Judgment delivered:October 10, 2002.BEARD J.I.THE\nISSUE[1]This is an appeal from a sentence imposed on a summary conviction\noffence.The accused pled guilty to theft under $5,000.00 under s. 322(1)(a)\nand 334(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code and was sentenced by the\nProvincial Court judge to a suspended sentence and a period of probation on\ncertain conditions.The only aspect of the sentence that is being appealed is\nthe suspended sentence, with the accused taking the position that he should\nhave been given a conditional discharge on the same conditions.The issue is\nwhether the Provincial Court judge made an error in sentencing the accused such\nthat I should overturn the sentence and substitute another.[2]The accused filed an affidavit the day before the hearing of the\nappeal.By consent of both counsel, I have struck out paragraphs 8, 9 and 12\nof that affidavit and have not considered them in my decision.II.THE FACTS[3]The accused, Jonathan Tyler Edwin Streib (“Mr. Streib”), was\nemployed as a cashier at a gas station in Niverville, Manitoba.He pled guilty\nto a charge of theft under $5,000.00 regarding a series of thefts that he\ncommitted against his employer over the period from August 28, 2000 to October\n10, 2000.During that time, he stole an amount that he estimated was between\n$3,000.00 and $5,000.00.After the discovery of the thefts, an audit of the\nemployer’s records during the one year that the accused was employed at that\nbusiness showed an unexplained loss of approximately $7,000.00.Mr. Streib has\nrepaid that whole sum, notwithstanding that a portion of it occurred outside\nthe time frame covered by the information and, therefore, is not covered by\nthese proceedings.[4]In addition to making restitution to his employer, Mr. Streib has\ntaken several other steps to atone for his behaviour and otherwise mitigate the\nseriousness of his actions, including pleading guilty, providing a written\napology to his former employer, admitting that he had a gambling addiction and\ntaking treatment, stopping gambling and submitting two letters of reference of\nhis prior good character.It should be noted that he had no prior record and\nwas 18 years of age at the time of the offence.III.THE LAW[5]In recent years, the Supreme Court of Canada has re-emphasized\nthe degree of deference that is to be shown to a trial court when considering a\nsentence appeal.While there are numerous decisions that deal with this issue,\nI will quote only one, being the court’s comments in R. v. Proulx (2000),\n2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C.(3d) 449 at pp. 499-500:¶123In recent years, this Court has repeatedly stated that the\nsentence imposed by a trial court is entitled to considerable deference from\nappellate courts: see Shropshire, supra, at paras. 46-50; M.\n(C.A.), supra, at paras. 89-94; McDonnell, supra, at\nparas. 15-17 (majority); R. v. W. (G.), S.C.C., No. 26705, October 15,\n1999, at paras. 18-19 [reported 1999 CanLII 668 (SCC), 138 C.C.C.(3d) 23, 178 D.L.R.(4th)\n76].In M. (C.A.), at para. 90, I wrote:Put\nsimply, absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or\nan overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only\nintervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably\nunfit.Parliament explicitly vested sentencing judges with a discretion to\ndetermine the appropriate degree and kind of punishment under the Criminal\nCode.[Emphasis in original.]¶124Several provisions of Part\nXXIII confirm that Parliament intended to confer a wide discretion upon the\nsentencing judge.As a general rule, ss. 718.3(1) and 718.3(2) provide that\nthe degree and kind of punishment to be imposed is left to the discretion of\nthe sentencing judge.Moreover, the opening words of s. 718 specify that the\nsentencing judge must seek to achieve the fundamental purpose of sentencing “by\nimposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives”\n(emphasis added).In the context of the conditional sentence, s. 742.1\nprovides that the judge “may” impose a conditional sentence and enjoys a wide\ndiscretion in the drafting of the appropriate conditions, pursuant to s.\n742.3(2).¶125Although an appellate court\nmight entertain a different opinion as to what objectives should be pursued and\nthe best way to do so, that difference will generally not constitute an error\nof law justifying interference.Further, minor errors in the sequence of application\nof s. 742.1 may not warrant intervention by appellate courts.Again, I\nstress that appellate courts should not second-guess sentencing judges unless\nthe sentence is demonstrably unfit.¶126As explained in M. (C.A.),\nsupra, at para. 91:This\ndeferential standard of review has profound functional justification.As\nIacobucci J. explained in Shropshire, at para. 46, where the sentencing\njudge has had the benefit of presiding over the trial of the offence, he or she\nwill have had the comparative advantage of having seen and heard the witnesses\nto the crime.But in the absence of a full trial, where the offender has\npleaded guilty to an offence and the sentencing judge has only enjoyed the\nbenefit of oral and written sentencing submissions (as was the case in both Shropshire\nand this instance), the argument in favour of deference remains compelling.A\nsentencing judge still enjoys a position of advantage over an appellate judge\nin being able to directly assess the sentencing submissions of both the Crown\nand the offender.A sentencing judge also possesses the unique qualifications\nof experience and judgment from having served on the front lines of our\ncriminal justice system.Perhaps most importantly, the sentencing judge will\nnormally preside near or within the community which has suffered the\nconsequences of the offender’s crime.As such, the sentencing judge will have\na strong sense of the particular blend of sentencing goals that will be ‘just\nand appropriate’ for the protection of that community.The determination of a\njust and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which attempts to balance\ncarefully the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of\nthe offender and the circumstances of the offence, while at all times taking into\naccount the needs and current conditions of and in the community.The\ndiscretion of a sentencing judge should thus not be interfered with lightly.[Emphasis added.][6]As can be seen from this quote, an appellate court is to give\nconsiderable deference to the sentence imposed by a trial judge, whether\nimposed after a trial or a guilty plea, and to interfere only if there has\nbeen:-an error in principle;-a failure to consider a\nrelevant factor;-an overemphasis of the\nappropriate factors; or-a sentence that is\ndemonstrably unfit.IV.ANALYSIS[7]The defence set out the following three points and argued that,\nif I found in favour of Mr. Streib on any one, I should allow the appeal and\nsubstitute a conditional discharge for the suspended sentence that was imposed:(i)the\nsentence was harsh and excessive having regard to the circumstances of the\noffence and the background of the offender;(ii)the\nProvincial Court judge over-emphasized the principle of general deterrence and\nthereby proceeded on an error of principle; and(iii)the\nProvincial Court judge erred in law by determining that the principle of\ngeneral deterrence precluded the granting of a discharge.(i)was the sentence harsh and excessive?[8]I am not going to review the facts of the many cases that defence\ncounsel provided to me.While I have read those cases, each was decided on its\nfacts, and likewise this case must be decided on its facts.[9]There is a wide range of sentences appropriate for a charge of\ntheft under $5,000.00, from a period of incarceration in an institution, to a\nconditional sentence, to a fine, a suspended sentence or a conditional\ndischarge with or without probation and to an absolute discharge.In R.\nv. Baybars, [1989] M.J. No. 622 (Man. C.A.), Philp J.A. stated that a\nconditional discharge for a theft of a credit card and its use to withdraw\n$1,074.00 from an account was “at the low end of the scale”.It should be\nnoted that the justice in the minority in that case would have set aside the\nconditional discharge and ordered a fine, which is a more serious penalty than\na suspended sentence.The next step up on the scale from a conditional\ndischarge is a suspended sentence, which is the penalty that was imposed in\nthis case.Thus, the suspended sentence ordered in this matter is within the\nrange of sentence applicable to this type of offence and closer to the low end\nof that scale.[10]In addition to the appropriate range of sentence, the court must\nconsider the circumstances of the offence and the offender, along with the\nprinciples of sentencing in determining the appropriate sentence.In this\ncase, the Provincial Court judge gave careful consideration to these various\ncircumstances and the sentencing principles under the Criminal Code\nin arriving at her sentence.She was of the view that it would be appropriate,\nin the circumstances of this case, to give this accused a suspended sentence\nwith probation.This is a community-based sentence which permits the accused\nto make reparation to the victim of his crime and to the community and, to that\nend, is appropriate.It clearly meets the principle of sentencing which states\nthat all available reasonable sanctions other than imprisonment should be\nconsidered.[11]She concluded that there were two circumstances of this offence\nthat made a conditional discharge inappropriate, those being the breach of\ntrust and the ongoing nature of the thefts, which occurred over several weeks.The abuse of trust aspect is specifically mentioned in s. 718.2(a)(ii) of the Criminal\nCode as an aggravating circumstance.[12]The sentence imposed was clearly within the range of sentence\navailable to the Provincial Court judge and meets the sentencing principles set\nout in the Criminal Code.I do not find that her decision was\neither harsh or excessive.(ii)did the Provincial Court judge\nover-emphasize the principle of general deterrence and thereby proceed on an\nerror of principle?[13]General deterrence is clearly one of the principles of sentencing\nreferred to in s. 718 of the Criminal Code, and to omit a reference\nto it may well be an error.The relevant portions of that section are as\nfollows:718.PurposeThe fundamental purpose of\nsentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to\nrespect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by\nimposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to\ndenounce unlawful conduct;(b)to\ndeter the offender and other persons from committing offences;. . . . .[14]Defence counsel has noted several references to general\ndeterrence in the reasons of the Provincial Court judge and argued that she\nover-emphasized that principle in arriving at the appropriate sentence.I\ncannot accept that argument.The Provincial Court judge spent a great deal of\ntime discussing the principles of rehabilitation and reparation before\nconsidering deterrence.She reviewed the mitigating circumstances, which led\nher to the conclusion that a period of incarceration was not required\nnotwithstanding the aggravating circumstances of the offence.She again\ncarefully weighed all of those circumstances, both mitigating and aggravating,\nand concluded that a conditional discharge would also not be appropriate.This\ndecision was clearly one that was open to her, and I do not accept the argument\nthat, in arriving at that decision, she over-emphasized the principle of\ngeneral deterrence or proceeded on a wrong principle.(iii)did\nthe Provincial Court judge err in law by determining that the principle of\ngeneral deterrence precluded the granting of a discharge?[15]In her decision, the Provincial Court judge made the following\ntwo comments:The issue really comes down to whether the principle of general\ndeterrence is such that it requires that a conviction be registered.\n(transcript of proceedings at p. 25-25)What the Court has to determine is\nwhether it would be contrary to the public interest to give someone the\nopportunity of remaining free of the stigma, if you will, of having a\nconviction for an offence.In deciding that issue I have to look at the\naggravating and mitigating circumstances of your case.(transcript of\nproceedings, p. 23-24)[16]Defence counsel concluded his written argument as follows:The Provincial Court was in error when it stated that “the\nprinciple of general deterrence is such that it requires that a conviction be\nregistered.”It is submitted with respect that the Court erred in failing to\nconsider Streib’s case upon its own circumstances, rather than the type of\noffence.A conviction is not required to meet the needs of general deterrence.[17]I disagree with the suggestion that the Provincial Court judge\ndetermined that the principle of general deterrence precluded the granting of a\ndischarge or that she failed to consider this case upon its own circumstance,\nrather than the type of offence.[18]While the first quote referred to above from the judge’s\ndecision, when read alone, could be given the interpretation suggested by\ncounsel, this is not a valid interpretation when read in the context of her\nwhole decision.That decision covered 13 pages and discussed the many factors\nthat go into determining whether there should be a conditional discharge or\nsome other sentence.While she considered the issue of general deterrence, she\nconsidered it as only one factor among several, and she clearly did not take\nthe view that general deterrence precluded her from granting a discharge.[19]Counsel’s argument that the court erred by failing to consider\nStreib’s case upon its circumstances rather than the type of offence is also\nnot a valid argument.The type of offence, being a theft under $5,000.00, is\nclearly one relevant factor in determining the appropriate sentence.The\nProvincial Court judge did not, however, consider only the type of offence.She also considered the circumstances of the offence and the aggravating and\nmitigating factors.Those circumstances that she found aggravating and leading\nto a suspended sentence instead of a conditional discharge were the breach of\ntrust and the repeated thefts over a period of several weeks.Those factors\nare a part of the circumstances of this case, in addition to the mitigating\ncircumstances, which must be included in any weighing of the facts to arrive at\nan appropriate sentence.[20]When I consider these comments together with her overall decision,\nI do not think it is correct to state either that she determined that the\nprinciple of general deterrence precluded the granting of a discharge or that\nshe failed to consider this case upon its own circumstances.V.DECISION[21]I have concluded that the Provincial Court judge did not commit\nan error in principle, fail to consider a relevant factor, over-emphasize any\nfactors or impose a sentence that is demonstrably unfit.If I were to grant\nthe appeal, I would be substituting my decision for that of the Provincial\nCourt judge, which I must not do.I am, therefore, dismissing this appeal.J."}

Charles, 2011 ONCJ 3ONTARIOCOURTOFJUSTICEBETWEEN:HERMAJESTYTHEQUEEN—AND—TERON CHARLESBefore Justice H. BorensteinSentencing\nSubmissions heard on January 6, 2011Reasons for\nSentence released on January 6, 2011Mr. T. Pittman........................................................................................................for\nthe CrownMs. U. Kancharla.........................................................................for\nthe accused Teron CharlesBORENSTEIN J.:[1]This is the sentencing of Teron Charles who\nwas found guilty after trial of sexual assault. The related count of sexual\ninterference was conditionally stayed pursuant to R. v. Kienapple. Mr.\nCharles was 26 years old at the time of the offence. He had a sexual\nrelationship with a 14 year old. The 14 year old girl initiated the sexual\nrelationship. Consent is not a defence in the circumstances. My reasons for\njudgment were released on November 19, 2010 and I will not repeat the facts\nhere.[2]No victim impact statement was presented to\nthe Court. A pre-sentence report was prepared.[3]Mr. Charles is now 28 years old. He is a\nfirst offender. He was born in Grenada. His mother raised him as a single\nmother. He has no relationship with his father. His mother moved to Canada when\nhe was very young and Mr. Charles was then cared for by his grandmother’s\nsister. Mr. Charles was in a very serious car accident in Grenada where he lost\nhis hearing in his right ear and has only partial hearing in his left ear. Mr.\nCharles then came to Canada at the age of 12 to join his mother. They lived\ntogether in Scarborough.[4]Mr. Charles believes his father had a son\nfrom another relationship. That would be his step brother. Mr. Charles believes\nthat person lives in Toronto but they have no contact.[5]Mr. Charles went to a high school for the\ndeaf and hearing impaired and graduated. He took a few courses at a community\ncollege thereafter. As I indicated in the trial, Mr. Charles has learned to\nadapt very well. Most people do not realize he has a hearing impairment. He can\nhear somewhat and he lip reads.[6]He has worked at various jobs. He worked at Burger\nKing for four years as well as in a factory. He would like to apprentice as a\nplumber and then enrol in a plumber’s course at a community college. That is\nhis plan. He also receives financial assistance from the Ontario government.[7]Mr. Charles’ relationship’ with women have\nbeen discussed in the pre-sentence report and are relevant given that he chose\nto have a relationship with a girl he suspected was a minor and continued\nnonetheless.[8]Mr. Charles clearly wants to be involved in\na stable, steady relationship with a partner. He lived with his mother until he\nwas 19 but then moved out to move in with a woman. That lasted three years.\nWhen that relationship ended, he moved back in with his mother.[9]He then had the relationship with the 14\nyear old complainant in this matter. Once he was charged with this offence, he\nmoved to Brantford in October 2009 when he met a woman in Brantford. That\nrelationship lasted two months[10]In December 2010, Mr. Charles told the\nauthor of the pre-sentence report that he met another woman in Brantford about\na year earlier, that would be approximately December 2009 – or just a month of\nso after his last relationship ended. He told the author that he married this\nwoman in June 2010. She had five children of her own although two were\napprehended by CAS. He told the author that was like a father to her children. At\nthe second meeting with the author of the pre-sentence report one week later, Mr.\nCharles indicated that his new relationship ended and his wife and children had\nmoved out and he did not know her whereabouts. At today’s hearing, I have been\ntold that that relationship has resumed.[11]The Crown seeks a conditional sentence and\nprobation as well as a DNA order. The Crown is not seeking an Order that Mr.\nCharles be registered on the Sex Offender Registry.The defence seeks a suspended\nsentence.[12]It is clear to me that Mr. Charles very much\nwants to be in a stable relationship. There is nothing unusual about that and\nperhaps even more so for Mr. Charles given his early life experience in\nGrenada. No doubt that desire led him to ignore the fact that the complaint was\nobviously very young, 14 in fact, and he continued nonetheless without learning\nher age.[13]His IQ has been mentioned throughout the\ntrial. He has a low IQ although that is not particularly apparent to those who\ndeal with him,. I certainly did not notice him having any difficulty\nunderstanding the proceedings or communicating.[14]The aggravating features in this case are\nthe fact that a 26 year old chose to engage in a sexual relationship with a 14\nyear old. He knew she was young. He did not know for certain how young she was but\nhe proceeded nonetheless. Given the vulnerabilities of young people, even those\nwho initiate sexual relationships with older men, Parliament has imposed a\nrequirement that the adult take responsibility to ensure their sexual partners\nare 16 years old or older. Mr. Charles chose not to do that and to proceed\nnonetheless. That conduct needs to be denounced and deterred.[15]On the other hand, Mr. Charles is himself\nsomeone who has some vulnerabilities. He has not had any of the advantages of a\nstable upbringing. His mother left him when he was very young. He does not know\nhis father. He lost his hearing. He then came to Canada at 12 and persevered\ndespite his hearing impairment to graduate high school and he continually tries\nto remain working.[16]This is indeed a sad case for all involved.[17]Mr. Charles has been found guilty of a crime\nthat contains a considerable level of stigmatization. I do not see the need nor\nthe benefit to the community of incarcerating Mr. Charles, a first offender.\nIncarceration would send a message to others who would engage in similar\nbehaviour and that is a factor to consider. However, given the fact that he has\nnever before offended, given his vulnerabilities both in terms of IQ and\nhearing impairment, in my view incarceration would be harsh. A criminal record\nand probationary terms would be a sufficient sentence to address the principles\nof sentencing.[18]Given the unique circumstances in which this\ncase occurred, the Crown, very fairly as it has been throughout, is not seeking\nto have Mr. Charles registered on the Sex Offender Registry.Even without\nregistration on the Sex Offender Registry, this offence carries a considerable\namount of stigmatization. That, together with the 14 days of pre-trial custody,\nprovide enough deterrence and denunciation to satisfy those principles of\nsentencing.[19]Accordingly, I will suspend the passing of\nsentence and place Mr. Charles on probation for two years on the following\nterms: He is subject to the mandatory terms of probation. In addition to the\nmandatory terms of probation, he will take and actively participate in any\nassessment and counselling that his probation officer recommends and will sign\nall releases to enable his probation officer to monitor his compliance. He will\nhave no contact or communication, directly or indirectly with the victim in\nthis matter. He will not be in the company of anyone under the age of 15 unless\nthey are members of his own family or if he is in the presence of another adult\naged 18 or more. Finally, he will provide a sample of his DNA to the\nauthorities. Given the finding of guilt, his privacy rights are outweighed by\nthe benefits to society of having his DNA .Released:January 6, 2011Signed: “Justice H.\nBorenstein”"}

Hislengthy criminal record included four prior convictions for drinking anddriving offences between 1986 and 1991. The Crown served a notice ofintent to seek a greater penalty based on the four prior drinking anddriving convictions and tendered the accused's criminal record at theoutset of the sentencing proceedings. When questioned by the trialjudge, the Crown conceded that pursuant to a Crown policy, a prosecutoris directed to prove prior convictions that occurred within five yearsof the offence for which the accused is being sentenced, absentexceptional circumstances, but has a discretion as to whether or not toseek an increased penalty where the prior convictions occurred beyondthe five- year time period. The Crown stated that the decision to provethe notice of intent in this case was based on the number of priorconvictions. The trial judge found that, in exercising its discretion toprove the notice, the prosecutor was not engaged in a coreprosecutorial function, that the prosecutor's decision could be reviewedon a reasonableness standard and that the Crown had not offered anyreasonable basis for its decision to ignore the 17-year gap in theaccused's drinking and driving record. The trial judge found that thefiling of the notice violated the accused's rights under s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.He set aside the filing of the notice and sentenced the accused withoutregard to the mandatory minimum penalties set out in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. The summary conviction appeal court judge affirmed that decision. The Crown appealed. [page424]Held, the appeal should be allowed.As a prosecutor's decision to prove the notice of intent has a direct impact on the liberty interest of an accused under s. 7 of the Charter,the prosecutor must exercise his or her discretion in a way that isconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice. The Crown'sdecision to prove the notice of intent is not an exercise of a coreelement of prosecutorial discretion, so a trial judge's review of theprosecutor's discretion is not limited to allegations of an abuse ofprocess. A trial judge can review the prosecutor's exercise ofdiscretion to determine whether it offended a principle of fundamentaljustice and violated the s. 7 rights of the accused but cannot review for reasonableness. The decision will violate an accused's s. 7rights if it undermines the integrity of the administration of justice,operates in a manner that renders the sentencing proceedingsfundamentally unfair, is arbitrary or results in a limit on theaccused's liberty that is grossly disproportionate to the state interestin proving the notice. In this case, the Crown's decision to prove thenotice did not violate the accused's rights under s. 7 of the Charter. The accused was subject to the mandatory minimum penalties set out in the Criminal Code.APPEAL from the order of Kiteley J., [2011] O.J. No. 2411, 2011 ONSC 1145 (CanLII), 273 C.C.C.

It has further declared thatthose penalties shall include minimum jail terms for second andsubsequent convictions. The mandatory minimum penalties forsecond and subsequent offences apply only if, prior to plea,the prosecutor has notified the accused of the intention toseek a greater penalty, and at the time of sentencing, theprosecutor proves the prior notice and, unless admitted, provesthe prior conviction or convictions. In these reasons, I willrefer to the notice of intention to seek a greater penaltysimply as \"the notice\".[2] A prosecutor is under no obligation to prove the noticeat the sentencing hearing. Even if the accused has been givennotice, the Crown may decide not to prove the notice in whichcase the mandatory minimum sentences for second or subsequentoffences do not apply: see R. v. Demchuk (2003), 2003 CanLII 15723 (ON CA), 68 O.R. (3d)17, [2003] O.J. No. 4215 (C.A.), at para. 1.[3] This appeal raises the question of whether a trial judgecan review the reasonableness of a prosecutor's decision toprove that notice was given to an accused. In this case, thetrial judge held that he could review that decision on areasonableness standard and further held that the Crown hadacted unreasonably in seeking to prove that the notice had beengiven to the respondent. The trial judge set aside the noticeand sentenced the accused, taking into account his fullcriminal record (including the four prior drinking and drivingoffences), but without regard to the minimum penalties imposedby Parliament for second and subsequent drinking and drivingrelated offences. The trial judge imposed an effective jailterm of 50 days, 40 days less than the mandatory minimum.[4] The Crown appealed. The summary conviction appeal courtagreed with the trial judge, holding that the prosecutor'sdecision to prove the notice could be reviewed on areasonableness standard and that the Crown had actedunreasonably in seeking to prove the notice in the respondent'scase.[5] The Crown comes to this court pursuant to s. 839 of theCriminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. The parties agreed thatthis is an appropriate case in which to grant leave to appeal.I proceed directly to the merits.[6] I would allow the appeal. A prosecutor's decision toprove the notice has a direct impact on the liberty interest ofan accused under s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights andFreedoms. The prosecutor must exercise his or her discretion ina [page427] way that is consistent with the principles offundamental justice. A trial judge can review the prosecutor'sexercise of discretion to determine whether it offends aprinciple of fundamental justice and violated the s. 7 rightsof the accused.[7] However, review for compliance with s. 7 of the Charterdoes not involve an assessment of the reasonableness of theprosecutor's decision. The prosecutor's decision to prove thenotice will run contrary to the principles of fundamentaljustice and, therefore, violate an accused's s. 7 rights if it-- undermines the integrity of the administration of justice;-- operates in a manner that renders the sentencing proceedingsfundamentally unfair;-- is arbitrary; or-- results in a limit on the accused's liberty that is grosslydisproportionate to the state interest in proving the notice.[8] There is no suggestion in this case that the Crown'sdecision to prove the notice was taken in bad faith orundermined the integrity of the administration of justice inany other way. Nor was the sentencing proceeding renderedfundamentally unfair because the prosecutor chose to serve thenotice, thereby rendering the respondent, a repeat drinking anddriving offender, liable for the minimum penalty expresslyprovided by Parliament for repeat drinking and drivingoffenders. I see no basis upon which the exercise of theprosecutor's discretion could be described as arbitrary in therelevant sense. Finally, the concession that the minimumpenalties do not infringe s. 12 of the Charter dooms any s. 7claim based on gross disproportionality.[9] I would hold that the prosecutor's decision to prove thenotice as against the respondent did not infringe his rightsunder s. 7 of the Charter. The mandatory minimum penalties wereapplicable to the respondent.IIThe Trial[10] A concerned citizen saw the respondent, who appeareddrunk, sitting in his parked car with a bottle of vodka on theseat. The citizen called 911. The respondent drove away but wasstopped shortly afterwards by the police. The police made abreath demand. While the police were waiting for the testingdevice, the respondent became belligerent and emphatically[page428] indicated that he would not provide a breathsample. He was charged with refusing to provide a breath samplecontrary to s. 254(5) of the Criminal Code. The Crown electedto proceed summarily. After a trial, the trial judge convictedthe respondent.[11] At the outset of the sentencing proceedings, the Crowntendered the respondent's lengthy criminal record. That recordincluded convictions for four prior drinking and drivingoffences:-- a conviction for \"over .08\" entered on December 11, 1986 forwhich the respondent received a 14-day jail term;-- an impaired driving conviction entered on January 21, 1987for which the respondent received a 14-day jail term;-- an impaired driving conviction entered on September 19, 1991for which the respondent received a 57-day jail term;-- an impaired driving conviction entered on September 24, 1991for which the respondent received a 90-day jail term.[12] In his submission on sentence, Crown counsel said:[A]s you'll see there are four impaired. I'll candidly admitthat they are from a long time ago. They are from the late80s and early 90s. That said, the Crown has filed or served anotice of intention to seek higher penalty, and in theCrown's view it should be treated as a third conviction thatcarries a minimum 90-day sentence.[13] The trial judge inquired as to the whether the Crownusually introduced the notice if the prior convictions hadoccurred more than ten years before the conviction for whichthe accused was being sentenced. The Crown acknowledged thatthere was a Crown policy that gave prosecutors a discretion toprove the notice. Counsel indicated:The policy is a contextual one. That is the case if there wasone impaired conviction in 1988 and then here we are 20 yearslater, but when there are four previous convictions, theCrown finds itself in a different position. Clearly there areconcerns here, Mr. Gill has been convicted four times ofimpaired driving. Here we are on another conviction, on arefusal of the same genre. The Crown finds itself in adifferent position. It's a discretionary policy on when toserve and when not to serve those intentions to seek higherpenalties, in this case we have. And the reason being, simplyit's just the number -- the sheer number -- four convictionsin four years is a lot. And we find that there are,accordingly, some very serious concerns about the public'ssafety in light of a new conviction on an impaired relatedcharge.(Emphasis added)[14] The Crown policy is found in a document described asPractice Memorandum [2008] No. 4, \"Impaired Driving and[page429] Road Safety Offences\". The memorandum addresses avariety of matters that may arise in the course of theprosecution of drinking and driving offences, including theCrown's discretion in relation to the proof of prior drinkingand driving convictions.[15] Under the policy described in the memorandum, theprosecutor is directed to prove prior convictions that occurredwithin five years of the offence for which the accused is beingsentenced \"absent exceptional circumstances\". Where the priorconvictions occurred beyond the five-year time period,prosecutors are directed to \"consider seeking an increasedpenalty\". In exercising that discretion, prosecutors aredirected to \"be mindful of the aggravating factors\", some ofwhich are listed earlier in the memorandum, and to considermitigating factors such as \"any substantial period during whichthe offender was free of criminal involvement, the age andhealth of the accused, and any undue hardship or suffering thatmay result from a jail sentence\".[16] Under the policy described in the memorandum, there is apresumption in favour of proving prior convictions thatoccurred within five years of the offence for which an accusedis being sentenced. There is no presumption one way or theother if the conviction occurred beyond that five-year period.In that circumstance, the prosecutor is directed to considerthe various aggravating and mitigating factors beforedetermining whether to prove the prior convictions and seek theminimum penalties.[17] Neither the service of the notice nor the four priorconvictions for drinking and driving offences were disputed bythe respondent. The Crown sought a four-month sentenceacknowledging that the respondent should be given 50 dayscredit for his 25 days of pre-trial custody: see R. v. Wust,[2000] 1 S.C.R. 455, [2000] S.C.J. No. 19, 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII), atpara. 45.[18] Counsel for the respondent initially appeared to acceptthat the minimum 90-day jail sentence was required in light ofthe respondent's prior convictions. She submitted that the 90days should be reduced by 50 days to take into account therespondent's 25 days in pre-trial custody. She also suggestedthat the minimum could be reduced by some further unspecifiedamount to reflect the very restrictive bail terms endured bythe respondent. Counsel asked for an adjournment so that shecould prepare more helpful submissions in support of herposition. The trial judge adjourned the sentencing.[19] Counsel subsequently brought an application before thesentencing judge alleging that the Crown's exercise of itsdiscretion in favour of proving the notice violated therespondent's rights under ss. 7 and 12 of the Charter. Thetrial judge [page430] dismissed the claim alleging a breach ofs. 12. That claim was not pursued in the summary convictionappeal court and is not advanced in this court.[20] The trial judge did find a breach of s. 7. In hisreasons, he first considered the nature of the exercise of theCrown's discretion to prove the notice. He determined, atparas. 32-39 [2008 ONCJ 502 (CanLII), [2008] O.J. No. 4104 (C.J.)], that in exercisingits discretion, the Crown was not engaged in a coreprosecutorial function to be afforded \"great deference\" by thecourt. The trial judge viewed the Crown's decision to prove thenotice as a tactical decision made in the conduct of theproceedings.[21] The trial judge next identified the operative principleof fundamental justice, stating, at para. 43:It is the role of Parliament to set the range of allowablesentences for particular offences. It is the role of thesentencing judge to hear submissions and determine a fitsentence. It is a principle of fundamental justice thatParliament or a [j]udge decide what a fit sentence will be,not the prosecutor. It is a principle of fundamental justicethat Parliament is supreme and the judiciary is independentboth of which co-exist but both of which are significantlyundermined where the prosecutor in a particular case isempowered to make a decision which has the effect ofsuspending the operation of the laws of Parliament and alsoundermines judicial independence by filing notice. To be ableto do so without stating any reason for so doing and which isnot subject to review except in the most egregiouscircumstances would be contrary to the principles offundamental justice.(Emphasis added)[22] The trial judge then turned to the appropriate standardof review, stating, at paras. 50-51:What is potentially objectionable about the sentencingscheme is that the decision to file the notice, especiallywhere there is a long gap in the record, can be made withoutthe prosecutor stating any reason for his or her decisionthat can be reviewed by the [c]ourt on a limited basis. Ifthe [c]ourt can, in appropriate cases, require the Crown tostate reasons for its decision which could then be assessed,then any objectionable aspect of such a scheme would beeliminated. In order to address these potential shortcomings,the review would be to determine whether the Crown actedreasonably and took into account only appropriateconsiderations in making its decision. If not, the decisionto file the notice would be set aside.Most discretionary powers and decisions are reviewed on abasis of reasonableness. Courts are well equipped to assesswhether the decision maker turned its mind to appropriateconsiderations and whether the decision was unreasonable.(Emphasis in original)[23] Having decided that the prosecutor's decision could bereviewed on a reasonableness standard, the trial judge turnedto the reasonableness of the decision to serve the notice inthis case. After referring to Crown counsel's explanation thatthe [page431] decision to prove the notice was based on therespondent's four prior related offences, all of which hadresulted in incarceration, the trial judge concluded, at para.63:The factors noted by the Crown are certainly not irrelevantfactors but they do not assist in the determination ofwhether the Crown's decision to file the notice wasreasonable in view of the gap. I note that the factorsspecifically enumerated in the Crown Policy Manual suggest tome that the notice ought not to have been filed. My reviewdoes not go that far. In my view, Crown counsel has simplynot offered any reasonable basis for its decision to ignorethe 17-year gap and to file the notice.(Emphasis added)[24] The trial judge proceeded to set aside the filing of thenotice, presumably under s. 24(1) of the Charter, and tosentence the respondent without regard to the mandatory minimumpenalties set out in the Criminal Code.IIIThe Reasons of the Summary Conviction Appeal Court[25] The summary conviction appeal court judge summarizedmany of the pertinent authorities and essentially agreed withthe analysis of the trial judge. In doing so, she described theeffect of the Crown's decision to prove the notice, at para. 45in her reasons [2011 ONSC 1145 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 2411 (S.C.J.)], in these terms:The [t]rial [j]udge is required to exercise his or herdiscretion to impose a sentence taking into account the broadsentencing principles articulated in ss. 718, 718.1, 718.2and 718.3 bearing in mind the unique circumstances of theoffence and the offender. Allowing the Crown to exerciseunreviewable discretion to file a [n]otice is causing a\"clash of discretions\". By reducing the sentencing optionsnormally available to the sentencing judge, the Crown iseffectively using its discretion to limit the trial judge'sdiscretion in sentencing an offender pursuant to fundamentalprinciples and pursuant to s. 718.3 of the Code.(Emphasis added)IVThe Relevant Statutory Provisions[26] Section 255(1) of the Criminal Code as it applied at therespondent's trial read:255(1) Every one who commits an offence under section 253or 254 is guilty of an indictable offence or an offencepunishable on summary conviction and is liable, (a) whether the offence is prosecuted by indictment orpunishable on summary conviction, to the followingminimum punishment, namely, [page432] (i) for a first offence, to a fine of not less thansix hundred dollars, (ii) for a second offence, to imprisonment for notless than fourteen days, and (iii) for each subsequent offence, to imprisonmentfor not less than ninety days; (b) where the offence is prosecuted by indictment, toimprisonment for a term not exceeding five years;and (c) where the offence is punishable on summaryconviction, to imprisonment for a term notexceeding six months. [See Note 1 below]Section 253 creates the offence of impaired driving. Section254 creates the offences of \"blowing over .08\" and refusing toprovide a breath sample. The three offences are treated as oneand the same for the purposes of s. 255. I will refer to theoffences collectively as drinking and driving offences.[27] Under s. 255, any prior drinking and driving offence isa prior offence for the purpose of determining the applicableminimum penalty regardless of when that offence occurred. Thereis no qualification, such as that found in s. 84(5), thatlimits the prior offences to those that occurred within tenyears of the offence for which the individual is beingsentenced.[28] The objective of s. 255 is crystal clear. Persons whoare convicted of second or subsequent drinking and driving mustgo to jail for at least the minimum terms set out in thesection. That intention reflects Parliament's recognition ofthe very serious societal harms associated with drinking anddriving offences and the need to deter and denounce therepetition of that behaviour by the imposition of mandatorycustodial sanctions.[29] Section 727(1) reads:727(1) Subject to subsection (3) and (4) [neither of whichare relevant here], where an offender is convicted of anoffence for which a greater punishment may be imposed byreason of previous convictions, no greater punishment shallbe imposed on the offender by reason thereof unless theprosecutor satisfies the court that the offender, beforemaking a plea, was notified that a greater punishment wouldbe sought by reason thereof. [page433][30] Section 727(2) requires that the court satisfy itselfthat the offender has been notified and if the offender doesnot admit the prior conviction, allow the Crown to leadevidence to prove the prior conviction.[31] Section 727(1) does not apply only to drinking anddriving related prosecutions. It applies whenever the Crown isseeking greater punishment, be it incarceration or some otherform of punishment, by virtue of a prior conviction: see R. v.Tabor, [2004] B.C.J. No. 766, 2004 BCCA 191 (CanLII), 184 C.C.C. (3d)262. I agree with the trial judge that this section is intendedto benefit the accused by ensuring that the accused has noticeof the nature of his or her jeopardy before entering a plea:see R. v. Taylor, [1963] B.C.J. No. 97, [1964] 1 C.C.C. 207(C.A.), at pp. 208-209 C.C.C.; R. v. Zaccaria, [2005] A.J.No. 318, 2005 ABCA 130 (CanLII), 195 C.C.C. (3d) 198, at para. 12, leaveto appeal to S.C.C. refused [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 272.[32] As observed in R. v. Kumar, 1993 CanLII 1445 (BC CA), [1993] B.C.J. No. 2266, 85C.C.C. (3d) 417 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused[1994] S.C.C.A. No. 47, 88 C.C.C. (3d) vi, per Taylor J.A.(for the majority), at p. 425 C.C.C., per Lambert J.A. (indissent), at p. 454 C.C.C., the language of s. 727 is somewhatawkward when applied to situations in which the previousconvictions increase the minimum penalty rather than themaximum penalty. However, given the purpose underlying s. 727,it has been uniformly held to be applicable to situations inwhich the previous convictions trigger an increase in theminimum penalty. Neither the Crown nor the respondent asks thiscourt to take a different view of the provision's applicationto increased minimums.[33] Proof of the notice occurs in the sentencing process andis governed by the evidentiary rules referable to thesentencing process: e.g., Criminal Code, ss. 723, 724. Theprosecutor, where notice is challenged, must prove beyond areasonable doubt that notice complying with s. 727 was given tothe accused prior to plea: see R. v. Cordero, [2003] O.J. No.6246 (S.C.J.). Similarly, if the prior convictions arechallenged, the prosecutor must prove those prior convictionsbeyond a reasonable doubt: Criminal Code, s. 724(3)(e).[34] Section 727 places the responsibility for proving theproper notification on the Crown. It does not, however, imposea legal duty on the Crown to prove prior notification in everycase where notification is given. It is implicit in s. 727(1),and indeed in the adversarial process itself, that theprosecution has a discretion and may elect to not prove thenotice. [page434]VLegal Analysis (i) The issue raised[35] This appeal involves a relatively narrow constitutionalissue. The respondent does not argue that the minimum jailterms for second and subsequent drinking and driving offencesare unconstitutional. Nor does the respondent suggest that ascheme that imposes enhanced minimum penalties for second andsubsequent convictions only where the Crown has provided propernotice and proved the prior convictions is inherentlyunconstitutional. The respondent challenges specific stateaction -- the prosecutor's exercise of his discretion to provethe notice in this case -- not any legislative provision. Heseeks a remedy under s. 24(1) of the Charter, not a declarationof invalidity under s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982: see R.v. Ferguson, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96, [2008] S.C.J. No. 6, 2008 SCC6 (CanLII), at paras. 58-66.[36] I would be surprised had the respondent attacked theconstitutionality of the legislative scheme based on thediscretion afforded to the Crown by the scheme. Increasedpenalties, including minimum penalties for second andsubsequent offences, are entirely consistent with sentencingprinciples set out in the Criminal Code. If Parliament choosesto impose a greater penalty, including a minimum penalty forsecond or subsequent offences, I cannot envision how, under theadversarial process within which the criminal justice systemoperates, the decision to prove the prior offence could be leftin the hands of anyone other than the prosecutor. Presumably,Parliament could require that all prior convictions be provedin every case, although I doubt that anyone would welcome thatkind of legislation. Absent a parliamentary command, there mustbe a discretion, and if there is a discretion, who else otherthan the prosecutor can be charged with the responsibility ofexercising that discretion?[37] There is nothing unique about the discretion given tothe prosecutor where Parliament chooses to impose minimumpenalties for second and subsequent offences. Prosecutorialdiscretion is an essential feature of the criminal justicesystem: R. v. Beare, 1988 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, [1987] S.C.J. No. 92,at p. 410 S.C.R. Parliament has chosen to impose greaterpenalties where a variety of aggravating factors exist. If anaggravating factor is not an essential element of the offence,it will inevitably fall to the Crown to decide whether it willchoose to lead evidence to prove [page435] the aggravatingfactor and trigger the sentencing consequences prescribed byParliament. [See Note 2 below][38] The parties also agree that the state action in issuehere -- the exercise of the discretion to prove the notice-- is subject to Charter review. When the prosecutor decides toprove service of the notice, the accused's liberty interest isadversely affected by the minimum jail term requirement. Itfollows that the prosecutor's decision to prove the notice mustcomply with s. 7 of the Charter: see Canada (Attorney General)v. PHS Community Services Society, [2011] 3 S.C.R. 134, [2011]S.C.J. No. 44, 2011 SCC 44 (CanLII), at para. 117; see, also, MarcRosenberg, \"The Attorney General and the Administration ofJustice\" (2009), 34 Queen's L.J. 813. The narrow, butimportant, dispute on this appeal focuses on the scope of thereview contemplated under s. 7 of the Charter. (ii) The discretion of the sentencing judge[39] The trial judge and the summary conviction appeal courtjudge accepted that the exercise of the prosecutor's discretionto prove the notice interfered with the trial judge's exerciseof his or her discretion on sentence and potentially preventedthe trial judge from imposing a fit sentence. Thisprosecutorial interference with the trial judge's sentencingdiscretion was seen as contrary to the principles offundamental justice unless that prosecutorial power was checkedby appropriate judicial review.[40] The analysis of the trial judge and the summaryconviction appeal court judge reflect the reasons of themajority and dissent in Kumar. With respect, this analysismisunderstands the relationship between statutorily imposedminimum penalties and a trial judge's exercise of his or hersentencing discretion.[41] In imposing sentence, a trial judge must have regard tothe objectives and principles of sentencing described in PartXXIII of the Criminal Code. Except in rare situations (e.g.,first degree murder), the trial judge has a variety ofsentencing options and must ultimately settle on the one thathe or she regards as best reflecting the proper blending of theapplicable principles.[42] The sentencing judge's discretion is not, however,unfettered. One significant limitation is addressed in s.718.3: [page436](1) Where an enactment prescribes different degrees or kindsof punishment in respect of an offence, the punishment to beimposed is, subject to the limitations prescribed in theenactment, in the discretion of the court that convicts aperson who commits the offence.(2) Where an enactment prescribes a punishment in respect ofan offence, the punishment to be imposed is, subject to thelimitations prescribed in the enactment, in the discretion ofthe court that convicts a person who commits the offence, butno punishment is a minimum punishment unless it is declaredbe a minimum punishment.(Emphasis added)[43] As s. 718.3 makes clear, trial judges exercise theirsentencing discretion \"subject to the limitations prescribed inthe enactment\". Parliament sets the boundaries within whichjudges exercise their sentencing powers. Parliament alwaysimposes an upper boundary, that is, a maximum penalty, andsometimes fixes a lower boundary, that is, a minimum penalty.[44] Where Parliament chooses to impose a minimum penalty,either for a specific offence or if specified aggravatingfactors exist, the discretion of the sentencing judge isnecessarily limited. As McLachlin C.J.C. put it in Ferguson, atpara. 54, the minimum penalty \"mandates a floor below whichjudges cannot go\". Assuming a minimum penalty isconstitutionally sound, judges have no discretion to impose asentence that is below the minimum even if, in theirassessment, a proper application of the sentencing objectivesand principles in the Criminal Code would yield a lowersentence: Ferguson, at paras. 52-56.[45] The interaction of statutorily prescribed minimumpenalties, judicial discretion on sentencing and the Charterwas considered in R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, [2010]S.C.J. No. 6, 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII), at paras. 43-45. After explaining thebroad discretion generally afforded to trial judges to fashiona fit sentence, LeBel J., at para. 45, turned to the limits onthat discretion:The discretion of a sentencing judge is also constrained bystatute, not only through the general sentencing principlesand objectives enshrined in ss. 718 to 718.2 articulatedabove but also through the restricted availability of certainsanctions in the Code . . . . Parliament has also seen fit toreduce the scope of available sanctions for certain offencesthrough the enactment of mandatory minimum sentences. Arelatively new phenomenon in Canadian law, the minimumsentence is a forceful expression of governmental policy inthe area of criminal law. Certain minimum sentences have beensuccessfully challenged under s. 12 of the Charter on thebasis that they constituted grossly disproportionatepunishment in the circumstances of the case . . . . Absent adeclaration of unconstitutionality, minimum sentences must beordered where so provided in the Code. A judge's discretiondoes not extend so far as to override this clear statement oflegislative intent.(Emphasis added) [page437][46] Later, at para. 63, when discussing how policemistreatment of an accused amounting to a s. 7 violation mightimpact on sentencing, LeBel J. reiterated the limit placed onsentencing discretion by minimum penalties:In addition, the discretion of the sentencing judge will haveto be exercised within the parameters of the Criminal Code.The judge must impose sentences respecting statutory minimumsand other provisions which prohibit certain forms ofsentencing in the case of specific offences. [See Note 3below][47] Parliament has declared that second and subsequentdrinking and driving offences demand minimum jail terms. If theprosecutor can establish that the notice was given and provethe prior conviction or convictions, if required, the trialjudge is obliged to impose at least the minimum penalty. Thetrial judge must still take into account the principles andobjectives of sentencing identified in the Criminal Code, buthe must do so on the basis that the minimum penalty prescribedby Parliament sets the baseline.[48] The minimum penalties for second and subsequent drinkingand driving offences clearly limit a trial judge's sentencingdiscretion. That limitation is, however, imposed by Parliamentthrough its decision to enact mandatory minimum jail terms forsecond and subsequent offences: see R. v. Bolender, [2010] O.J.No. 5711, 2010 ONCJ 622 (CanLII), 8 M.V.R. (6th) 290.[49] The Crown is no more limiting the sentencing discretionof a trial judge when it chooses to prove the notice under s.727 then it is when it chooses to prove the use of a firearm inthe commission of certain offences, chooses to charge anoffence that attracts a minimum penalty or chooses to proceedby indictment when that procedure attracts a greater minimumpenalty. In each instance, it can be said that the Crown'saction limits the sentencing judge's discretion in the sensethat, but for the Crown's actions, a minimum penalty would notapply. The exercise of the Crown's discretion, however, has theeffect of limiting the judge's sentencing discretion because ofthe statutory provisions enacted by Parliament. It is thoseprovisions that limit the trial judge's sentencing discretion.As the Supreme Court of Canada made clear in Ferguson and againin Nasogaluak, unless minimum penalties are unconstitutional,judges must [page438] accept them and impose sentences thatfall within the range fixed by Parliament. (iii) The nature of the prosecutor's discretion[50] Mr. Perlmutter, for the Crown, submits that whendeciding whether to prove the notice, a prosecutor isexercising a core element of prosecutorial discretion. Hecontends that prosecutorial independence, itself a fundamentalconstitutional principle, dictates that the exercise of thatcore discretion is beyond judicial review except for abuse ofprocess. Mr. Perlmutter further contends that as the respondentdoes not suggest that the proof of the notice amounted to anabuse of process in this case, the prosecutor's decision cannotoffend the principles of fundamental justice. Thecharacterization of the prosecutor's decision to prove thenotice as an exercise of core discretion finds support in R. v.Mohla, [2012] O.J. No. 388, 2012 ONSC 30 (CanLII), 26 M.V.R. (6th) 63(S.C.J.), at paras. 156-65.[51] The distinction between core prosecutorial decisions andother exercises of prosecutorial discretion is now entrenchedin our jurisprudence: see Krieger v. Law Society of Alberta,[2002] 3 S.C.R. 372, [2002] S.C.J. No. 45, 2002 SCC 65 (CanLII), atparas. 45-47; R. v. Nixon, [2011] 2 S.C.R. 566, [2011] S.C.J.No. 34, 2011 SCC 34 (CanLII), at paras. 18-21; Miazga v. Kvello Estate,[2009] 3 S.C.R. 339, [2009] S.C.J. No. 51, 2009 SCC 51 (CanLII), atparas. 45-48; and R. v. R. (J.S.), [2012] O.J. No. 4063, 2012ONCA 568 (CanLII), at paras. 118-34.[52] Prosecutorial decisions that are said to lie at the coreof prosecutorial authority have been described in Krieger, atpara. 47, as involving. . . the ultimate decisions as to whether a prosecutionshould be brought, continued or ceased, and what theprosecution ought to be for. Put differently, prosecutorialdiscretion refers to decisions regarding the nature andextent of the prosecution and the Attorney General'sparticipation in it.(Emphasis omitted)[53] Prosecutorial decisions that do not lie at the core ofprosecutorial authority are said to involve \"tactics or conductbefore the court\": Krieger, at para. 47.[54] One cannot set out an exhaustive list of prosecutorialpowers that engage the prosecutor's core discretionary powers.The distinction between core discretionary powers and otherprosecutorial decisions lies in the nature of the decisionbeing made. Core prosecutorial decisions are those that arefundamental to the nature, commencement or continuation of theprosecution. Decisions that are made in the course of anongoing proceeding and address the kinds of tactical issues[page439] that routinely arise in litigation are not part ofthe core prosecutorial discretion.[55] Prosecutors, like all litigators, exercise discretion ina myriad of ways during a proceeding. Matters affected by theexercise of that discretion range from the mundane to thetactically crucial. In the exercise of what I would refer to asthe prosecutor's litigation discretion, prosecutors routinelydecide what evidence will be adduced in support of the Crown'sposition on sentence. In doing so, prosecutors are not makingdecisions regarding \"the nature and extent of the prosecutionand the Attorney General's participation in it\": see Krieger,at para. 47. Rather, prosecutors are deciding how to put theircase forward on sentence. Like the trial judge, at paras. 38-39of his reasons, I would not characterize the decision to provethe notice as akin to a decision to commence, continue or ceasea prosecution. Nor does the decision to prove the notice impacton any of those core prosecutorial responsibilities.[56] It seems to me that counsel for the appellant'scharacterization of the prosecutor's decision to prove thenotice as an exercise of core prosecutorial powers is more areflection of the nature of the impact of the decision on theaccused rather than the nature of the decision itself. Inalmost any case, the prosecutor will have to decide whatevidence to lead on sentence. This will include evidence ofpotentially aggravating factors. Some aggravating factors arespecifically identified in the Criminal Code. For example, s.718.2 identifies several circumstances that must be taken asaggravating if proved by the Crown. The Crown has a discretionas to whether to lead evidence of the facts referred to in s.718.2 on sentencing. I do not think it could be argued that theprosecutor, in electing to prove a s. 718.2 aggravating factor,e.g., racial bias, was engaged in the exercise of a coreelement of prosecutorial discretion. The Crown's decision toprove the notice is qualitatively no different than itsdecision to prove other aggravating factors on sentence. Thenature of the decision does not change because the noticetriggers a minimum penalty whereas proof of other aggravatingfactors does not. A decision to prove an aggravating fact onsentence, regardless of its impact on the range of availablesentencing decisions, is a litigation decision made in theprosecutor's exercise of his or her discretion concerning theconduct of the proceedings on behalf of the Crown. (iv) The relevant principles of fundamental justice[57] The distinction between prosecutorial decisions thatengage the core prosecutorial discretion and otherprosecutorial [page440] decisions is important because theformer are reviewable only for abuse of process. Thus, if anaccused challenges a prosecutorial exercise of discretion unders. 7 of the Charter, and that decision is said to go to thecore prosecutorial power, it can offend the principles offundamental justice only if it constitutes an abuse of process.Put in a more positive way, prosecutorial independence, itselfa principle of fundamental justice, forecloses judicial reviewof core decisions under s. 7 for anything other than abuse ofprocess.[58] My conclusion that the Crown's decision to prove thenotice is not an exercise of a core element of prosecutorialdiscretion means that the principles of fundamental justice donot limit the review of the prosecutor's discretion toallegations of an abuse of process. The question then becomeswhat is the appropriate scope of review under s. 7 forprosecutorial decisions that do not reflect the exercise ofthat core prosecutorial discretion. To answer that question,one must identify the applicable principles of fundamentaljustice.[59] The principles of fundamental justice refer to thoselegal principles that are basic to, and vital to, our notion ofcriminal justice: Rodriguez v. British Columbia (AttorneyGeneral), 1993 CanLII 75 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519, [1993] S.C.J. No. 94, at paras.141-46; Mohla, at para. 175. The applicable principles offundamental justice will depend on the context. A prosecutor'sdecision to prove the notice will run contrary to theseprinciples of fundamental justice and, therefore, violate anaccused's s. 7 rights if it-- undermines the integrity of the administration of justice;-- operates in a manner that renders the sentencing proceedingsfundamentally unfair;-- is arbitrary; or-- results in a limit on the accused's liberty that is grosslydisproportionate to the state interest in proving the notice.[60] Although the decision to prove the notice is not anexercise of core prosecutorial discretion, the exercise of thatdiscretion is subject to review under the abuse of processdoctrine. A decision to prove the notice that constitutes anabuse of process will result in an infringement of the libertyinterest of an accused that is contrary to the principles offundamental justice.[61] Abuse of process in the context of challenges to theexercise of prosecutorial discretion refers to decisions thateither undermine the integrity of the criminal justice systemin a broad [page441] sense or fundamentally impair the fairnessof the specific proceedings: Nixon, at paras. 36-42. I need notattempt a more exact description of the first category of abuseof process as it is not suggested that the Crown's decision toprove the notice in this case could somehow undermine theintegrity of the criminal justice system.[62] The second category of abuse of process looks at theimpact of the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion on theright to a fair trial. That right extends to the sentencingprocess. Fairness is generally assured by compliance with theapplicable procedural and evidentiary rules. Section 7 remainsavailable, however, if despite compliance with those rules, theproceeding is rendered fundamentally unfair to an accused as aresult of challenged prosecutorial conduct: R. v. Albright,1987 CanLII 26 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 383, [1987] S.C.J. No. 56, at pp. 395-96S.C.R.[63] Trial fairness is a procedural concept. Trial fairnessspeaks to things such as proper notice to an accused of thecase to be met and a fair opportunity to meet that case. Trialfairness does not mean that the prosecutor must make decisionsthat the court considers to be reasonable. Trial fairness isalso not concerned with the trial judge's notions of thesuitability of a minimum penalty that may arise as aconsequence of a decision made by the Crown. Assuming theminimum penalty is constitutional, and no one suggests that theminimum penalties in issue here are unconstitutional, exposureto those penalties is not unfair in any relevant constitutionalsense. The prosecutor's decision to prove the notice did notcause any unfairness to the respondent.[64] Arbitrariness, a well-recognized principle offundamental justice, also applies to the exercise ofprosecutorial discretion: see PHS Community Services Society,at paras. 126-32. A decision will be arbitrary and contrary tothe principles of fundamental justice if the decision bears norelationship to the objective of the relevant legislation:Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford (2012), 109 O.R. (3d) 1,[2012] O.J. No. 1296, 2012 ONCA 186 (CanLII), at paras. 143-47. Therelevant law for present purposes is s. 255 of the CriminalCode, which provides for minimum jail terms for second andsubsequent drinking and driving offences.[65] The objective of the sentencing regime established unders. 255 is obvious. The mandatory minimum jail terms for secondand subsequent drinking and driving offences speak toParliament's resolve to reflect the community's denunciation ofconduct that is both inherently dangerous and one of Canada'smost pressing social problems. The statutory regime further[page442] demonstrates Parliament's determination to deterthe repetition of that conduct by the promise of certainincarceration.[66] Service of the notice by the prosecutor, a preconditionto a triggering of the mandatory minimum jail term, isconsistent with and bears a direct relationship to theachievement of the legislative objective underlying s. 255.Without the notice, Parliament's promise of incarceration forrepeat offenders cannot be kept. Arguably, it is where theprosecutor decides not to prove the notice that the exercise ofprosecutorial discretion conflicts with the legislativeobjective of s. 255. However, the arbitrariness of thatdecision is constitutionally irrelevant as s. 7 is not engagedwhen the prosecutor chooses not to prove the notice.[67] I think the policy enunciated by the Attorney General inthe memorandum is also relevant to the arbitrariness inquiryunder s. 7. A decision by an individual prosecutor that bearsno relationship to the objectives underlying the policy in thememorandum would, in my view, be arbitrary and contrary to theprinciples of fundamental justice. The policy clearly calls foran exercise of discretion based on the mitigating andaggravating factors of the specific case. The policy also drawsa distinction between prior offences that occurred more thanfive years before the latest offence and those that occurredwithin five years of the latest offence. Thus, for example, ifa prosecutor took the position that the notice must be provedin all cases, or that the passage of more than five years sincethe last conviction was irrelevant, the prosecutor's decisionto prove the notice would bear no relationship to theobjectives of the policy and would be arbitrary and contrary tothe principles of fundamental justice.[68] The arbitrariness inquiry based on the AttorneyGeneral's policy does not, however, contemplate a review, onany standard, of the merits of the prosecutor's decision. Adecision to prove the notice predicated on both a recognitionof the discretion, and an assessment of the mitigating andaggravating factors is consistent with the objectives of theAttorney General, regardless of how the discretion isexercised.[69] On this record, it cannot be said that the prosecutor'sdecision to prove the notice bore no relationship to theobjectives of the policy set out in the memorandum. Theprosecutor was clearly alert to the policy and the significanceof the time gap between the prior convictions and theconviction for which the respondent was being sentenced. Theprosecutor also appreciated that the number of priorconvictions, a clearly aggravating factor, was relevant to theexercise of his discretion. [page443][70] It is important to bear in mind that it was not for theprosecutor to prove that he did not act arbitrarily. It wasincumbent on the respondent to establish a breach of s. 7 bydemonstrating arbitrariness in the sense that the prosecutor'sdecision bore no relationship to the objectives of the policy.The record offers no support for that assertion.[71] Gross disproportionality is also a well-establishedprinciple of fundamental justice. If the deprivation of libertyoccasioned by the exercise of the prosecutor's discretion is soextreme as to be clearly disproportionate to any legitimategovernment interest furthered by the exercise of theprosecutor's discretion, the prosecutor's conduct willcontravene the principles of fundamental justice enshrined ins. 7: see Bedford, at para. 149.[72] The deprivation of the respondent's liberty interestsoccasioned by the Crown's exercise of its discretion to provethe notice flows from the mandatory minimum penaltiesprescribed in s. 255. Arguments alleging grossdisproportionality in respect of sentences are addressed unders. 12 of the Charter. A sentence that passes constitutionalscrutiny under s. 12 cannot be found to offend the grossdisproportionality principles of fundamental justice: R. v.Malmo-Levine, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, [2003] S.C.J. No. 79, 2003SCC 74 (CanLII), at paras. 159-62. The respondent has not argued thatthe minimum sentences are so grossly disproportionate as tocontravene s. 12. This concession effectively defeats any s. 7claim based on gross disproportionality.[73] The trial judge did not refer to the principles offundamental justice discussed above. Instead, after holdingthat proof of the notice was not a core prosecutorial function,the trial judge concluded that the court could require theprosecutor to \"justify\" his decision to prove the notice. Atpara. 50, the trial judge held that the court could review thejustification offered by the prosecutor. . . to determine whether the Crown acted reasonably andtook into account only appropriate considerations in makingits decision. If not, the decision to file the notice wouldbe set aside.[74] Putting the trial judge's findings in the framework of as. 7 analysis, I take him to have held that the principles offundamental justice require that the Crown offer an explanationfor the exercise of the discretion to prove the notice and thatthe exercise of that discretion can survive s. 7 scrutiny onlyif the trial judge views the exercise of discretion asreasonable. I think the summary conviction appeal courteffectively adopted the same analysis: see paras. 57-58, 67-68.[75] I cannot accept this analysis. There is no free-standingprinciple of fundamental justice requiring that the Crownjustify [page444] the exercise of its discretion to the trialcourt. To the contrary, our legal tradition -- the source ofthe principles of fundamental justice -- has long recognizedthat the independence of the prosecutor and the very distinctroles assigned to judges and prosecutors in the criminalprocess combine to dictate that judges should not oversee trialdecisions made in the exercise of prosecutorial discretionexcept to the extent that they impact on the integrity of theprocess or the fairness of the trial. To require prosecutors to\"justify\" decisions to trial judges on a reasonablenessstandard is to imply that trial judges have some sort ofsupervisory role over the conduct of the prosecution. They donot. Further, to open all prosecutorial decisions that impacton an accused's liberty to a reasonableness review by the trialjudge could significantly prolong criminal proceedings and addyet a further layer of motions and applications to what hasbecome an ever more complicated and protracted process: see R.v. Power, 1994 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, [1994] S.C.J. No. 29, at pp.626-27 S.C.R.; Nixon, at para. 52; and Michael Code, \"JudicialReview of Prosecutorial Decisions: A Short History of Costs andBenefits, in Response to Justice Rosenberg\" (2009), 34 Queen'sL.J. 863, at pp. 883-85.[76] I do not mean to suggest that the prosecutor may neverbe required to explain its decision to prove the notice. If theaccused, who carries the burden of persuasion on a s. 7application, leads evidence of a violation of s. 7, the Crownmust respond to that evidence. In doing so, it may be necessaryto offer an explanation for its decision to prove the notice orface an adverse finding based on the evidence offered by theaccused.[77] I also do not intend to discourage the prosecutor fromoffering an explanation for its decision to prove the notice inthose cases where that decision is not self-evident. Byoffering an explanation, the prosecutor clearly enhances thetransparency of his or her decision-making process and, hence,the fairness of the proceeding. Those positive consequences area good reason for the prosecutor to offer an explanation. Thoseconsequences do not, however, justify the conclusion that anexplanation is constitutionally demanded by the Charter. In myview, the prosecutor is under no constitutional obligation togive reasons for the decision to prove the notice.[78] I also cannot agree with the trial judge that theprinciples of fundamental justice require that a trial judgereview the exercise of the Crown's discretion on areasonableness standard. In selecting reasonableness as thestandard against which to review the prosecutor's decision, thetrial judge said, at para. 51: [page445]Most discretionary powers and decisions are reviewed on thebasis of reasonableness. Courts are well equipped to assesswhether the decision maker turned its mind to appropriateconsiderations and whether the decision was unreasonable.[79] With respect, there are two errors in the trial judge'sobservation. First, the common practice of reviewing theexercise of discretionary powers on a reasonableness standardinvolves reviews that are based on the statutory grant of apower of appeal or judicial review. There is no such statutoryauthority for review of a prosecutor's exercise of his or herdiscretion. The review the trial judge conducted was notpremised on any statutory authority, but rather on ss. 7 and24(1) of the Charter. I am unaware of any authority that hasheld that reasonableness is a principle of fundamental justiceagainst which state conduct that limits liberty can bemeasured.[80] Second, I must disagree with the trial judge'sindication that the courts are \"well equipped\" to assess thereasonableness of the prosecutor's exercise of his or herdiscretion. The deference traditionally shown by the courts toall prosecutorial decision-making is founded on the recognitionthat the distinct roles played by the prosecutor and the judge,combined with practical institutional limitations, makejudicial review of the exercise of prosecutorial discretionvery difficult.[81] This case demonstrates how easily a reasonablenessreview can slide into the substitution of a judge's opinion forthat of the prosecutor. In exercising his discretion to provethe notice, the prosecutor emphasized the key aggravatingfactor -- the number of prior convictions. In finding that theprosecutor's decision was unreasonable, the trial judgeemphasized the key mitigating factor -- the 17-year gap betweenthe prior convictions and the most recent offence. Thedifference between the two assessments came down to theemphasis that should be placed on the key aggravating factor ascompared to the emphasis that should be placed on the keymitigating factor. This is exactly the kind of balancing thatmust be left to the prosecutor unless the decision is contraryto the principles of fundamental justice outlined above.[82] The s. 7 jurisprudence provides a further reason forrejecting reasonableness as a principle of fundamental justice.If decisions can be reviewed for reasonableness under s. 7, thearbitrariness standard of review, a firmly entrenched principleof fundamental justice, becomes redundant. There would belittle point in reviewing state action for arbitrariness ifreasonableness were a principle of fundamental justice.Clearly, all arbitrary decisions would be unreasonable, but notall unreasonable [page446] decisions would be arbitrary as thatword has been defined in the s. 7 jurisprudence.[83] In summary, a review for reasonableness is unsupportedin the case law, inconsistent with the recognized standards ofreview under s. 7, and incompatible with the recognized rolesof the prosecutor and the trial judge. The trial judge shouldnot have inquired into the reasonableness of the prosecutor'sexercise of his discretion.VIConclusion[84] The Crown has demonstrated an error in law. Normally,the court would allow the appeal and impose a jail term of atleast 90 days, the minimum, giving the respondent credit forhis pre-trial custody. However, this appeal was heard almostfive years after the offence and almost four years after therespondent was convicted. He served the sentence imposed by thetrial judge long ago. Crown counsel advised, during oralargument, that he would not seek the re-incarceration of therespondent were the appeal successful. I think this is anappropriate concession.[85] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of thesummary conviction appeal court dismissing the appeal, setaside the sentence imposed by the trial judge and impose asentence of 90 days. I would stay the imposition of the jailterm. The remainder of the sentence, a probation term and adriving prohibition, remains as imposed by the trial judge.Appeal allowed.Notes----------------Note 1: The section was amended by the Tackling Violent CrimeAct, S.C. 2008, c. 6, s. 21 to increase all of the minimumpenalties. The minimum penalty for a first offence is now afine of not less than $1,000, a second offence is punishable bya term of imprisonment of not less than 30 days and subsequentoffences are punishable by a term of imprisonment of not lessthan 120 days.

D.D., 2015 ONSC 5865R E\nA S O N SF O RS E N T E N C EFairburnJ.(Orally):OverviewD.D. and the victim met in December, 2012.\nThey formed a relationship.By mid-February, 2013, D.D. started moving into\nthe victim’s home, where she resided with her 18-year-old son.On April 29th,\n2013, and again on May 1st, 2013, D.D. sexually assaulted the\nvictim.He also threatened to kill the victim and her son.My task is to sentence DD for these\noffences.Factual\nBackground(i) Circumstances\nof the offencesThe Victim’s EvidenceThe victim is originally from Bangladesh.She\narrived in Canada in 2005.She is a single mother.In 2013, she owned a\ntwo-story house, where she lived with her son.She met D.D. while at a gas station in\nDecember, 2012.They commenced a relationship and he eventually moved into her\nresidence.He was arrested on May 1st, 2013.He faced five\ncharges: one count of assault, two counts of sexual assault, and two counts of\nutter death threat.A jury returned verdicts of guilty on all counts but the\nassault.As it relates to the allegation of assault,\nthe victim testified that D.D. pushed her against a wall on a few occasions.On\none occasion in specific, she said that her head hit the wall and bled.As the\njury acquitted D.D. in respect to this conduct, alleged to have occurred in the\ntime leading up to the sexual assaults and death threats, I specifically\ndisregard it in arriving upon a fit sentence.Sexual\nAssault: April 29, 2013The victim testified that by April 29th,\n2013, things had become very difficult with D.D..He was consuming a lot of\nalcohol.She wanted him to move out and believed that he would be leaving the\nresidence.She went to bed at between 11:30 p.m. and\n12:00 a.m.She had locked her bedroom door when she went to bed.Shortly\nafterwards, she heard D.D.’s voice at the door.He was banging and kicking the\ndoor, demanding that she open it.So as not to scare her son, she opened the\ndoor.D.D. grabbed her and threw her face first\nonto the bed.He pulled her hair and said, “I am going to dominate you today,\nbitch”.He penetrated her anus with his penis.She was begging him to leave\nher alone.She testified about how much it hurt.She defecated in the bed as\na result of the anal penetration.D.D. eventually turned her over, wiped his\npenis on the bed sheets, and entered her vagina with his penis.The victim\ntestified that he was slapping her and holding her neck right under her chin.She\ntestified that he eventually ejaculated inside of her vagina.He did not use a\ncondom.Sexual Assault:\nMay 1st, 2013During the morning, after returning from\ntaking her son to school and doing a few things, the victim testified that she\nentered her bedroom.D.D. was hiding behind the door and grabbed her.He\nremoved her robe and tank top and threw her face first on the bed.He then\nremoved her underwear.She asked him not to enter her anally, as she was\nalready bleeding from her anus from the April 29th sexual assault.The victim testified that D.D. started to\nbite and scratch her neck, back and shoulder areas.She begged him to stop as\nit was hurting.She testified that he was “wild and crazy”.She testified\nthat at one point he was holding her mouth, and at other points she was begging\nand crying for the assault to stop.Unlike on April 29th, D.D. did\nnot enter her anally.Instead, he turned her over and penetrated her vagina\nwith his penis.He ejaculated inside of her vagina.Again, he did not use a\ncondom.Death Threats:\nMay 1st, 2013After the sexual assault, the victim went to\nthe kitchen area.Eventually, D.D. appeared in the kitchen and smelled of\nalcohol.She told him that he was drinking too much and that he was torturing\nher physically and mentally and it needed to stop.He proceeded to the living\nroom area and shouted “shut the fuck up”, called her a “bitch”, and said that\nhe was going to, “kill you and your son and no one can kick me out of this\nhouse.This is my house.”D.D. called the police.It was agreed at\ntrial that when the police arrived, the victim was observed with a red mark on\nthe left side of her neck, she was crying, very upset, and her hands were\nshaking.D.D.’s position with respect to the seriousness of the sexual assaultsThe factual circumstances that can\nconstitute the crime of sexual assault fall on a wide spectrum of potential\nconduct.D.D. takes the position that because this was a jury trial, we do not\nknow the factual basis upon which the sexual assault verdicts rest.He argues\nthat, as the sentencing judge, I am duty-bound to arrive upon factual\nconclusions as to what actually occurred in this case.Only then can a proper\nassessment be made as to the seriousness of the offences, a finding which is\ncritical to the determination of a fit sentence.It is D.D.’s position that I should come to\nfactual findings that lead to the conclusion that the sexual assaults were not\nserious.He says that I should conclude that there was either no intercourse\nand, if there was, that it was consensual in nature.D.D. says that it is open\nto me to find that if there was intercourse, it was consensual and that the\ncriminal conduct, as found by the jury, is rooted in D.D.’s behaviour when he\nwent too far and slapped the victim, or grabbed and held her throat.It is D.D.’s position the victim’s evidence\ncannot be trusted, particularly as it relates to all of what she said.He\npoints out that, by virtue of the acquittal for assault, the jury did not\naccept all of her evidence.He says that I need not and should not accept all\nof her evidence with respect to the seriousness of the sexual assaults.While he acknowledges that the jury clearly\naccepted something from her evidence that constituted sexual assaults, it is\nnow up to me to determine what happened.Only by arriving at this factual\ndetermination, can DD be properly sentenced.D.D. relies upon various factors in\nsuggesting that I should have little confidence in the victim’s evidence.For\ninstance, text messages were exchanged between the victim and D.D. the day\nfollowing the April 29th sexual assault.He expressed the fact that\nthe previous evening had been “amazing” and she had “tasted so yummy”.She\nresponded “LOL. You are so naughty.”When these text messages were put to her in\ncross-examination, the victim testified that she had intended to use the word “nasty”.The auto correct function on her electronic device had changed it to “naughty”.As for the LOL, she understands this to be\nthe equivalent of a smile in a text message.She testified that she was\nplacing a smile into the message because she did not wish to be rude to D.D.,\nand because he was still living in her home.Through the assistance of the\ninterpreter, she testified that LOL means “shrugging” someone off in the sense\nthat their words are not being taken seriously.She shrugged D.D. off\n“lightly” because she did not want to make him angry.When it comes to determining the seriousness\nof the sexual assaults, D.D. also encourages me to place little weight on the\nvictim’s evidence because of a statement she gave to the police on May 1st,\n2013.She told the police that she had stopped D.D. from penetrating her anus.When she was confronted with this statement\nin cross-examination, she accepted that she had said this to the police.She\nexplained why she said it.She said that at the time she gave her statement,\nfollowing the second sexual assault and death threats, she was in shock, shy, in\npain, and uncomfortable speaking with the police.She was worried about her\nson’s well-being and she was not thinking straight.In attempting to shake her credibility and\npersuade me to find that the sexual assaults fall at the lower end of the\nseriousness spectrum, D.D. also points to the victim’s suggestion that she bled\nfrom her anus for some time following the assault.She testified that she had\nongoing problems with her anus.D.D. emphasizes the fact that a letter was\nproduced from the victim’s family physician, suggesting that she told her\ndoctor that her rectal bleeding only commenced in 2014.In re-examination, the\nvictim disputed this fact and said that she had disclosed to her doctor that\nshe had anal bleeding since April, 2013.D.D. also points to a document, sworn by the\nvictim, suggesting that she and her “fiancée” had merely engaged in “rough sex”\nand “not forced sex”.The letter goes on that her English is not “that good\nand may be that’s why there was a miscommunication”.D.D. says that this sworn\ndocument underscores the fact that the sexual assaults are not as serious as\nthe victim testified to in this court.When asked about this sworn document, the\nvictim testified that she did not take an oath, despite the fact that the\nletter appears to have been commissioned by a commissioner of oaths.She said\nthat she received a copy of the letter from D.D.’s sister, who emailed it to\nher.It had already been written and the victim just changed some parts.She\ntestified that many parts of the letter are not true, particularly the part\nrelating to “rough sex”.She signed the letter because D.D.’s mother\nand sister asked her to.At the time she signed the letter, she wanted D.D. back\nin her life and thought that the letter may help. At the time she was holding\nout hope that he would get alcohol treatment and be a good person.She\ntestified that they did not have “rough sex”, they had “forced sex”.The law relating\nto findings of fact in jury casesIn jury cases, the sentencing judge must\nsometimes determine the facts necessary to impose a fit sentence: R. v.\nFerguson, 2008 SCC 6 (CanLII), at para. 16 [Ferguson].While the sentencing\njudge must accept the “express and implied factual implications of the jury’s\nverdict”, R. v. Brown, 1991 CanLII 73 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 518, at p. 523, it is sometimes\nnecessary to go beyond the verdict and determine relevant facts disclosed by\nthe evidence.These principles are found in s. 724(2) of\nthe Criminal Code.Where an individual has been tried by a jury, s.\n724(2)(a) requires the court to “accept” as proven all facts “express or\nimplied, that are essential to the jury’s verdict of guilty”.Where the\nfactual implications of a jury’s verdict are ambiguous, it is not the task of\nthe sentencing judge to reconstruct the jury’s thinking.Rather, the judge\nmust come to her own “independent determination of the relevant facts”:\nFerguson, at para. 18.It is here that s. 724(2)(b) comes into\nplay.The sentencing judge “may find any other relevant fact” that is\ndisclosed by evidence at trial. For that proposition, I rely on Ferguson,\nat para. 18; and R. v. Roncaioli, 2011 ONCA 378 (CanLII), at para. 59.In order\nto rely on a factor in aggravation of sentence, the sentencing judge must be\nsatisfied beyond a reasonable doubt as to the existence of the fact.Findings of factI had the advantage of seeing and hearing\nthe victim testify.She struck me as a shy and reserved individual.She gave\ncareful and thoughtful testimony.For the most part she was able to get by\nwithout the assistance of a Bengali interpreter, who was on stand-by throughout\nthe trial and available to assist when the victim needed help.At times, particularly when she was\ndescribing the sexual assaults, the victim was overcome by emotion.She would\nshake and cry, yet make efforts to compose herself and continue.She testified\nin a quiet but dignified manner.She was not combative during\ncross-examination.When challenged with difficult evidence,\nlike her prior inconsistent statement about being anally penetrated, and her\nsworn statement claiming that she and D.D. had only engaged in “rough sex”, she\ndid not attempt to minimize these things.She slowly and cautiously explained\nwhy she did what she did and said what she said.She appeared intent on\ntelling the truth and explaining what she felt at the time.I caution myself that it is unsafe to place\ntoo heavy an emphasis on demeanor when making assessments of credibility.I do\nnot do so.At the same time though, it is an accepted means by which to assess\na witness’ evidence.As noted by McLachlin C.J. in R. v. N.S., 2012 SCC\n72 (CanLII), at para. 25:It\nis a settled axiom of appellate review that deference should be shown to the\ntrier of fact on issues of credibility because trial judges (and juries) have\nthe \"overwhelming advantage\" of seeing and hearing the witness - an\nadvantage that a written transcript cannot replicate: Housen\nv. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 (CanLII), [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, at\npara. 24; see also White\nv. The King, 1947 CanLII 1 (SCC), [1947] S.C.R. 268, at p. 272; R. v. W. (R.), 1992 CanLII 56 (SCC), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, at p. 131. This advantage is described as stemming from the ability to assess the demeanour of the witness, that is, to see how the witness gives her evidence and responds to\ncross-examination.In this case, I have had this advantage.I\nfind that the victim was intent on being truthful. Despite circumstances that\nappeared at times to be excruciatingly difficult to recount, she struggled\nthrough.I accept her explanation as to why she did not tell the police\ncertain things during her first interview, including the fact that she was\nbleeding from her anus.She had been through a great deal, was in shock, and\nwas struggling with some language barriers.I witnessed these language\nbarriers throughout the trial.While she did not require the use of the\ninterpreter very much, it was often necessary for counsel to slow their\nquestioning and restate their questions to ensure the witness understood what\nshe was being asked before answering.As it relates to the victim’s sworn letter,\nsaying that she and D.D. had only engaged in rough sex, I accept her\nexplanation as to how this document came to be.I note that, sadly, she is not\nthe first and will not be the last victim of a serious domestic assault who,\nnotwithstanding her treatment at the hands of her partner, expresses strong\nfeelings for the accused.I accept her explanation as to why she signed the\nletter.I also accept that it was originally authored by D.D.’s mother and\nsister.This does not shake my confidence in her evidence.As for the text message the day following\nthe April 29th sexual assault, including the phrase “LOL.You are\nso naughty”, I accept the victim’s explanation as to why she said that she sent\nthis message.D.D. was still living in her home at the time, meaning that he\nwas still living with and had access to the victim and, importantly, her son.By\nhis own admission he seems to have been a difficult alcoholic and, owing to the\nliving arrangements, it makes sense that she was intent on making peace with\nhim.In the end, I find the victim gave credible\nand reliable evidence.I find beyond a reasonable doubt that the sexual\nassaults occurred as she described in her evidence.(ii)\nCircumstances of the offenderD.D. is 38 years of age.He has a Grade 9\neducation.He has a criminal record dating back to 2000 for various unrelated\noffences.He has never been sentenced to more than 15 days incarceration.His\nmost recent offence that predates the matters upon which he is being sentenced\nwas in January, 2013, for impaired operation of a motor vehicle.Prior to\nthese offences, he has also been convicted of trafficking, theft under, and\npossession of a controlled substance.All of these offences tend to have their\nroots in drug and alcohol addiction issues.D.D. has had a very troubled past.His\nmother was 15 years old when she had him. Although she is now back in his life,\nand has been supportive throughout these proceedings, she abandoned him during\nmuch of his formative years.He had an abusive father.D.D. was blamed by his\nfather for the death of his sister.D.D.’s mother believes that this had a\nsignificant adverse impact on him as a child.He has had various partners and has four\nchildren.His oldest son, with whom he has little contact, resides with his\nmother in Italy.D.D. also had twins with another woman.Sadly, one died at\nfour days of age.The other is 10 years old and D.D. maintains some\nrelationship with him.He says his 10-year-old is the most important person in\nhis life.I accept this to be so.He also has a daughter.While she is not\nhis natural child, he loves her like she is his own child.None of his\nchildren live with him.D.D. has had various drug addictions\nthroughout his adult life.At points he has been involved with ecstasy,\ncocaine, mushrooms, crack cocaine, and crystal methamphetamine.He has used\nintravenous drugs and has Hepatitis C. He has acted as an escort in the past.D.D.\nclaims to have been diagnosed with borderline mood disorder and that he is\nbipolar. He says that he has posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorder\nand depression.He told the probation officer that he attempted suicide once\nand that he has been involuntarily committed to psychiatric facilities.He is\ntaking no medication right now other than medical marijuana.D.D.’s family physician provided information\nto the probation officer.He stated that the offender has a licence for\nmedical marijuana for the management of chronic pain. D.D. has also attended\ncounselling with a person from the Canadian Mental Health Association.The\nprobation officer was told by this individual that she and D.D. “had a falling\nout”.She discharged D.D. some time ago.She only saw him four times, he\ncancelled five appointments, and he failed to attend three scheduled\nappointments.During submissions, counsel suggested that this may have had\nsomething to do with the weather and ability to get to appointments.I am\nprepared to accept that this is the case.According to the probation officer, D.D. accepts\nno responsibility for his actions.He told the officer that he denies all\naspects of the offences.However, he told the probation officer that he feels\n“utterly disgusted that [the victim] feels that way.It was never my intention\nto make someone feel that way.I feel sorry she feels the way she does.”I invited D.D. to address the court at\nsentence.He said that he has been sexually assaulted and would never do this\nto someone else.He should not be required to pay for something he did not do.While he feels remorse that the victim feels the way she does, he did not\ncommit the offences.His son is the most important person in his life, and he\ndoes not wish to lose contact with him.There were letters filed in his support from\nhis mother, his 10-year-old son, his niece and his nephew’s girlfriend.His\nmother’s letter is exhaustive and repeats a fair bit of what is found in the\nPre-Sentence Report.She expresses significant support for D.D..The rest of\nthe letters express affection and support for him as well.(iii) Victim\nImpactWhile the victim provided information to the\nprobation officer when he was preparing the Pre-Sentence Report, she chose not\nto provide a Victim Impact Statement.I was informed by Crown counsel that she\nwas provided with the opportunity to do so.The defence take the position that I should\nnot have regard to the information provided by the complainant in the\nPre-Sentence Report.As there is a statutory mechanism by which she could have\nprovided these comments pursuant to s. 722 of the Criminal Code, it is\ninappropriate to be received through the mechanism of a pre-sentence report.I\nneed not come to a conclusion on this point as I have had the opportunity to\nwatch the victim testify.Having watched and heard her testimony, I find that\nthis offence has had a tremendous adverse impact upon her.I do not take into\naccount her comments from the pre-sentence report.Positions of\nCounselPosition of the\nCrownCrown counsel says that D.D. should be\nsentenced to four years concurrent on each of the sexual assaults, and six\nmonths concurrent on each of the death threats, for a total sentence of four\nyears.Ms. Sibian argues that the sentencing principles of denunciation and\ndeterrence are of paramount concern in this case.She accepts that D.D. should\nreceive credit for 22 days of pre-trial custody at a ratio of 1 to 1.5.Ms.\nSibian disputes that D.D. should receive any credit for the time he has spent\non bail under house arrest.Position of\ndefence counselMr. Feldmann takes the position that I\nshould conclude that the sexual assaults are at the lower end of seriousness.If\nI come to this factual conclusion, then D.D. should be sentenced to a few\nmonths in custody.If I conclude that the sexual assaults are at the more\nserious end of the spectrum, then the sentence should be two years in custody.As\nabove, I have found that the sexual assaults are at the more serious end of the\nspectrum and occurred as the victim described at trial.Mr. Feldmann takes the position that D.D. should\nreceive credit for his 22 days in pre-trial custody, which translates into\nabout a month, as well as benefit for the fact that he has been under house\narrest since he was released from custody on May 22nd, 2013.While acknowledging it is somewhat\narbitrary, counsel requests that D.D. receive about four months credit for the\nover two years of house arrest spent on bail.Sentencing\nPrinciples and Range of SentenceSexual assault is a serious crime.When a\nsexual assault occurs in the context of a domestic relationship, it is all the\nmore serious.Section 718.2(ii) of the Criminal Code says that a\nsentencing court shall take into consideration the fact that “in committing the\noffence” the offender abused a “spouse or common-law partner”.While D.D. and the victim were not\n“common-law” partners within the meaning of s. 2 of the Criminal Code, and\ns. 2 defines “common law partner” as “a person who is cohabiting with the\nindividual in a conjugal relationship, having so cohabited for a period of at\nleast one year”, they were domestic partners.This is a relevant consideration\non sentence.As noted by Cronk J.A. in R. v. McGregor (2008), 2008 ONCA 831 (CanLII), 94 O.R.\n(3d) 500 (C.A.), at para. 30, all intimate relationships are based on “trust\nand confidence”.This concept was revisited and reinforced by\nCronk J.A. in R. v. C.R., 2010 ONCA 176 (CanLII) [C.R.] where she found at\npara. 85 that:Any sexually\nintimate relationship between adults of the type entered into by J.P. and C.R.\nis founded on a certain amount of trust and confidence, at least to the extent\nthat each participant may reasonably expect that he or she will not knowingly\nbe exposed by the other to serious and obvious perils.The principles of denunciation and\ndeterrence are to be given primary consideration when sentencing in the context\nof domestic violence: R. v. D.J., 2010 ONSC 3910 [D.J.], at para.\n19; and R. v. Boucher (2004), 2004 CanLII 17719 (ON CA), 187 O.A.C. 378, at para. 27.As noted by Simmons J.A. in Boucher:This court\nhas repeatedly emphasized that the principles of denunciation and deterrence are\nof paramount importance in cases involving domestic violence.D.D. suggests that rehabilitation is\nalso a relevant sentencing principle in this context.\nHe says that I should also take into account his prospects for rehabilitation.Although\nthe Pre-Sentence Report gives rise to serious concern about what these\nprospects are, a concern that is in part rooted in his track record in respect\nto seeking, obtaining and receiving medical treatment, I agree that it is a\nprinciple that I should take into account.When it comes to the range of sentence, the Court of Appeal\nfor Ontario recently observed that the range of\nsentence for forced intercourse with a spouse is 21 months to 4 years.As\nBenotto J.A. held, the sentences at the low end of the range are those\ninvolving single incidents of forced intercourse: R. v. H.E., 2015 ONCA\n531 (CanLII), at para. 44. See also: R. v. Smith, 2011 ONCA 564 (CanLII), at para. 87.This\nrange seems to be born out by the jurisprudence. Some examples include: C.R.,\nwhere a two and a half year sentence was imposed; R. v. Evans, [2012]\nO.J. No. 4941, aff’d R. v. K.E., [2014] O.J. No. 1119 (C.A.) where a\nfour year sentence was imposed; and D.J. where a three year sentence was\nimposed in the context of a guilty plea.Mitigating and Aggravating Factors\nin This CaseThere are numerous aggravating factors in this case.They\ninclude the following:i)D.D. was in a relationship with the victim and the\noffence constituted a breach of trust.ii)There were two sexual assaults less than 48 hours apart.iii)The first sexual assault involved anal penetration and\ncaused the victim to defecate in her own bed.iv)The anal penetration caused her an injury serious enough\nto cause bleeding from her anus for some time.v)The first sexual assault was not only an act of\ndomination, but was accompanied by an expression of domination: “I am going to dominate you today, bitch”.vi)The victim’s son was home when she was\nanally penetrated.vii)D.D. ejaculated inside the victim’s\nvagina during both sexual assaults.viii)D.D. did not use a condom during either attack.ix)D.D. took advantage of the victim by\nmoving into her home and then using that location to sexually assault her.x)D.D. made a death threat not only toward\nthe victim, but also threatened to kill the person she loves most in life, her\nson.xi)D.D. has a prior criminal record,\nalthough it is unrelated and not serious.There are a few mitigating factors in\nthis case. They include the fact that D.D. has been haunted by mental health\nissues throughout his life.He has also been afflicted with drug and alcohol\naddictions.On any objective standard, he has lived a difficult and most tragic\nlife and I have specific regard to this fact in arriving upon a fit disposition\nin this case.As well, D.D. spent the time from his release on bail on May\n22nd, 2013, to today, on a recognizance with the following clause:\n“Remain in your residence daily except to and from and attending\nemployment, medical emergencies, court related matters, counsel matters,\ncounseling or in the presence of your surety.”Counsel described this as a\nhouse arrest provision and said that D.D. should get\ncredit for the strict bail terms he has been living under.While I agree that this is a relevant mitigating factor on\nsentence, I note that there are distinguishing factors from those adverted to\nby Rosenberg J.A. in R. v. Downes, 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA), [2006] O.J.\nNo. 555 (C.A.).In Downes, Rosenberg J.A. noted that house arrest is a\nrelevant factor on sentence.In that case, according to Rosenberg J.A., “even\nthe normal exceptions that usually attend house arrest were missing”.There\nwas not even an exception for medical care.This caused Mr. Downes to be\narrested and convicted for breaching his recognizance when he remained at the\nhospital without his surety.I note that the Downes bail included\na true house arrest provision.While D.D.’s house arrest provision is strict,\nit does not match the most severe form of house arrest imaginable, or\navailable, or imposed on bail.It was nowhere close to as restrictive as the\nDownes bail.Moreover, I note that D.D.was convicted\non two occasions for breaching his recognizance.I am informed by counsel that\nthese breaches related to alcohol related matters.Also, and interestingly, the PSR\nsuggests that D.D. has been living with his new\ngirlfriend since January of 2015.He shared with the probation officer that\nthey play sports together.This is not the type of house arrest that Mr.\nDownes was subjected to.As for the time related to what has been described as\nhouse arrest, and notwithstanding Mr. Feldmann’s helpful and complete\nsubmissions on the point, I have decided that this is a mitigating factor, but\nnot a significant mitigating factor.As such, I approach his somewhat\nstrict bail conditions as a mitigating factor, in accordance with the\nprinciples set down in Downes, as amplified in cases like R. v. Ijam,\n2007 ONCA 597 (CanLII).I do so having regard to the totality of circumstances\nsurrounding the imposition of this bail condition and how D.D. operated under\nit.Conclusion on SentenceThese were very serious sexual assaults committed in the\nprivacy of the victim’s own home.It is obvious from\nthe victim’s evidence that the crimes have had a serious impact on her.The manner\nin which she was dominated was merciless and cowardly.The principles of denunciation and\ndeterrence are paramount.A strong message must be sent that this conduct will\nnot be tolerated.The danger of domestic assaults is that they occur behind closed\ndoors.On the occasions when those doors open, the court must convey in the\nclearest of terms that those who engage in this conduct, and treat their\npartners as objects for their own sexual gratification, will meet a serious\npunishment.While I have taken into account the principle of\nrehabilitation, and I accept that there is some hope that D.D.\nmay be a candidate for this, I note that it is a rather faint hope.He\nhas expressed no remorse; he has expressed no insight into his actions.Nor\nhas he demonstrated a good track record for seeking help in the past or being\nintent on rehabilitating himself.With that said, I am prepared to accept that\nhe is still a fairly young man and an individual who seems to have family\nsupport.And I note that his family is present.His mother is present in the\ncourtroom today, as she has been throughout the trial of this matter.I also have regard to the fact that D.D.has never served a sentence of longer than 15-days in\ncustody.While he has a criminal record, it is not serious and this will be\nhis first time he is sentenced to a lengthy custodial term.In all of the circumstances, I find that a fit sentence is a\nglobal term of 3 years and 7 months in custody.I credit D.D.\none month on account the 22 days of pre-trial custody which he has served.In the end, he is sentenced to 3 and\na half years in custody for the sexual assault on April 29th, 2103.He\nis sentenced to 3 and a half years concurrent for the sexual assault on May 1,\n2013.I impose 6 months for each utter death threat to be served concurrently.Ancillary OrdersI impose weapons prohibition orders pursuant to ss. 109(2)(a)\nand (2)(b) for a period of 10 years and life respectively.I impose a DNA order pursuant to s. 487.051(1) of the Criminal\nCode.I impose an order pursuant to ss. 490.012 and 490.013(1) and\n(2) of the Criminal Code requiring D.D. to\ncomply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for life.I impose an order pursuant to s.\n743.21(1) prohibiting D.D. from communicating with the\nvictim and her son, directly or indirectly, during the custodial period of his\nsentence....FORM 2CERTIFICATE\nOF TRANSCRIPTEvidence\nAct, Subsection 5(2)I, Ryan Easson, certify that this\ndocument is a true and accurate transcription of the recording of, August\n31, 2015, in,R. v.

Ferguson 2008 SCC 6 (CanLII) how this fact-finding process is to be done.The\nsentencing judge need not arrive at a complete theory of the facts, but must\nmake those factual determinations necessary for the appropriate sentence.[4]The Court in Ferguson set out the two\nprinciples governing this exercise at paras. 17-18:17Two\nprinciples govern the sentencing judge in this endeavour. First, the sentencing\njudge \"is bound by the express and implied factual implications of the\njury's verdict\": R. v. Brown, 1991 CanLII 73 (SCC), [1991] 2\nS.C.R. 518, p. 523. The sentencing judge \"shall accept as\nproven all facts, express or implied, that are essential to the jury's verdict\nof guilty\" (Criminal Code, s. 724(2)(a)), and must not\naccept as fact any evidence consistent only with a verdict rejected by the\njury: Brown; R. v. Braun (1995), 95\nC.C.C. (3d) 443 (Man. C.A.).18Second,\nwhen the factual implications of the jury's verdict are ambiguous, the\nsentencing judge should not attempt to follow the logical process of the jury,\nbut should come to his or her own independent determination of the relevant\nfacts: Brown; R. v. Fiqia (1994),\n1994 ABCA 402 (CanLII), 162 A.R. 117 (C.A.). In so doing, the sentencing judge \"may\nfind any other relevant fact that was disclosed by evidence at the trial to be\nproven\" (s. 724(2)(b)). To rely upon an aggravating fact or\nprevious conviction, the sentencing judge must be convinced of the existence of\nthat fact or conviction beyond a reasonable doubt; to rely upon any other\nrelevant fact, the sentencing judge must be persuaded on a balance of\nprobabilities: (ss. 724(3)(d) and 724(3)(e); see also R. v.\nGardiner, 1982 CanLII 30 (SCC), [1982] 2\nS.C.R. 368; R. v. Lawrence (1987), 58\nC.R. (3d) 71 (Ont. H.C.)). It follows from the purpose of the\nexercise that the sentencing judge should find only those facts necessary to\npermit the proper sentence to be imposed in the case at hand. The judge should\nfirst ask what the issues on sentencing are, and then find such facts as are\nnecessary to deal with those issues.[5]Mr. Kyere has been found guilty of one count\nof sexual assault that took place on July 21, 2013 at the home of D.G., the\ncomplainant.The jury must have concluded that there was sexual activity that\nevening without Ms. G.’s consent.[6]Ms. G. described three incidents of sexual\nactivity with Mr. Kyere that night.She said that he inserted his fingers into\nher vagina in the kitchen.She said that he forced her to perform fellatio.She\nalso said that he attempted to penetrate her vagina with his penis.[7]Mr. Kyere’s position, which the jury\nobviously rejected, was that all of the sexual activity between them was\nconsensual.[8]Counsel for both the Crown and for Mr. Kyere\nhave made extensive submissions as to what facts I should find.It is not\nsurprising that they take very different views.They both acknowledge that the\nsentence that I impose will depend very much on the facts as I find them to be.[9]It is the defence position that Ms. G.’s\ncredibility is questionable and that the jury must have rejected her evidence\nin relation to the four counts on which they acquitted Mr. Kyere.The defence\nposition is that I should find that at the end of the evening of July 21, 2013,\nafter they had been arguing, Mr. Kyere and Ms. G. went to the bedroom and\nengaged in the sexual activity he described.More specifically, he asks me to\nfind that he rubbed his penis near her vagina and attempted sexual intercourse.Counsel acknowledges that this was without Ms. G.’s consent.The defence says\nthat I should not accept that there was digital penetration earlier or forced\nfellatio.[10]I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that\nMr. Kyere engaged in the non-consensual sexual activity described by the\ncomplainant, including digital penetration, forced fellatio and attempted\nintercourse.[11]I listened carefully to Ms. G.’s description\nof digital penetration in the kitchen and her evidence as to what Mr. Kyere\nsaid to her at the time.It makes sense to me that he would have made comments\nsuggestive of her having had sexual activity earlier in the evening as I find\nthat he was jealous of her and very concerned about the possibility that she\nwas engaging in sexual activity with others.Her evidence was clear and\nconsistent and very persuasive.The sexual conduct that she described was\nconsistent with her description of Mr. Kyere as controlling and angry.[12]There is some confirmation of Ms. G.’s\nversion of events in that she described herself running out of the house\nscreaming after the digital penetration.Neighbours heard screaming both\nearlier in the evening and again later.I accept that as she fled following\nthe digital penetration, the complainant was screaming.Ms. G. also said that\nshe banged on a neighbour’s door for assistance, evidence that was confirmed by\nMr. Stephen.While Mr. Kyere agrees that Ms. G. ran outside and then came\nback, it is his position that they were arguing, but that there was no\nnon-consensual sexual activity.I do not accept his version as to what\nhappened.[13]I accept Ms. G.’s evidence as to what\noccurred in the kitchen and find that there was non-consensual digital\npenetration.[14]In relation to what happened upstairs, Ms. G.\ndescribed forced fellatio.Her evidence was extremely detailed and her\ndescription of Mr. Kyere’s movements and actions at the time of the force\nfellatio was not really challenged under cross-examination.There was a denial\nby him of any fellatio that night.[15]I accept that the forced fellatio occurred.In reaching this conclusion, I rely on the corroboration provided by the DNA\nevidence.That evidence, from expert Heather Shacker, was that there was a\nlarge amount of the complainant’s DNA on Mr. Kyere’s penis.She said that it\ncould come from bodily fluid.I acknowledge that she also agreed that it was\npossible for there to be a transfer of DNA through skin cells, possibly as Mr.\nKyere explained through mutual touching.However, it seems to me that it makes\nmore sense to conclude that this amount of DNA was transferred to Mr. Kyere’s\npenis when he forced fellatio on Ms. G. as she described.[16]Finally, I accept that there was\nnon-consensual attempted intercourse as described by Ms. G..There are two\naspects of the evidence that seem to confirm her version of events.First, she\nexplained that Mr. Kyere’s knees were on her bicep during this activity.The\nphotographs entered as exhibits show some evidence of redness in the area that\nshe describes having been held.Second, the neighbours called 911 shortly\nbefore the police arrival, which would correspond with the timing of this part\nof the sexual assault as described by Ms. G..[17]It is my conclusion that Mr. Kyere must be\nsentenced on facts that include three incidents of non-consensual sexual\nactivity with Ms. G. over the course of the one evening.Circumstances\nRelated to the Offender[18]Mr. Kyere is 37 years old.He was born in\nGhana and attended bible seminary there.He immigrated to Canada from Ghana in\n2008.He is a permanent resident in Canada but is not a citizen.[19]As a permanent resident, I am advised that\nthe conviction will result in Mr. Kyere being found to be inadmissible under s.\n36 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (“IPRA”). I am\ntold that Mr. Kyere can expect to become subject to a removal order under s.\n44(2) of the IPRA.Deportation then follows.An appeal of the removal\norder will not be available, under s. 64(2) of the IPRA, if the sentence\nI impose is greater than six months.[20]Mr. Kyere has four children.His son Eldad\nwas born in Ghana and came to Canada with him.Mr. Kyere married in Canada.That marriage has ended.He and his former wife have three children, ages 11,\n8 and 5, whom he supports.[21]Mr. Kyere is a trained and ordained pastor in\nthe Restored Christian Fellowship International Church.He worked as a pastor\nin Ghana and has continued to do so in Canada.He has established his church\nin Canada with congregations in Toronto and Ottawa.His work involves many\nspeaking engagements, leading congregations, and being present in his community\nwith youth groups, hospital visits and by providing spiritual guidance.[22]I have been presented with a large number of\ncharacter letters in support of Mr. Kyere.Without exception, he is described\nas a compassionate and caring man of great faith.Those who know him clearly\nhave a deep affection for him and view this criminal conduct as out of\ncharacter.The letters describe his openness with members of his church about\nhaving been charged and convicted.He has a wide circle of very supportive\nfriends, acquaintances and colleagues.I accept that he has a passion for his\nfaith and has dedicated a great deal of his time and effort to the well-being\nof others within his faith community and in the larger community.[23]The letters also indicate that Mr. Kyere has\nbeen publically stigmatized as a result of the offence and that both his\npersonal reputation and the reputation of his church have been affected.[24]Mr. Kyere comes before the court with no\ncriminal record.[25]Since his conviction, Mr. Kyere has been\ninvolved in counseling with a therapist, Mr. Peach.Mr. Peach is a registered\nsocial worker who specializes in providing treatment to men who have had\ndifficulty with the law as a result of their sexual behaviours.Mr. Peach\nindicates that Mr. Kyere presents as pro-social.He is able to articulate\nappropriate boundaries for intimate relationships and understands the need to\nobtain consent for sexual activity.There is a plan for treatment to continue\nto explore issues of communication, conflict resolution and healthy intimacy.[26]Mr. Kyere has served 9 days of pre-sentence\ncustody for which he will receive credit of 13 days, to be deducted from\nwhatever sentence is imposed.Victim\nImpact[27]During the trial, I heard the evidence of Ms.\nG. and the manner in which she described the impact of Mr. Kyere’s conduct on\nher.[28]Ms. G. has also provided a Victim Impact\nStatement.It was filed as an exhibit on sentencing and she read it in court\nat the sentencing hearing.[29]In her statement, Ms. G. describes the\nprofound manner in which the offence has affected and continues to affect her.She details the many effects of the sexual assault.They include recurring\nnightmares, sleeplessness, insomnia, difficulties in concentration, and panic\nattacks.She says that she isolated herself socially because she felt unable\nto socialize and be with others.She speaks of losing her self-confidence,\nself-esteem, dignity and self-respect.She describes her difficulties in\ntrusting others and connecting with them.[30]I accept that the sexual assault, occurring\nas it did in the context of what had been a loving domestic relationship, has\naffected the complainant deeply, and will continue to do so as she tries to\nmove forward.Positions\nof the Parties[31]Counsel each premised their positions as to\nthe length of incarceration that is appropriate on their positions as to what\nfacts I should find.[32]Given the facts that the defence invited me\nto find, Ms. McCabe-Lokos sought a sentence of six months jail.[33]The Crown position, based on facts that include\nthe three incidents of non-consensual sexual activity, is that a sentence of 3\n½ years is appropriate.[34]The Crown seeks a variety of ancillary\norders, all of which the defence agrees are appropriate.These include a s.\n743.21 non-communication order while Mr. Kyere is in jail, a DNA order, a\nweapons prohibition order and a SOIRA order.Applicable\nLegal Principles[35]Section 718 of the Criminal Code sets\nout the purposes and objectives of sentencing.[36]Both parties have filed casebooks setting out\nthe relevant principles and range of sentences.In cases of domestic violence,\nthe principles of denunciation, general and specific deterrence are paramount.At the same time, there must be some consideration of Mr. Kyere’s prospects for\nrehabilitation.[37]Given my conclusion respecting the facts, I\nfind that most of the cases provided to me by the defence are not particularly\nhelpful in setting out the appropriate range of sentence.That said, the cases\nprovided by the defence do reveal that for less serious sexual offences, the\nrange of appropriate sentence may go as low as a suspended sentence or a short\nperiod of incarceration.[38]The Crown says that the appropriate range for\nthis offence is from the upper reformatory range to a sentence of five or six\nyears.[39]I have reviewed below some of the cases that\nI found to be of assistance in reaching a fit sentence in this case.[40]In taking the position that she does, Ms.\nBandini relies on the Court of Appeal’s comments in R. v. Smith 2011\nONCA 564 (CanLII) at para 87.In that case, Epstein J.A. said that “in cases of sexual\nassault involving forced sexual intercourse with a spouse or former spouse,\nsentenced generally range from 21 months to four years”.[41]The other jurisprudence provided to me sets\nout a range of sentence, dependent on the particular facts of the offences and\ncircumstances of the offenders.[42]The Court of Appeal suggests in R. v. S.A.,\n2014 ONCA 1609 that a five year sentence was fit for an accused who took two acquaintances\non dates to secluded places and sexually assaulted them.Though he was 23 and\na first offender, the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had been in\nerror to conclude that the appropriate range of sentence in these circumstances\nincluded a reformatory sentence.[43]The Crown also refers me to R. v. A.S.H.,\n2015 ONSC 2792 (CanLII) in which Daley J. imposed a five year sentence for a 50 year old\nfound guilty by a jury of sexual assault and choking of his former common law\nwife.He had entered her garage and choked her to prevent her from seeking\nassistance.He used physical violence to control her and engaged in\nnon-consensual vaginal intercourse.She sustained numerous bruises and\nabrasions.[44]Also of assistance is the decision of Hill J.\nin R. v. D.J., 2010 ONSC 3910 in which he sentenced an offender to three\nyears incarceration after a guilty plea to sexual assault.The relationship\nbetween the offender and complainant was intermittent. One night, while they\nwere in bed together, he tried to initiate sexual activity which she did not\nwant.She left the room and he followed her.She locked the bathroom door and\nhe opened it.She began to scream and he wrapped a towel around her head,\nmaking her feel that she was choking.Despite her struggling and kicking, he\nforced her to have sexual intercourse.The offender had mental health and\naddiction issues, and a criminal record, though not for violent offences.Hill\nJ. acceded to the joint position of three years.[45]In R. v. W.R., 2012 ONSC 3118, Coats\nJ. imposed a sentence of twenty-two months for sexual assault.The complainant\nand accused had a four year common law relationship that was on and off.The\nsexual assault included touching the complainant’s breasts, putting his hand\nbetween her legs, digitally penetrating her, laying on top of her and\npenetrating her with his penis, all without her consent.The accused had no\ncriminal record and made some expressions of remorse, although Coats J. did not\nfind him to have accepted full responsibility for his actions.Aggravating\nCircumstances[46]Section 718.2(a)(ii) provides that evidence\nthat the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s spouse or\ncommon-law partner is an aggravating circumstance on sentence.There was\nconflicting evidence at the trial as to whether or not Mr. Kyere and Ms. G.\nwere still together at the time of the offence.It was his evidence that he\nviewed them as being together.It was her evidence that they had split up and\nthat she was dating someone else.[47]I adopt the view of Hill J. in R. v.\nBarilko, 2014 ONSC 1145 (CanLII) at para. 29 that s. 718.2(a)(ii) does not include a\nformer or ex-spouse or domestic partner (See also: R. v. A.S.H., at para.\n37).[48]I do not need to make a finding as to the\nstatus of the relationship between Mr. Kyere and Ms. G. on the date of the\noffence.It is clear to me that whether or not they were continuing in a\nrelationship, the offence had the “flavour of a domestic situation”.They were\nin regular communication.Mr. Kyere was financially supporting Ms. G..Mr.\nKyere’s actions, on his own evidence, were in furtherance of what he believed\nwas their relationship.In my view, it is an aggravating factor that Mr. Kyere\nused the physical violence that he did on Ms. G., whom he viewed as his\ndomestic partner.[49]I do not accept, however, the Crown’s\nposition that this sexual assault occurred in the context of a violent\nrelationship.I cannot accept that this was anything other than an isolated\nincident.I agree that the relationship had tensions and jealousy.But there\nis no evidence before me that proves that there were prior incidents of\nphysical or sexual violence that would amount to aggravating features on\nsentencing.[50]There are other aggravating factors\nincluding:a.That\nthe sexual assault occurred in the complainant’s home and thus violated her safety\nand security;b.That\nthe sexual offences occurred over a period of time between some point after\nmidnight and 2:30 a.m.;c.That\nthere were three separate incidents of different types of sexual violence.It was\nintrusive and involved digital penetration, forced fellatio and attempted\nsexual intercourse;d.That\nbeyond the sexual assaults, which necessarily involve violence, there was some additional\nphysical violence used by Mr. Kyere.He persisted despite her screaming and\nasking him to stop.Evidence of the physical violence may be seen by her\nphysical injuries, although I recognize that they were relatively minor;e.That\nthe impact of these offences on Mr. G. has been very significant.Mitigating\nFactors[51]Mr. Kyere says that he has been taking\ncounselling with a therapist, that this is ongoing and that it is evidence of\nhis recognition that his relationship with the complainant was unhealthy and\nthat counselling is appropriate.He says that this is a mitigating factor and\ndemonstrates initiative and a willingness to learn and gain insight.[52]The Crown’s position is that the counselling\nonly started after conviction and that the counselling is a signal of an\nattempt to garner mitigation rather than a true expression of remorse.[53]In my view, Mr. Kyere’s willingness to engage\nin meaningful counselling is an indication that he may have accepted some\nresponsibility for his conduct.He says he has been learning about healthy\nrelationships, which I see as a step towards ensuring that he never again\nengages in non-consensual sexual activity.However, when he spoke at his\nsentencing hearing, while Mr. Kyere said that he accepted the jury’s verdict,\nhe did not acknowledge that what he had done was wrong or show any insight\nabout the profound effect that his conduct has had on the complainant.[54]I conclude that Mr. Kyere’s willingness to\ntake counselling is a mitigating factor, though I find that his insight into\nthe effects of his actions are still somewhat lacking.[55]Mr. Kyere also asks me to find that his bail\nconditions have been such that he should receive some mitigation of sentence.He was arrested in July 2013 and has been under conditions of bail since then.[56]I observe that while Mr. Kyere was under a\nterm of house arrest, that term was only between midnight and 7:00 am.Although\nhe may have had to limit his international speaking engagements because of the\nrestriction imposed on him that precluded him from leaving the country, this term\nwas varied on consent when he sought the variation in May, 2015.[57]In my opinion, the restrictions on Mr. Kyere\nthat flow from his bail have been relatively minor.There is no evidence that\nhe suffered any undue hardship as a result of the bail conditions.Indeed, the\nevidence is to the contrary in that he appears to have continued his ministry\nand leadership role in his church in a very fulsome way.[58]I find the following further factors are\nmitigating:•Mr. Kyere has no criminal record;•Mr. Kyere has widespread support in the\ncommunity and has demonstrated to the many people to whom he ministers that,\nother than having committed this offence, he appears to be a person of strong\nmoral character who has given much back to his community and to his family;•Mr. Kyere has accepted the verdict, although\nI did not hear any expression of regret for his actions or and remorse in\ncourt;•This offence appears to me to be an isolated\nincident of sexual or physical violence in the relationship.Immigration\nConsequences[59]Submissions were made by counsel about the\nimpact of Mr. Kyere’s impending deportation on the appropriate sentence.[60]It is the defence position that if, based on\nthe facts as I find them to be, I conclude that a sentence in the lower\nreformatory range is appropriate, I should impose a sentence of six months less\na day so as to ensure that Mr. Kyere will have a right to appeal his removal\norder.I am told that this would enable him to make submissions as to why he\nshould not be returned to Ghana.Counsel highlights that Mr. Kyere’s\ndeportation will affect not only him, but also his three dependent younger children,\nwhom he supports financially. It will also affect his son Eldad, who has been\nliving with him since coming to Canada in 2008.In addition, his church will\nbe greatly affected by the loss of his leadership.[61]In R. v. Pham, 2013 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2013] 1 S.C.R. 739 at\nparas. 10-16, Wagner J., writing for the court, explained that collateral\nconsequences of a sentence include any consequence for the impact of the\nsentence on the particular offender.They may be taken into account as\npersonal circumstances, though they are not strictly speaking aggravating or\nmitigating factors.Collateral consequences related to immigration may be\nrelevant when tailoring sentence, but their significance must be determined in\naccordance with the facts of the case.The court emphasized that immigration\nconsequences “must not be allowed to dominate the exercise or skew the process”.The\nSentence to be Imposed[62]In my view, the appropriate sentence for Mr.\nKyere is one in the upper reformatory range.[63]As a result of this conclusion, I do not find\nthe fact that Mr. Kyere will be deported to be a collateral consequence that\nwarrants much consideration in determining a fit sentence.Certainly, in my\nview, the fact of the likely deportation and inability to appeal that decision\ncannot be the single factor that warrants departing from the appropriate range\nof sentence and imposing a sentence of six months or less.In my view, a\nsentence in the low reformatory range would, on the facts that I have found, be\nmanifestly unfit.[64]I accept that the range for this sort of sexual\noffence in a domestic context is quite broad, going from upper reformatory time\nto significant penitentiary time.Accordingly, I must consider all of the circumstances\nof the offence and offender in crafting a fit sentence that gives effect to the\nparamount sentencing principles.[65]In my opinion, while the offences are\nserious, the circumstances are not such as to require a penitentiary term.Mr.\nKyere is a first offender who otherwise appears to be a person of good\ncharacter and high moral standing.He is by all accounts an excellent father\nand committed pastor.His conduct on the night in question stands in contrast\nto the rest of his conduct, including that relating to Ms. G. though their\nrelationship.The effect of the conviction on him and on his family and church\nhave already been profound, and will be permanent.[66]Mr. Kyere has no criminal record or history.He has accepted the verdict and chosen to begin counselling.I find that his\nprospects for rehabilitation, as evidenced by the letter from Mr. Peach, are\nstrong.[67]Many of the cases relied upon by the Crown\nreveal offenders who have committed more serious offences with more aggravated\npersonal circumstances.I view this case as more similar to that described in W.R.\nthan any of the other cases provided, although in that case there was forced\nsexual intercourse and more significant injuries from the physical abuse.[68]I conclude that Mr. Kyere should be sentenced\nto a period of custody of 20 months in jail.From this, there will be 13 days\ndeducted for pre-sentence custody credit.[69]This will be followed by a term of probation\nfor two years.The statutory conditions in s. 732.1(2) shall apply.Additional terms are: that he report to a probation officer as required, that\nhe reside where directed, that he shall not contact, directly or indirectly\nD.G., that he shall not attend at any place known to be the residence, place of\neducation or place of employment of D.G., that he obtain counselling or treatment\nas directed, including for or about sexual offending.[70]In addition, the following ancillary orders\nare appropriate:a.a\ns. 743.21 non-communication order with the complainant while Mr. Kyere is in\ncustody;b.a\nfirearms and weapons prohibition order under s. 109(2)(a) for ten years and\nunder 2(b) for life;c.aprimary DNA order under s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code;d.a\nSOIRA order under s. 490.011(1)(a), 490.012(1) and 490.013(2)(b) for 20\nyears.Woollcombe J.Released: August\n18, 2017CITATION: R. v.

Synard (M.), 2006 NLTD\n101Date: 2006-06-28Docket: 200506T0160Between:Her Majesty the QueenandMichael SynardHandrigan, J.Counsel:Neil Smith, for Her Majesty the Queen;Jerome Kennedy, Q.C., for Mr. Synard.Introduction[1]Handrigan, J.: Michael Synard pleaded guilty to dangerous\ndriving causing death and dangerous driving causing bodily harm, both contrary\nto section 249 of the Criminal Code of Canada [seefootnote 1]. He was\ncharged with these offences because of an incident at Rushoon, NL on May28, 2004. Cory Kenway and Andrew Barry were passengers in a car ownedand operated by\nMr. Synard. Mr. Kenway was killed when Mr. Synard lost control of hisvehicle\nand it left the road. The vehicle ran along a ditch until it struck aculvert.\nIt flipped over, rotated in the air and landed upright on its wheels.Mr.\nKenway stayed inside the car, but Mr. Barry was thrown clear. Hesuffered\nbroken collar and tail bones and cuts and abrasions over his body.[2]I conducted a sentencing hearing and reserved my decision until\ntoday. The Crown and Mr. Synard generally agree that he should be imprisoned\nfor the offences but disagree on whether it should be served in jail or in the\ncommunity as a conditional sentence.The Issue:[3]What sentences fit Mr. Synard and the crimes he committed?The Law:General Principles:[4]Any discussion of sentences for criminal offences must start with\nthe statement of principles that appears in section 718 and following sections\nof the Criminal Code. It is unnecessary to reprint the statutory\nprovisions here. I note that the principles stated in those sections encompass\na broad spectrum of considerations from denunciation, through deterrence,\nreparation, rehabilitation and the general promotion of a sense of\nresponsibility in offenders for the losses experienced by their victims.[5]Also of concern are proportionality, the alternatives to\nincarceration where they are both available and appropriate, and the factors\nthat mitigate or aggravate the offence. The overriding consideration throughout\nthese sections is the protection of the public and how that can be achieved in\nthe context of the legislation and in the circumstances of the offence.\nUltimately the sentence must fit both the offence and the offender.[6]Communicating to accused persons and others of like mind that\nthey must refrain from criminal activity is one of the primary goals of\nsentencing. Denunciation is also important, especially for driving offences\nwhich cause death or serious bodily harm to third parties. It is generally felt\nthat deterrence and denunciation of criminal behaviour involving offences of\nthat magnitude can be achieved best if custody is ordered.The Offences:[7]Dangerous driving causing death and dangerous driving causing\nbodily harm are indictable offences. The former is punishable under section\n249(4) of the Criminal Code and the latter under section 249(3). Both\nare indictable offences and the maximum punishments are fourteen and ten year's\nimprisonment respectively. There are no minimum punishments.[8]Steele, J.A.'s general discussion of driving-related offences in R.\nv. Woodward (H.) [see footnote 2] is still relevant today. He provided a\ntest for \"dangerous driving\": \"... whether an ordinary, prudent\nbystander would have perceived an obvious risk that lives or safety would be\nendangered by the driving ... .\" Steele, J.A. quoted the Ontario Court of\nAppeal in R. v. Peda [see footnote 3] to support his view that \"...\n(e)vidence of alcohol consumption by the driver 'is always admissible to show\nthe cause of the dangerous driving and to negate any defence that the driving\nwas something beyond the control of the accused'\" [see footnote 4].[9]He also ranked driving-related offences in descending order of\ngravity:- Manslaughter;- Criminal negligence (causing bodily harm or death);- Dangerous driving (causing bodily harm or death); and,- Impaired driving (causing bodily harm or death).Driving Prohibition:[10]A driving prohibition may be imposed for dangerous driving, but\nit is not mandatory. The discretion to prohibit driving by those convicted of\ndangerous driving appears in section 259(2) of the Criminal Code. Any\nprohibition must not exceed ten years plus any imprisonment to which the\noffender is sentenced, if, as in this case, the offender is liable to\nimprisonment for more than five years but less than life.Conditional Sentences:[11]Section 742.1 of the Criminal Code provides for\nconditional sentences of imprisonment. It sets out four prerequisites to\nserving a sentence of imprisonment conditionally:- no minimum term of imprisonment applies for the offence;- a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years is\nimposed;- the conditional sentence would not endanger the community;\nand,- the conditional sentence would be consistent with the\nfundamental purposes and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to\n718.2 of the Criminal Code.[12]Conditional sentences are available for all offences that meet\nthese prerequisites.[13]Section 742.1 involves a two-stage analysis. First, the court\nmust consider and reject probationary measures or a penitentiary term as\nappropriate dispositions. If it views a custodial term of less than two years\nas an adequate punishment, the court must, in the second stage of the analysis,\ndetermine whether the custodial term can be served in the community. This\nentails considering whether the safety of the community would be endangered by\nallowing the accused to serve the sentence conditionally.[14]The possibility that the community will be endangered is measured\nagainst two criteria:- the risk that the accused will re-offend; and,- the gravity of the damage that the accused could cause if he\ndoes re-offend.[15]The risk assessment should also consider the risk of any criminal\nactivity, and not be limited \"...solely to the risk of physical or\npsychological harm to individuals\" [see footnote 5].[16]A conditional sentence of imprisonment will generally be better\nthan imprisonment in a jail at achieving the restorative objectives of\nsentencing: rehabilitation of the offender; reparations to the victim and the\ncommunity; promotion of a sense of responsibility in the offender; and,\nacknowledgment of the harm done to the victim and the community.[17]The Supreme Court of Canada said in R. v. Proulx (J.K.D.) [see\nfootnote 6] that Parliament made it clear to judges when it introduced\nconditional sentences that it wanted them to use jail terms less often as a\nsentencing sanction [see footnote 7]. The duration and degree of restriction\nimposed through conditional sentences are governed by the seriousness of the\noffence.[18]One final comment about conditional sentences is apropos of this\ncase: A conditional sentence can provide significant denunciation and\ndeterrence, but there are some cases, and this is one of them, in which the\nneed for denunciation or deterrence is so pressing that a jail sentence will be\nthe only suitable way to condemn the offender's conduct or to deter similar\nconduct in the future.Analysis:The Car Crash:[19]Michael Synard lives in St. John's, NL. [see footnote 8]He was\nin Rushoon, on the Burin Peninsula, on May 28, 2004 because hisgirlfriend, Sabrina Francis, was graduating from high school in thenearby community of\nMarystown on May 29. Synard, Robyn Power, and Synard's cousin, MarkLundrigan,\narrived at a shed belonging to Chad Moores in Rushoon, around 7:00 pm onMay 28. They came in a grey Plymouth Neon motor vehicle which Mr.Synard owned\nand operated. Other young people were already in the shed, a localgathering\nplace, when the three arrived. Mr. Synard and Mr. Lundrigan left shortlyafter\nthey arrived at the shed and went to a local convenience store in Mr.Synard's\nvehicle where they bought a dozen beer and brought it back to the shed.[20]Mr. Synard drank some beer after he came back to the shedbut the\namount he drank and the time over which he drank it are unclear. Mr.Synard and\nCory Kenway left Chad Moores' shed together between 8:20 and 8:30 pm todrive around the community in Mr. Synard's car. Andrew Barry got intothe rear\nseat of the vehicle just as it pulled away from the shed. Mr. Barry saton the\npassenger side of the rear, just behind Mr. Kenway and Mr. Synard drove.None\nof the occupants of the vehicle wore seat belts.[21]The road was dry, it was daylight and the sky was overcast as Mr.\nSynard drove down through Rushoon towards the harbour. En route to the harbour,\nMr. Synard encountered a sharp bend in the road, estimated to be approximately\n45 to 50 degrees. He made it successfully through the turn although he drove at\na high speed and had to travel in the outside lane of the turn, on his wrong\nside of the road, to do it.[22]Mr. Synard turned around near the wharf and headed back over the\nroad he had just traveled. He stopped briefly before the sharp turn and spoke\nto a group of teenage children on the side of the road. He was drinking beer in\nthe car at the time and set off shortly after he stopped, in the direction of\nthe turn, accelerating before he reached it.[23]Before they arrived at the turn, Mr. Kenway urged Mr. Synard to\nslow down and suggested that he could not make the turn at that speed. Mr.\nKenway believed that Mr. Synard would \"go through Mike Norman's\nhouse\" at the apex of the turn if he did not reduce his speed. Mr. Synard\nbrushed Mr. Kenway's caution aside with an \"I can make it\" and did\nnot relent as he continued toward the turn.[24]Of course, Mr. Synard did not make it. Instead his vehicle, which\nhad entered the turn in the inside and wrong lane of travel, skidded to the\noutside of the turn, crossed a driveway and dropped into a ditch. It careened\nalong the ditch until it struck a culvert and driveway approach which crossed\nthe ditch. The impact caused the vehicle to flip over. It rotated in the air,\nand eventually landed upright on its wheels.[25]Andrew Barry was thrown from the vehicle. He broke hiscollar and\ntail bones and had cuts and abrasions over his body. Cory Kenwayremained\ninside the vehicle and died from his injuries, during or shortly afterthe\ncrash. Mr. Synard was injured too. He complained of pains in his legswhen Constable\nFoley of the RCMP approached him at the accident scene around 9:00 pm.Mr. Barry's parents took him to hospital in their vehicle and Mr. Synardwent in\nan ambulance.[26]When Constable Foley approached him at the scene, Mr. Synard\nconfirmed that he owned the vehicle and had been driving it at the time of the\naccident. Mr. Synard acknowledged that he had been acting foolishly and\nstupidly when Constable Foley asked him what happened. He also offered an\nimmediate explanation for the cause of the crash: \"Driving too fast if you\nwants to know\". Just before leaving in the ambulance, Mr. Synard showed\nhis remorse for what happened when he said, \"Young fellows are always\ndoing foolish things; this is so wrong\".[27]The RCMP conducted a crash investigation. They determined that\nthe \"critical curve speed\" for the turn Mr. Synard was trying to\nnegotiate is 64 km/h. The \"critical curve speed\" is the maximum speed\nat which a vehicle can travel through a turn without braking and without\nsliding to the outside of the turn. The RCMP crash investigators also estimated\nthe speed at which Mr. Synard's vehicle had been traveling from the\n\"yaw\" marks it left on the pavement. They concluded that he may have\nbeen going as fast as 77 km/h but conceded that this speed was only an estimate\nand might not be accurate because certain conditions of their calculations had\nnot been met. It was clear, however, that Mr. Synard's vehicle exceeded the\ncritical curve speed. In effect, Mr. Synard was driving too fast to make the\nturn in the road.[28]The speed limit at the crash scene is 50 km/h. While there is no\nposted speed sign displaying that limit, there is a caution sign which local\nresidents posted asking drivers to \"Protect Our Children - Drive Slow -\n30\". Mr. Synard was familiar with the turn in the road. He had been in the\narea a week before the crash for a funeral. He had just driven through the turn\non his way toward the harbour in the same trip as the crash and had also passed\nthrough it at least twice earlier that day.[29]Blood drawn from Mr. Synard at the Burin Peninsula Health Care\nCentre at 10:22 pm on May 28, 2004 for diagnostic purposes was tested for\nalcohol content. It showed a blood/alcohol level of 21 mmol/L. Blood was also\ndrawn from Mr. Synard pursuant to a demand made on him by Corporal Ross of the\nRCMP at 11:23 pm on the same day for forensic use.[30]Analysis of the second sample showed a blood/alcohol content of\n68 mgs of alcohol in 100 mls of blood. It is unclear what Mr. Synard's\nblood/alcohol level was at the crash but the Crown and defence agree it was in\nthe range of 68 to 79 mgs of alcohol in 100 mls of blood, or at its highest,\njust fractionally under the \"legal limit\" of 80. It is also unclear\nwhether Mr. Synard's driving was impaired at the crash by the alcohol in his\nblood.Michael Synard:[31]Michael Synard is twenty-two years old. He was born onOctober 19, 1983 and lived in Terrenceville, NL most of his life. He hasone sibling, a\nsister who is three years older than him. Mr. Synard graduated highschool in\n2002 and attended the Burin campus of the College of the North Atlanticin 2003\nwhere he completed a metal fabrication course. Mr. Synard has beenemployed\nfull-time in St. John's with Beaver Truss, a division of Chester DaweLimited,\nsince he completed his post-secondary studies. His supervisor at BeaverTruss\ndescribes Mr. Synard as an \"excellent\" employee, who does good work,\ngets along well with staff and completes the work which is assigned tohim.[32]Mr. Synard is not married, but lives in a common-law relationship\nwith Sabrina Francis who is three years younger than him. They have been going\ntogether for four years and Mr. Synard describes their relationship as secure\nand stable and he notes that they rarely disagree or have any problems. He has\nenjoyed Ms. Francis' support since the accident two years ago, as well as the\nsupport of family and friends.[33]Mr. Synard has one prior conviction for a criminal offence. He\nwas convicted in Provincial Court at Grand Bank, NL on May 7, 2003 of causing a disturbance contrary to section 175 of the Criminal Code. He was\nfined $150 and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of $50. This conviction, of\ncourse, is largely unrelated to the driving-related offences for which he is to\nbe sentenced today.[34]More relevant is his conviction for speeding in Traffic Court on March 19, 2004. He breached section 110(3) (b) of the Highway Traffic\nAct [see footnote 9] (exceeding speed limit between 11 and 20 km/h), was\nfined and awarded two demerit points. Otherwise, Mr. Synard's driving and\ncriminal records are clean.The Victims:[35]Cory Kenway was seventeen years old when he died. He celebrated\nhis seventeenth birthday on April 19th, a little over a month before his death.\nCory was the youngest of three children of Randy and Julie Kenway. His brother,\nTodd, and sister, Jilliane, are his older siblings. Cory was completing Grade\n10 of the high school program. His mother said in her victim impact statement\nthat\"... [Cory] wasn't a grade A student, but he worked hard for the\ngrades he got\".[36]The Kenway family was torn apart by Cory's tragic death. Thirteen\nmembers of the family filed victim impact statements. They included Cory's\nmother, father, siblings, aunts, uncles and his maternal grandmother. Three of\nthe family, Cory's mother, father and sister asked, and I granted them,\npermission to present their victim impact statements orally during the\nsentencing hearing.[37]It is impossible to convey the profound grief and anguish\ndescribed in the victim impact statements or expressed by those who gave them\norally. It would be presumptuous for me to tell how they feel without repeating\ntheir words entirely. I want the Kenway family to know that I have taken the\nmeasure of their sorrow. I have witnessed their pain. I agree with them that\nnothing can replace the son, grandson, brother or nephew they lost. I sincerely\nhope they find relief when these proceedings are finished.[38]Nor can we forget Andrew Barry, the other passenger in Mr.\nSynard's car. Mr. Barry was thrown from the vehicle as it flipped over and\nsuffered cuts and abrasions to his body, as well as a broken collar bone and a\nbroken tail bone. Mr. Barry has made a good recovery from his injuries and\nthere is no indication he suffers any residual complaints.[39]Andrew Barry saw the danger in Michael Synard's driving as they\napproached the turn in the road at Mike Norman's house for the second time. He\nrecalled that Cory Kenway had a similar reaction and cautioned Mr. Synard that\nhe should slow down or he was \"... going to go through Mike Norman's\nhouse\". Mr. Synard ignored the caution his passengers urged on him and\ndrove into the turn with an over-confident and foolish, \"I can make\nit\" attitude.Principles of Sentencing:[40]Regulating human behaviour is at the core of criminal law.\nSociety is interested in the safety of its law-abiding citizens. It strives to\nshield the innocent from the dangers that accompany unlawful behaviour. Michael\nSynard killed Cory Kenway, seriously injured Andrew Barry and endangered the\nlives and safety of all members of the public who were or might have been on\nthe streets of Rushoon on May 28, 2004. Mr. Synard, against better judgment and\nignoring the cautions of his passengers, got behind the wheel of his car and\ndrove it under the influence of alcohol and at dangerous speeds throughout the\ncommunity.[41]His behaviour is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated. It must be\ncondemned and can never be countenanced. His actions may have taken only a few\nreckless moments of time but they have permanently scarred the Kenway family.\nMr. Synard must be deterred and other members of public who would do the same\nmust be informed by what happens to him that this behaviour attracts and\ndeserves severe denunciation.[42]There is less need to emphasize specific deterrence in this case\nthan in similar cases. Mr. Synard has been contrite from the beginning. He has\nalways acknowledged that he acted foolishly and that his behaviour was the\ndirect cause of the crash that killed Cory Kenway and injured Andrew Barry.\nThere is ample evidence of his remorse. When Constable Foley spoke to Mr.\nSynard at the accident scene and said to him, \"So you were the driver,\nwere you?\", Mr. Synard replied obtusely, but honestly: \"Driving too\nfast if you wants to know\". Just before Mr. Synard was taken from the\naccident scene by ambulance he pulled close to Constable Foley and said to him:\n\"Young fellows are always doing foolish things; this is so wrong\".[43]The pre-sentence report contains these comments about Mr.\nSynard's attitude towards the offences: \"... [T]he defendant appeared to\nbe sincere in his remorse for what had happened. He acknowledged that he was\ndriving too fast and that he is responsible for what occurred. At no time did\nhe minimize his guilt or blame the accident on extraneous factors. He expressed\nremorse for the pain he has caused others and stated that whatever the outcome\nin sentencing, he is prepared and will accept it\".[44]I asked Mr. Synard if there was anything he wanted to say at the\nend of the sentencing hearing. Mr. Synard responded by standing in the\nprisoner's dock, saying he was sorry for what happened, and apologizing to the\nmany members of the Kenway family who were in court. I am certain from his\nwords and demeanour that he genuinely regrets what he did and that his apology\nwas sincere.[45]But general deterrence and denunciation are critically important\nin this case. We are told constantly of the risks that speeding drivers,\nespecially those influenced by alcohol, present for the motoring and pedestrian\npublic. These drivers must be warned of the risks they take and the dangers\nthey pose and be deterred from driving their vehicles when they are either\nunable or simply unwilling to do so in a safe and prudent manner. The sentences\nI impose on Mr. Synard will serve to inform him and others like him of this, as\nwell as denounce the behaviour.Aggravating Factors:[46]The following factors worsen the incident for Mr. Synard:He was under the influence of alcohol.His speed exceeded the limit for the area, the critical curve\nspeed for the turn and was much faster than was prudent and manageable in the\ncircumstances.He ignored his passengers' cautions to slow down.He knew from experience that the turn where the crash happened\ncould not be negotiated safely at high speed but he discounted that danger.Cory Kenway died in the crash.Andrew Barry sustained serious injuries in the crash.Mr. Synard was convicted of speeding less than three months\nbefore the incident.Mitigating Factors:[47]The following factors moderate the seriousness of the incident\nfor Mr. Synard:He has been contrite from the beginning and his remorse is\ngenuine.He has always accepted responsibility for causing Cory\nKenway's death and Andrew Barry's injuries.He pleaded guilty to the offences and saved the Kenway family\nand Andrew Barry the angst of a trial.He is a young man, of good background, whose convictions for\ncausing a disturbance and speeding are the only blemishes on an otherwise clean\nrecord.He is a low risk to re-offend, because of his employment\nstatus, educational level, family and marital relationships, attitude towards\nthe offences and relatively minor previous record.The Sentences:[48]I noted earlier in these reasons that Crown and defence counsel\ngenerally agree that Mr. Synard should be imprisoned for the offences,\nespecially dangerous driving causing the death of Cory Kenway. I agree with\ntheir assessment of the appropriate penalty. That view is also consistent with\nGushue, C.J.N.'s statement in R. v. Murphy (S.) [see footnote 10] that\n\"... an offence for dangerous driving causing death would [normally]\nattract a term of imprisonment.\" Counsel disagree, as I also noted,\nwhether the imprisonment should be served in the community or in jail; nor are\nthey in full agreement about how long Mr. Synard should be imprisoned. I will\ndeal with where the sentence should be served shortly but turn now to the term.[49]Mr. Synard has been remorseful from the beginning and has\naccepted responsibility for the harm he caused to Andrew Barry and the Kenway\nfamily. I accept that his feelings are genuine. His response to the offences\ntells me that deterring Mr. Synard need not play a significant role in\nsentencing him although it cannot be ignored completely. Nor is there a need to\nemphasize Mr. Synard's rehabilitation - that is well underway. Thus, I place\nthe primary emphasis in sentencing Mr. Synard on general deterrence and\ndenunciation.[50]We are told constantly of the risks of dangerous driving for the\nmotoring and pedestrian public. A motor vehicle driven beyond its driver's\ncontrol can cause catastrophic and even lethal damage. The hypothesis is so\nself-evident that it begs the question of why it continues to happen. I have no\nanswer to that question but I do agree with Mr. Synard when he told Constable\nFoley at the accident scene that he had been acting foolishly and stupidly and\nthat is why the accident happened.[51]Of course, it is too late to realize the behaviour is foolish and\nstupid when one person is dead and another is seriously injured because of the\nbehaviour. And that is how sentences can serve the joint purposes of general\ndeterrence and denunciation. The public, people like Michael Synard in\nparticular, must be informed by sentences imposed on offenders that the\nbehaviour is senseless and risky; and they must be informed of this before the\nfact so they can curb their behaviour. It is all about consequences. The\ncriminal law provides one of the best opportunities to inform about\nconsequences. The sentences I will impose on Mr. Synard will serve that\ninstructional function as well as denounce the behaviour.[52]I sentence Mr. Synard to eighteen months in jail for dangerous\ndriving causing the death of Cory Kenway. I sentence him to six months in jail\nfor dangerous driving causing bodily injury to Andrew Barry. The sentences are\nto be served concurrently. Mr. Synard will get credit for the time he spent in\ncustody since the sentencing hearing, but not on a \"two-for-one\"\nbasis.Whether in the Community or in Jail:[53]Three of the four criteria for a conditional sentence are met in\nthis case: no minimum term of imprisonment applies for the offences; sentences\nof imprisonment of less than two years are imposed; and, permitting Mr. Synard\nto serve the sentences conditionally would not, because he is rated as a low\nrisk to re-offend, endanger the community.[54]But the fourth criterion is not met. Conditional sentences for\nMr. Synard would not be consistent with the fundamental purposes and principles\nof sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code. Let\nme explain.[55]R. v. Proulx [see footnote 11] is the leading case on\nconditional sentences. Lamer, C.J.C. noted that the \"... first three\ncriteria are prerequisites to any conditional sentence. These prerequisites\nanswer the question of whether a conditional sentence is possible in the\ncircumstances. Once they are met, the next question is whether a conditional\nsentence is appropriate\" [see footnote 12]. The propriety of the\nconditional sentence is assessed by referring to the \"... fundamental\npurpose and principles of sentencing set out in s. 718 to 718.2\" [see\nfootnote 13].[56]General deterrence and denunciation are at the heart of the\nsentencing provisions of the Criminal Code to which Lamer, C. J.C.\nreferred in Proulx. They are also of utmost importance in sentencing for\ndangerous driving. Mr. Synard confirmed the need for general deterrence and\ndenunciation when he confided to Constable Foley at the accident scene that\n\"... [y]oung fellows are always doing foolish things; this is so\nwrong\".[57]Lamer, C.J.C. agreed in Proulx that \"[i]ncarceration\nwill usually provide more denunciation than a conditional sentence\" [see\nfootnote 14]. He also agreed that \"[i]incarceration ... may provide more\ndeterrence than a conditional sentence\", although he cautioned judges to\nbe \"... wary ... of placing too much weight on deterrence when choosing\nbetween a conditional sentence and incarceration....\" [see footnote 15][58]The Proulx decision, aside from its discussion of\nconditional sentences, is relevant to Mr. Synard's case in another way. Proulx,\nlike Mr. Synard, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing death and\ndangerous driving causing bodily harm. He was an eighteen year-old male, with\nno previous driving offences, who drove a mechanically unsafe vehicle after\nconsuming alcohol.[59]Proulx drove the vehicle erratically and attempted to overtake\nanother vehicle. He collided with an oncoming vehicle and caused one death and\nserious injuries to himself and another person. The trial judge was satisfied\nProulx was rehabilitated and posed no danger to society. She held that\ndenouncing Proulx's conduct was of critical importance and declined to allow\nProulx to serve the eighteen month sentence conditionally.[60]The Manitoba Court of Appeal allowed Proulx's appeal from\nsentence and substituted a conditional sentence for the jail term. The Crown\nappealed to the Supreme Court of Canada which allowed the appeal and\nre-instated the sentence imposed by the trial judge. Lamer, C.J.C. noted\nthat the trial judge had emphasized denunciation and general deterrence when\nshe imposed a jail term of eighteen months on the accused. He acknowledged that\nthe trial judge had exercised her discretion appropriately and refused to\ninterfere with her decision.[61]I need say no more to highlight the obvious parallels between\nthis case and Proulx. Suffice it to say that the striking similarities to this\ncase make it a strong sentencing precedent.[62]I reject Mr. Synard's request to serve his sentences\nconditionally because of the need to stress general deterrence and\ndenunciation. Incarceration will provide the deterrent and denunciatory\nqualities that conditional sentences would not deliver in this case. As well, I\nam unable to reconcile a conditional sentence with the directives contained in\nsections 718 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code, nor, for that matter, with\nthe requirements of s. 718.1 of the Criminal Code, which stipulates that\na \"sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the\ndegree of responsibility of the offender\".[63]It would be to ignore the gravity of the offences of which\nMichael Synard has been convicted and the impact his actions have had on the\nvictims, as conveyed in the victim impact statements, to allow him to serve his\nsentences in the community. I am fully aware of the countervailing\nconsiderations: conditional sentences with stringent restrictive conditions are\npunitive by nature and carry a significant social stigma; no crime (subject to\nprerequisites one and two) is excluded from consideration for a conditional\nsentence; and, conditional sentences can sometimes achieve denunciation and\ndeterrence as effectively as incarceration.[64]But as Lamer, C.J.C. also said in Proulx: \"there\nmay be certain circumstances in which the need for denunciation is so pressing\nthat incarceration will be the only suitable way in which to express society's\ncondemnation of the offender's conduct\" [see footnote 16]. This, as I\nnoted earlier in these reasons, is one of those cases. Mr. Synard will serve\nhis sentences in a jail.Other Orders:DNA Order:[65]Dangerous driving, whether causing death or bodily harm, is a\nsecondary designated offence under section 487.04 of the Criminal Code. A\ncourt sentencing an accused of secondary designated offences may order DNA\nsamples to be taken from the accused if\" ... the court is satisfied that\nit is in the best interests of the administration of justice to do so\":\nsection 487.051(1) (b). That determination will be made by considering the\ncriminal record of the offender, the nature of the offence, the circumstances\nsurrounding its commission and the impact the order will have on the person's\nprivacy and security of the person. I have considered all of those factors and\nam satisfied that no DNA order is necessary in this case. I make none.Driving Prohibition:[66]An accused who is convicted of dangerous driving may also be\nprohibited from driving a motor vehicle under section 259 of the Criminal\nCode. The prohibition for dangerous driving is discretionary, not mandatory\nas it is for impaired driving (section 253) or refusing the breathalyzer\n(section 254).[67]The length of possible driving prohibition varies with the maximum\npunishment that can be imposed for the offence of which the accused has been\nconvicted. For dangerous driving causing death and dangerous driving causing\nbodily harm, the driving prohibition cannot exceed ten years plus any period to\nwhich the offender is sentenced to imprisonment: section 259(2) (b).[68]I made it clear earlier in these reasons that general deterrence\nand denunciation are of primary importance in sentencing Mr. Synard to\nimprisonment. Orders imposing driving prohibitions also serve important\ndenunciatory and deterrent functions in sentencing for driving-related\noffences. They are an additional way of expressing society's aversion for\nsenseless and destructive behaviour of offenders like Mr. Synard and of warning\nothers about consequences.[69]To achieve those goals in this case, I prohibit Mr. Synard from\ndriving a motor vehicle for five years for dangerous driving causing the death\nof Cory Kenway and two years for dangerous driving causing bodily harm to\nAndrew Barry. The prohibitions will run concurrently but will be in addition to\nthe terms of imprisonment I have imposed on Mr. Synard.Victim Surcharge:[70]I exempt Mr. Synard from paying the two victim surcharges of $100\nthat would normally apply under section 737 of the Criminal Code. I do\nthis because I have sentenced him to a jail term which will interrupt his\nemployment and adversely affect his income. I note as well the following\ncomment about Mr. Synard's finances, from the adult probation officer who\ncompiled the pre-sentence report: \"The defendant [Mr. Synard] described\ntheir [his and Sabrina Francis'] financial situation as a 'bit shaky' due to\nlegal fees and student loans\".Summary and Disposition:[71]Michael Synard pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing the\ndeath of Cory Kenway and dangerous driving causing bodily harm to Andrew Barry.\nExcessive speed was the primary cause of the car crash which killed one of Mr.\nSynard's passengers and seriously injured the other. Although Mr. Synard had\nbeen drinking beer before the accident, it could not be said conclusively that\nhis driving was impaired by the alcohol he drank.[72]The court imposed sentences of eighteen months for dangerous\ndriving causing death and six months for dangerous driving causing bodily harm\nto be served concurrently, as well as driving prohibitions of five and two\nyears, also to be served concurrently. The sentences of imprisonment are to be\nserved in jail and not in the community as conditional sentences. General\ndeterrence and denunciation are the primary concerns in sentencing Mr. Synard.\nHe is genuinely remorseful for his behaviour and has been contrite from the\nbeginning. There is less need to stress reform and rehabilitation. No DNA order\nwas made; and Mr. Synard was exempted from paying victim surcharges because he was\nsentenced to a jail term.Order:[73]In the result, I order that:1. Michael Synard serve eighteen months in jail for dangerous\ndriving causing the death of Cory Kenway.2. Michael Synard serve six months in jail for dangerous\ndriving causing bodily harm to Andrew Barry.3. These sentences are to be served concurrently.4. Michael Synard is prohibited from driving a motor vehicle\non any street, road, highway or other public place in Canada for five years\n(plus any period to which he is sentenced to imprisonment) for dangerous\ndriving causing the death of Cory Kenway.5. Michael Synard is prohibited from driving a motorvehicle\non any street, road, highway or other public place in Canada for twoyears (plus any period to which he is sentenced to imprisonment) for\ndangerous driving causing bodily harm to Andrew Barry.6. These driving prohibitions are to be served concurrently.7. No DNA samples be taken from Michael Synard.8. Michael Synard is exempt from paying victim surcharges for\neach of the offences of which he is convicted. Accused sentenced."}

Delafosse,2008 YKTC 82Date:20080612Docket:07-0045807-00458A07-00528Registry:WhitehorseIN THE TERRITORIAL COURT OFYUKONBefore:His Honour Judge FaulknerREGINAv.KEEFER PAUL DELAFOSSEAppearances:Jennifer GrandyElaine CairnsCounselfor CrownCounselfor AccusedREASONS FOR SENTENCING[1]FAULKNER T.C.J. (Oral):In this\ncase, Keefer Paul Delafosse has entered pleas of guilty to charges of\ntrafficking in marihuana, contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and\nSubstances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19, and a further charge of a breach of\nundertaking.[2]The circumstances of\nthe CDSA charge are that Mr. Delafosse was found by the RCMP in possession of\napproximately a pound of marihuana.Given the quantity of marihuana and given\nthat he also had scales, baggies, and was receiving phone calls from\nprospective clients, there is no question whatsoever that Mr. Delafosse was\nengaged in commercial, albeit low level, trafficking in marihuana.From all of\nthe circumstances it can be inferred that he was engaged in what is often\ncolloquially called a \"dial-a-dope\" sort of operation.[3]The breach charge arose\nafter his arrest on the drug matter and involved him breaching a condition of\nhis undertaking which required him to report to a bail supervisor.It should\nbe noted that after that failure he was ultimately arrested and served 13 days\nin custody prior to being again released on a rather compendious recognizance,\nwhich has now been in effect for a period of some seven months.[4]Mr. Delafosse entered\nguilty pleas and has no prior record.The Crown indicated that it was\nsuggesting a custodial sentence in the range of three to five months but\nconceded that a conditional sentence would be appropriate, having regard to the\nfavourable pre-sentence report and Mr. Delafosse's performance on his\nrecognizance that, as I have already indicated, has been in effect these last\nseven months.[5]For the accused, Ms. Cairns\nargued that I should consider imposing a conditional discharge.In my view, in\ncases of drug trafficking, even trafficking in so-called \"soft\" drugs\nsuch as marihuana, it would not be in the public interest to impose a discharge\nsave in exceptional circumstances, which I do not find to be present in the\ncase at bar.[6]There is, in my view,\nnothing in the material before me that takes this case out of the range of\nsentences which would customarily be imposed, and the range of sentence that\nwould customarily be imposed is precisely the sort of range for which the Crown\ncontends, or indeed even higher than the range for which the Crown contends.[7]There are some reasons\nto mitigate the range of sentence.Certainly, I have already mentioned the\nguilty plea and the lack of prior record, and certainly Mr. Delafosse's\nperformance, not initially but latterly, on his release conditions is worthy of\nnote.[8]In my view, having\nregard to the circumstances of the offence but giving full credit for the fact\nthat Mr. Delafosse has been compliant with his recognizance conditions, which\nwere extremely strict, amounting virtually to house arrest, I am going to\nimpose a sentence of imprisonment of four months.I will, however, allow that\nsentence to be served conditionally, subject to the following terms:1.You will keep the\npeace and be of good behaviour.2.You will report to\nthe Court as and when required.3.You will report\nwithin two working days to a conditional sentence supervisor and thereafter as,\nwhen and in the manner directed.4.You will advise the\nconditional sentence supervisor in advance of any change of name or address and\npromptly notify him of any change of occupation or employment.5.You will remain\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Court and not go outside of the Yukon without the prior written permission of your conditional\nsentence supervisor.6.You will diligently\nseek and maintain employment and provide your conditional sentence supervisor\nwith any information he requires in that regard.7.You will reside\nwhere directed by the conditional sentence supervisor.8.You will abide by a\ncurfew by remaining within your place of residence between the hours of 8:00\np.m. and 7:00 a.m. daily except with the prior written\npermission of your supervisor, or in the case of medical emergency.You must\npresent yourself at the door or answer the telephone in response to curfew\nchecks and your failure so to do will be a presumptive breach of this\ncondition.9.You will abstain\nabsolutely from the possession or consumption of alcohol or controlled drugs or\nsubstances except in accordance with a prescription given to you by a qualified\nmedical practitioner.You will provide samples of your breath or urine for the\npurpose of analysis upon demand by a peace officer or your conditional sentence\nsupervisor if either has reason to believe you may have failed to comply with\nthis condition.10.You will take such\ndrug assessment counselling and programming as directed by the conditional\nsentence supervisor.11.You will not have in\nyour possession any mobile communication device except with the written\npermission of your conditional sentence supervisor.[9]Counsel, there was some reference in the\nrecognizance and in the pre-sentence report to a no-contact with a Mr.\nRousseau.I presume that was the gentleman --[10]MS. GRANDY:At the second\narrest --[11]THE COURT:-- at the second arrest.[12]MS. GRANDY:Yes.[13]THE COURT:Any submissions on that?[14]MS. CAIRNS:I’ll just\nindicate that I spoke to -- or his counsel, Ms. Hill, approached me a short\ntime ago and indicated that should a no-contact condition be proposed, she\nwished to advise me that Mr. Rousseau had indicated he did not seek it.He\nwas not particularly desirous of a no-contact condition at this point, so it\nwas not for his benefit, if that was what the Court was considering.So that\nwas the information she conveyed to me.[15]THE COURT:I was not thinking it was\nfor Mr. Rousseau's benefit.I was --[16]MS. CAIRNS:No, sometimes\nit is.[17]THE COURT:Yes, well.[18]MS. CAIRNS:So I just\nwished to advise the Court of that.[19]MS. GRANDY:No, there is\nno suggestion that there was any pressure or otherwise to Mr. Rousseau.It was\nmore for --[20]THE COURT:He is an associate with\nwhom he should no longer associate.[21]MS.

The trial judgeexpressed some concern as to whether the proposed sentence could bejustified given the magnitude of the evasion, ordered a presentencereport, and adjourned the case for sentencing. On the date set forsentencing, the accused's lawyer was removed as counsel of record andthe sentencing was adjourned. On the next date, the accused applied towithdraw his guilty plea, arguing that he had been led by his formercounsel to believe that the court was bound to accede to the jointsubmission.Held, the application should be dismissed.For a guilty plea to be valid, the accused must be aware of theconsequences of the plea, including the potential penalties which mightbe imposed. The court must be satisfied that, at the time the plea wasentered, the accused was aware that the court was not bound by thesubmissions of counsel but rather had a duty to impose a sentence whichit considered to be fit. Accordingly, if the accused's evidence raisedeven a doubt that his understanding at the time of his plea was as hedescribed it, then he should be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea.The accused's claim that he had been misinformed as to the consequencesof his guilty plea was totally unsupported by evidence. It wassignificant that the accused's former lawyer was not called as awitness, despite the fact that it was brought to his present counsel'sattention that the application would be strengthened by such evidenceand that an adjournment was granted to permit this to be done. Theaccused was not a credible witness.A joint submission shouldbe rejected only where the court is of the view that the proposedsentence is plainly wrong or that its acceptance would be contrary tothe public interest. The joint submission in this case had to becharacterized in that way. Its acceptance would bring the administrationof justice into disrepute.The accused was a 47-year-old firstoffender in poor health. The offence which he committed was a seriouscriminal offence. His presentence report disclosed that the College ofPhysicians and Surgeons had revoked his licence to practise medicine in1993 after the Discipline Committee found him guilty of professionalmisconduct by failing to maintain the appropriate standard of care forhis patients for whom he had prescribed anabolic steroids, falsifyingmedical records, recording false diagnoses, billing for services he hadnot provided and submitting false accounts to the Workers CompensationBoard. In imposing its penalty, the Discipline Committee stated that theaccused had shown that he was capable of persistent devious behaviour,that he was clearly avaricious, and that he showed no sign of remorse orcontrition. It was not possible to justify a non-custodial sentence forincome tax evasion on this scale over such a protracted period of time.The offence was motivated by greed, and the fact that the accused wasable to pay a substantial monetary penalty because he had managed toamass considerable wealth, at least partly at the expense of thosemembers of the public who dutifully pay their taxes, did not make a finethe appropriate sentence. Income tax evasion is one of those offenceswhere general deterrence is the most important consideration. Theaccused was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and fined $374,058 or12 months consecutive in default of payment.APPLICATION to withdraw a guilty plea.\nCases referred toKnox Contracting Ltd. v.

Div. J.: -- Dr. Artinian pleaded guilty to acharge of wilfully evading $374,058 in income taxes by failing toreport income of $1,222,274 during the taxation years 1988, 1989and 1990, contrary to s. 239(1) of the Income Tax Act, S.C.1970-71-72, c. 63, as amended. Following the guilty plea, theCrown and defence joined in a submission that the appropriatesentence would be a fine equal to the amount of the taxes evaded,and probation for one year to include community service.The facts of the offence were presented by way of an agreedstatement which was filed. According to that summary of thefacts, in the specified three years, Dr. Artinian failed toreport income in the amount of $204,802 from O.H.I.P., $426,834from the Workers' Compensation Board, and interest income inthe amount of $383,840 from investments and Canada SavingsBonds. As well, the accused admitted overstating hisprofessional expenses by $206,798, with the result that histaxable income was reduced by that amount. While claiming falseexpenses is not the same as failing to report income, bothparties agreed that it should be treated in that way to make upthe total of $1,222,274 \"unreported income\" alleged in thecharge.The case against the accused, as conveyed by the agreedstatement of facts, was quite straightforward. Certain O.H.I.P.remittances paid directly into Dr. Artinian's personal bankaccounts were simply not reported by him as income. Similarly,cheques paid by the W.C.B. were deposited by the accused butnot reported. The overstated expenses consisted of bad debtwrite-offs for unpaid billings to law firms and insurancecompanies for medical reports where such payments had neverbeen reported as income, another fictitious claim in 1990 of abad debt of $70,000 from O.H.I.P. (which was part of $700,000in overbillings paid by O.H.I.P. and later withheld by them in1991), and a further $114,148 claimed as a bad debt from theW.C.B. which had never been reported by him as income. Withrespect to his interest income, the accused reported only thosepayments from sources which had issued T5 information slips tohim. The other payments received by him, totalling $383,840 inthe three years, was not declared by Dr. Artinian at all.Through his counsel, the accused admitted the accuracy ofthose facts and stated that he had nothing to add to them.Based on his guilty plea and those admitted facts, a finding ofguilt was made.Notwithstanding the joint submission, I expressed someconcern as to whether the proposed sentence could be justifiedfor income tax evasion of this magnitude. Accordingly, I askedcounsel for other cases which would support the position theywere taking, and some authorities were filed at that time. Inorder to obtain more information concerning the accused'scircumstances, I ordered a presentence report, and the case wasadjourned for sentencing.The presentence report was duly prepared, but on the date setfor the sentencing, the accused's lawyer, with Dr. Artinian'sconsent, was removed as counsel of record and the sentencingwas adjourned. On the next date, represented now by newcounsel, Mr. Galluzzo, Dr. Artinian brought an application towithdraw the guilty plea that he had entered.The application to withdraw the guilty pleaThe court clearly has a discretion to permit the withdrawalof a guilty plea if there is a valid ground for doing so: seeR. v. Adgey (1973), 1973 CanLII 37 (SCC), [1975] 2 S.C.R. 426, 13 C.C.C. (2d) 177.Mr. Galluzzo submitted that the accused should be permitted towithdraw his guilty plea here because he had neither understoodthat the court was not bound by a joint submission by the Crownand the defence, nor that the court had a residual discretionto impose the sentence that it considered to be required.In R. v. T. (R.) (1992), 1992 CanLII 2834 (ON CA), 10 O.R. (3d) 514 at p. 519, 17 C.R.(4th) 247 at p. 252 (C.A.), Doherty J.A. stated:To constitute a valid guilty plea, the plea must be voluntaryand unequivocal. The plea must also be informed, that is, theaccused must be aware of the nature of the allegations madeagainst him, the effect of his plea, and the consequences ofhis plea . . .For purposes of this application, I will assume that therequired awareness of the \"consequences\" of the plea includesan appreciation of the potential penalties which, following theguilty plea, might be imposed upon the accused. I also thinkthat the court should be satisfied that at the time the pleawas entered, the accused was aware that, regardless of thesubmissions made by counsel, the court had a duty to impose asentence which it considered to be fit.I appreciate that the test may have been more narrowlyconstrued on occasion in the past. For example, in R. v.Corcoran (1967), 2 C.R.N.S. 160 at pp. 164-65, 53 M.P.R. 345(N.S. Co. Ct.), O'Hearn Co. Ct. J. stated:I am satisfied that at the time the accused appeared in courthe understood the nature and effect of a plea of guilty tothe charge in question. The word \"effect\" in this contextdoes not refer to the consequences of the plea, but to thefact that it binds the accused so that he cannot deny thefacts that he has accepted by his plea and that it rendershim subject to legal penalties.. . . . .Usually the fact that a conviction entails \"unexpectedconsequences\" is not a ground for allowing a plea to bewithdrawn.That position appeared to be consistent with what had beenstated in R. v. Bamsey, 1960 CanLII 35 (SCC), [1960] S.C.R. 294 at p. 300, 125 C.C.C.329 at pp. 334-35, where Ritchie J. quoted with approval thefollowing observations made by Sidney Smith J.A. in R. v.Sanders (1953), 106 C.C.C. 76 at p. 82, 16 C.R. 378 (B.C.C.A.):On the face of it, there would seem something anomolous inthe law if it allowed an accused person, with fullunderstanding, to plead \"guilty\" before a Magistrate andthen, because he found the sentence unexpectedly heavy, orhad unexpected consequences, or for some other reason havingnothing to do with the merits, allowed him to appeal to thecounty court and, without explanation, blandly plead \"notguilty\", and thus obtain a full trial on the merits. Thatseems to be playing fast and loose with the administration ofjustice.(Ritchie J.'s emphasis)I think it is now accepted, however, that the \"fullunderstanding\" referred to encompasses an awareness of thepotential penalties and the discretion of the court concerningsentence.Dr. Artinian was called as a witness on the application. Hetestified that prior to pleading guilty, he had been led by hiscounsel to believe that the joint submission arranged withCrown counsel was a \"done deal\" to which the court was bound toaccede. The accused was not cross-examined by Crown counsel,who apparently viewed the application as a matter to be decidedby the court on a non-adversarial basis. I think that if theaccused's evidence raises even a doubt that his understandingat the time of his plea was as he described it in his evidence,then he should be permitted to withdraw his guilty plea.The accused's former lawyer was not called as a witness toconfirm Dr. Artinian's evidence. It was brought to Mr.Galluzzo's attention that the application would certainly bestrengthened by such evidence, but notwithstanding theadjournment to permit this to be done, the accused did not callthe evidence of his previous counsel.While there is clearly no hard and fast rule as to what isrequired by way of supporting material in these circumstances,it seems to me that where an accused is attempting to escapethe consequences of his guilty plea by alleging that he wasmisled as to the effect or consequences of his plea because hislawyer failed to advise him of the possible penalties he couldincur, the absence of evidence from the accused's formercounsel to corroborate the accused's testimony is significant.For example, in R. v. Gruzecki, [1991] B.C.J. No. 2366 (C.A.),Hinds J.A. observed that an assertion that the accused hadpleaded guilty because he had been unduly pressured by hislawyer was, in the absence of affidavit material from theformer lawyer, \"not satisfactorily explained\".In this case, instead of calling the former lawyer as awitness, Mr. Galluzzo filed, with the Crown's consent,correspondence between the previous counsel and both Dr.Artinian and himself. Mr. Galluzzo's submission was that sincehe had brought to the lawyer's attention the accused'sallegation that he had been misled or uninformed as to theeffect of a joint submission, the lawyer's failure to deny itin subsequent letters confirmed the allegation. The furthersubmission was that the previous counsel demonstrated in hiscorrespondence his inadequate representation of the accusedand, more generally, his lack of familiarity with the criminallaw, by such statements in a letter following the guilty pleathat he would have to do research to determine if a sentenceimposed after a rejected joint submission could be appealed.I do not draw the inference from the filed correspondencewhich the accused seeks. In fact, I do not think that itaddresses the issue at all. While it is certainly embarrassingto read what the lawyer undoubtedly intended to be privatecommunications to his client concerning his negotiations andunderstanding with the Crown, and about such matters as thepayment of his own fees, I do not think that the lettersestablish incompetence on the part of the counsel or, moreparticularly, an admission that the accused was not properlyadvised as to the effect of a guilty plea. To the contrary, thecorrespondence suggests a careful effort on the lawyer's partto keep the accused fully informed of developments and toprovide appropriate legal advice concerning his options.In reply to a letter from Mr. Galluzzo, dated January 9,1995, informing the previous counsel that the accused wasalleging that he had not been \"fully and properly apprised ofall the possible consequences of his guilty plea\", the formercounsel wrote, in a letter dated January 13, 1995, filed as anexhibit on the application, \"I not only do not want to see theinterests of Dr. Artinian and Mrs. Artinian [the accused'smother and co-accused] prejudiced in any way, but I am alsoprepared to cooperate towards the end that the best practicallypossible result for them be reached\". Despite his offer to co-operate to achieve the best result for the accused, theformer counsel was not called to give sworn testimony as anofficer of the court, and as a barrister bound to comply withcertain ethical standards, that could directly confirm orrefute the accused's allegation.The correspondence sent by the previous lawyer to the accusedboth immediately before and after the guilty plea was filed onthe application as well. The letter dated November 2, 1994,summarized the negotiations that had occurred the day beforewith representatives of the Department of Justice concerningthe criminal and civil aspects of the situation involving theaccused, his mother and Revenue Canada. It is not necessary torepeat the details, but it was evidently stated that Dr.Artinian and his mother had in excess of $6 million in Canada,and that at one time $840,000 was agreed upon as an appropriatefine, although the Crown later reduced the amount to somethingbetween $340,000 and $370,000. The lawyer stated that Crowncounsel had been persuaded that a jail term would not be\"advisable\", suggesting at least that the accused had beeninformed that the offence was punishable by imprisonment. Thelawyer also referred to the meeting ending with a \"deal\"acceptable to both parties that involved the accused and hismother each presenting a cheque in the amount of $1 million onNovember 4, 1994, the date the guilty plea was to be entered.The letter to Mr. Cullen, also dated November 2, summarized theterms of their \"settlement\", with specific reference to thejoint submission on sentence that was to be made.In a letter to the accused dated November 4, 1994, whichreferred to correspondence the day before which was not filed,the lawyer reported the new position to be taken by the Crown,involving fewer hours of community service than had beendiscussed previously, and the consent amendment to be made tothe count on which the Crown would proceed. The lawyer wrote,\"I advised you that I will say as little as possible to theCourt, and that you should do likewise\". If, as the accused nowclaims, it was conveyed to him that the court would have norole to play apart from rubber-stamping the \"done deal\", it isnot clear why the lawyer would provide advice as to how littleshould be said to the court, or why the accused would not drawthe obvious inference that what was said might affect whathappened.The letter dated November 6, 1994, from the previous counselto the accused, outlining the events the day the guilty pleawas entered and canvassing future possibilities, was referredto by Mr. Galluzzo for purposes of challenging the quality ofthe legal representation received by Dr. Artinian at that time.The letter described the proceedings before Judge Sparrow,where the case had initially been sent for the guilty plea onNovember 4. When the accused and his counsel arrived in hercourtroom, according to the hearsay account in the letter, Mr.Cullen was dealing with another income tax evasion caseinvolving \"only $20,000\". The lawyer stated that \"Judge Sparrowhad balked at the fact that Cullen did not ask for a jailsentence, but that Cullen finally prevailed\". Why witnessingsuch a proceeding, if it was accurately reported in the letter,would not have conveyed to the accused that the court was notbound by counsel's submissions was not the subject here of anyevidence or argument.The lawyer's letter also summarized the pre-arraignmentdiscussions which occurred before Judge Sparrow when the casewas called. A transcript of those proceedings was also filed onthe application. After the Crown had briefly set out theallegations and indicated the position he would be taking onsentence, Judge Sparrow expressed her concern about thatposition, stating that the amount involved \"strikes me asincredibly high for a non-custodial sentence\". She invited theCrown to consult with a more senior colleague in the courtroom,and indicated that she would send the case back to the courtthat sets dates for federal matters, so that it could bebrought back before someone else with case-law to support thejoint submission. Defence counsel stated that he understood herconcerns, but referred to the extensive deliberations that hadoccurred involving people who were more informed of all of thecircumstances. Judge Sparrow related her opinion that jailterms were usually imposed in cases far less serious than thisone. She stated that while she was not necessarily rejectingthe joint submission, she was asking for more. The Crownundertook to find some case-law during the lunch recess. In theafternoon, Judge Sparrow had the matter traversed to the\"assist\" court where I was sitting.In my view, anyone listening to that discussion before JudgeSparrow, particularly an accused as intelligent andsophisticated as Dr. Artinian, could not have been left withany mistake as to the court's discretion to reject a jointsubmission. Mr. Galluzzo submitted that the accused might havethought that the case was traversed because Judge Sparrowconsidered the joint submission unacceptable, and that it wasbeing sent to be dealt with by a different court which wouldaccept it. The accused gave no evidence that that was hisbelief, and I frankly have great difficulty characterizing thesuggestion, in the absence of credible evidence of such amisperception, as other than extremely far-fetched.Based on the material before me as to the accused's characterand conduct, I do not consider him to be an honest or crediblewitness, and I do not believe his unsupported evidence thatthere was any misunderstanding on his part as to theconsequences of his guilty plea or the court's authority toimpose a sentence that differed from the joint submission ofcounsel. The accused was not misled by the position being takenby the Crown, so I think the situation here is quite differentfrom R. v. V. (D.), an unreported judgment of MacDonnell Prov.Div. J., dated March 21, 1994, which Mr. Galluzzo cited. WhileI think that Dr. Artinian expected that the court would likelyaccept the joint submission, in my view, the judgment in R. v.Rubenstein (1987), 1987 CanLII 2834 (ON CA), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 91, 24 O.A.C. 309 (C.A.),applies to the facts here. Zuber J.A. stated at p. 94:It is argued in this court that when a trial judge regardsthe joint submission with respect to sentence as unreasonableor in error he should so inform an accused and give thataccused an opportunity to withdraw the plea. It is arguedthat to do otherwise would be fundamentally unfair since theaccused in the position of an appellant offers the plea inthe expectation that the joint submission will be followed.It was further argued that the joint submission was the quidpro quo for the pleas of guilty and therefore the failure ofthe trial judge to heed the joint submission entitled theaccused to be restored to his original position, i.e., hecould force the Crown to prove the case against him in full.I disagree with this proposition. The power of a trialjudge to impose a sentence cannot be limited to a jointsubmission, and the joint submission cannot be the basis uponwhich to seek to escape the sentencing judge when it appearsthat he chooses to reject the joint submission.The other ground for allowing the guilty plea to be withdrawnraised initially by Mr. Galluzzo was that the accused had notintended to admit the wilfulness of his tax evasion, anessential element of the offence. Reference was made to theaccused's statements to the probation officer, as reported inthe presentence report, that his failure to report income was\"an oversight, not a deliberate act\", and that because hewas seeing 250 patients a day, he was \"disorganized\". Thestatements were similar to his former counsel's representationsby way of mitigation following the guilty plea that the accusedwas \"consumed by the practice of medicine\" and paid littleattention to the bookkeeping. At that time, however, inresponse to a direct inquiry from the court, defence counselstated expressly that the accused was not disputing that he hadevaded the taxes knowingly and wilfully, and that there was noissue concerning that element of the offence.Likewise, Mr. Galluzzo, on behalf of his client, explicitlyabandoned this ground as a basis for allowing the withdrawal ofthe guilty plea. The accused's statements to the probationofficer were left to be viewed simply as an attempt by theaccused to minimize his conduct, and were not to be taken as adenial of one of the essential elements of the offence to whichhe pleaded guilty.Mr. Galluzzo did indicate at that time that there might stillbe an issue as to the quantum of income taxes he wilfullyevaded. On a subsequent occasion, however, Mr. Galluzzoexpressly stated that his client was not disputing the amountof the evaded taxes which he had already admitted.I am satisfied that the accused is attempting \"to play fastand loose with the administration of justice\", to use thephrase from Bamsey, supra, and that there is no valid ground topermit the withdrawal of the guilty plea. The application isdismissed, and on the basis of the finding of guilt alreadymade, a conviction is entered.SentenceAs already stated, there was a joint submission that theappropriate sentence would be a fine of $374,058, the sameamount as the income taxes evaded, and probation with communityservice. The Court of Appeal made it clear in Rubenstein,supra, at p. 94, that the court is obliged to give a jointsubmission serious consideration. I accept that a jointsubmission should be rejected only where the court is of theview that the proposed sentence is plainly wrong or that itsacceptance would be contrary to the public interest: see R. v.Kirisit (Ont. C.A., August 9, 1993, [1993] O.J. No. 1825); R. v.Bosklopper (Ont. C.A., January 18, 1995, [1995 O.J. No. 4125),both cited by Mr. Galluzzo. Regrettably, I think that the jointsubmission that has been made here must be characterized in thatway. To accede to it would require the court to disregard theappropriate principles of sentence and, in my view, itsacceptance would bring the administration of justice intodisrepute.The offence committed by the accused must be regarded as aserious criminal offence.

(2d) 241, 120 C.C.C. 44at p. 47 (C.A.):. . . we are convinced that to make false or deceptivestatements in a return filed or made as required by eithertax Act is to commit a crime, and a serious crime, ratherthan to contravene a statutory law not ordinarily regarded ascriminal.Cory J. continued, at pp. 349-50 S.C.R., pp. 125-26 D.L.R., asfollows:It is fitting and appropriate that the s. 239 offences beconsidered as criminal law. The Income Tax Act is a majorsource of funds for the federal government. Its provisionsare applicable to most adult Canadians. The vast majority paytheir income tax by way of payroll deduction with little orno opportunity for evasion or misstatement. Those who doevade the payment of income tax not only cheat the state ofwhat is owing to it, but inevitably increase the burdenplaced upon the honest taxpayers. It is ironic that those whoevade payment of taxes think nothing of availing themselvesof the innumerable services which the state provides by meansof taxes collected from others.The entire system of levying and collecting income tax isdependent upon the integrity of the taxpayer in reporting andassessing income. If the system is to work, the returns mustbe honestly completed. All taxpayers have the right to knowthat it is a criminal violation to commit any of the offencesdescribed in s. 239.As with any other crime, the appropriate sentence willreflect the gravity of the actual offence committed, as well asthe accused's particular circumstances, having regard to theoverall objectives of deterrence, rehabilitation and what isnow usually described simply as \"punishment\". It seems to methat income tax evasion is one of those offences where generaldeterrence is the most important consideration, using that termin the sense explained by Zuber J.A. in R. v. Ramdass (1982), 2C.C.C. (3d) 247 at p. 249, 18 M.V.R. 256 (Ont. C.A.), where hequoted as follows [R. v. Roussy, Ont. C.A., December 15, 1967]:. . . in a crime of this type the deterrent quality of thesentence must be given paramount consideration and here I amusing the term \"deterrent\" in its widest sense. The sentenceby emphasizing community disapproval of an act and brandingit as reprehensible has a moral or educative effect andthereby affects the attitude of the public. One then hopesthat a person with an attitude thus conditioned to regardconduct as reprehensible will not likely commit such an act.In R. v. Zink, B.C.C.A., May 15, 1992, Court File CA014179,Hinds J.A., at p. 4, accepted that income tax cases should notbe treated as separate and distinct matters, but that theordinary principles of sentencing should apply. In R. v.Griffin, [1992] O.J. No. 4005 (Gen. Div.), Feldman J. imposed asentence of 12 months' imprisonment and probation for threeyears where an accountant pleaded guilty to preparing returnswith false claims totalling more than $1 million. At p. 6, HerHonour stated:It is clear that the primary principle of sentencing in thiscase must be general deterrence . . . it is clear that incases of this sort, a significant period of incarceration isrequired in order to ensure that it is well understood inthis community that this type of activity is illegal and willnot be condoned.The parties initially sought to justify the joint submissionmade in this case not on the basis that there were exceptionalcircumstances that warranted an unusual sentence, but that theproposed sentence was consistent with dispositions made insimilar cases. When the Crown proceeds summarily, pursuant tos. 239(1)(f) and (g), the offence is punishable by a fine of upto double the evaded taxes and by imprisonment for two years.Counsel provided the following cases where fines had beenimposed or approved: R. v. Fogazzi (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 572,93 D.T.C. 5183 (C.A.), where the court imposed a fine of$100,000, after a joint submission, for evading $120,000 oftaxes 14 years earlier; R. v. Munk, [1981] Ont. D. Crim. Sent.7330-01, where LeSage Co. Ct. J. imposed a fine in the amountof $26,591, equivalent to the taxes evaded; R. v. Donutland byGirls \u0026 Co., [1986] Ont. D. Crim. Sent. 7330-01, where SalhanyD.C.J. affirmed an unspecified fine which was 50 per cent ofthe taxes evaded; and R. v. Coffen, Ont. Prov. Div., April 16,1993, unreported, where Silverman Prov. Div. J., after trial,imposed a fine twice the $73,000 in income taxes which had beenevaded.In an unpublished paper, \"Observations on Sentencing in'White Collar' and 'Blue Collar' Fraud Cases\", presented byD.D. Graham Reynolds, Q.C., to the August 1994 FederalProsecutors' Conference in Ottawa, it was suggested that therehad recently been a trend toward more severe sentences forincome tax evasion involving very large amounts. Mr. Reynoldsalso cited such older decisions as R. v. Mirando, Ont. H.C.J.,July 8, 1982, Evans C.J.H.C., unreported, involving unreportedincome of $1.2 million over seven years which had resulted inthe evasion of $535,000 in taxes. In imposing a sentence of twoyears' imprisonment following a guilty plea, the Chief Justicestated:The public, of course, suffers when a man defrauds thegovernment of over half a million dollars. Somebody else hasto make up that shortfall and it falls upon every citizen.That is why the public has an interest in seeing that thosewho defraud the government pay the appropriate penalty, andthat penalty must be a reflection of the revulsion whichsociety feels. Public confidence has to be maintained. Theordinary Joe in the street, whose taxes are deducted atsource, or the small businessman who must report his taxes,certainly gets quite a shock when he finds that someone asintelligent as [the accused] defeats the government of overhalf a million dollars.In a survey of income tax evasion cases from across the countrybetween 1990 and 1994, Mr. Reynolds referred to a number ofcases where penitentiary or substantial reformatory sentenceswere imposed. Among the cases with similarities to some aspectsof this case were two years for a Belleville tax preparer(Woodbeck) in 1992 where $317,000 in taxes had been evaded,six months and a $110,000 fine in 1992 for a Toronto escortservice operator (St. Denis) who failed to pay $110,000 taxeson unreported income over a three-year period, six months for aWindsor man in 1993 (Washburn) who evaded $268,000 in taxes asa result of a fraudulent tax shelter scheme, and a three-monthjail term for a Scarborough dentist (Zeck) in 1992 for evading$82,417 in income taxes after failing to file a return forthree years.It appears that there is considerable disparity in thesentences which have been imposed, and while courts undoubtedlystrive for consistency in principle, it is clear that theparticular circumstances of different cases can lead to quitedifferent results. When the joint submission was presented,nothing was said to suggest that there was anything unusual inDr. Artinian's circumstances. The submission that a fine andcommunity service would be appropriate implied nothing morethan that he was wealthy and that, as a doctor, he would be ina position to provide socially beneficial services. Aconsequence of both parties' apparent effort to keep to aminimum the information provided to the court was that a pre-sentence report seemed essential to permit a properassessment of the case.The pre-sentence report disclosed that the Ontario College ofPhysicians and Surgeons revoked the accused's licence topractise medicine in August 1993. The Discipline Committeefound the accused guilty of professional misconduct by failingto maintain the appropriate standard of care for his patientsfor whom he had prescribed anabolic steroids, that he hadfalsified medical records, recorded false diagnoses and billedfor services he had not provided, and that he had knowinglysubmitted false accounts to the W.C.B. In imposing its penalty,the Committee concluded as follows:Of equal importance to the serious nature of the actionsgiving rise to the finding of guilt is the issue of Dr.Artinian's character. Character is of crucial significance ina self-regulating profession. Dr. Artinian has shown that heis capable of persistent devious behaviour. His demeanourbefore the Committee showed no sign of remorse or contritionregarding his conduct. His evidence was at best evasive. Heis clearly avaricious and will breach his patients' trust aswell as the trust of the medicare system in order to advancehis own ends.The Committee is not persuaded that Dr. Artinian haslearned any lesson. His behaviour is a disgrace to hisprofession and his licence is hereby revoked.While I think the accused's present professional situation isindeed relevant, it is important to point out that Dr.Artinian, 47, has no prior criminal record. There is noevidence before the court that the unreported income covered bythe charge was derived from fraudulent billings to O.H.I.P. orthe W.C.B., and the Crown takes the position that thelegitimacy of the unreported income would not be relevant tosentence in a tax evasion case in any event. What can be takeninto account, I think, is that the accused has already sufferedsubstantial losses of both a professional and financial nature,and that he has been ruined professionally and personally.The accused's guilty plea should also be taken into accountas a mitigating factor. In one sense, after the effort towithdraw the plea, it is difficult to regard it as the usualdemonstration of remorse or contrition, but, having refused itswithdrawal, it would seem quite unfair to deprive him of thebenefit of his plea as a reason for a more lenient sentencethan would otherwise be appropriate. The Crown accuratelystated that the guilty plea saved the expense and inconvenienceof a trial, which counts in the accused's favour.Certain statements in the pre-sentence report should, Ithink, be disregarded. The claim by Revenue Canada that $2.2million is owed as a result of the taxation years from 1987 to1991 is not part of the admitted facts and should be ignored.After the prosecutor chose to proceed with a charge that waslimited to three taxation years and to a specific amount, itwould be wrong to consider a more serious allegation at thetime of sentencing. Similarly, as stated earlier, the defenceagreed that the accused's statements to the probation officerconcerning the circumstances of the offence should bedisregarded. Material in the report which relates not to theaccused's social and personal situation, but to the offence orother alleged misconduct is inadmissible and inappropriate: seeR. v. Urbanovich (1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 43, 31 Man. R. (2d) 268(C.A.), R. v. Rudyk (1975), 1 C.R. (3d) S-26, 11 N.S.R. (2d)541 (C.A.).The pre-sentence report describes the accused's serioushealth problems. In addition, Mr. Galluzzo filed letters fromthe accused's doctors. The accused suffers from inflammatorybowel disease, bronchial asthma, gout, degenerative discdisease, arthritis and cardiac problems, all of which have beenaggravated recently by stress associated with theseproceedings. The accused has severe obsessive-compulsiveneuroses, which include prolonged, ritualistic hand washing,and Dr. Artinian himself recognizes his need for psychotherapy.The accused lives with his widowed mother, who has her ownmedical problems, and he cares for her in the modest home whichthey share. Dr. Artinian's doctor stated that incarcerationwould be devastating for the accused, and the probation officerreported, improperly in my view, the doctor's opinion that asthe accused is not dangerous, his incarceration would benefitno one.All of the above circumstances must be taken into account, aswell as the fact that the Crown's position is that the publicinterest does not require a jail term in this case. I do notthink, however, that it is possible to justify a non-custodialsentence for income tax evasion on this scale over such aprotracted period by a person like the accused. The offence wasmotivated by greed, and the fact that the accused is able topay a substantial monetary penalty because he has managed toamass considerable wealth, at least partly at the expense ofthose members of the public who dutifully pay their taxes, doesnot, in my view, make a fine the appropriate sentence. Generaldeterrence must be reflected in the sentence as well. While theaccused's health problems will make his incarceration moredifficult than it is for others, and some leniency should beextended on that account, I do not think that the accused'scircumstances are so exceptional that they warrant abandoningthe applicable sentencing principles altogether. A fitsentence, in my view, would be six months in a reformatory. Aconsiderably longer term could probably have been justified.The warrant of committal will include the recommendation thatappropriate medical care be provided.I also think it is appropriate to impose the fine which wassuggested. The accused has the ability to pay it, andregardless of the taxes and civil penalties that have now beenpaid, it adds a further deterrent to those whose primaryconcern is financial gain. The fine will be in the amount of$374,058, or 12 months' imprisonment, consecutive to the jailterm already imposed, in default of payment. As requested bythe accused's counsel, he will be granted 30 days within whichto pay the fine.The sentence, then, is six months' imprisonment and a fine inthe amount of $374,058, or 12 months' consecutive in default ofpayment.Application dismissed and sentence imposed."}

Brown................................................................................................counsel\nfor the CrownT. Robertson....................................................................................counsel\nfor Emma RaynerREASONS\nFOR SENTENCEHARRIS J.:OVERVIEW[1]Emma Rayner pled guilty to dangerous driving which caused bodily\nharm to William Hobin.[2]She\nis before me today to be sentenced with respect to that offence.[3]Crown\ncounsel argued that I should impose a sentence of imprisonment in the range of\n60 to 90 days, to be served on an intermittent basis.[4]Counsel\nfor Ms. Rayner argued that I should suspend sentence, and place her on\nprobation.[5]Both\ncounsel agreed that a driving prohibition is in order here.[6]My\ntask here then is to determine the appropriate sentence for Ms. Rayner.THE\nLAW[7]In\nmaking this decision, I must consider the fundamental purpose and principles of\nsentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code.[8]The\nfundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute to respect for the law, the\nmaintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions\nthat have one or more of the objectives of denunciation; deterring the offender\nand other persons from committing offences; separating offenders from society,\nwhere necessary; assisting in rehabilitating offenders; providing reparation\nfor harm done to victims or to the community; and promoting a sense of\nresponsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and\nto the community.[1][9]The\nrelevance and relative importance of each of these objectives will vary according\nto the nature of the crime and the circumstances of the offender.[2][10]The fundamental principle of sentencing is\nthat the punishment should be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and\nthe degree of responsibility of the offender. The punishment should fit the\ncrime. There is no single fit sentence for any particular offence.[3][11]Doherty J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal\nstated in R. v. Hamilton that:The\n\"gravity of the offence\" refers to the seriousness of the offence in\na generic sense as reflected by the potential penalty imposed by Parliament and\nany specific features of the commission of the crime which may tend to increase\nor decrease the harm or risk of harm to the community occasioned by the\noffence.[4][12]He went on to state that:The\n\"degree of responsibility of the offender\" refers to the offender's\nculpability as reflected in the essential substantive elements of the offence\n-- especially the fault component -- and any specific aspects of the offender's\nconduct or background that tend to increase or decrease the offender's personal\nresponsibility for the crime.[5][13]He then quoted Rosenberg J.A. who had\npreviously described the proportionality requirement in R. v. Priest:The principle of proportionality is rooted in notions\nof fairness and justice. For the sentencing court to do justice to the\nparticular offender, the sentence imposed must reflect the seriousness of the\noffence, the degree of culpability of the offender, and the harm occasioned by\nthe offence. The court must have regard to the aggravating and mitigating\nfactors in the particular case. Careful adherence to the proportionality\nprinciple ensures that this offender is not unjustly dealt with for the sake of\nthe common good.[6][14]On this point, Doherty J.A. concluded by\nstating that:Fixing\na sentence that is consistent with s. 718.1 is particularly difficult where the\ngravity of the offence points strongly in one sentencing direction and the\nculpability of the individual offender points strongly in a very different\nsentencing direction. The sentencing judge must fashion a disposition from\namong the limited options available which take both sides of the\nproportionality inquiry into account.[7][15]Proportionality is the fundamental principle\nof sentencing, but it is not the only principle to be considered.[16]I must specifically consider section\n718.2(d) of the Criminal Code which provides that “an offender should\nnot be deprived of liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in\nthe circumstances”.[17]I must also consider the impact of section 718.2(e)\nwhich provides that “all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are\nreasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with\nparticular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.”[18]The Supreme Court of Canada discussed the\napplication of this section in Gladue v. The Queen and said that section\n718.2(e) applies to all offenders, and that imprisonment should be the penal\nsanction of last resort. Prison is to be used only where no other sanction or\ncombination of sanctions is appropriate to the offence and the offender.[8][19]The Supreme Court also noted that section\n718 now requires a sentencing judge to consider more than the longstanding\nprinciples of denunciation, deterrence and rehabilitation. Now a sentencing\njudge must also consider the restorative goals of repairing the harms suffered\nby individual victims and by the community as a whole, promoting a sense of\nresponsibility and an acknowledgment of the harm caused on the part of the\noffender, and attempting to rehabilitate or heal the offender.[9]As a general\nmatter restorative justice involves some form of restitution and reintegration\ninto the community.[20]Dangerous driving causing bodily harm is an\nindictable offence.The maximum sentence is imprisonment for 10 years.There\nis no minimum sentence.A conditional sentence of imprisonment is not an\noption here in light of section 742.1(e)(i) of the Criminal Code.[21]Before I can apply the applicable principles\nof sentencing, however, I must look at the facts underlying the offence here\nand at Ms. Rayner’s background.THE OFFENCE[22]On June 19, 2013, Ms. Rayner was driving her\nmotor vehicle from her home in Niagara Falls to work.She was running late.[23]The roads were dry and the weather was\nclear.[24]She overtook another vehicle on Beaverdams\nRoad just as they reached a speed bump/traffic calming device. She was\ntravelling in excess of the 50 kilometre per hour posted speed limit and so was\ndefinitely exceeding the 20 kilometre per hour suggested speed for the traffic\ncalming device.[25]She failed to stop at a stop sign.[26]She then drove across another speed bump\nfast enough to cause her vehicle to jump.[27]She began to lose control of her vehicle and\nfailed to negotiate a bend in the road due to her speed.Her vehicle travelled\nonto the paved shoulder.[28]She quickly redirected it back onto the road\nbut the vehicle slid sideways.[29]William Hobin was trimming weeds in the\nditch when her vehicle struck him before continuing on, rolling onto its side.[30]Ms. Rayner crawled from her vehicle and\nwent to help Mr. Hobin.[31]When speaking to him and to police later she\nwas distraught. She stated that she was late and that she had been going too\nfast. She was travelling 90 kilometres per hour.[32]The posted speed limit at that point was 80 kilometres\nper hour but there was a 60 kilometre per hour advisory sign for the bend\nin the road.[33]Ms. Rayner was familiar with Beaverdams\nRoad, travelling it daily.[34]A school and a golf course are both located\nnearby along that road.[35]Ms. Rayner was taken by ambulance to the\nGreater Niagara General Hospital for minor injuries.She was released later\nthe same day.INJURIES TO MR. HOBIN[36]The paramedics believed that his injuries\nwere life threatening and they took Mr. Hobin to the Erie County Hospital\nin Buffalo, New York. His condition was later downgraded to stable but serious.[37]He suffered a compound fracture of his left\nfemur.There was a 16 centimetre wound.Surgery was performed.This included\nthe insertion of a 38 centimetre long pin into Mr. Hobin’s leg.His\nspleen was also lacerated.[38]He is still feeling pain.He has difficulty\nkneeling and climbing stairs.He attends physiotherapy three times per week\nand hopes to return to work later this year.[39]He has experienced nightmares and insomnia.The\naccident has also caused him financial strain.[40]He stated that he holds no ill will against\nMs. Rayner and expressed the hope that she had fully recovered from the\naccident.He indicated that he did not want Ms. Rayner to be sent to jail for\nwhat she had done.BACKGROUND OF MS. RAYNER[41]I have had the benefit of a Pre-Sentence\nReport and a book of references and other sentencing materials which provided\nme with the following information.[42]Ms. Rayner is 42 years old.[43]She resides in Niagara Falls with her 10\nyear old daughter and with her mother and stepfather. She also has a 24 year\nold daughter attending university in Hamilton.[44]Following the breakup of her marriage, she\nhas taken on nearly sole responsibility for her daughters. She has been\ndescribed as a devoted mother.[45]She quit school in grade 10 but returned to\nschool after her daughter was born and earned her Ontario Secondary School\nDiploma. She then completed a two-year Early Childhood Education program.[46]She has been employed as a Registered Early\nChildhood Educator ever since. Her current employer speaks very highly of her\ndedication to her work.[47]She has no issues with alcohol or drugs.[48]The Pre-Sentence Report states that she expressed\nremorse for her actions and concern over the physical and emotional impact on the\nvictim.She indicated that she accepts full responsibility for making “a poor\ndecision” to drive over the speed limit on the morning of the offence.She\nreported that she has not driven a motor vehicle since that day and is unsure\nthat she will in the future.[49]She sustained contusions to her rib cage,\nchest, and sternum in the accident and was off work on medical leave for\napproximately one month.She continues to experience physical pain and deal\nwith symptoms related to depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.[50]She stated that she was willing to comply\nwith any conditions that are placed on her and that she is amenable to\ncommunity service.[51]She is a good candidate for community\nsupervision.ANALYSIS[52]Doherty J.A. aptly described my task here\nwhen he began the judgment in R. v. Hamilton by stating:The\nimposition of a fit sentence can be as difficult a task as any faced by a trial\njudge. That task is particularly difficult where otherwise decent, law-abiding\npersons commit very serious crimes in circumstances that justifiably attract\nunderstanding and empathy.[10][53]There is a great deal that can be said in\nfavour of Ms. Rayner.[54]She pled guilty. She has accepted full\nresponsibility for her offence and expressed remorse.[55]She had no criminal record.Her driving\nrecord does not include any “moving violations”.[56]She has been a productive and contributing\nmember of society.[57]She has suffered from the loss of reputation\nas a result of committing this offence.[58]She too has suffered, both physically and\npsychologically.[59]I am sure that she has been personally\ndeterred by being apprehended and brought to court.[60]She has good prospects for rehabilitation and\nis unlikely to reoffend.[61]On the other hand, the offence that she\ncommitted here is an extremely serious one with horrendous consequences for Mr.\nHobin.[62]I note the comments of Epstein J.A. in R.\nv. Rawn where she said:The\noffence of dangerous driving causing bodily harm has been described as among\nthe more serious of crimes: R. v. McMertry (1987), 21 O.A.C. 68, at para. 11.\nDangerous driving puts the public at great risk of harm. The crime is all the\nmore egregious when people, often innocent members of the public, are injured.[11][63]She repeated herself later, stating:It\nis worth repeating - dangerous driving causing bodily harm is a serious\noffence. An appropriate sentence must give primacy to the objectives of general\ndeterrence and denunciation. To meet the requirements of these principles, the\nsentence must clearly reflect the seriousness of the conduct and its consequences,\nboth actual and potential. To meet the requirements of denunciation, it is\nnecessary that there be absolutely no ambiguity in the message that such\nconduct is completely unacceptable.[12][64]When considering deterrence, I look to the\nwords of Zuber J.A. in R. v. Roussy, where he\nsaid:I\nam using the term \"deterrent\" in its widest sense. The sentence by\nemphasizing community disapproval of an act and branding it as reprehensible\nhas a moral or educative effect and thereby affects the attitude of the public.\nOne then hopes that a person with an attitude thus conditioned to regard\nconduct as reprehensible will not likely commit such an act.[13][65]So, general deterrence and denunciation are\nthe principles of sentencing which need to be given primacy here.The question\nis whether this can be accomplished by means of a suspended sentence which\nincludes restrictive or even punitive terms of probation combined with a\nlengthy driving prohibition.[66]I have reviewed a number of cases in which\nconditional sentences or suspended sentences were imposed for similar offences.\nMost of these are dated however, decided prior to 2007 when section 742.1 of\nthe Criminal Code was first amended so as to preclude the imposition of\na conditional sentence for serious personal injury offences such as dangerous\ndriving causing bodily harm. As I mentioned earlier, the most recent amendments\nare such that a conditional sentence is still not an option now in light of\nsection 742.1(e)(i).[67]As noted by Epstein J.A. in R. v. Rawn,\n“the more important consequence of this amendment is that it signals that\nParliament has determined that conduct of this nature will not be tolerated.”[14][68]In any event, I have found very few\nsuspended sentences imposed for dangerous driving causing bodily harm since\nthese amendments came into effect.[69]Arguably, a suspended sentence and probation\ncan be punitive and accomplish some degree of deterrence and denunciation.[70]I note however the comments of the Supreme\nCourt of Canada in R. v. Proulx stating that probation has traditionally\nbeen viewed as a rehabilitative sentencing tool. Probation seeks to secure “the\ngood conduct” of the offender and to deter him from committing other offences.\nIt does not particularly seek to reflect the seriousness of the offence or the\noffender’s degree of culpability. Nor does it particularly seek to fill the\nneed for denunciation of the offence or the general deterrence of others to\ncommit the same or other offences. Depending upon the specific conditions of\nthe order there may well be a punitive aspect to a probation order but\npunishment is not the dominant or an inherent purpose. It is perhaps not even a\nsecondary purpose but is more in the nature of a consequence of an offender’s\ncompliance with one or more of the specific conditions with which he or she may\nfind it hard to comply.[15][71]After considering all of the above, while I\nam not prepared to find that a suspended sentence would never be appropriate\nfor the offence of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, I find that a short\nperiod of imprisonment to be served on an intermittent basis would be the\nappropriate sentence in this case.[72]Crown counsel has provided me with one\nrecent decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in which an intermittent\nsentence was found to be within the acceptable range.[16][73]I intend to structure the intermittent sentence here in such a way as\nto maximize the number of weekends Ms. Rayner will spend in jail while\nminimizing the length of time she will be away from her child on any one\noccasion.It will also allow her to continue her employment.[74]This will be supplemented by a period of\nprobation which will include a sizable community service component.My\nintention is that the community service order will provide the means for Ms.\nRayner to give something back to the whole community.[75]In addition, she will be prohibited from\ndriving for the next three years.[76]Taken together these are the least\nrestrictive sanctions that are appropriate in the circumstances.They satisfy\nthe need for denunciation and general deterrence while still giving effect to\nthe principles of rehabilitation and restorative justice.SENTENCE[77]I sentence Ms. Rayner to imprisonment for 60\ndays, to be served on an intermittent basis.[78]She will be taken into custody today for\nprocessing and then released. She will then surrender herself into custody at\nthe jail at 7:00 a.m. on Saturday, May 17, 2014 and remain in custody until\n7:00 p.m. on Sunday, May 18, 2014 and thereafter between each subsequent\nSaturday at 7:00 a.m. until the following Sunday at 7:00 p.m. until the\nsentence is completed.[79]By my calculation, it will take her 20\nweeks, or about five months, to complete that sentence. It is my hope and\nintention that she will pause and reflect on the seriousness of her offence\neach and every time she attends at the jail to serve this intermittent\nsentence.[80]She will be placed on probation for three\nyears commencing today.[81]The terms of the probation will require that\nMs. Rayner:1.keep the peaceand be of good behaviour;2.appear beforethe court when required to do so by the court;3.notify thecourt or the probation officer in advance of any change of name or addressand promptly notify the court or the probation officer of any change ofemployment or occupation;4.must appear atthe jail to serve her intermittent sentence on time, in a sober condition,with a blood alcohol concentration of zero, and not under the influence of orin possession of any controlled substance unless she is taking thatcontrolled substance pursuant to a lawfully obtained prescription;5.must report inperson to a probation officer within two working days of her release fromcustody and after that, at all times and places as directed by the probationofficer or any person authorized by a probation officer to assist in her supervision;6.Her reportingrequirement ends when she has satisfied her probation officer that she hascompleted all of her community service hours.7.must cooperatewith her probation officer.She must sign any releases necessary to permitthe probation officer to monitor her compliance and she must provide proof ofcompliance with any condition of this order to her probation officer onrequest;8.must not be inthe driver’s seat of any motor vehicle;9.must perform100 hours of community service work.This work is to start within 60 days ofcompleting her intermittent sentence and shall be completed at a rate of notless than 10 hours per month.She shall complete the work as directedby and to the satisfaction of the probation officer.She must complete allof her community service hours within 17 months.[82]Ms. Rayner is prohibited from operating a\nmotor vehicle on any street, road, highway or other public place for three\nyears.[83]She has 90 days in which to pay the victim\nfine surcharge.Released:May 12, 2014Signed:“JusticeD.A.

Wannamaker........................................................................................................for\nthe CrownS. Willoughby..........................................................................................................for\nthe accusedCOLE J.:[1]Following a Crown election to proceed by way of summary conviction,\nthe offender entered a plea of guilty to a charge that, on April 10, 2009, he\nsexually assaulted his 17 year-old daughter D. G.[2]The admitted facts were that while the offender and his wife, the\nmother of the victim, had separated approximately one month before the\nincident, his daughter remained living with him. Around 3:30 p.m. she awoke and\nwent to the bathroom in their residence. When she came out of the bathroom, the\noffender called her into his bedroom. He told her to lie down on his bed,\nrubbed her back, touched her breasts and digitally penetrated her vagina. He\ntold her not to tell anyone what he had just done.[3]The victim immediately went to a friend’s home, disclosed to her and\nher friend’s mother what had happened. The police were called, and the victim\nwas interviewed. Later that day the offender was arrested, and confessed (on\nvideotape) to what he had done.[4]Counsel agree that a custodial sentence should be imposed. Crown\ncounsel argues that a sentence of 12 months actual custody is appropriate,\nwhile the defence argues that the various principles of sentence can be\nadequately addressed by a conditional sentence of 18 months. Both counsel agree\nthat various ancillary orders – probation, DNA, and Sex Offender Information\nRegistration Act (SOIRA) should also be imposed. Counsel did not mention a\nweapons prohibition order, so I presume they have considered and rejected the\nneed for such an order in this case.THE BACKGROUND OF THE OFFENDER[5]A Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) was prepared to assist me in determining\nthe appropriate sentence. It discloses that the offender is now 42 years old.\nHe has no previous record. He has been steadily employed with the same bedding\nmanufacturing company for more than 10 years. A letter from his employer\ndescribes him as “a productive and exemplary employee”.[6]Friends described themselves as “surprised” or “shocked” by the\ncharge, as did the offender’s sisters. The mother of the complainant, the\noffender’s ex-spouse, told the writer of the PSR that she “still can’t believe\nit happened”, and that the offender is “a good father and a good provider”. The\noffender’s current romantic partner, whom he met after this incident, described\nhim as “a remarkable person”, who is “very religious” and “very spiritual”. She\nsaid that he is “upset and remorseful over his actions” and that he is “very\nloving towards his kids”.[7]Though the overall tenor of the PSR is positive, the writer noted\nsome troubling elements. He comments: “[w]hen this writer asked the subject\nabout changes he has made in his life and what would prevent him from\nre-offending in the future, he mostly speaks in general terms. He states that\nhe is ‘dealing with my situation’ and wants ‘to be a better person’. He\npresents as struggling with personal issues but has not attended professional\ncounselling or a rehabilitative program to date”. I agree with the writer that\nit is somewhat concerning that even after his acknowledgment of guilt the offender\nhas not yet begun to take any steps to seek out professional assistance in\norder to enable him to gain insight into why he committed such a gross breach\nof trust.[8]Unfortunately, this lack of insight was carried into the court\nproceedings, When I asked the offender whether he wished to exercise his right\nto address the court (as he is entitled to do under s.726 of the Code),\nhe repeated many of the same vague generalities about “wanting to provide for\nhis family” and “improving himself”. While I must caution myself not to discriminate\nagainst someone who might have been uncomfortable speaking publicly, the\ncombination of what he said - and did not say - to the writer of the PSR and\nwhat he said - and did not say - to me is troubling. I think Crown counsel had\nit right when she pointed to the offender’s lack of engagement in any kind of\ntreatment program as indicative of the fact that, despite his guilty plea, he\nhas not fully accepted (or internalized) the need at least to have an\nassessment done as a possible precursor to treatment for his now admitted sexual\ndeviance.[9]Defence counsel of course made much of the fact that in her Victim\nImpact Statement (VIS), the complainant appears not to hold any particular\ngrudge against her father for what he did to her. In fact, she refers to her\nfather as “my best friend” and says “I would like to have contact with my dad\nin the future if he wants to have contact with me again”. At one level, I agree\nwith defence counsel that this is what appears in her VIS. However, it seems\nquite clear to me that in responding to the question on the VIS form about\n“providing a description of the impact of the crime on your life” the\ncomplainant has been significantly affected by the loss of “my old house, old\nroom, all my belongings….I also miss visiting his side of the family….I just\nmiss being a family again”. In other words, I read her VIS as indicating that\nthe victim realizes that her sense of trust and security have been profoundly -\nand likely permanently – affected, both by the family breakup and by the\noffender’s assault on her. Looked at in this light, I see her rather wistful\nstatements about rekindling her relationship with her father more as a desire\nto return to some halcyon days of yore, rather than as a clear and firm\nexpression of her wishes and intentions for the future. Thus, while I accept\ncounsel’s comment that the complainant does not appear to bear an obvious\ngrudge against her father for what he did to her, it is entirely clear that\nwhat he did has significantly contributed to her feelings of loss.[10]There is one other matter somewhat connected with the offender’s background\nthat should be dealt with at this point in the analysis. During submissions it\ncame out as an agreed fact that the complainant had been sexually abused by a\nfellow student a few months prior to April 10, 2009. More important, this fact\nwas known to the offender at the time he assaulted her. Crown counsel argued\nthat I should see this as an aggravating factor on sentence; however, she was\ncareful to concede that she did not base her position on any suggestion that\nthe offender felt that he could abuse his position of trust precisely because\nshe was vulnerable as a result of the previous sexual assault. She rather\nargued that the offender’s callousness in taking advantage of his daughter just\nafter she had been the victim of a sexual assault should give me some additional\ninsight into his character.[11]I have carefully considered this submission and consider that there\nis some validity to it. This is not a case where – by analogy – an accused\ntakes advantage of someone standing alone on a street corner late at night, or\nan accused who, knowing that a home has been recently burgled, breaks into it\nto steal goods freshly acquired as a result of an insurance settlement. In\nother words, this is not (on the evidence before me) a case in which I can reasonably\ninfer that the offender deliberately took advantage of his daughter’s\nvulnerable state to prey upon her. I rather see this as a case in which the\noffender was so caught up with his lustful desires that he simply ignored the\neffect that any – and in this case a second - sexual attack might have had on\nhis daughter. I agree with Crown counsel that this was particularly selfish and\ncallous behaviour on his part, which substantially increases his “moral blameworthiness”.CASE LAW CITED BY COUNSEL[12]Because the Crown elected to proceed summarily in this case, it is\ncommon ground that a conditional sentence is available as a possible penalty.\nWhile conceding that the Supreme Court of Canada did say in R. v. Proulx\nthat punitive and restorative objectives of sentencing could sometimes be\nachieved by means of a tightly restricted conditional sentence, Crown counsel\ncited several paragraphs of Proulx for the proposition that “[w]here the\nneed for punishment is particularly pressing…incarceration will likely be the\nmore attractive sanction” (paras. 100 \u0026 102). She also cited R. v. W.\n(L.F.), one of the companion judgments to R. v. Proulx, where (in\ndissent[1])\nL’Heureux-Dube J. cited various case law for the proposition that “[c]ourts\nhave tended, even under the new sentencing principles adopted in Bill C-41 to\nfind that the principle of denunciation weighs particularly heavily in cases of\noffences perpetrated against children by adult in positions of trust and authority”\n(para. 29).[13]Even though L’Heureux-Dube J. wrote for the dissent in W. (L.F.),\ncareful perusal of the reasons of the majority disclose that their decision was\nmore about deference to the trial judge’s reasons rather than about the\nsubstantive decision. Indeed, writing for the majority Lamer C.J.C. expressly\nstated: “Were I a trial judge, I might well have…imposed a sentence of\nincarceration” (para. 25).[14]Though they were not expressly addressed by Crown counsel, I find it\nnoteworthy that in two of the other companion cases argued with R. v. Proulx\nthe Supreme Court decided to expressly overrule Courts of Appeal to reinstate\ncustodial sentences for sexual assault that had been imposed by trial judges. I\nfind that the Supreme Court’s reasoning for taking this relatively rare step in\nthese cases to be most instructive as to how I should deal with the case at\nbar.[15]In R. v. R. (R.A.) (2000) 2000 SCC 8 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 523 (S.C.C.) the\ntrial judge imposed a custodial sentence of one year custody (plus probation)\non a charge of sexual assault committed by an employer against his employee.\nLargely because the conditional sentence regime came into effect between the\ntime the trial judge imposed sentence and the date the matter came on for\nhearing in the Court of Appeal, the Manitoba Court of Appeal reversed this, and\nsubstituted a six-month conditional sentence[2].\nA majority of the Supreme Court determined that the sentence imposed by the\nCourt of Appeal “was unfit in light of the gravity of the offences committed\nand the respondent’s moral blameworthiness given his abuse of a position of authority”\n(para. 24), and restored the one-year custodial sentence imposed by the trial\njudge. The majority also expressly commented that “while service of the\nsentence in the community and house arrest might well achieve an appropriate\nmeasure of denunciation and deterrence in some circumstances, it did not send a\nsufficiently strong message in this case” (para. 28).[16]It should also be noted that, rather like the majority in W.\n(L.F.), the judges in the minority in R. (R.A.) based their\nreasoning on the need to defer to a lower court – in this case the Court of\nAppeal – rather than on the sentence actually imposed. Lamer C.J.C. wrote: “Although\nthis sentence appears to be somewhat lenient and, had I been the sentencing\njudge, I might have imposed a longer conditional sentence or a term of\nimprisonment, I am reluctant to substitute my opinion for the Court of Appeal”\n(para. 22). His Lordship repeated this even more forcefully later in his\nreasons: “[D]espite the fact that I might have imposed a sentence of incarceration…”\n(para. 25).[17]In R. v. S. (R.N.) (2000) 2000 SCC 7 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 553 the Supreme\nCourt again dealt with a scenario where a trial judge had imposed a nine-month\ncustodial sentence (followed by probation), for which a conditional sentence\nwas later substituted by the British Columbia Court of Appeal, once that form\nof sentence became available as a matter of law. In that case the Supreme Court\nof Canada unanimously reversed the decision to impose a conditional sentence,\nand reinstated the custodial sentence imposed at trial. The Court held that,\ndespite the offender’s “clearly abhorrent and reprehensible behaviour”, the\ntrial judge had imposed a very lenient sentence which already took into account\nthe offender’s “precarious health”, “marital difficulties” and “the social\nstigma he had already suffered”. Lamer C.J.C. wrote:With respect, I do not think that a nine-month\nconditional sentence was a fit sentence, in light of the relevant sentencing\nconsiderations, including the gravity of the offences committed and the high\nmoral blameworthiness of the respondent.The impugned acts occurred\nrepeatedly over a period of approximately five years.The respondent\nabused the trust of a very young child, despite clear indications from the complainant\nthat she did not like what he was doing.He remained unrepentant and\ncontinued to deny that the offences took place.The amount of\ndenunciation provided by a nine-month conditional sentence was clearly\ninsufficient in the circumstances to signify society’s abhorrence for the acts\nthe respondent committed, despite the fact that his liberty was restricted by\nthe conditions imposed.It must be remembered that, even though the\nrespondent experienced some marital difficulties, he still benefited from the\nsupport of his family, while the victim and her mother were ostracized by the\nrest of the family (para. 18; emphasis added).His Lordship wrote: “[b]y imposing\na conditional sentence of only nine months, the Court of Appeal transformed\nwhat was already a lenient sentence into an unfit sentence” (para. 19).[18]From these three Supreme Court decisions in sexual assault cases, I\nderive two propositions which should guide me in determining the appropriate\nsentence to be imposed. The first is fairly obvious: where an offender is in a\nposition of trust or authority, his moral blameworthiness is deemed to be\nelevated – see R. (R.A.) at para. 19; W. (L.F.) at paras. 24\n\u0026 30; S. (R.N.) at para. 18. Closely related to this, as the portions\nof the cases I have cited disclose, the Court was firmly of the view that it\nwould be a very rare case in which a non-custodial disposition would be imposed\nfor child sexual assault by an offender in a position of trust.[19]The second proposition I derive from these three Supreme Court\ndecisions is that where the court finds evidence that any form of vaginal penetration\n– oral, digital or penile – had occurred, it was much more likely that a\ncustodial sentence would be imposed. In W. (L.F.), though the offences\ncommitted were described as “terrible” by the majority (para. 20) and as\n“offensive and demeaning” by the dissenting judges (para. 30), there was no\nevidence of penetration on the facts found by the trial judge. In the result no\ncustodial sentence was imposed. In S. (R.N.) there was evidence that the\noffender fondled the victim’s vagina on several occasions (para. 2). In R.\n(R.A.) the Court adopted an agreed statement of facts that expressly included\nan admission that one of the most aggravating elements of the offender’s sexual\nassault on the victim was that he had inserted a finger into her vagina.[20]While I appreciate that these three decisions may well have more to\ndo with concepts of appellate deference than with this exact aggravating\nfeature, the reason I have focused in on this element is because of several\ndecisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal cited by Crown counsel which have\nconsidered this factor more explicitly.[21]R. v. Stuckless (1998) 1998 CanLII 7143 (ON CA), 127 C.C.C. (3d)\n225 was an appeal by the Crown against a decision of Watt J. (as he then was)\ndeclining to impose a penitentiary-length sentence following pleas of guilty to\n24 counts of indecent and sexual assault relating to a 20-year history of assaulting\nteenage boys. One of the trial judge’s reasons for that decision was “[t]here\nwas no actual or threatened violence towards any complainant beyond what was\nimplicit in the interference with the physical integrity of the\ncomplainant….There was no anal intercourse committed, attempted or threatened”\n(para. 24). On appeal, writing for a majority of the Court[3], Abella J.A. strongly disagreed\nwith this characterization of the offences by the trial judge, referring to it\nas “technical…fail[ing] to capture the full nature and scope of the offences”\n(para. 37). She was clear that “[t]he absence of penetration does not\nautomatically relegate the abuse of children to the ‘lower range’ of offences. There\nis no question that ‘additional force’, ‘collateral crimes’ and penetration\nare aggravating factors” (para. 42; emphasis added). Crown counsel relies\non these passages to suggest that in the case at bar the admission of\npenetration by the offender should be viewed by me as an aggravating factor\nthat should not only persuade me to push the custodial sentence to the level proposed\nby her, but also to reject a conditional sentence.[22]The next decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal cited by Crown\ncounsel (in chronological order)was R. v. P.M. 2002 CanLII 15982 (ON CA), [2002] O.J. No.\n644. The facts of the more significant of the two sexual offences being considered\nby the Court of Appeal disclosed that: “[w]hen C. was 13, the [26 year-old] respondent\nbegan to have sexual intercourse with her. He would pick her up at school and\ntake her to his apartment. He made her feel that he was her boyfriend…. The\nsexual relationship continued until the victim was at least 16 years old”\n(para. 2). In speaking for the court Feldman J.A. expressly adverted to this\nissue: “His conduct as a 26 year-old adult in molesting an 11 year-old girl leading\nup to intercourse with her at age 13 is both reprehensible and frightening”\n(para. 18; emphasis added).[23]In explaining why the offender’s behaviour was frightening Feldman\nJ.A. wrote: “This conduct is also frightening because as a 26 year-old man, the\nrespondent induced a vulnerable child into an ongoing sexual relationship by\nleading her to believe that they were boyfriend and girlfriend. This is\nexploitation of the worst order. Young women entering their teenage years\nface a myriad of confusing feelings regarding their bodies, their emotions and\ntheir sexuality. To exploit a young teenager as this man did reveals a level of\namorality that is of great concern.” (para. 19; emphasis added). Crown\ncounsel particularly directed me to the highlighted portion to make three\npoints. First, while the offender in P.M. stood in some position of\ntrust because he was (at the time of these assaults) a friend of the victim’s\nfamily, in the case at bar the offender is the victim’s father, clearly a more\negregious breach of trust. In the submission of the Crown, even though only one\nincident was involved here, the offender’s relationship to the victim made his behaviour\neven worse. Second, having recently been separated from her mother as a result\nof her parents’ separation, as the custodial parent the offender should have\nbeen most mindful of his teenage daughter’s need for reassurance and support, not\nexploitation. Finally, because his daughter had very recently been the victim\nof another sexual assault (as described in paras. 10 \u0026 11, supra),\nthe offender was under a particular obligation to treat his daughter with\nunderstanding, compassion and respect, all of which he failed to do.[24]The next case relied on by Crown counsel was the important Court of\nAppeal decision in R. v. D.D. 2002 CanLII 44915 (ON CA), [2002] O. J. No. 1061, where the offender\nattempted to appeal an eight year, one month sentence on the basis that R.\nv. Stuckless had established a “high-water mark of six years for adult\noffenders who groom and sexually abuse innocent children over prolonged periods\nof time” (para. 2). I find it noteworthy that in listing factors differentiating\nthis case from Stuckless, Moldaver J.A., writing for the court, began\nwith the fact that the offender had committed “[r]epeated and persistent\nacts of anal intercourse against two of the boys and attempted acts of anal\nintercourse with a third” (para. 26). Later in his reasons, he wrote: “I am of\nthe view that as a general rule, when adult offenders, in a position of trust,\nsexually abuse innocent young children on a regular and persistent basis over\nsubstantial periods of time, they can expect to receive mid to upper level\nsingle digit penitentiary terms. When the abuse involves full intercourse,\nanal or vaginal, and it is accompanied by other acts of physical violence…upper\nsingle digit to lower double digit penitentiary terms will generally be appropriate.\nFinally, in cases where these elements are accompanied by a pattern of\nsevere psychological, emotional and physical brutalization, still higher\npenalties will be warranted” (para. 44). While obviously the context in the\ncase at bar is radically different from the facts in D.D., nevertheless\nCrown counsel’s point is that the Court of Appeal is recognizing that, while\nall sexual assault against children are serious, penetration is inherently\nviolative and intrusive, and therefore particularly aggravating.[25]Crown counsel also cited several other recent Court of Appeal\ndecisions involving prolonged and escalating sexual assaults on young children\nby relatives or others in positions of trust.[4]\nShe concedes that they are factually very different from the case at bar; nevertheless,\nshe points to these decisions as further evidence that the Court of Appeal\nregards evidence of penetration as a significantly aggravating factor. R. v.\nD.R. 2003 CanLII 9127 (ON CA), [2003] O.J. No. 561 was a case where a father sexually assaulted his\n15-year-old daughter while she was asleep, 3-4 times per month over a 14-month\nperiod. Among the acts to which he (eventually) admitted committing was oral\nsex. In overturning the trial judge’s decision to impose an 18-month\nconditional sentence the Court of Appeal wrote: “This court has repeatedly\nindicated that a conditional sentence should rarely be imposed in cases\ninvolving the sexual touching of children by adults, particularly where, as\nhere, the sexual violation is of a vulnerable victim by a person in a position\nof trust. In addition, circumstances that involve multiple sexual acts\nover an extended period of time and escalating in intrusiveness generally\nwarrant a severe sentence” (para. 8; emphasis added). In R. v. F. (G.C.)\n2004 CanLII 4771 (ON CA), [2004] O.J. No. 3177 the offender was the assistant superintendent of the\napartment building where one of the complainants lived. He groomed two 13-year-old\ngirls over a period of two months, escalating in sexual activities to the point\nwhere he had sexual intercourse with one of them. Despite this, a conditional\nsentence was imposed at trial. On appeal by the Crown the Court of Appeal\nrepeated what it had said in D.D. and D.R. about the appropriateness\nof severe sentences where multiple sexual acts escalating in seriousness are\nunder consideration. I find it noteworthy that in summarizing the aggravating\nfeatures of the respondent’s conduct, Borins J.A., writing for the court, twice\nreferred to the element of sexual intercourse (para. 21).[5][26]Crown counsel submitted that her final case – R. v. R.W.D.\n2005 CanLII 20711 (ON CA), [2005] O.J. No. 2385 – came closest to the facts in the case at bar. In that\ncase the offender had twice come into his 12 year-old stepdaughter’s bedroom\nwhen she was sleeping. On the first occasion he attempted to have sexual\nintercourse with her, but the trial judge found as a fact that no penetration\nhad occurred. About three weeks later he again entered her bed, kissed her\nbreasts and performed an act of cunnilingus. The Court of Appeal allowed a\nCrown appeal against a conditional sentence imposed at trial, and substituted a\ncustodial sentence of twelve months. While accepting that only one incident is\ninvolved in the case at bar, Crown counsel nevertheless submitted that I should\nimpose a custodial sentence of the length imposed by the Court of Appeal.[27]In preparing these reasons I have come across the April 2007\n“Definitive Guideline” laid down by the English Sentencing Guidelines Council[6] for sexual offences. It notes\nthat the Sexual Offences Act, 2003 (implemented in May 2004) created a\nnew offence of “assault by penetration” (as well as amending the definition of\nrape to include “non-consensual penile penetration of the mouth”). The Council\nexplained that this definition, combined with a legislated potential maximum\npenalty of life imprisonment (at the same level as the penalty for rape), was\nintended to confirm that “penetrative acts are more serious than\nnon-penetrative acts” (paras. 1.18 \u0026 2.5). I read this Guideline as entirely\nconsistent with the Supreme Court of Canada and Ontario Court of Appeal decisions\nI have just cited. It stresses, as Canadian courts have done, that “[a]ll the\nnon-consensual offences involve a high degree of culpability”, and that “[t[he\nseriousness of the violation of the victim’s sexual autonomy may depend on a\nnumber of factors, but the nature of the sexual behaviour will be the primary\nindicator of the degree of harm caused in the first instance” (Part 2A, p. 28).\nI further note that if no plea of guilty is entered and a finding of guilt is\nmade after a trial, the English Guideline creates a “starting point” of 2 years\ncustody, with a range of 1-4 years for the offence of “[p]enetration with a\nbody part (fingers, toes, or tongue) where no physical harm is sustained by [a\nvictim 16 years of age or older]” (p. 29).Though of course this Guideline\ndoes not apply in Canada (and the statutory structures for both offence and\npenalty are considerably different), I read it as confirming the general\nproposition that sexual assaults involving any form of penetration virtually\nprelude the possibility of a community-based sentence – and for these purposes\na conditional sentence is a community-based sentence - being imposed.[28]Defence counsel did not cite any additional case law in support of\nhis argument that a conditional sentence should be imposed. He rather relied on\nthe by now well-known statements in Proulx to the effect that deterrence\nand denunciation can be achieved by a tightly structured conditional sentence\ninvolving a significant period of house arrest. He pointed to several of the\ncases mentioned by Crown counsel, all of which confirmed that there have and\ncontinue to be examples of serious sexual assaults on children that have\nresulted in conditional sentences. He quite properly reminded me that all the\ncases cited by Crown counsel involved multiple incidents (if not separate\ncounts) of sexual assault, that most of the cases involved much more serious\nmisbehaviour than in the case at bar, and that I have no evidence before me\nthat the complainant has been severely traumatized – in fact, her VIS indicates\na desire to reconcile with her father as soon as possible. Finally, he reminded\nme that it was open to Crown counsel to proceed by indictment, which would have\nprecluded the possibility of a conditional sentence being an available\ndisposition.[29]I now turn to the question of what length of custodial term should\nbe imposed. With respect, I think Crown counsel’s argument in favour of a term\nof one year over-emphasizes the severity of the offence while underplaying\nnumerous positive factors about the accused. As the Supreme Court has reminded\nthe bench and bar for many years, Canadian sentencing is an individualized\nprocess, where the offender is not normally to be sacrificed on the altar of\ndenunciation and deterrence. In this case, I consider that the following\nfactors operate to mitigate the sentence proposed by Crown counsel:-the\noffender’s lack of any previous record;-his plea of\nguilty;[7]-the positive remarks about the offender’s\ncharacter made by the victim’s mother, the offender’s current romanticpartner,\nand – to a lesser extent – by the victim herself;-the fact that this was a single and quite\ntransitory incident, not accompanied by any threats or actual violence[30]Though I acknowledge and have carefully considered the points made\nby defence counsel, I have come to the conclusion that this is not one of those\nvery rare cases where a conditional sentence should be imposed for an offence\nof this nature. The following factors have ultimately persuaded me that it\nwould not “be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of\nsentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2 [of the Code]” for me to\nimpose such a sentence (regardless of the degree of restrictions on the\noffender’s liberty that I might impose):-the\noffender’s overall “moral blameworthiness”;-his\nindifference to the core trust between parent and child;-his\nindifference to his daughter’s vulnerability given the recent family breakup;-his indifference to the fact that his\ndaughter had recently been the victim of another sexual assault;-his indifference to the long-term emotional\nimpact his gross and illegal acts would inevitably have on his child;-the element\nof digital penetration;-Supreme\nCourt of Canada and Ontario Court of Appeal case law;[30]Against the backdrop of recent appellate case law stressing the need\nto strongly denounce sexual exploitation of children by caregivers, I do not\nconsider that the various mitigating factors I have outlined are capable of\nreducing the custodial portion to the intermittent range. I fully appreciate\nthat this will no doubt make it more difficult for the offender and those he\nsupports, but – frankly – he should have thought of this before he so grossly and\ncallously abused his position of trust. Exercising the best amount of restraint\nI can in the circumstances of this case (and fully recognizing that, as in any\nindividualized sentencing system there is an element of arbitrariness in the\nattribution of “a number”), I have come to the following disposition:DISPOSITION[31]The offender is sentenced to 6 months in custody.[32]Upon release from custody, he will be placed on probation for a period\nof two years. In addition to the mandatory conditions common to any probation\norder, the following optional conditions of probation are imposed:-Report in person to a probation officer\nwithin two business days of your release from custody, and thereafter as\ndirected by him or her;-Attend for assessment and/or counselling for\nsexual deviance as directed by your probation officer;-Not discontinue any counselling or therapy\nunless authorized to do so by your therapist or counsellor;-Sign any releases as are necessary to\nauthorize your probation officer to communicate with treating assessors,\ntherapists or counsellors;-Not to be in contact directly or indirectly\nwith D.G. until she has provided written revocable consent to theprobation officer;-Not to be alone with D.G. until such time as\nyou have completed an assessment and/or counselling for sexual devianceto the\nsatisfaction of your therapist or counsellor;[33]There\nwill be an order for the production of a DNA sample pursuant to s. 487.051(4)\nof the Code.[34]The\noffender will be designated as a person convicted of a designated\noffence pursuant to s. 490.011(1)(a) of the Code for a period of 10\nyears.Released:March 2, 2011Signed: “Justice D.P. Cole”[1] I have not at all forgotten that the Court in fact split 4:4 in\nthis case, and that, strictly speaking, there was no majority for one view or\nthe other. However, as noted by the Court, in these circumstances, the rule is\nthat the Court of Appeal decision governs the ultimate result. Thus, when I\nrefer to the majority and the dissent, it must be understood within that\ncontext.[2] Consecutive conditional sentences of two months and one month for\nother (non-sexual) assaults committed against the same victim were also imposed\nby the Court of Appeal.[3] I read the concurring reasons of Austin J.A.as not differing from\nthe reasons of the majority on this point – see para. 69.[4] Though not cited by Crown counsel, I have also come across R. v.\nW. (Q.) 2006 CanLII 21035 (ON CA), 2006 CanLII 21035 (On. C.A.) at para. 20.[5] In the third of these cases cited by Crown counsel, R. v. D.H.D.\n[2004] O.J. No. 1736, the court upheld a custodial sentence of 12 months for a\nfact pattern that involved attempted anal, vaginal and oral penetration. I have\ndecided to cite this case in a footnote, as the court did not comment\nparticularly on this factor.[6] Sentencing Guidelines Council “Sexual Offences Act 2003”, available\nat www.sentencingguidelines.gov.uk.[7] I have deliberately excluded the offender’s good work history from\nconsideration as a mitigating factor, as I do not think it is relevant in a\ncase of this nature (see R. v. Joseph B. (1990) 36. O.A.C. 307)."}

D.E.D.P.Date: 2002-06-20Rachel A. Huntsman, for the Crown;Tony St. George, for the accused.(2002 01T 0782)[1]O’Regan, J.: D.P.\nwas living common law with S.L. in [xxx], Newfoundland. S.L. had two children\nfrom a previous marriage to R.L. and these children spent time both with the\nmother and the father. On July 24, 2001 J.L. told her mother that D.P. had\nsexually assaulted her. S.L. contacted the R.N.C. and reported this offence and\nalso reported that she was sexually assaulted by D.P. sometime between April\nand June, 2001. As a result of the complaints, charges were laid and D.P.\nsubsequently pleaded guilty to two charges. The charges were as follows.[2]In relation to S.L. the following charge was\nlaid.“Between the 1st day of April, A.D., 2001,\nand the 30th day of June, A.D., 2001, at or near [xxx], in the Province of\nNewfoundland, while committing a sexual assault on S.L. did use a weapon, to\nwit: a knife, thereby committing an indictable offence, contrary to Section\n272(1) (a) 272(2)(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada.”[3]In relation to J.L., D.P. was charged that:“On or about the 23rd day of July, A.D.,\n2001, at or near [xxx], in the Province of Newfoundland, being a person in a\nposition of trust or authority towards J.L., a young person, did for a sexual\npurpose, touch directly or indirectly, with a part of his body, the body of the\nsaid J.L., thereby committing an indictable offence, contrary to Section\n153(1)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.”[4]When the matter came on for trial, D.P. pled\nguilty and the following Agreed Statement of Facts was entered:“Agreed Statement of Facts“1. On July 24, 2001, the Royal\nNewfoundland Constabulary (R.N.C.) received a complaint from S.L. (D.O.B.:\n1966/05/15) that both she and her daughter J.L. (D.O.B.: 1987/02/19) had been\nsexually assaulted by D.P.2. At the time of the offences, D.P. was\nliving common-law with S.L. in [xxx], Newfoundland. S.L. has two children from\na previous marriage to R.L. The children spend time with both S.L. and R.L.3. S.L. spent the weekend prior to July 24,\n2001 with her son M. at her mother’s residence in [xxx]. Her daughter, J.L.\nremained in [xxx]. Prior to leaving, S.L. made arrangements with her ex-husband\nR.L. to have their daughter stay with him. This did not happen and J.L. stayed\nat her mother’s residence with D.P.4. When S.L. returned to her home in [xxx]\non Tuesday, July 24, 2001, J.L. told her mother that D.P. had sexually\nassaulted her. S.L. contacted the R.N.C. and reported this offence. S.L. also\nreported to the R.N.C. that she had been sexually assaulted by D.P. sometime\nbetween April and June, 2001.Complaint of S.L.5. The offence of sexual assault with a\nknife against S.L. occurred between the 1st day of April, A.D., 2001 and the\n30th day of June, A.D., 2001. On the night of the offence, D.P. arrived home at\nabout 3:30 a.m. When S.L. heard D.P. come in, she got out of bed and went into\nthe kitchen. S.L. believed that D.P. was “loaded.” D.P. asked her if she wanted\nto have sex. When S.L. told him “no”, he left the room for a short time. When\nhe returned, he grabbed her by the throat and told her to stand up. He had a\nknife in his hand which he pressed against her throat. S.L. recognized the\nknife to be the knife which D.P. used to slaughter the pigs.6. The following details of the offence\nwere provided by S. L. at the Preliminary Inquiry which was held on March 13,\n2002:‘He put his arm\naround my neck. The knife was in his hand. He held it against my throat and he\ntold me to stand up. I stood up. He told me to follow him into the bedroom and\nI was crying now at this point. I was shaken and I said what are you doing. He\nsaid shut up, he said, follow me into the bedroom. I went on in and he just\nstood there. He said strip. I said what are you talking about. He said take off\nyour clothes. I said no. Like, I thought it as all crazy. It was retarded. And\nI said no, I’m not. I said it a dozen times. And he said do you want to live or\ndie and I said well I prefer to live and he said, well, do as you’re told and\nhe said you will live. So he put the knife up to me again and I could feel it\ngetting tighter and then I took off my clothes. I was scared. And he fell on\nthe bed and he told met to get on my knees beside the bed and he asked me to\ngive him a blow job. I said you know that’s something I don’t do. I said I’m\nnot into that and he said, well, you are going to learn. And he made me do it\nand I was crying so hard I figured with my crying he’d come to his senses, he’d\nrealize what he’s doing because he always told me he’d never harm a hair on his\n(sic) head. I was crying so much I can’t even remember hardly doing what he\ntold me to do but I know I did it. And after a while he put the knife down to\nthe side and I don’t know how long I was on my knees but I remember him\ngrabbing me, threw me up on the bed, and he did everything he wanted to do with\nme.’Q.Which is? You have to be explicit, I’m sorry. What he wanted\nto do with you, I have to ask for details.‘He went down on\nme. He had intercourse through my backside and in front and did it every which\nway he ever wanted to do because when I have intercourse I find it painful and\nI can’t do it in certain ways.’Q.You have a medical problem?‘Yes’Q.He was aware of that?‘Yes’Q.Did it seem to concern him at this point?‘No. He didn’t\ngive a frig how much pain I was in. And he was pressing really hard and I was\nscreaming out in pain and agony. Like I said, intercourse hurts me. And after\nhe finished everything anyway, did everything he wanted to do, he ended up - he\nleaned up over me and he came all over my face and in my hair, all over me. And\nthen he passed out. I went out and his sister-in-law always told me if I needed\nany help or anything, call her, she’d get D. to come up and handle him. I went\nout to the phone in the living room and I called L. but there was no answer. I\nmean, this was probably 3:30 in the morning, then, four o’clock. I knew they\nwere (in) bed but I figured I’d probably wake them up. I kept calling and no\none picked up. So I don’t know if it was the next day I told her what happened\nor a few days later, I don’t know, but I know I told her and I told C, his\nother brother’s girlfriend about what happened.’7. The next morning, S.L. confronted D.P.\nHe denied recalling anything about the activities of the previous night. He\ntold her that if he ever did recall it, that he would hang himself. He promised\nthat he would never hurt her.8. Although S.L. did not initially report\nthe incident to the police, she did tell her daughter J.L. what had occurred.9. After the offence occurred, S.L. hid the\nknife in the spare bedroom. She ended up returning it to D.P. because he needed\nit to slaughter the pigs. She did not see the knife again until the police\nrecovered it on July 25, 2001. It was located in the rafters in one of the\nsheds on the property occupied by S.L. and D.P.”Complaint of J.L.10. During the evening of Sunday, July 22,\n2001, J.L. was at her mother’s residence with D.P. D.P. had some beer and J.L.\nasked him if she could have one. D.P. then told her to drink two more beer.\nJ.L. then started to get sick and went to the washroom. She had the door\nlocked; however, D.P. managed to pick the lock with a toothpick. He came in and\nasked if she was alright.11. J.L. stayed in the bathroom for a few\nminutes and then she went and lay down on the couch. She was wearing the\nclothes that she had on that day, which were a pair of jeans and a green khaki\ntop. J.L. was trying to get to sleep when D.P. came over to the couch. She estimates\nthat it was about 3:30 a.m.12. D.P. then started kissing her on the\nface. J.L. testified at the Preliminary Inquiry on March 13, 2002 to the\nfollowing:‘He asked me if\nI wanted to live or die and I said neither because I knew that live meant to do\nsomething with him. So he put his hand over my face so I couldn’t breathe but I\nwas still able to breathe while his hand was over my face and he kept asking me\nif I wanted to live or die and I said - I don’t know what I said. I must have\nsaid live because he took his hand off my face and then he started at me again\nand I said no and then he took my pillow from underneath my head and put it on\nmy face and I couldn’t breathe with that on so I ended up saying yes. Then he\ntook my clothes and then he took off his clothes and then he started at me\nagain.’“Q.When you say ‘at you’, what did he do?‘Had sex with\nme.’Q.Okay. Just specifically, with respect to sex, what part of\nyour person did he touch with his person? Do you know what I’m saying?‘My vagina.’Q.Okay. And what part of his person made contact with your\nvagina?‘His penis.’13. D.P. attempted to penetrate J.L.’s\nvagina with his penis. In order to assist him in this act, D.P. took a jar of\nVaseline from the bathroom and applied some Vaseline to his penis.14. D.P. did not use a condom during this\nassault. He ejaculated on her stomach and then used her top to wipe the\nejaculate off her stomach. J.L. has not seen this top since that evening.15. J. L. further testified at the\nPreliminary Inquiry on March 13, 2002 that‘Then he got up\nand he told me to move in, so I moved in. I didn’t know what to do. I was\ncrying and scared and I got the blanket and covered myself up and he sat next\nto me and he asked me what happened and I didn’t respond because I was crying\nand he said he was sorry and started apologizing for everything and I don’t\nknow, it just seemed like he was sober again or something.’Q.Do you recall how much he had to drink? You said you had\nabout three beers. Do you remember how much he had to drink during that period\nof time?‘I have no idea\nbecause he was drinking over at Wince’s house and when we came back he pulled a\ndozen out of the fridge.’Q.When he was with you on the couch, you said it was like he\nwas all of a sudden sober again. Did he act like he was intoxicated before\nthat, that he was drunk before that?‘No, but I\nassume he was.’Q.When you say he apologized, what did he say? Do you remember\nhis exact words?‘Not really. All\nI know is he asked me what he had done and then it just clicked into him what\nhe had done to me. He said he was sorry and that he was going to kill - hang\nhimself in the shed and I told him not to and he said it is either I go to jail\nor I go kill myself now and I told him not to go kill himself.’Q.And then what happened?‘He passed out\nin the chair or something like that and I had summer school the next morning,\nso I went to sleep and got up and went to school.’16. The next morning, J.L. had to attend\nsummer school. When she returned from school later on that day, D.P. told her\nthat he was talking to a lawyer friend of his and because there was no\nevidence, he wouldn’t get into any trouble. He also offered to buy her a pack\nof cigarettes every second day if she did not tell anyone what had happened.17. J.L. was examined by Dr. Morris at the Janeway\nHospital on July 24, 2001. Dr. Morris made the following findings concerning\nthis examination: “The hymenal orifice was edematous and enlarged.” It is Dr.\nMorris’ opinion that the edema and swelling noted are consistent with the date\nand description of the offence of July 22 -July 23, 2001 as described by J.L.Arrest of P.P.18. D.P. was arrested by the R.N.C. on July\n24, 2001. He was passed over to Constable Warren and Constable Tilley at 7:00\np.m. on this date. He was given his rights and caution and advised of the\ncharges against him. D.P. consented to provide buccal swabs, which were taken\nby Constable Tilley.19. D.P. gave a written cautioned statement\nto Constable Warren on July 24, 2001. In this statement, he denied having had\nany sexual contact with J.L. When he was questioned about the sexual assault on\nS.L., he told Constable Warren that he could not recall this incident.20. D.P. was released from custody on a\nrecognizance on July 30, 2001. On November 1, 2001, his recognizance was\ncancelled pursuant to Section 524(8) of the Criminal Code. On November\n1, 2001, he was convicted and sentenced to a total period of imprisonment of\nthirty (30) days on charges of breach of recognizance. D.P. has not since made\napplication for release.”[5]After the Agreed Statement of Facts was entered,\nconvictions were entered on both counts.[6]After the convictions were entered, I\nsubsequently sentenced Mr. P. to a total term of imprisonment of 5 years. At\nthe time I gave oral reasons and told both counsel that I would file a written\ndecision. This is the sentencing decision.[7]The applicable sections of the Criminal Code relating\nto sentencing are ss. 718, 718.1 and 718.2. They state:“718. Purpose - The fundamental\npurpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention\ninitiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and\nsafe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following\nobjectives:(a) to denounce\nunlawful conduct;(b) to deter the\noffender and other persons from committing offences;(c) to separate\noffenders from society, where necessary;(d) to assist in\nrehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide\nreparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f) to promote a\nsense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to\nvictims and to the community.“718.1 Fundamental principle - A\nsentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender.“718.2 Other sentencing principles -\nA court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the\nfollowing principles:(a) a sentence\nshould be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or\nmitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without\nlimiting the generality of the foregoing,(i) evidence\nthat the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race,\nnational or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or\nphysical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor, or(ii) evidence\nthat the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s spouse or\nchild,(iii) evidence\nthat the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority\nin relation to the victim, or(iv) evidence\nthat the offence was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in\nassociation with a criminal organization shall be deemed to be aggravating\ncircumstances;(b) a sentence\nshould be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar\noffences committed in similar circumstances;(c) where\nconsecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly\nlong or harsh;(d) an offender\nshould not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be\nappropriate in the circumstances; and(e) all\navailable sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the\ncircumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention\nto the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.”[8]The paramount objectives in sentencing for\ncircumstances such as this are deterrence, denunciation, rehabilitation and the\nprotection of the public. As well as these objectives, retribution,\ndistinguished from vengeance, confirms that sentences are also used to denounce\nthe conduct of the accused. In imposing sentence one has to be cognizant of the\ndelicate balance between society’s goals of sentencing against the\nblameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence. When weighing\nthese factors, the needs and current conditions of the community must also be\nconsidered.[9]Considering the circumstances in this case it is\napparent that both general and specific deterrence are the primary factors to\nbe considered. Certainly the sentence to be imposed will be greater than 2\nyears and, therefore, I do not have to consider the factors that might come\ninto play if the sentence were less than 2 years and I had to consider a\ncommunity-served sentence. Deterrence, both specific and general, demands a\nsentence in excess of 2 years.[10]In R. v. Atkins (K.J.) (1988), 1988 CanLII 201 (NL CA), 69 Nfld.\n\u0026 P.E.I.R. 99; 211 A.P.R. 99 (Nfld. C.A.), there is a checklist of factors\nto be considered when sentencing for sexual assault. The factors enumerated in Atkins\nare appropriate for both offences.1. The extent of the assault:[11]Both sexual assaults were serious, degrading and\nthe threats which were very real to both complainants, are very aggravating.2. The degree of violence or force used[12]In the case of both offences the complainants\nbelieved the threats to be real and there is no doubt that they both believed\nthat the accused was capable of carrying out his threats.3. The impact of the crime upon the\ncomplainants[13]The Victim Impact Statements quite vividly point\nout the effect of these assaults on both complainants and the obvious effect it\nis going to have on their lives.4. The degree of trust involved[14]In relation to J.L., the degree of trust that\nwas violated is serious. The Agreed Statement of Facts shows the serious breach\nof trust and the Victim Impact Statement in relation to J.L. shows the effect\nof the breach.5. Public abhorrence for the type of crime\ninvolvedThe facts as outlined relating to the nature of\nthe sexual assault, coupled with the threats, certainly amounts to the type of\ncrime that alarms a community.6. The attitude of the offender and the\nplea[15]The accused has pleaded guilty to the offences\nand has saved both complainants the trauma of a trial. However, they did\ntestify at the preliminary inquiry and have had the trial hanging over their\nheads for some time. Nevertheless, the guilty plea is a factor that I have\nconsidered.7. Biological and psychological factors[16]There is nothing before me regarding these\nfactors.8. The antecedents and age of the offender[17]I did not have the benefit of a presentence\nreport, as it was not requested by the defence. The accused is 27 years old and\nhas a record involving theft and driving offences, as well as breaches of\nundertaking in relation to this charge. Although he has a criminal record, this\nis not an aggravating factor, as the offences are really unrelated. I have been\ngiven nothing in the way of aggravating circumstances concerning the accused’s\nbackground.9. The need for specific and general\ndeterrence[18]Looking at the aggravating and mitigating\nfactors, the seriousness of the offences dictates a denunciatory sentence. The\noffences were sordid and repugnant and deterrence, both general and specific,\nmust be considered paramount over rehabilitation. Nevertheless, rehabilitation\nis a factor that has to be considered and balanced as well.10. Time spent in custody[19]The accused has been in custody on this charge\nfor approximately 6 1/2 months and I have taken that into consideration using\nthe normal formula of giving the accused credit for double the time served.11. Sentences imposed by other Courts[20]I have been given the following cases by both\ncounsel and have considered them when making my determination as to the range\nof sentence: R. v. Audet (1989), 1989 CanLII 4897 (NL SCTD), 78 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 123; 244 A.P.R.\n123 (Nfld. T.D.); R. v. Moorecroft (1985), 1985 CanLII 1861 (NL CA), 54 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 80;\n160 A.P.R. 80 (Nfld. C.A.); R. v. J.M. (1999), 1999 CanLII 19739 (NL SCTD), 173 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R.\n115; 530 A.P.R. 115 (Nfld. T.D.); R. v. Colley (B.J.) (1994), 41\nB.C.A.C. 232; 66 W.A.C. 232 (C.A.); R. v. Caouette (K.E.) (1994), 52\nB.C.A.C. 133; 86 W.A.C. 133 (C.A.); R. v. J.L.L. (1989), 1989 CanLII 4758 (SK CA), 76 Sask.R. 305\n(C.A.); R. v. Desbiens (1985), 1985 CanLII 2667 (SK CA), 43 Sask.R. 169 (C.A.); R. v. Vokey\n(H.A.) (2000), 2000 NFCA 14 (CanLII), 186 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 1; 564 A.P.R. 1 (Nfld. C.A.); R.\nv. R.W.B. (2000), 2000 NFCA 13 (CanLII), 185 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 212; 562 A.P.R. 212 (Nfld.\nC.A.); R. v. Samson (W.P.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 11067 (NL CA), 137 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 355; 428\nA.P.R. 355 (Nfld. T.D.); R. v. Curtis (S.F.) (2000), 2000 CanLII 28759 (NL SCTD), 192 Nfld. \u0026\nP.E.I.R. 179; 580 A.P.R. 179 (Nfld. C.A.); R. v. D.S. (1995), 1995 CanLII 10452 (NL SCTD), 127 Nfld.\n\u0026 P.E.I.R. 176; 396 A.P.R. 176 (Nfld. T.D.).[21]When I say I have considered these sentences, I\nhave viewed them in the light of the circumstances that were present for each\ncase. As has so often been said, “Each case must be determined on its own\nunique circumstances.” I conclude from the authorities that the range of\nsentence for the sexual assault involving J. is 2 to 4 years, and in relation\nto S., 3 to 5 years.12. Mitigating factors[22]It is very difficult to find any mitigating\nfactors in this case other than the plea. The accused’s actions in both charges\nare very serious.13. Analysis[23]As I have already stated, the primary factors to\nbe considered in this case are specific and general deterrence so as to achieve\nprotection for the public. Incarceration in this case will offer protection by\nisolating the accused from society for a period of years and likewise, society\nwill also be protected by deterring like-minded individuals from committing\nsimilar acts in the future. The Crown suggested a sentence of 6 years in total\nwould be appropriate and the defence’s position was for a sentence of less than\n4 years. In determining the length of the sentence, I have taken into\nconsideration, and given credit, for the 6 1/2 months which the accused spent\nin custody. Although I have not computed the credit with mathematical\ncertainty, I have considered and utilized the accepted formula of 2 to 1. As\nwell, because the sentences here are consecutive, I am required to consider\ntotality when tabulating the total sentence. Taking into consideration the\ncredit given for time served, as well as totality, I impose a sentence of 3\nyears for the sexual assault on S.L. and 2 years in relation to the charge\ninvolving J.L. These sentences are consecutive for a total sentence of 5 years.[24]In addition to the sentence imposed I am also\nordering authorization for the taking of bodily substances for forensic DNA\nanalysis as per s. 487.051(a) of the Criminal Code. That order is to be\ncarried out by the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary within 7 days after June 14,\n2002, or as soon as practicable.[25]Pursuant to s. 109(2) of the Criminal Code of\nCanada, D.P. is prohibited from:(a) Possessing any firearm, other than\nprohibited firearm or restricted firearm, any cross-bow, restricted weapon,\nammunition, and explosive substance commencing on the 29th day of May, A.D.,\n2002, and ending ten years after the release of D.E.D.P. from imprisonment for\nthe offences under Section 153 and Section 272 of the Criminal Code;(b) any prohibited firearm, restricted firearm,\nprohibited weapon, prohibited device and prohibited ammunition for life.[26]Judgment Accordingly.Accused sentenced."}

(1) An\naccused who is called on to plead may plead guilty or not guilty, or the\nspecial pleas authorized by this Part and no others.(1.1)A court may accept a plea of guilty only if it is satisfied that the accused(a) is making the plea voluntarily; and(b) understands(i)\nthat the plea is an admission of the essential elements of the offence,(ii)\nthe nature and consequences of the plea, and(iii)\nthat the court is not bound by any agreement made between the accused and the\nprosecutor.(1.2)The failure of the court to fully inquire whether the conditions set out in\nsubsection (1.1) are met does not affect the validity of the plea.[4]This amendment was proclaimed to come into force on September 23rd,\n2002.Accordingly, it was not in effect on June 24th, 2002 when Ms Ignacio entered her guilty plea.Consequently, the plea\ncomprehension inquiry contemplated by this amendment to section 606 of the Criminal\nCode was not carried out.In any event, as will be seen, from the\nevidence heard on this application, I am satisfied that Ms Ignacio\nunderstood the nature and consequences of her guilty plea, and that it\nconstituted an admission of the essential elements of the offence.There never\nhas been any indication that an agreement had been struck between counsel as to\nan appropriate sentence, and accordingly the issue touched on by subsection\n(1.1)(b)(iii) is moot in this case.APPLICATION TO WITHDRAW GUILTY PLEA[5]On March 11th, 2003 Ms Ignacio advised the Court\nthrough her then counsel, Mr. Scott Paler, that she wished to withdraw her\nplea of guilty and Mr. Paler withdrew as counsel of record.Mr. Bruce Gammon became counsel of record for Ms Ignacio and evidence\nwas heard on her application to withdraw her guilty plea on May 3rd, 2004 and on December 20th, 2004.[6]This matter was then adjourned for written argument.Although it was\ninitially anticipated that the arguments of both parties would be submitted to\nthe Court by February 18th, 2005, it was not until\nMarch 15th, 2005 that both arguments were in the hands of the\nCourt.PROCEEDINGS UP TO AND INCLUDING\nAPPLICATION TO WITHDRAW GULTY PLEA[7]In its Brief on the application, the Crown summarizes the Court\nproceedings on this charge up to March 11th, 2003 as follows:1.The\napplicant was charged that she did defraud Chin Na Dragon Institute between the\ndates of November 1, 1998 and November 30, 2000.On that information she was arrested on January 17, 2001 and\nreleased on a promise to appear for courtroom 119 on March 28, 2001.2.The\napplicant did not appear on March 28, 2001 at which time her\nnon-appearance was noted and the matter was adjourned to April 4, 2001.On\nthat date the applicant failed to appear and an endorsed warrant was issued for\nher arrest.3.That\nwarrant was executed on July 3, 2001 and she was released on a promise to\nappear for September 25, 2001 in courtroom 119.4.On\nJanuary 21, 2002 the applicant did not appear as previously directed to do\nso at which time an endorsed warrant was issued but ordered held to\nFebruary 4, 2002 @ 2:00 p.m. in courtroom 301 for her personal\nappearance.On that date the applicant did personally appear and the warrant\nthat was being held was cancelled.5.The\nmatter went over a few more times and on June 24, 2002 the applicant\nappeared before The Honourable Judge C. Newcombe at which time she entered a\nguilty plea to the offence currently before the court.The court ordered the\npreparation of a pre‑sentence report and the matter was adjourned to August 22, 2002\n@ 2:00 p.m. in courtroom 305 to permit the completion of the report.6.The\nmatter made two further appearances at which time it was noted that the\napplicant was not complying with her obligation to attend for the preparation\nof a pre‑sentence report.The matter was put over to November 4, 2002 @\n10:00 a.m. in courtroom 302 for her to personally appear on this matter.7.The\napplicant made a personal appearance on November 4, 2002 when representations were made on behalf of the applicant that she\nwould cooperate to permit the pre‑sentence report to be completed.The\nmatter was adjourned to December 19, 2002 for completion of the report and\nsentencing.8.The\napplicant did not attend court on December 19, 2002 at which time an unendorsed warrant was issued but held to\nDecember 30, 2002 @ 10:00 a.m. in courtroom 302.On that date the applicant did not\nappear and the warrant was struck for execution.9.The\noutstanding warrant was executed on February 17, 2003 at which time the\napplicant appeared in custody in courtroom 305.At the request of counsel, the\nmatter was adjourned to February 18,2003 @ 10:00 a.m. in courtroom\n305.On that date, the Crown opposed the release of the applicant, however she\nwas granted judicial interim release.The matter was then adjourned to March 11, 2003 @\n10:00 a.m. in courtroom 302.10.When\nthe matter appeared in court on March 11,2003 Mr. Scott Paler withdrew as\ncounsel of record.The applicant indicated to the court that she wished to\nretain new counsel as it was now her intention to withdraw her previously\nentered guilty plea.EXPLANATIONS FOR ACCUSED’S FAILURES TO APPEAR PRIOR TO\nGUILTY PLEA[8]No explanation appears to have been provided for Ms Ignacio’s\nfailures to appear on March 28th and April 4th,\n2001, which failures to appear resulted in a warrant for Ms Ignacio’s\narrest having been executed upon her on July 3rd, 2001.There\nwere, however, explanations provided to the Court for other of her failures to\nappear in Court prior to her plea of guilty on June 24th,\n2002.These explanations were as follows:[8a]On November 26th , 2001, Mr. Paler advised the Court that Ms Ignacio could not\nbe in Court because of car trouble.[8b]On January 21st,\n2002, Mr. Paler advised the Court that Ms Ignacio had called his\noffice advising that she was extremely ill and could not appear in Court.On\nthis occasion, Mr. Paler agreed to the issuance of a warrant to be held\nuntil the next Court appearance on February 4th, 2002.Ms Ignacio did appear in Court on February 4th, 2002 and\nthat warrant was cancelled.[8c]On April 16th,\n2002, Mr. Paler advised the Court that Ms Ignacio had contacted his\noffice from the Health Sciences Centre advising that her father had suffered a\nheart attack and that she would not be able to attend Court on that date.The\ncharge was then adjourned to June 24th, 2002 preemptory for a\nplea.That, of course, was the date on which Mr. Paler waived reading of\nthe election section, elected for trial in the Provincial Court; waived reading\nof the Information; and entered a guilty plea.Mr. Paler said in Court:The plea is one of\nguilty, I understand; is that correct?and Ms Ignacio answered “Yes”.To recap then, what can be described as reasonable\nexplanations were provided for Ms Ignacio’s failures to appear on November 26th, 2001; January 21st, 2002; and April 16th, 2002; but no explanations appear on the record for her\nfailures to appear March 28th and April 4th, 2001.CONTINUING PROBLEMS WITH MS IGNACIO’S ATTENDANCE IN COURT\nAND AT PROBATION APPOINTMENTS[9]After entering her guilty plea on June 24th, 2002, there continued to be a problem with Ms Ignacio’s appearances in Court.Further problems developed with regard to her attendances at appointments\narranged first with Restorative Resolutions, and then with Probation Services,\nfor the preparation of a pre‑sentence report.These can be detailed as\nfollows:[9a]On October 21st,\n2002, Mr. Paler advised the Court that Restorative Resolutions had decided\nthat Ms Ignacio’s case was not an appropriate one for them and that they\nhad referred it to Probation Services.He added that he understood that\nProbation Services was now having some difficulty with the matter.Mr. Paler also advised the Court that Ms Ignacio had called his voice\nmail on this day to say she was ill and could not appear.Ms Ignacio’s\nnon‑appearance was noted and the matter was adjourned to November 4th,\n2002 for her personal appearance.On that date, Ms Ignacio appeared and\nMr. Paler addressed the concerns which had been expressed by the probation\nofficer with regard to Ms Ignacio’s attendance to provide information for\nthe pre‑sentence report by explaining that Ms Ignacio said that on\nthe first two occasions that she had appointments with the probation officer\nthe probation officer was late and that on a third occasion the probation\nofficer was sick.Ms Ignacio added that she had tried to make an\nappointment with the probation officer in the morning, but that the probation\nofficer had advised that this was not possible.Ms Ignacio said she had a\nproblem in the afternoons because she had to pick her daughter up after school\nand that apparently her appointments with the probation officer had been set\nfor late in the afternoon.[9b]Although the representations\nmade by both Mr. Paler and Ms Ignacio to the Court on November 4th,\n2002 indicate that she was doing her best to cooperate with Probation Services,\nthe two letters from Restorative Resolutions, dated August 20, 2002 and\nSeptember 10, 2002, and a further letter from Probation Officer Diane-Lynn\nPetrash dated October 11, 2002, which were filed respectively as Exhibits\n2, 3 and 4 to this application, paint a very different picture.These letters\nare set out in Schedule I to this decision.WARRANT FOR ARREST DECEMBER 19, 2002[10]Another warrant was issued for Ms Ignacio December 19th,\n2002 when she failed to appear in Court and the matter was adjourned to\nDecember 30th, 2002.The warrant was held to that date, and\nwhen Ms Ignacio did not appear the matter was struck off the docket for\nexecution of the warrant.[11]When Ms Ignacio was arrested on the warrant and appeared in Court\non February 18th, 2003, she advised the Court through duty\ncounsel that she had tried to come to Court on December 30th,\n2002 but ended up in the ditch because of stormy weather.She also said that\nshe had tried to call Mr. Paler to tell him this, but apparently he did\nnot get the message.It can be noted that on this bail application the duty\ncounsel who appeared on Ms Ignacio’s behalf advised the Court during the\ncourse of his successful bail application that Ms Ignacio had “only been\noutstanding on these charges for a little over a month now, about a month and a\nhalf” and that “It’s not as if she’s been regularly missing Court”.It is\nunclear where duty counsel got this information.EVIDENCE ON APPLICATION[12]Ms Ignacio’s application to withdraw her guilty plea proceeded by\nway of viva voce evidence from Ms Ignacio on May 3rd , 2004.On agreement of counsel this matter was then adjourned to December 20th,\n2004 for the Crown to present its case in opposition to Ms Ignacio’s\napplication.The evidence which the Court heard on that date was that of\nMs Ignacio’s previous lawyer, Mr. Scott Paler.MS IGNACIO’S EVIDENCE[13]Ms Ignacio’s evidence was as follows:[13a]She says that the first time she\nmet with Mr. Paler she asked him what her choices were.She says he told\nher that if she pled guilty to the charge that she would probably get a\nsentence of house arrest for a period of two years.She says he also told her\nthat if she pled not guilty to the charge her parents would have to be called\nas witnesses.She said that, particularly because her father was not in good\nhealth, she did not want her parents to “go through that kind of stuff”.She\nsays that her meeting with Mr. Paler took only about half an hour and that\nshe entered a plea of guilty to the charge on her very next appearance in\nCourt.She says that she only had one meeting with Mr. Paler.[13b]She said that Mr. Paler\ntold her that if she pled not guilty and went to trial and was convicted, that\n“I would go to jail”.When she was asked by Mr. Gammon whether or not\nMr. Paler discussed with her the likelihood of her being found guilty, her\nresponse was “No, not really.”Ms Ignacio was also asked whether she ever\ngave Mr. Paler her version of what had happened.Her response was “maybe\nfive minutes worth”.[13c]Ms Ignacio indicated that\nbecause the complainant in the charge against her was Mr. Bell, who worked\nas a Sheriff’s Officer at the Law Courts and “knows everybody in this\nbuilding”, she felt that she had no chance of being acquitted.[13d]Ms Ignacio’s counsel asked\nher if Mr. Paler had gone through the particulars of the charge against\nher and specifically whether or not she had had a chance to review the police\nreports herself.She said that she did not, however when her counsel asked her\n“Did you understand what it was they were saying you did?”, herresponse was\n“Yes.”[13e]With regard to the specifics of\nthe fraud charge against her, Ms Ignacio says that at Mr. Bell’s\nrequest she started to do bookkeeping work for his martial arts club.She says\nthat Mr. Bell said he was busy and told her to “just sign” his name on\ncheques.She says that also at his request she paid some of the club’s bills\nherself and then, at Mr. Bell’s request, would “write (herself) out a\ncheque”.Ms Ignacio denied that there were ever any cheques from the club\nthat she signed and used for her own purposes.[13f]Ms Ignacio was asked about\nan exchange of letters between Mr. Bell and herself which were\nrespectively filed as Exhibits 6 and 7 to this application.Mr. Bell’s\nletter is dated October 26/00.It clearly refers to Ms Ignacio having\ntaken money from the club and what Mr. Bell refers to as Ms Ignacio’s\n“stupid excuse about stealing the money for 2½ years”.Mr. Bell says:\n“You’ve left me no choice but to charge you.”; and asks Ms Ignacio:“Do\nyou realize how many cheques you forged my name on?”[13g]The first two paragraphs of\nMs Ignacio’s undated letter of response read as follows:First of all, I would\nlike to apologize for everything.I know what I did was wrong and I don’t know\nhow many times I can ever say I’m sorry.You have every right to be angry with\nme and never speak to me again.But I would like to\nlet you know that not all I did was to use or take advantage of you.Throughout our whole relationship my motives were not all “not nice”.I cannot\ndefend what I did was right but I can defend myself about being a not so “nice”\nperson.There were many times I did things for you without having motives to\nmy advantage.Essentially the balance of the letter relates to the\npersonal relationships between Mr. Bell, Ms Ignacio and her daughter,\nand ends with a P.S. reading:P.S.Enclosed\nis a deposit slip with a $5000.00 cheque from me.You can have your accountant\nverify it.Ms Ignacio says that the $5,000.00 cheque referred to\nwas a loan from her to Mr. Bell to pay the property taxes on the martial\narts club property.She says she made this advance to Mr. Bell “’cause\nhe’s done stuff for me”.[13h]In cross-examination,\nMs Ignacio denied that her undated letter of apology to Mr. Bell\nfiled as Exhibit 7 was “in reference to the theft”.She was asked then what it\nwas she was apologizing for, and the following exchange occurred during her\ncross-examination:AFor\neverything.You have to feel sorry for him.He was a sick man and I have\ncaused him all this trouble.Like, I mean, read the letter; he was very\nbitter.QHe\nwas very bitter about a number of, the fraudulent transactions that occurred at\nhis business?AAnd\nplus criticizing me about my daughter, how I raise her.QThat’s\ncorrect.But I just want to make it clear that when you apologize, you don’t\nsay, I’m apologizing for raising my daughter badly?AI\ndon’t – I don’t specifically say what I’m apologizing for.[13i]Mr. Gammon’s\nexamination-in-chief of Ms Ignacio was concluded with the following\nquestion and answer:QAnd\ncan you just tell us again why it is that you pled guilty even though you\nweren’t guilty?AI\nhad no choice.Basically, the way I understood it, talking with\nMr. Paler, there was no choice.[13j]In cross-examination, it was\nacknowledged by Ms Ignacio that Mr. Paler went over the allegations\nwith her; told her she had “her choices”; and told her:This is what it is if\nit’s guilty and this is what it is if it’s not guilty.Ms Ignacio acknowledged that by pleading guilty she\nwas admitting that she had done what they said she did, but she says that\nMr. Paler knew that she did not want to admit to it:ABecause\nI know -- yes, I told him.I says:I’m not guilty.But I don’t -- I was\nunder a lot of pressure.I had to, because I had told him who this\nMr. Bell knows.I says, what are the chances?He says, well, we don’t\nknow, we have to go to trial.[13k]With regard to the pre‑sentence\nreport which was ordered by the Court after Ms Ignacio entered her guilty\nplea, Ms Ignacio says that she met with the probation officer twice for\nabout 30 minutes on both occasions.Mr. Moar asked her in\ncross-examination:QAnd\nI take it that during these meetings with her you would have told her, you know\nwhat, I’m not really guilty of these offences?Ms Ignacio responded that:I don’t think we even\ngot that far.She indicated that the probation officer was asking her\nabout the background of the situation as to how she and Mr. Bell became\nacquainted.Ms Ignacio indicates that she was simply responding to questions\nput to her by the probation officer.[13l]Ms Ignacio gave\nexplanations for not being available for meetings with both Ms Gordon of\nRestorative Resolutions and with Ms Petrash of Probation Services.With\nregard to Ms Gordon, she says that Ms Gordon had not made a schedule\nof appointments for her; that she (Ms Ignacio) then went on vacation; and\nthat when she returned Ms Gordon went on vacation and “she never contacted\nme after that”.[13m] With regard to Ms Petrash,\nshe says she had two brief meetings with her but that a third meeting did not\ntake place because Ms Petrash’s office contacted her and advised that\nMs Petrash was ill.She says that then she and her family went out to\n“the cabin” for the Thanksgiving weekend (from Wednesday to Sunday) and when\nshe came back there was a message on her telephone answering machine from\nMs Petrash saying that she had tried to contact her but that “you didn’t\nanswer”.Ms Petrash also apparently said she was going to write a letter\nto the judge.Ms Ignacio says she called back to Ms Petrash and left\na message for her advising that she had been at the cabin, and had not received\nMs Petrash’s message.Ms Ignacio was asked what she did as a result\nof Ms Petrash having advised in her telephone message that she would be\nclosing Ms Ignacio’s file.She responded:Well,\nI figured Mr. Paler would contact me.The following exchange then occurred:QYou didn’t\nphone him yourself, I take it?AI\nphoned him, but there’s always -- he’s in court, he’ll give me a call back.He\nnever does.But I’ve never seen that letter.The last time I saw that letter\nwas when we went to Mr. Paler’s office to photocopy everything that he\nhad.That was the only time I saw that letter.[13n]Ms Ignacio says that after\nher problems with Probation Services she spoke to Mr. Paler, “and I had\ntold him my side of the story”.The following exchange then occurred in\ncross-examination:QBut\nagain, you didn’t tell Mr. Paler again that I’m, I’m not guilty of this\noffence, why am going through this?ABecause\nwe had already decided that I was to plead guilty.[13o]Further during\ncross-examination, Ms Ignacio said that from the time of her guilty plea\nin June of 2002 until Mr. Paler withdrew as her counsel of record on March 11th, 2003 she had not been told by Mr. Paler that it was\nreported that she was not cooperating with Probation Services.She was then\nasked why it was then that “all of a sudden” she told Mr. Paler that she\nwanted to change her plea and she said:ABecause\nwhat happened was, when they had arrested me they put me in the remand centre\nfor two days, two, three days, and as you know, my parents never knew anything\nabout it, nobody knew what was happening.And when that happened, everybody\nknew.Right.Everybody found out.So when I got out of the remand centre,\n‘cause my mom had to get me out…QUm-hum.AWe\nhad a discussion between my parents and my boyfriend, and they told me, what is\nthis all about, how come you never told us, because --She further says:…And they asked me straight\nin my face and said, did you do it, Maria?I said, no.Then why did you plead\nguilty?Because I had no choice.I didn’t want to put them through so much\nhell of going through all the stuff because I just know everything is basically\nyour guts will be taken inside out and I didn’t want them to go through that.I didn’t want my family to go through that.Ms Ignacio acknowledged that this was the first time\nafter she had entered a guilty plea that she told anyone that she wanted to\nchange her mind and plead not guilty.[13p]The following rather interesting\nexchange then occurred between Ms Ignacio and her counsel in the course of\nre‑examination by Mr. Gammon:QDid\nyou ever change what you had told him?Did you tell him, at some point, that\nyou were, in fact, guilty?AIn\ncourt?QNo,\nin your interview with Mr. Paler, before you went into court to plead\nguilty did you tell him that you were guilty and you wanted to plead guilty?AIt\nwas already -- we had talked in the office and that was it.Like, we never\nreally discussed it after that.QDid\nyou tell him that in the office, is my question.AIn\nthe office?QYes,\nthat you were guilty.AI’m\npleading guilty, yes.In further cross-examination following this re‑examination,\nMs Ignacio was asked if after telling Mr. Paler that she was not\nguilty that she then told Mr. Paler she was going to plead guilty.Ms Ignacio responded:Because\nafter the discussion we weighed the situation, like, what choices do I have; I\nhave no choice but to plead guilty.She was then asked if Mr. Paler did not then ask her\nany more questions about her guilt.She responded that he did not.EVIDENCE OF MR. SCOTT PALER[14]The Crown called Mr. Scott Paler as a witness.Mr. Paler has\na reputation in the Manitoba courts as an experienced and highly-competent\ncriminal defence lawyer.He testified that he was Ms Ignacio’s counsel\nfrom late 2001 until 2003, and represented her when she entered a plea of\nguilty to the fraud charge on June 24th, 2002.Mr. Paler\ngave his evidence on the clear understanding that his ex‑client,\nMs Ignacio, had not waived her solicitor-client privilege in connection\nwith communications between them.The Crown did not contend that in the\nparticular circumstances of this case (Ms Ignacio having testified as to\nwhat she and Mr. Paler had discussed), that Mr. Paler could be\ncompelled to testify about these communications because Ms Ignacio had\nimpliedly waived her privilege.This issue was only referred to obliquely in\nthe comments of Mr. Gammon set out at paragraph [18].Accordingly,\nMr. Paler’s evidence for the most part dealt only with his “usual\npractice” in representing people charged with criminal offences.[15]Mr. Paler advised that his practice is to review the particulars of\na criminal charge with a client verbally and that occasionally “I’ll provide\nthem with copies of particulars if it seems appropriate”.He says that before\na plea is entered he meets with his client to discuss what plea should be\nentered.He says that he does this in connection with “each and every case\nprior to Court”.His practice is further to review the allegations with the\nclient and discuss “their side of the story”.He further reviews the legal\nissues that may or may not come up; what their plea options are; and what the Crown’s\nposition on sentencing might be if the case is resolved.He also says:…There\nare procedural issues that you have to review with clients with respect to when\nsentencing will take place or whether or not there should be a pre‑sentence\nreport involved, and things of that nature.[16]Mr. Paler was asked what he would do in a situation where a client\nhad said that they were not guilty and had not wavered from that position and\nthen decided when they came to Court to plead guilty at that time.His\nresponse was:Well,\nthere’s a, there’s a difficulty with part of your question.I mean, obviously,\nif a client is of the view that they’re not guilty of an offence, that’s,\nthat’s one issue.But clients aren’t lawyers; there have been times when a\nclient’s approached me, and I’m sure it’s happened to countless other counsel,\nwhere they’ll say:I’m not guilty of an assault, I only pushed her.And of\ncourse, so your guilt with respect to an offence is, to some degree, a matter\nof opinion or a legal issue to be determined, and sometimes the client’s\nposition on that isn’t determinative.But certainly, if a client indicates\nto me that they are not guilty and I don’t have a difficulty with that, then\nthe only option you have is to set a hearing date.(Emphasis\nadded)[17]When he was asked a question of clarification of his comment,\nMr. Paler added:Well,\ncertainly if a client’s denying the elements of the offence, I have no choice\nbut to set a trial date and contest the matter.(Emphasis\nadded)[18]Mr. Paler confirmed that he met with Ms Ignacio prior to her\nentering a plea in this matter.The following exchange then occurred between\nMr. Moar and Mr. Paler:QAnd,\nin fact, the meeting was some five-minutes long, in --ANo,\nthat’s not correct.At this point Mr. Gammon rose and addressed the Court as\nfollows:We’re\ngetting into the area where waiver becomes an issue, and clearly insofar as the\nquestions of Ms. Ignacio require a response of her counsel on ethical and\nother bases, then a waiver can be implied.Because Mr. Paler has put it\non me or suggested that responsibility is mine to rise and object, I do so at\nthis point so that he can be aware, as he moves into area that may not be\nwithin the area of that implicit waiver, that privilege is an issue.[19]The following exchange then occurred between Mr. Moar and\nMr. Paler:QYou met with Ms. Ignacio on\na particular date.Do you have a recollection of her explanation taking five\nminutes, or that she was only accorded five minutes to give you an explanation?AI\nmet with Ms. Ignacio on these matters on February the 13th, 2002,\nI expect.We -- according to the time records I keep at my office, the\ninterview was approximately an hour and that fits with my recollection.As far\nas what proportion of that time was spent with me talking or with her talking,\nI can’t honestly say I recall what proportion.When Mr. Paler was advised that\nMs Ignacio in her testimony said that she met with Mr. Paler on only\none occasion prior to entering her guilty plea, he responded:She\nonly met me on one occasion in my office.There were certainly other\ndiscussions that occurred with respect to her case in and around various court\nappearances that she was making.Mr. Paler also confirmed that discussions\nbetween Ms Ignacio and himself occurred on more than one occasion\nconcerning potential pleas.[20]Mr. Moar quoted certain further portions of Ms Ignacio’s\nevidence on this application and the following exchange occurred between\nMr. Moar and Mr. Paler:That’s\nan answer that Ms. Ignacio gave in which she indicates clearly that she\ntold you, I’m not guilty.Do you have a recollection of her saying to you,\nduring discussions, that, I’m not guilty?ASorry,\nYour Honour, because I have a concern with respect to the specifics of this\nquestion without privilege being waived.[21]Mr. Paler did, however, confirm that:…certainly\nI can tell you that I discussed the case with her on more than one occasion.[22]The following exchange then occurred between Mr. Moar and\nMr. Paler:QAll\nright.Let me ask you this, and this is just… Prior to an individual entering\na plea of guilt…AYes.QIt\nwould be safe to say, as yourself as counsel, first of all, that you’d have to\nbe of the view that they understand what the allegation is against them?AYes.QThat\nyou’ve had an opportunity to discuss that allegation with them?AYes.QAnd\nthat if they are entering a guilty plea, would it be safe to say that you would\nhave satisfied yourself in general, in all cases, that the material elements of\nthe offence have been met?AYes.QAnd\nthat the individuals entering guilty pleas have done so voluntarily?In other\nwords, you don’t go and force people, twist their arms or tell them that they\nshould plead guilty or not?AI\ncertainly don’t.I, I can’t account for what others might do.QNo,\nno, I appreciate.But yourself?AYes.QAnd\nthat if an individual told you that, I’m not guilty, as indicated, you’d set a\ntrial date?AYes.[23]In cross-examination, Mr. Gammon asked Mr. Paler a couple of\nquestions about specific statements made by Ms Ignacio to Mr. Paler\nduring her consultations with him:[23a]Mr. Gammon established with\nMr. Paler that during the course of Mr. Paler’s conversations with\nMs Ignacio she had spoken to him “about the power that Mr. Bell, she\nperceived, had…within the courts” and with regard to “his potential ability to\naffect the outcome of a trial”.Mr. Paler confirmed that this\nconversation had taken place between he and Ms Ignacio on February 13th,\n2002.[23b]Mr. Gammon also established\nwith Mr. Paler that during his discussions with Ms Ignacio she had\nspoken to him about her concern respecting the impact of a guilty plea on her\nfamily.He also acknowledged that she had “expressed a concern about the\nhealth and well-being of her father at that point and that she was living with\nhim”.[24]Mr. Paler was also asked in cross-examination by Mr. Gammon\nwhether or not he had encountered instances during the course of his general\npractice where a client had entered a guilty plea, but after having entered the\nplea then told him that they were not guilty.He was asked “That happens as\nwell, correct?”Mr. Paler responded as follows:The,\nthe instances I can think of that happening are typically when an individual\nhas entered a plea and actually there’s been a pre‑sentence report\nordered and at some point the concern is raised because an accused person who’s\nentered a guilty plea isn’t accepting responsibility for some particular part\nof the allegation or even the whole of the allegation on occasion; but typically,\nthat’s what happen is, is you may end up getting pre‑sentence report back\nwhere the probation officer indicates that the person isn’t accepting\nresponsibility for what they understood the person to have pled guilty to.Mr. Paler said that such a scenario had\noccurred on “a couple of occasions” during the course of his practice.THE LAW[25]The leading case on the law in Canada relating to the withdrawal of a\nguilty plea continues to be Adgey v. The Queen (1973), 23\nC.R.N.S. 29 (S.C.C.).In a fairly recent decision, Her Honour Judge Linda\nGiesbrecht of the Provincial Court of Manitoba makes reference to the Adgey\ncase, and other relevant decisions.Judge Giesbrecht’s outlining of the law in\nthis area is succinct and accurate.It reads as follows:[31]It\nis clear that at any time before sentence is imposed a Court has the power to\npermit a plea of guilty to be withdrawn.The decision as to whether or not to\nallow a guilty plea to be withdrawn rests in the discretion of the judge to\nwhom the application is made.That discretion must be exercised judicially:Thibodeau\nv. The Queen, (1955) 1955 CanLII 57 (SCC), 21 C.R. 265 (S.C.C.) at p. 275.Whether an\naccused will be permitted to withdraw his or her guilty plea will depend on the\ncircumstances of each particular case.[32]The\nsignificance and effect of a guilty plea must be acknowledged.In Adgey v.\nThe Queen (2973) 23 C.R.N.S. 29 (S.C.C.) Dickson J. (as he then was) stated\nat p. 303:“In pleading guilty an\naccused admits having done that with which he is charged.”[33]Laskin J.\n(as he then was) in dissent in the Adgey case said the following about a\nguilty plea at p. 308:“A plea of guilty carries an admission that the\naccused so pleading has committed the crime charged and a consent to a\nconviction being entered without any trial.The accused by such a plea\nrelieves the Crown of the burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\nabandons his non-compellability as a witness and his right to remain silent and\nsurrenders his right to offer full answer and defence to a charge.It is\nimportant, therefore, that the plea be made voluntarily and upon a full\nunderstanding of the nature of the charge and its consequences, and that\nit be unequivocal.”(Emphasis added)[34]In\nR. v. T. (R) (1992), 1992 CanLII 2834 (ON CA), 17 C.R. (4th) 247 (Ont. C.A.) at pp.\n251-2 Doherty J.A. set out the requirements of a valid guilty plea as follows:“To\nconstitute a valid guilty plea, the plea must be voluntary and unequivocal.The plea must also be informed, that is the accused must be aware of the nature\nof the allegations made against him, the effect of his plea, and the\nconsequences of his plea…”[35]Doherty J.A.\nthen stated at p. 253 that a voluntary guilty plea requires “the conscious\nvolitional decision of the accused to plead guilty for reasons which he or she regards\nas appropriate.”[36]In\nan application to withdraw a guilty plea the onus is on the accused to persuade\nthe Court on a balance of probabilities that the plea should be withdrawn.[37]Some\nof the earlier cases seem to suggest that a guilty plea should only be\nwithdrawn where one of the following situations exists:1.Where the accused did not appreciate the nature of the\ncharge or did not intend to admit that he was guilty of it, and therefore the\nplea was entered in error;2.Where upon the admitted facts the accused could not in\nlaw have been convicted of the offence charged; or3.Where the plea was entered under\nimproper inducements or threats.[38]It\nis clear, however, from a review of later cases that the discretion vested in\nthe judge in applications of this kind is much broader.In R. v. Bamsey\n(1960) 1960 CanLII 35 (SCC), 32 C.R. 218 (S.C.C.) at p. 222 Ritchie J. for the Court stated that an\naccused should be permitted to withdraw his or her guilty plea if he or she\nsatisfies the Court that there are “valid grounds” for being permitted to do\nso.This statement was cited with approval by Dickson J. in the Adgey\ncase, and he then went on to say at p. 301:“It\nwould be unwise to attempt to define all that which might be embraced within\nthe phrase ‘valid grounds’.I have indicated above some of the circumstances\nwhich might justify the Court in permitting a change of plea.The examples\ngiven are not intended to be exhaustive.”[39]The\nexamples referred to by Dickson J. as justifying the withdrawal of a guilty\nplea were set out at p. 301 as follows:“…the\nevidence may indicate that the accused never intended to admit to a fact which\nis an essential ingredient of the offence with which he is charged or he may\nhave misapprehended the effect of the guilty plea or never intended to plead\nguilty at all, in any of which events the judge may in his discretion direct\nthat a plea of not guilty be entered or permit the accused to withdraw his\noriginal plea and enter a new one.”[40]In Manitoba the\nleading authority on withdrawal of guilty pleas is R. v Santos (1985), 34 Man. R. (2d) 9 (C. A.).In R. v. Jawbone, a May 26, 1998 decision\nof the Manitoba Court of Appeal the Santos case was referred to and Scott C.J.M. for the Court\nstated:“The\ncircumstances justifying the exercise of such a discretion are not confined to\ncircumstances where there is a suggestion of impropriety or error in the formal\nplea itself, rather ‘valid grounds’ …for the accused being permitted to\nwithdraw his plea should not be too narrowly defined or rigidly applied.The\nessential question to be determined in each case is whether it is justified in\nthe interests of justice.”[41]One\nimportant factor to consider on applications of this kind is whether the\naccused was represented by counsel at the time the guilty plea was entered.In\nBrosseau v. The Queen, 1968 CanLII 59 (SCC), [1969] 3 C.C.C. 129 (S.C.C.), the Court\nconsidered the duty of inquiry resting on a judge before whom a guilty plea is\nentered.The majority of the Court held that where there is reason to doubt\nthat the accused understands what he or she is doing when entering a guilty\nplea, the judge should satisfy him or herself that the accused understands the\nnature of the charge and the effect of the plea.The Court indicated that such\nan inquiry, however, is rarely necessary where an accused is represented by\ncounsel.[42]Thus, where an accused pleads guilty with\nthe benefit of counsel the onus on the accused to establish that the guilty\nplea was invalid is a particularly heavy one.[26]Mr. Gammon in his Brief on behalf of Ms Ignacio cites the\nFebruary 1st, 2002 decision of Mr. Justice Hill of the\nOntario Superior Court of Justice in R. v. Moser 2002 CanLII 49649 (ON SC), 2002\nCarswellOnt. 487, 163 C.C.C. (3d) 286 at paragraphs 29-43 in support of the\nproposition that:The\ntrial judge has a broad discretion to make inquiries in determining whether or\nnot to accept a guilty plea.The entry of a guilty plea is a monumental event\nin the trial of a criminal charge.The effect of the plea is to waive and\nremove basic and essential rights given to protect the innocent from\nconviction.The purpose of making such inquiries is to assist in protecting\nthe innocent by ensuring guilty pleas are:a.Unequivocal;b.Voluntary; and,c.Informed.[27]Paragraphs 40 to 43 of this decision read as follows:[40]It may be that following a plea of guilt, otherwise appearing\nvalid when entered, circumstances arise which call into question the actual\nvalidity of the plea.Where the circumstances are made known to the trial\ncourt, the presiding justice is empowered with a discretion to conduct an\ninquiry into whether the plea should be rejected or struck and the case proceed\nto trial: Adgey v. R., supra at 189-191, per Dickson J.; Regina\nv. C.(N.), supra at para. 10.Frequently referred to as an Adgey\nhearing; the inquiry focuses on that feature of the existing record, or as\namplified, which may reasonably hold real potential to conflict with an\nunequivocal, voluntary, and informed plea.There is no absolute or\nunrestricted right to have a guilty plea withdrawn.The onus, in the sense of\nthe burden of persuasion, is upon the accused: R. v. Eastmond, supra\nat para. 6, 7; R. v. Djekic, supra at 575; Regina v. C.(N.),\nsupra at para. 6, 9.[41]Statements made in the course of the court’s inquiry into the\nfacts supporting the allegations immediately following a plea of guilt,\nalthough not admitted by the Crown, may justify the court in rejecting the\nguilty plea: Adgey v. R., supra at 189; Regina v. C.(N.), supra\nat para. 10.At times, subsequent statements by the accused to others may\nraise the spectre of conflict with the guilty plea: R. v. Eastmond, supra\n(statement to pre-sentence report author); Regina v. T (R.), supra\n(statement to newspaper reporter).[42]We must have finality to proceedings unless the demands of\njustice dictate otherwise: R. v. Closs (1998), 1998 CanLII 1921 (ON CA), 105 O.A.C. 392 (Ont. C.A.\n[In Chambers]) at para. 394 per Carthy J.A.Exceptional\ncircumstances calling into question the validity of a guilty plea warrant a\njudicious exercise of discretion to inquire into the legitimacy of the plea.At the same time, the court must be vigilant that an experienced criminal not\nbe allowed to abandon a position when matters “did not play out as expected”: R.\nv. Dallaire, supra at para. 5-6.In other words, a valid guilty\nplea must not be disturbed by a calculated scheme designed to manipulate the\nsystem: R. v. Gurney, [2001] O.J. No. 2227 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 1, per\ncuriam.[43]While the accused carries the burden of persuading the court\nthe plea is invalid and ought to be withdrawn, the jurisprudence is not clear\nas to the standard of persuasion.Some authorities advocate a balance of\nprobabilities standard (R. v. C. (S.), supra at para. 13; R.\nv. Thawer, [1996] O.J. No. 989 (Ont. Prov. Div.) at para. 36 per\nOmatsu J.; R. v. Mikalishen, [1996] B.C.J. No. 2541 (B.C. Prov.\nCt.) at para. 51 per Stansfield J.) while other cases apply a “heavy\nonus” or “heavy burden” hurdle for the accused (R. v. Dallaire, supra\nat para. 7; R. v. Lamoureux (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 101 (Que. C.A.), at\n106 per Rothman J.A.; R. v. Samms, [1992] N.J. No. 344 (Nfld.\nC.A.) at para. 8 per Gushue J.A. (as he then was)).While the quality\nof the evidence prompting the striking or withdrawal of a guilty plea cannot be\nspeculative, suspect, or lacking in credibility and reliability, I would\nhesitate to place the burden of persuasion at a point threatening adjudicative\nfairness.Whatever the standard for appellate intervention, I am content that\nwhere a trial judge has a real doubt as to the plea’s validity, the court\nshould strike the plea and send the case to trial.[28]On the issue of the onus on the applicant Mr. Moar cites R.\nv. Olson, [1980] 1 W.W.R. 279, a decision of His Honour Judge\nGraeme Garson of the Provincial Court of Manitoba.The headnote for this case\noutlines the factual situation, and reads as follows:The\naccused was charged with five charges of unlawful confinement and several other\ncharges arising out of a hostage-taking incident.He met eight times with his\nlawyer, who told him he was meeting with the Attorney General’s department\nconcerning the charges.When the accused and his counsel appeared in court he\npleaded guilty to the five charges of unlawful confinement and the Crown\nimmediately thereafter stayed the remaining charges.The\naccused later claimed he had not understood that he was pleading guilty to the\nfive charges.He changed lawyers and applied to withdraw the guilty pleas.His original lawyer was not called to testify.Held –\nThe application was denied.While\nthe court had the discretion to allow an accused to withdraw a guilty plea, in\nthis case the accused, in the absence of testimony from his former lawyer, had\nnot discharged the onus of proving that a misunderstanding as to the nature of\nhis guilty plea was probably and likely true.[29]At pages 287 and 288 of the decision Judge Garson makes the following\nobservations about the onus on an application to withdraw a guilty plea, and\nconcludes his decision as follows:During\nthe course of counsel’s submissions it was acknowledged that the onus of proof\nwas on the accused to make out his application for withdrawal of plea.Discussion was then had between the bench and counsel as to the standard of\nproof the accused had to meet in order to discharge the onus upon him.In\nshort, does he have to produce evidence to establish by a preponderance of\nevidence that his assertions are probably true or, alternatively, simply adduce\nevidence sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the court’s mind that he did\nnot appreciate the nature of the plea that he was entering?Put another way,\ndoes the accused have to establish that his version is probably true or only\nthat it might be true?With\nrespect to this evidentiary burden I have been unable to find any case on the\npoint.However, as indicated above, I am of the view that the presumption at\ncommon law that counsel’s representations are binding upon a client is so\ningrained in our judicial system that such a presumption should only be\noverturned by evidence sufficient to establish an accused’s version by a\nbalance of probabilities.In\nholding thus I am aware that from a practical point of view I have indirectly\nincreased the accused’s evidentiary burden to an even greater degree than\nrequiring he prove his assertions upon a balance of probabilities or a\npreponderance of evidence.This greater or extra burden upon the accused\nresults from the court’s natural and, I believe, proper bias, or indeed\npresumption, that a member of the bar exercising reasonable professional skills\nwould not do anything that would be inimical to his client’s interests or\nrights.This\ncourt bias, or presumption, in favour of the ethical and lawful\nresponsibilities of counsel is usually attacked by a client’s charges of\nnegligence, incompetence or dereliction of duty.These are issues that are\neasily understood and ascertained.But in the present case the accused comes\nbefore the court without specific complaint as to the conduct of his counsel.There\nis no question that situations arise where there is a legitimate misunderstanding\nbetween counsel and accused as to the nature of his plea.But in every\nreported case that I have been able to find and to review in the limited time\nthat I have had to consider this matter, I can find no instance where the\naccused has not sought the assistance of his original counsel to provide the\ncourt with sworn evidence, either viva voce or by affidavit, corroborating in\nsome material particular that the accused may have misunderstood the\nproceedings or that there were circumstances existing that would provide the\npotential for misunderstanding.The cases of Brosseau v. R., supra, R.\nv. Hansen, supra, and R. v. Stork, [1975] W.W.D. 127, 31 C.R.N.S.\n395, 24 C.C.C. (2d) 210 (B.C.C.A.), are illustrative.In each case there was\nevidence given by a counsel of record to the effect that there may have been a\npotentiality for misunderstanding by the accused, either because of personal or\nsituational factors.I\nwould not go so far as to say that under no circumstances can an accused\nestablish misunderstanding as to nature of his plea without the assistance of\nhis original counsel, but I do think that it would be the rare case indeed.In\nthe case at hand, I find that Mr. Olson’s version as to what occurred\nbetween him and Mr. T. and his consequent misunderstanding may be true.But I am not satisfied that it is probably and likely true.Accordingly, his\napplication is denied and his guilty pleas will remain affixed on the record.REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF MS IGNACIO’S EVIDENCE[30]On a review of Ms Ignacio’s evidence it can be noted that she\nacknowledges:[30a]She knew what it was that she was being charged\nwith.[30b]Mr. Paler went over her\noptions with her and advised her what would be likely to happen if she pled\nguilty or if she pled not guilty and was convicted after trial.[30c]He did not apparently press her\none way or another as to what her plea should be, and when she asked what her\nchances were on fighting the charge, he told her:…Well, we don’t know,\nwe have to go to trial.Accordingly, it would appear that when Ms Ignacio\nadvised the Court that she plead guilty because “I had no choice.Basically,\nthe way I understood it, talking with Mr. Paler, there was no choice”,\nwhat Ms Ignacio is really saying is that in her own view she had no choice\nbut to plead guilty, and that this was not something pressed upon her by her\ncounsel.[30d]In that portion of\nMs Ignacio’s cross-examination, which is referred to in paragraph [13h],\nit would appear that Ms Ignacio is acknowledging that fraudulent transactions\noccurred at Mr. Bell’s business in the following question and answer:QHe\nwas very bitter about a number of, the fraudulent transactions that occurred at\nhis business?AAnd\nplus criticizing me about my daughter, how I raise her.(Emphasis\nadded)The wording of this answer would appear to constitute a\nvery significant psychic slip on the part of Ms Ignacio, with the\nimplication being that she was acknowledging that there were fraudulent\ntransactions at Mr. Bell’s business.IMPLICATIONS FROM MR. PALER’S\nEVIDENCE[31]As has been noted, Mr. Paler’s evidence was essentially directed\ntowards “his usual practice” in representing people charged with criminal\noffences.Nevertheless, his evidence directly contradicted Ms Ignacio’s\ntestimony on the following points:[31a]Mr. Paler says that his\nmeeting with Ms Ignacio in his office was approximately one hour, and not\nthe half hour that Ms Ignacio referred to.He did not clearly contradict\nMs Ignacio’s contention that she was only able to give Mr. Paler\n“five minutes worth” of her version of what happened; but the possibility of\nhis having limited his client to such a short exposition of her position to him\nseems most unlikely.[31b]Mr. Paler also contradicted\nMs Ignacio’s indication that this was the only discussion about the\ncharges which she had with Mr. Paler.He mentioned that there were a\nnumber of other meetings that he had with her during the protracted course of\nher appearances in this matter.[32]With regard to Ms Ignacio’s contention that she told Mr. Paler\nthat she was not guilty of the offences she was charged with, and that she did\nnot wish to plead guilty to those charges, there is a clear implication from\nMr. Paler’s evidence as to his usual practice that he would never have\nbeen a party to Ms Ignacio entering a guilty plea in those circumstances\nand that, rather, he would have set the matter down for trial.[33]As set out in paragraph [24], Mr. Paler was asked by\nMr. Gammon in cross-examination whether or not he had encountered\ninstances where a client had entered a guilty plea but later told him that they\nwere not guilty.Mr. Paler advised that typically this type of situation\nwould arise where a pre‑sentence report has been ordered and the accused\nperson advises the probation officer that they are not accepting responsibility\nfor some particular part of the allegation.He also said that such a scenario\nhad occurred in the course of his practice “on a couple of occasions”.It\nwould appear clear that Ms Ignacio’s situation could not have been one of\nthese “couple of occasions” insofar as her evidence was clearly to the effect\nthat she never told either of the two probation officers with whom she had\ncontact in anticipation of the preparation of a pre‑sentence report that\nshe was not guilty of the offence to which she had pled guilty.CONCLUSIONS ON LAW AND EVIDENCE[34]I conclude that Ms Ignacio’s guilty plea in this matter was\nvoluntary and unequivocal.Further, it was an informed plea in the sense that\nMs Ignacio was well aware of the nature of the allegations against her,\nthe effect of her plea and the probable consequences of her plea.This is not\na situation where a guilty plea was entered in error.[35]It has not been demonstrated that upon the admitted facts the accused\ncould not in law have been convicted of the offence, nor has there been any\nindication that this plea was entered under improper inducements or threats.[36]Early in her examination-in-chief, Ms Ignacio was led through the\nfollowing questions and answers by Mr. Gammon:QSo\nI think you’ve said there were, there were three things that were playing on\nyour mind at the time you entered this.You -- your father had had a heart\nattack?AUm-hum.QYou\nsaid your family, you didn’t want your family to know and to put them through\nthat, and you’ve indicated that you didn’t feel that you had much of a chance\n--ANo.Q--\nbecause of who Mr. Bell was; is that, is that accurate?Was there ‑‑AYes.Q--\nwere there anything else playing on your mind at the time that you entered the\nplea?ANo.As indicated in paragraphs 34 and 35 of the Adgey\ndecision previously quoted, a valid guilty plea must be voluntary, unequivocal\nand informed.It must also be:…the\nconscious volitional decision of the accused to plead guilty for reasons which\nhe or she regards as appropriate.It would seem that the reasons set out in the\nquote above from Ms Ignacio’s evidence were reasons which Ms Ignacio\nregarded as appropriate.[37]I bear in mind the caution from the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R.\nv. Jawbone that valid grounds for withdrawing a plea of guilty “should\nnot be too narrowly defined or rigidly applied” and “the essential question to\nbe determined in each case is whether it is justified in the interests of\njustice”.In this case, it appears to me that a withdrawal of the guilty plea\ncannot be justified in the interest of justice.Rather, the whole of the\nevidence in this case points towards Ms Ignacio simply having manipulated\nthe system to delay matters as long as she could and that she now wishes to add\ninsult to injury by attempting to withdraw her guilty plea at the last possible\nmoment in an effort to start the process off anew.[38]In R. v. Moser, it is stated:I am\ncontent that where a trial judge has a real doubt as to the plea’s validity,\nthe court should strike the plea and send the case to trial.It is also stated:While the quality of\nthe evidence prompting the striking or withdrawal of a guilty plea cannot be\nspeculative, suspect, or lacking in credibility and reliability, I would\nhesitate to place the burden of persuasion at a point threatening adjudicative\nfairness.In this case I have no real doubt as to the validity of\nMs Ignacio’s guilty plea, and unfortunately I find her evidence in this\nmatter to be suspect and lacking in both credibility and reliability.In fact,\nI believe that her letter (Exhibit 7) which was sent in response to\nMr. Bell’s letter of October 26th, 2000 alleging\nMs Ignacio’s thefts from him, is a clear admission of those fraudulent\nacts on her part.In my view, it would be ludicrous to now permit her to\nwithdraw her plea of guilty on the basis of her ridiculous evidence to the\neffect that she was apologizing for some other bad conduct on her part, and\nthat the $5,000.00 cheque which she attached to her letter was simply a loan\nshe was making to Mr. Bell.[39]In R. v. R.M., [2002] M.J. No. 354, Madam Justice\nBeard of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench reviews the law in part as\nfollows:-the grounds for setting aside a guilty plea\ninclude the following:(i)the plea was not voluntary and unequivocal;(ii)the\nplea was not informed, in that the accused was not aware of the nature of the\nallegations made against him or her, the effect of the plea and the\nconsequences of the plea; or(iii)other\ncircumstances make it justified, in the interests of justice, to permit a\nwithdrawal of the plea;-there is\nevidence of a viable defence.In this case such grounds are completely missing and there is no\nevidence of a viable defence.[40]My conclusion, then, is that Ms Ignacio will not be permitted to\nwithdraw her plea of guilty, and that this matter shall now proceed as\nexpeditiously as possible to submissions on sentencing.Wesley H.

Rady of the Superior Court of Justice.ENDORSEMENT[1]The appellant was convicted of manslaughter in\nrespect of the death of his infant son, as well as one count of assault for an\nearlier incident involving the child.He was sentenced to 10 years in jail on\nthe manslaughter conviction, plus one year in jail, concurrent, on the assault\nconviction, after credit on a 1:1 basis for his pre-sentence custody.He\nappeals from his convictions and sentences.A.Conviction Appeal[2]The appellant appeals from his convictions on\none main ground.He submits that the trial judge misapprehended the trial\ntestimony of several of the Crown’s civilian witnesses and that of one of the\nmedical experts called by the Crown at trial.[3]We disagree.[4]We see no material error in the trial judge’s\nappreciation of the evidence of the relevant civilian witnesses.It was open\nto the trial judge to conclude, as she did, that these witnesses, who were\nfriends and neighbours of the appellant, testified reluctantly and that they\nwere hesitant to say anything at trial that was adverse to the appellant’s\ninterests.The trial judge’s observations in this regard formed a proper part\nof her assessment of the witness’ credibility, a matter squarely within the\ntrial judge’s domain.Although, as the Crown concedes, the trial judge\nmisquoted the evidence of one of these witnesses in one respect, this error was\nnot material to the trial judge’s reasoning process.That the relevant witness\nwas a friend of and supportive of the appellant was borne out by either version\nof the statement at issue.In these circumstances, the error in question did\nnot occasion any miscarriage of justice.[5]We reach a similar conclusion concerning the\ntrial judge’s treatment of the expert’s evidence.As the Crown acknowledges,\nthe expert’s report misstated the date on which the fatal injury to the\nappellant’s child occurred.This misstatement, which the appellant concedes\nmay have been merely a typographical error, was not addressed by the trial\njudge.However, the misstatement did not bear on the core of the expert’s\ntestimony, which concerned the timing of the fatal injury within a 30-minute\nperiod, established by the timing of the baby’s crying as overheard by the\nappellant’s neighbours and the timing of the arrival on the scene of medical\npersonnel.The expert’s evidence in this regard was supported by the testimony\nof another properly qualified medical expert at trial.The misstatement in\nquestion, therefore, was inconsequential and could not have affected the\noutcome at trial.We note, in this regard, that the evidence implicating the\nappellant in the assault and death of his son, taken as a whole, was\noverwhelming.[6]For these reasons, the conviction appeal is\ndismissed.B.Sentence Appeal[7]The appellant also seeks leave to appeal\nsentence.As advanced during oral argument, the only issue is whether the\ntrial judge erred by failing to accord the appellant enhanced credit for\npre-sentence custody.In light of the fresh evidence filed on appeal, the\nCrown acknowledges that enhanced credit was available in the circumstances.[8]The trial judge did not have the benefit of the\nSupreme Court’s decision in R. v. Summers, 2014 SCC 26 (CanLII), [2014] 1\nS.C.R. 575 or this court’s decision in R. v. Slack, 2015 ONCA 94 (CanLII).In\nlight of those decisions, it is our view that credit should have been afforded\nto the appellant for his pre-sentence custody at the rate of 1.5:1.We see\nnothing in the Supreme Court’s recent decision in R. v. Lacasse, 2015\nSCC 64 (CanLII) that dictates a different conclusion.[9]Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is\ngranted, the sentence appeal is allowed and the appellant is granted credit for\nhis 1,156 days of pre-sentence custody at the rate of 1.5:1.This results in a\ntotal credit for pre-sentence custody of 1,734 days or 4.75 years, yielding a\nresidual sentence of 5.25 years’ imprisonment.In all other respects, the\nsentences imposed remain unchanged.“E.A.

Karkar, for the Defendant)Defendant))))HEARD:December13, 2010DECISION:January 11, 2011REASONS\nFOR SENTENCEWein J.[1]It has been said that cocaine is a destructive, insidious, and\npowerfully addictive substance that causes great devastation and misery to\nthose whose lives it touches:R. v. Sandhu, 2003 BCSC 2033 (CanLII), [2003] B.C.J. No. 3241.[2]Ms. Nalvarte has been convicted of importing into Canada almost 12\nkilograms of high purity cocaine.At street level, the value of cocaine would\nhave been around $1 million.The difficult task of sentencing her follows.The Offence[3]Ms. Nalvarte is a Canadian resident residing in Montreal.She has\nreturned frequently to her home country of Peru, making nine trips in the three\nyears prior to this offence in April of 2008.Most prior trips were of short\nduration for three, four or five days, but on this occasion she remained for\ntwo weeks and travelled with three of her four children, her nephew and her\nmother-in-law.She returned with 24 boxes labelled as cake mix, brownie mix\nand pancake mix.These were found to be cocaine at a high level of purity.[4]Her explanation that she received these packages just before leaving\nfrom an acquaintance of her older daughter whose mother had approached her on\nthe plane trip down to Peru, and brought them back as a favour, was rejected by\nme for reasons indicated in the Reasons for Judgment. I found that she had\nknowledge that she was importing drugs.The Offender[5]Ms. Nalvarte has been a permanent resident of Canada since 1997.She is 40 years old, and has four children, one of whom is an adult. Her\nremaining three children are 17, 14 and 5 years old. She has been separated from\ntheir father for several years.She has been a hard working and contributing\nmember of society in Canada for many years, working at low paying jobs in the\nfood industry but also creating her own business to assist other immigrants\nfrom Peru in obtaining work in Canada.She has not, however, been financially\nsuccessful.[6]The pre-sentence report indicates that Ms. Nalvarte arrived in\nQuebec in 1992 and successfully claimed refugee status.Her claims related to\nher husband’s involvement in the political/terrorist group called the Shining\nPath.[7]While the pre-sentence report indicates negative concerns because\nMs. Nalvarte admitted to working in undeclared jobs while receiving social\nassistance, and because her and her daughter’s businesses have not been financially\nviable, and resulted in bankruptcy proceedings, the report does indicate that\nMs. Nalvarte has made efforts to work consistently even at unskilled jobs, and\neven though she has made frequent trips back to Peru despite her inability to\npay for them.The assessment summarizes concerns about Ms. Nalvarte’s “level\nof integration in Canada” but notes that:With regard to the court sentence on her situation in\nthis country, the Customs agency has specified that a warrant of remand could\nbe issued, but that it would not be applied given Ms. De La Cruz Nalvarte’s\nrefugee status.She therefore wants to remain in this country with her\nchildren.[8]Despite the suggestion in the pre-sentence report that she would not\nbe deported as a result of her conviction for this offence, I accept the\nsubmissions of defence counsel, who is experienced in immigration matters, that\nit may possibly be that deportation will be an ancillary punishment as a result\nof this conviction, and notwithstanding that her three youngest children are\nCanadian citizens.Positions of the Crown and Defence[9]Counsel have presented diametrically opposed positions.The defence\nargues that this is a special case warranting leniency, and that the\nconditional sentence provisions of the Criminal Code warrant the\nimposition of a conditional sentence of two years less a day, to be served\nunder house arrest, such that Ms. Nalvarte could continue to care for her\nchildren and work from home in her business of providing immigration services\nand work referrals to persons coming to Canada from Peru.[10]The Crown refers to caselaw that emphasizes the need for general\ndeterrence, and based on those cases, recommends that a penitentiary sentence\nof eight to 10 years must be imposed.Analysis[11]Apart from the factor of sympathy, which is undeniable in this case\ngiven the age of Ms. Nalvarte’s children and their current circumstances, there\nis no justification for the imposition of a conditional sentence in this case.Sad as the reality of Ms. Nalvarte’s personal circumstances may be, such a\nsentence would clearly be wrong.The quantity is clearly indicative of a\nsignificant commercial enterprise,and there are no extenuating circumstances,\nno plea of guilty, and no hint of duress, that could begin to justify such a\nsentence as being in the public interest.[12]I have been referred to a number of cases where the Court has given\na lengthy reformatory sentence in recognition of the fact that a penitentiary\nsentence would bring with it the additional reality that any deportation order\ncould not be the subject of appeal.Those cases involve different\ncircumstances, particularly including a much smaller quantity of drugs and/or a\nplea of guilty.It is the quantity of the drugs imported that demands a\npenitentiary sentence in this case.The indicia of frequent trips to Peru, the\nnature, purity and quantity of the drug imported, also weigh against the\nimposition of any lesser sentence.[13]The Court of Appeal has long since established, in cases dating back\nto R. v. Madden and R. v. Cunningham that a range of three to\nfive years for the importation of one kilogram of cocaine more or less is\nnormally appropriate.The amount imported in this case was quite significantly\nhigher, and indicative of much more serious involvement.It might well attract\na sentence of even longer than that recommended by the Crown:See R. v. Epp\n2006 BCCA 570 (CanLII), where a ten year sentence was imposed in personal circumstances\nof some similarity, but with weight given to the factor of cooperation with the\npolice and an early guilty plea.[14]Each case must be considered individually; mathematical certainty in\ncalculation of the sentence is not possible.In this case, the sentence that\nwill be imposed is one of eight years in the penitentiary.Ancillary Orders[15]The drugs will be forfeited.There will be a mandatory weapons\nprohibition order pursuant to the provisions of s.109 of the Criminal Code:\nfor ten years under s.109(2)(ii) and for life under s.109(2)(b).[16]In the circumstances, the victim fine surcharge will be waived.___________________________Wein J.Released:January 11, 2011CITATION: R. v.

Peter Ross of the Nova Scotia Provincial Court on the\nrespondent, J.J.W. for two assaults contrary to s. 266(a) and 266(b)\nrespectively and sexual assault contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal\nCode.For the reasons I will develop, I would dismiss the appeal.Background[2]The events giving rise to the\ncharges of assault and sexual assault took place in August and November, 2007.In each case, the victim was the respondent’s\nthen wife, AB.The sentence imposed was informed by the judge’s decision on conviction.Consequently, I will begin\nwith that decision.[3]The judge found the respondent\nguilty of an assault on AB on August 12, 2007.When the respondent and AB were\ninside Smooth Herman’s nightclub, the conduct of a friend upset the\nrespondent.Later when he was outside and coming to pick up his wife, the\nrespondent saw the friend on the sidewalk.In his decision, the judge stated\nthat the respondent:...basically attacked [C], and, as I say, even by his own\nadmission in the process grabbed his wife and threw her, or pushed her away.He attempts to minimize what he did, at least that’s my conclusion having heard all the evidence\nand considered it.Ms. [B], herself, described having been thrown quite\nforcibly.As she said, he threw me into the middle of the street.She was\nshocked, it wasn’t\njust a push ...The respondent did this to his\nwife in front of family and acquaintances.Other witnesses testified how AB\nwas slammed or thrown to the ground, and rolled into on-coming traffic.[4]The charge of sexual assault and\nsecond charge of assault arose from events at the couple’s bedroom on November 24, 2007.The judge described\nhow, although the relationship was strained, the parties maintained a sexual\nrelationship.It is apparent from his decision that the judge did not accept\nall of AB’s detailed description of that evening.At the same\ntime, he stated that in certain places, the respondent’s credibility was strained.The judge explained where\nhe had difficulties with the evidence and why.He also observed that the\nrespondent admitted that he had sexually assaulted his wife to one of his\nchildren, his wife’s parents, and his own father and brother.[5]The judge continued:. . . I don’t\nthink I can conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no consensual\nsexual contact that evening.I know this is what [A] says.It seems to me it’s possible that there was\nsome consensual conduct ... contact, and conduct between the two.But at\nsome point she refused to kiss him, and as I said, he snapped, and I do find\nthat the crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the anal intercourse\nengaged in that evening was without her consent.There’s no indication whatsoever\nof any objectively reasonable and subjectively honest but false belief in\nconsent that emerges from any of the evidence.He also physically assaulted\nher a few minutes later when he woke up by kicking her, and throwing her down.And I’m convicting him\n... finding him guilty, rather, of a sexual assault upon [AB], and also of\ncommitting the simple assault on the 266 as a result of those findings, and\nthose conclusions.(Emphasis added)[6]I now turn to the judge’s decision on sentencing.The judge noted that the\nCrown had proceeded by way of indictment and the respondent was to be sentenced\naccording to the law in 2007.He stated that a number of principles were\nengaged, including those pertaining to consecutive or concurrent sentences, and\ntotality.The judge referred to a number of cases, including this court’s decision in R. v. Adams, 2010 NSCA 42 (CanLII) (which\nwas referred to in our decisions in R. v. Naugle, 2011 NSCA 33 (CanLII) and R.\nv. Bernard, 2011 NSCA 53 (CanLII)), and the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R.\nv. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500.[7]The judge referred to the victim\nimpact statement.He stated that the impact on the victim “certainly is significant” and noted that the impact of the sexual assault is primarily\npsychological as opposed to physical.The victim impact statement poignantly\nconveys the victim’s trauma and pain, and how the respondent’s actions severely affected her dignity and\nself-esteem.It began:I was raped and beaten by my husband.There was no consent to\nanything and he lost control and raped me because I said NO.It was my\npunishment for not responding to him the way he wanted me to.What he did is\nunforgivable.He hurt me.He humiliated me and has made me feel ashamed of\nmyself.I walk around smiling but hide the hurt, anger, and sadness I feel for\nwhat has happened.I still think sometimes that it must of [sic] been my fault\nbut am learning that I didn’t\nmake him hurt me - that was a choice he made.I didn’t do anything that justified what he did.It\nhas taken me the last year talking to Dr. [M] to start believing this.I lost\nsomething that night and struggle to get it back.I lost a bit of my self\nrespect and all of my trust.I’ve\nnever been around violence before and when it happened, I froze.I couldn’t fight back and stop what\nwas happened [sic] because of shock and fear and I am still trying to get over\nthe guilt of saying no.The victim spoke of the\npsychological damage done to her and her children, the destructive and divisive\neffect of the sexual assault on the family, and her emotional struggles and\nloss of trust.[8]With respect to the circumstances\nof the offender, the judge referred to the pre-sentence report and letters from\ncertain individuals.The pre-sentence report read in part:EMPLOYMENTThe offender reported he was employed as a fire fighter with\n... from 1995 to May 20, 2011, at which time he was terminated as a result of\nthe current convictions.He advised grievances have been filed concerning\nsame.The offender reported extensive fire fighter training and\nvarious certificates of achievement including assistance with Hurricane\nKatrina.He advised he created and trained the ... Fire Services and is a\nqualified instructor of First Aid, CPR and WHIMS.[AH], Supervisor, ... Fire Services, was contacted for this\nreport.Mr. [H] confirmed he supervised the offender for many years and\ndescribed the offender as a motivated, good worker who took direction well.Further, Mr. [H] reported the offender was President of their International\nUnion and in that capacity, was responsible for addressing many grievances. ...According to Mr. [H], the offender has an excellent work record\nand he would like him to be granted a second chance to pursue his career as a\nFire Fighter, suggesting “he\nwas very good at his job”.Previous employment for the offender includes employment as an\nAirport Fire Fighter at the ... from 1992 to 1995.He advised he left this\nemployment when he was successful in acquiring a position with ....The offender reported an extensive volunteer background\nincluding the ... Camp, fundraising for Muscular Dystrophy, Crones [sic] and\nColitis, Instructing the Babysitting Course at ..., Soccer Coach and Hockey\nGames for Local Charities.The respondent had no previous\ncriminal record.In the pre-sentence report he was described as a good parent\nwho was in a new relationship.His father who has terminal cancer relies on\nhim heavily.[9]The Crown sought a total sentence\nof two to three years imprisonment.The defence suggested a conditional\nsentence.The judge’s decision reads in part:... The section 271 offence, the sexual assault involves the\nforced anal intercourse.I heard evidence about the use of the vibrating\ndevice, taking clothing off, forced oral sex, mutual forced oral sex, et\ncetera, but what I could be sure was proven beyond a reasonable doubt was\nthe forced anal intercourse.Looking at that conduct, it is extremely, of\ncourse, serious conduct, as the Crown has quite correctly pointed out.Looking at that charge, even if it stood alone, considering this offence as\nthough it were the only offence charged, even with that, I do think that a\nsentence of less than two years would be fit and appropriate and that,\ntherefore, a conditional sentence is a possibility based on the length of the\nsentence.I do not think that Mr. [W] poses a danger to the community\nat this point and so I don’t\nthink a conditional sentence would endanger the community.At the same time,\nhowever, I do not think that a conditional sentence of imprisonment would be\nconsistent with the fundamental principles of sentencing as they apply to these\ncircumstances here.As the Crown has pointed out, the\naccused forced anal sex upon the victim against her will and despite her\nprotestations he did so to express dominance and control.He impacted the\nvictim significantly, primarily in a psychological sense but significantly and\nseriously nonetheless.At the same time, Mr. [W] has\nsuffered some consequences as a direct result of the conviction.He was fired\nfrom his job and his job is, obviously, very important to him.I know he’s fighting that dismissal\nbut he can’t be sure\nthat he’ll be\nsuccessful and even if eventually he wins at arbitration he will still have\nsuffered this consequence to some extent.Secondly, Mr. [W] has been on\nconditions since February the 4th, 2008.This is more than three years and he\nhas been before the court for quite a long time awaiting trial and sentence.This is certainly, in part, owing to his own elections, re-elections and the\ninherent time it takes to bring these [matters] to a conclusion.At the same\ntime, having this hanging over his head, I think has been difficult for him\nand, undoubtedly, difficult for the victim, too.But looking at what the\nsentence ought to be is the impact on him that is significant here.And thirdly, the principle of\ntotality comes into play in fashioning the length of sentence for the Section\n271 offence.I can only speak to one sentence at a time, to one charge at a\ntime, and there are three.I’m\nbeginning with the most serious but in passing sentence for this offence I do\nso knowing the sentences that I will be imposing momentarily for the two 266\noffences.And I have, thus, determined for\nthe three reasons given here, the consequences to employment, the awaiting\ntrial and being on conditions and a reduction in accordance with the totality\nprinciple, I have determined that the sentence for the sexual assault should be\nreduced from what it would otherwise be if it stood alone.(Emphasis\nadded)[10]The judge sentenced the respondent\nto:(a)a five month jail sentence for the sexual assault;(b)a consecutive eight month conditional sentence\nof imprisonment with house arrest for the assault the same night; and(c)a consecutive three month conditional sentence\nof imprisonment for the earlier assault.In summary, the sentence was\na five month jail sentence and an 11 month conditional sentence.[11]The judge also ordered a DNA and a\n10 year firearms ban.After hearing submissions, he refused to make an order\npursuant to the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, S.C. 2004, c.\n10 (“SOIRA”).Issues[12]The issues on appeal are:1.Whether the sentence was manifestly unfit;2.Whether the judge misapplied the principle of\ntotality; and3.Whether the judge erred in law, and in law and\nfact, in declining to make a mandatory SOIRA order pursuant to s.\n490.012 of the Criminal Code.Demonstrably Unfit\nSentence[13]The standard of review for\nsentence appeals is well established.The approach to be taken on appellate\nreview is a deferential one.In R. v. L.M., 2008 SCC 31 (CanLII), LeBel J.\nwriting for the majority stated:[14]In its past decisions, this Court has established that\nappellate courts must show great deference in reviewing decisions of trial\njudges where appeals against sentence are concerned. An appellate court may not\nvary a sentence simply because it would have ordered a different one. The court\nmust be “convinced it\nis not fit”, that is, “that ... the sentence [is]\nclearly unreasonable”\n(R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, at para. 46, quoted in R. v.\nMcDonnell, 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at para. 15). This Court also made the\nfollowing comment in R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 90:...absent an error in principle,\nfailure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate\nfactors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at\ntrial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit.(See also R. v. W. (G.), 1999 CanLII 668 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 597, at para.\n19; A. Manson, The Law of Sentencing (2001), at p. 359; and F. Dadour, De\nla détermination de la peine: principes et applications (2007), at p. 298.)[15]Owing to the profoundly contextual nature of the\nsentencing process, in which the trier of fact has broad discretion, the\nstandard of review to be applied by an appellate court is one based on\ndeference. The sentencing judge has “served\non the front lines of our criminal justice system”\nand possesses unique qualifications in terms of experience and the ability to\nassess the submissions of the Crown and the offender (M. (C.A.), at\npara. 91). In sum, in the case at bar, the Court of Appeal was required ‑‑\nfor practical reasons, since the trier of fact was in the best position to\ndetermine the appropriate sentence for L.M. ‑‑ to show deference to\nthe sentence imposed by the trial judge.[14]In Shropshire and M.\n(C.A.), the Supreme Court of Canada held that an appellate court should\nonly vary a sentence if the sentence is “clearly\nunreasonable” or “demonstrably\nunfit”.In R. v. W. ( G.), 1999 CanLII 668 (SCC), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 597,\nLamer C.J. emphasized at ¶ 19 that those two standards mean the same thing.[15]In R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010\nSCC 6 (CanLII), the Supreme Court affirmed the sentencing principles in Shropshire\nand M. (C.A.).At ¶ 46, LeBel\nJ. stated:[46] Appellate courts grant\nsentencing judges considerable deference when reviewing the fitness of a\nsentence. In M. (C.A.), Lamer C.J. cautioned that a sentence could only\nbe interfered with if it was “demonstrably\nunfit” or if it\nreflected an error in principle, the failure to consider a relevant factor, or\nthe over‑emphasis of a relevant factor (para. 90; see also R. v. L.M.,\n2008 SCC 31 (CanLII), [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, at paras. 14‑15; R. v. Proulx,\n2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at paras. 123‑26; R. v. McDonnell,\n1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at paras. 14‑17; R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4\nS.C.R. 227). As Laskin J.A. explained in R. v. McKnight (1999), 1999 CanLII 3717 (ON CA), 135\nC.C.C. (3d) 41 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 35, however, this does not mean that\nappellate courts can interfere with a sentence simply because they would have\nweighed the relevant factors differently:To suggest that a trial judge\ncommits an error in principle because in an appellate court’s opinion the trial judge\ngave too much weight to one relevant factor or not enough weight to another is\nto abandon deference altogether. The weighing of relevant factors, the\nbalancing process is what the exercise of discretion is all about. To maintain\ndeference to the trial judge’s\nexercise of discretion, the weighing or balancing of relevant factors must be\nassessed against the reasonableness standard of review. Only if by emphasizing\none factor or by not giving enough weight to another, the trial judge exercises\nhis or her discretion unreasonably should an appellate court interfere with the\nsentence on the ground the trial judge erred in principle.Sentencing judges enjoy a\nbroad discretion.That discretion is fettered in part by case law that has, in\nsome circumstances, set down ranges so as to give effect to the parity\nprinciple.However, ranges are only guidelines and a sentencing falling\noutside the regular range is not necessarily unfit (¶ 44).[16]The Crown pointed out that the\njudge himself described the sexual assault here as “extremely . . . serious conduct”.Forced anal intercourse is a major sexual assault.According to the Crown, the sentence of five months imprisonment that the judge\nordered for that offence inadequately reflects the objectives of denunciation\nand deterrence.It submits that, having regard to the nature of the offence\ncommitted and the circumstances of the offence and the offender, the sentence\nis simply not sufficient.The Crown also argues that the judge failed to\nconsider the totality of the circumstances in ordering a conditional sentence\nof imprisonment for the assault convictions, and he overemphasized the impact\nof the conviction and the process on the offender.[17]The Crown relied on a number of\ncases to establish the range of sentence for major sexual assaults and to show\nthat the sentence here was manifestly unfit.These included cases from\njurisdictions where the starting point approach has been followed.In Alberta,\nthe starting point for non-consensual vaginal intercourse and other equally\nserious sexual assaults is three years, presuming a mature person with no\ncriminal record and without pleading guilty:R. v. Sandercock (1985) 1985 ABCA 218 (CanLII), 40\nAlta. L.R. (2d) 265, 48 C.R. (3d) 154, 22 C.C.C. (3d) 79 (Alta. C.A.).In R.\nv. Arcand, 2010 ABCA 363 (CanLII), the majority of a five member panel of the\nAlberta Court of Appeal discussed the use of starting points on an appeal of\nsentence by an aboriginal man with no prior criminal record who sexually\nassaulted an unconscious woman.The majority wrote:[175] Rape and other major sexual assaults are grave and\nserious acts of violence. As the Supreme Court explained in R. v. McCraw:Violenceis\ninherent in the act of rape.... It seems to me that to arguethat\na woman who has been forced to have sexual intercourse has notnecessarily\nsuffered grave and serious violence is to ignore the perspective of\nwomen.... Violence and the threat of serious bodily harm are indeed the\nhallmarks of rape.... rape is a crime that is likely to have serious\npsychological consequences and may, as well, have serious physical\neffects....[Emphasis added by Alberta Court of Appeal][176] While these comments were made in the context of rape,\nthat is non‑consensual vaginal intercourse, they apply with equal force\nto other major sexual assaults. When an offender commits a major sexual\nassault, including rape, against a person, this act of violence causes harm. It\nis harm to both the victim and society. A major sexual assault constitutes a\nserious violation of a person’s\nbody and an equally serious violation of their sexual autonomy and freedom of\nchoice. These breaches of one’s\nphysical integrity and privacy are indisputable and undeniable. That harm, and\nit is substantial, is inferred from the very nature of the assault. Add to this\nthe serious breach of a person’s\nhuman dignity and the gravity of a major sexual assault perpetrated on a victim\nbecomes readily apparent.[177] In addition to this very grave harm, there is also\nintrinsic to major sexual assaults the likelihood of other very real\npsychological or emotional harm. That includes fear, humiliation,\ndegradation, sleeplessness, a sense of defilement, shame and embarrassment,\ninability to trust, inability to form personal or intimate relationships in\nadulthood with other socialization problems and the risk of self‑harm or\neven suicide. While these effects fall into the psychological or emotional harm\ncategory, they may be equally or even more serious than the physical ones but\nmuch less obvious, indeed even unascertainable at sentencing....[179] There is another aspect of the harm caused by an offender\nwho commits a major sexual assault. That is the harm caused to society by this\nkind of criminal activity. Harm to one member of the community affects the\nrights and security of others. This is particularly striking in cases involving\nviolence against women.[18]Saskatchewan has adopted a similar\nstarting point for major sexual assaults.See, for example, R. v. Iron,\n2005 SKCA 84 (CanLII), at ¶ 12.[19]In Newfoundland, the range for\nserious sexual assault with intercourse is stated in R. v. H.A.V., 2000 NFCA 14 (CanLII), 2000\nNFCA 14 to be three to five years.The range was confirmed in R. v. Freake,\n2012 NLCA 10 (CanLII).See however, R. v. Squires, 2012 NLCA 20 (CanLII) where the Court\nof Appeal discussed that range in the context of that particular case.[20]The Crown points out that in R.\nv. P.V.K. (1992), 1992 CanLII 4820 (NS SC), 116 N.S.R. (2d) 110 (S.C.T.D.), Saunders, J. (as he then\nwas) in sentencing a man found guilty of sexually assaulting his daughter over\nseveral years, stated:25I have considered the approach taken in Alberta\nbeginning with the 1985 decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v.\nSandercock (1985), 1985 ABCA 218 (CanLII), 62 A.R. 382 (C.A.), which reaffirmed its commitment to “the starting point approach” to sentencing in cases of\nsexual assault. By this method typical categories are stated with precision. A “major sexual assault” would qualify upon\nevidence of the blameworthiness of the offender and the effect upon the victim.\nThe starting point for a major sexual assault is three years’ imprisonment “assuming a mature accused\nwith previous good character and no criminal record”. Such a starting point would not include\nmajor aggravating factors pointing to a planned and deliberate attack. Certain\nmitigating factors would include a guilty plea where it spared the victim from\ntestifying or waiting to testify, waiving certain constitutional rights in\ndeference to an expedited trial, remorse, immaturity or the totality principle\nfollowing consecutive sentences. There, as here, the primary goals in\nsentencing for sexual assault are deterrence and denunciation.After considering a decision of\nthe Manitoba Court of Appeal, he indicated in ¶ 28 that, in his respectful view, there was much to be said for the\napproach taken in those provinces.The trial judge in R. v. O.B. (No. 4)\n(1995), 141 N.S.R. (2d) 339 (S.C.) at ¶\n9 agreed with this comment.Sandercock was quoted by this Court in R.\nv. Blackburn (1986), 75 N.S.R. (2d) 30 (C.A.) at ¶ 13.[21]Nova Scotia has not adopted a\nstarting point approach.Rather, this Court has chosen to remain focussed on\nthe principles of sentencing as set out in the Criminal Code and the\nSupreme Court of Canada’s affirmations that the approach on review on\nsentencing appeals is one of deference to the decisions of the sentencing\njudge.[22]Since sentencing is such an\nindividualized process and done in the context of the particular circumstances\nof each case, it is notoriously difficult to find cases that are factually\nsimilar.The Crown presented the following summaries, among others, in support\nof its argument that the five month jail sentence for sexual assault was\ndemonstrably unfit:(i) R. v. T.V.G. (1994), 1994 CanLII 7588 (NS SC), 133 N.S.R. (2d) 299 (S.C.) ‑‑\nThe offender and victim had been separated a few days before the offence. The\noffender called her the night preceding the offence causing the victim to be\nafraid. She took her children next door to her father’s house. When she returned to pick up some\nclothing, the offender confronted her, forced her into the bedroom, and raped\nher despite her struggles. The offender questioned the victim about her\nboyfriends as he repeatedly penetrated her. The Court viewed the assault on the\nformer common‑law wife as aggravating. The accused came from a stable,\nhard‑working family. Offender and victim had two daughters. Victim Impact\nStatement demonstrated nervousness on behalf of the common‑law wife.\nSentence: two years and eight months’\nincarceration;(ii) R. v. B.(D.), 2005 NWTSC 89 (CanLII) ‑‑ Offender\npleaded guilty to sexual assault on his common‑law spouse. He was a\ntwenty‑five year old aboriginal with a work history and volunteer work.\nHe and the victim had two children. He assaulted the victim two months prior to\nthe sexual assault. The Court concluded that sexual assaults committed by a man\nagainst his wife are more serious than other sexual assaults. The range in that\njurisdiction for a first offence involving full sexual intercourse was two to four\nyears’ imprisonment.\nSentence: two years less one day;(iii) R. v. S.D.M. (1995), 1995 CanLII 7469 (NS SC), 141 N.S.R. (2d) 203 (S.C.) ‑‑\nTwenty‑six year old offender with driving offences sentenced to two years’ imprisonment for sexual\nassaults on common‑law spouse. Record did not manifest violence, though\nindicated a lack of control and responsibility on the offender’s part;(iv) R. v. Toor, 2011 ONCA 114 (CanLII) ‑‑ Appellant\nwas a first time offender convicted of assault causing bodily harm, sexual\nassault and sexual assault causing bodily harm. He had punched the victim,\ndragged her across the floor, and violently forced sexual intercourse on her.\nChildren were present. Appellant had subjected her to a situation of\npsychological imprisonment within the family unit. Sentence of four years\nupheld on appeal;...(vi) R. v . Smith, 2011 ONCA 564 (CanLII) ‑‑ Numerous\ncounts involving two victims on the sentence appeal. The facts involved a death\nthreat to D.Q., and assaults on M.O., including a sexual assault. The Court\nendorsed the proposition that in cases of sexual assault involving forced\nintercourse with a spouse or former spouse, sentences generally ranged from\ntwenty‑one months to four years. The Court noted that the Crown had\nchosen to not cross‑appeal sentence, and therefore would not impose a\nsentence exceeding three years’\nincarceration;(vii) R. v. M.(B.), 2008 ONCA 645 (CanLII) ‑‑ Accused\nhad been sentenced to nine months’\nimprisonment with two years’\nprobation and SOIRA Order for seven years of compliance. The Crown appealed. The\nCourt allowed the appeal, increasing the imprisonment term to two years less\none day, and a mandatory twenty year SOIRA Order. The Respondent had engaged in\nanal intercourse with his developmentally delayed wife without her consent. The\nCourt indicated that prior abusive conduct may be relevant to the sentencing to\nshow the character and background of the offender, particularly to assess the\nneed for individual deterrence, rehabilitation, or the protection of the\npublic. Sentence at trial failed to send the message that those who victimize\ntheir partners within the context of the marital relationship must know that\nserious consequences will follow;(viii) R. v. Cook (1994), 92 Man.R. (2d) 231 (C.A.) ‑‑\nAccused pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault on his common‑law\nwife and sentenced to four years’\nimprisonment. A knife was used involving forced anal and oral intercourse. A\nfour year sentence was upheld on appeal;...(x) R. v. D.W.G., 1999 ABCA 270 (CanLII) ‑‑ Crown\nappeal of four month sentence plus one year probation for a sexual assault on\nthe common‑law wife. The Respondent served four months in remand. The\nfacts illustrated a violent attempt at rape. The victim, trying to sleep, was\nconfronted by her common‑law husband who had been drinking. He slapped\nher, stripped her naked, choked her with one of his forearms across her throat,\nand attempted to have intercourse. He was too drunk to complete the sex act and\nshe was eventually able to get away. The Court of Appeal took the view that the\nsentence was not fit. A sentence at first instance of three and one‑half\nyears would have been appropriate. The sentence, however, was reduced to eight\nmonths due to the fact that the Respondent had already completed the custodial\nportion of his sentence and four months’\npre‑trial custody.[23]In these summaries, the lowest\nsentence for sexual assault is two years less a day in each of B.(D.)\nand M.(B.).[24]The respondent also relies on case\nlaw to buttress his argument that the judge’s\nsentence should not be disturbed.However, his authorities are largely\ndistinguishable.I will now discuss his cases.[25]In R. v. R.G., 2003 NLCA\n73 (CanLII), the offender was sentenced to six months imprisonment for an act of non‑consensual\nsexual intercourse with his spouse.In upholding the sentence, the Court of\nAppeal indicated that “in this Province the normal range of sentence for\nsexual assault involving penetration is three to seven years.”However, it concluded the trial judge was correct in\nconcluding that “the circumstances of this case are quite unusual and\nthat this case is an appropriate one for a sentence below the normal range.”There the couple remained together after the assault\nand had consensual relations for another seven months.The wife gave a\nstatement to the police only after their separation.Moreover, the offender\nhad served his sentence and been released.None of these facts are present in\nthe matter under appeal.[26]The respondent also pointed to\nanother case from Newfoundland and Labrador, R. v. G.W.P., 2006 NLTD\n136 (CanLII).In that case, the spouse of the complainant was sentenced to five months\nimprisonment for an unsuccessful attempt to have non‑consensual sexual\nintercourse with his wife.The two had been arguing, and he pushed the\ncomplainant onto the bed and pulled down her clothes and restrained her in an\nattempt to have sexual intercourse.She said it lasted about 15 to 20 minutes\nand was quite frightening.Unlike the situation here, there was no penetration.In addition, the judge there relied upon R.G. which I have already\ndistinguished on the facts.[27]The respondent referred in R.\nv. R.H. (1994), 1994 ABCA 21 (CanLII), 149 A.R. 230 (Alta. C.A.) where the offender forced his\ncommon‑law spouse to have non‑consensual sexual intercourse.The\nparties subsequently reconciled and married.The Court of Appeal increased the\nsentence from six months imprisonment to 15 months.It stated that a proper\nsentence was 18 months but the fact that the accused had already served the sentence\ncreated an expectation on his part.Neither the reconciliation or marriage\njustified a reduction in sentence.[28]The respondent argues that in R.H.\nthe sentence was 15 months, while he received a 16 month sentence, five of\nwhich were conventional jail time and the remainder house arrest but,\nnonetheless, a sentence totalling 16 months.However, the sentence in R.H.\nwas only for the sexual assault and did not include assaults which the\nrespondent incorporates into his calculation.Moreover, R.H. is no\nlonger the law in Alberta.Arcand has confirmed Sandercock which\nestablished a starting point of three years imprisonment.[29]Finally, the respondent drew our\nattention to R. v. L.F.W., 2000 SCC 6 (CanLII).The accused, a 55 year old man with\nno previous criminal record, was convicted of indecent assault and gross\nindecency against his cousin over a six year period when she was between six\nand twelve.The trial judge sentenced him to a 21 month global sentence of\nimprisonment, to be served in the community.The Newfoundland Court of Appeal\naffirmed that sentence.The Supreme Court of Canada heard the appeal in L.F.W.\ntogether with the appeal in R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII) and other cases.It applied the general principles governing the conditional sentencing regime\nset out in Proulx to the facts of that case.[30]The respondent is correct that L.F.W.\n“is yet another precedent speaking to the need for\nappellate review to be deferential to the sentence imposed by a trial judge” and that there the Supreme Court of Canada “adopted a non‑interventionist position”.However, the deferential approach on appellate\nreview of sentence is not in dispute.Furthermore, that case does not concern\na sexual assault of the kind which is the subject of this appeal, and so is not\nhelpful in determining the adequacy of the sentence.[31]At the hearing of the appeal, the\nrespondent acknowledged that he had not been able to find any case law where\nthe sentence was as low as five months for sexual assault involving\npenetration.[32]I agree with the Crown that a five\nmonth sentence for this sexual assault, forcible anal intercourse, is\ndemonstrably unfit.In doing so, I recognize that sentencing judges are\nentitled to considerable deference from the appellate courts, and that ranges\nas established by case law are only guidelines intended to assist sentencing\njudges.However, the discrepancy between the sentence here imposed for a grave\nsexual assault, one committed by the appellant to dominate and control his\nwife, namely five months imprisonment, and the next lowest sentences found in\nthe case law for similar major sexual assaults in comparable circumstances,\nnamely two years less a day, is simply too large to ignore.The sentence\ncontravenes the principle of parity.Persons convicted of serious sexual\nassaults must appreciate that the principles of sentencing include specific and\ngeneral deterrence and denunciation, and such offences will attract serious\nconsequences.The five month sentence of imprisonment for sexual assault on a\nspouse does not send that message.In my view, considering the principles of\nsentencing as set out in the Criminal Code, it is clearly unreasonable.[33]Moreover, the reasons given by the\njudge show that he erred in principle.He pointed to three considerations in\narriving at a sentence of five months incarceration:delay in the proceedings,\nloss of employment, and the principle of totality.[34]If the delay in the completion of\nthe trial process is lengthy and beyond the control of the offender, or if\nthere is delay attributable to Crown conduct, delay can be a mitigating factor\non sentence: see R. v. Spencer (2004), 2004 CanLII 5550 (ON CA), 186 C.C.C. (3d) 181 (Ont. C.A.)\nat ¶ 41.[35]The Information charging the\nrespondent was sworn on February 5, 2008.The Court Appearance Record is\nstraightforward.It shows that at his first appearance in April 2008, the\nrespondent elected trial before a judge and jury.In December 2008, he re-elected\nto judge alone and, at that time, the trial was set down for March 2, 2010.It\nwas subsequently rescheduled to May 6, 2011.There is no indication of any\nunusual matters that slowed the court process.Nor is there any suggestion of\ndelay attributable to actions or failures to act by the Crown.[36]In Spencer, Doherty J.A.\nfor the Ontario Court of Appeal wrote:43In deciding whether any delay in the completion\nof the process should mitigate sentence, it is appropriate to consider an\noffender’s bail\nterms.The more stringent those terms, the more likely it will be that any\ndelay in completion of the process will have some mitigating effect on\nsentence.Indeed, even absent delay, particularly stringent bail conditions\ncan have a mitigating effect on sentence. ...[37]Here, after the Information was\nsworn in February 2008, the respondent entered into an undertaking.When he\nfirst appeared in court that April, he again entered into an undertaking.Both\nthose undertakings required him to keep the peace, not possess a firearm, not\nconsume intoxicating substances, not be at a certain location, and not\ncommunicate with the complainant.These conditions are neither onerous nor\nunusual.He was at liberty throughout the proceedings until his convictions in\nMay 2011.[38]In my view, although the judge\ncorrectly noted that the appellant had been on conditions for more than three\nyears and he had been before the courts for “quite\na long time” which had been difficult for both the appellant and\nthe victim, neither the terms of the appellant’s undertakings, nor the length of time needed to complete the trial\nprocess, warranted any mitigation of his sentence.[39]I turn then to the second reason\nthe judge gave for reducing sentence, namely the respondent’s loss, as a result of conviction, of his long-time\nemployment as a firefighter.Clayton C. Ruby et al., Sentencing, 7th\ned. (Markham, Ont: LexisNexis, 2008) at §\n5.230 - 5.231 reads:§5.230\nLoss of employment is a serious blow for anyone, and it may mean the\ndestruction of an entire family.It is, therefore, always serious, and must be\nconsidered as part of the circumstances in which penalty is being imposed ...\nAny job loss is mitigating.§5.231\nA loss of employment is a frequent result of criminal conviction for persons in\nevery walk of life, particularly for those in the public service such as\npolice, school teachers, firefighters and professionals.The possibility of\nfuture loss of employment may be taken into account.Loss of a pension would\nbe significant.Bankruptcy as a result of the arrest is a mitigating factor.[40]Loss of employment as a mitigating\nfactor is reflected in the case law.See, for example, R. v. Ens, 2011\nMBQB 301 (CanLII), at ¶ 20; R. v. Maguire, 2005 CarswellOnt 1696\n(S.C.), at ¶ 23; R. v. Campbell (1992), 102 Nfld. \u0026\nP.E.I.R. 259 (P.E.I.S.C.T.D.), at ¶\n8‑11.However, while it may mitigate the need for specific deterrence\nfor a guilty plea, it does not displace general deterrence and denunciation:see R. v. Jaikaran, 2007 ABCA 98 (CanLII).Moreover, an error in assessing mitigating\ncircumstances, such as job loss, may offend the principles of proportionality\nand parity and lead to an increased sentence on appeal:see R. v. Van de\nWiele, 1997 CanLII 9695 (SK CA), [1997] 3 W.W.R. 477 (Sask.C.A.).[41]The third reason the judge gave\nfor a reduction in the sentence for the sexual assault was the application of\nthe totality principle.He stated that in passing sentence for that offence,\nhe did so knowing that he would also be imposing sentence for the two assault\noffences.[42]The totality principle applies\nwhen several sentences are imposed.It calls on the judge to take a last,\ncareful look at the total of all the sentences to ensure that it does not\noffend the principle of proportionality.While the application of the totality\nprinciple can lead to a reduction of the overall sentence, it does not always\ndo so.Here, although the judge referred to the Court’s decision in Adams, it is not apparent from\nhis reasons that he conducted the requisite analysis.[43]In my view, the sentence itself\nand the judge’s three reasons for reducing sentence show error in\nprinciple.It appears that the judge gave the respondent’s personal circumstances excessive importance.Although he took specific deterrence into account, he failed to consider\nappropriately general deterrence and denunciation.The\nSOIRA Appeal[44]The judge refused to make the SOIRA\norder sought by the Crown.In doing so, he relied upon a statutory exemption.He reasoned:... I think the central feature of\nthese crimes is violence and not sexual proclivities or sexual propensities.It is not a case a childhood sexual abuse, you know, the pedophile or anything\nof that sort.The conduct arose within a domestic context.He has a new\npartner who says it’s\na good relationship.I don’t\nthink that there’s\nreally any public interest or public protection served in requiring sexual\noffender information registration in this particular case in comparing the type\nof conduct to the impact and privacy.There is a serious disproportionality\nand so I’m going to\ndecline to impose the requirement to register under that legislation.Before\nthis Court, the Crown submitted that the judge erred in law, and in law and\nfact, in declining to make the order pursuant to s. 490.012 of the Criminal\nCode.In two unsolicited post-hearing submissions, it provided additional\ninformation to the Court.[45]The authority for a sentencing\njudge to direct a person sentenced on conviction of a crime to register under\nthe SOIRA is found in the Criminal Code.Section 490.011 sets\nout the definition of “designated offence.”Those offences are divided among six paragraphs.Since sexual assault (s. 271)\nis found under paragraph (a) of the definition of “designated offence”,\ns. 490.012(1) applies.It reads:490.012 (1) When a court imposes a sentence on a\nperson for an offence referred to in paragraph (a), (c), (c.1), (d) or (e) of\nthe definition “designated\noffence” in subsection\n490.011(1) or renders a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of\nmental disorder for such an offence, it shall make an order in Form 52\nrequiring the person to comply with the Sex Offender Information\nRegistration Act for the applicable period specified in section 490.013.[46]Section 490.012(1) uses the word “shall” rather than\nthe permissive “may.”As a result,\nin cases governed by that provision, an order is mandatory on application by\nthe prosecutor after conviction of a designated offence.[47]Prior to the Protecting Victims\nFrom Sex Offenders Act, S.C. 2010, c. 17, s. 490.012(4) of the Criminal\nCode provided for a possible exemption:490.012(4) The court is not\nrequired to make an order under this section if it is satisfied that the person\nhas established that, if the order were made, the impact on them, including on\ntheir privacy or liberty, would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest\nin protecting society through the effective investigation of crimes of a sexual\nnature, to be achieved by the registration of information relating to sex\noffenders under the Sex Offender Information Registration Act.[48]The s. 490.012(4) exemption called\nfor a balancing of interests.The impact of registration on the offender’s interests as an individual, including his or her\ninterest in privacy or liberty, was to be weighed against the public interest\nin protecting society through the effective prevention and investigation of\nsexual offences through registration of information about sex offenders.Only\nwhere the impact of registration on an offender’s individual interests would be grossly disproportionate to the\npublic interest is an exception to registration to be granted.The burden of\nestablishing a grossly disproportionate impact rested on the offender.[49]I turn then to the standard of\nreview on an appeal of a SOIRA order.In R. v. Debidin, 2008\nONCA 868 (CanLII), Watt J.A., for a unanimous court, wrote:71Section 490.014, which confers on the prosecutor\nand offender the right to appeal the refusal or grant of a SOIRA order\nand describes the dispositive authority of the appeal court, is silent about\nthe standard of review that prevails. Similar language appears in s. 487.05(4),\nwhich governs appeals from grants or refusals of DNA orders. In each case, an\nappeal court may alter a decision only where the sentencing judge has:i. erred in principle;ii. failed to consider a relevant\nfactor;iii. overemphasized an appropriate\nfactor; oriv. made a clearly unreasonable\ndecision.Redhead at para. 13; R.C. at paras. 48‑49; R.\nv. Turnbull (A.) (2006), 2006 NLCA 66 (CanLII), 261 Nfld. and P.E.I.R. 241 (N.L. C.A.), at para.\n21.[50]On appeal, the Crown argued that\nthe judge erred by declining to make a SOIRA order pursuant to the s.\n490.012(4) exemption.The respondent made submissions towards having the judge’s reasoning in refusing that order upheld.[51]In a letter sent to the Court a\nmonth after the hearing of the appeal, the Crown correctly pointed out that s.\n5 of the Protecting Victims From Sex Offenders Act, which came into\nforce April 15, 2011, eliminated the exemption under s. 490.012(4) and made\noffenders found guilty of the designated offences subject to an order for\nautomatic inclusion in the national registry.Any judicial discretion to\ndecline to impose such orders for the reasons set out in former s. 490.012(4)\nvanished.[52]The sentencing hearing in this\nmatter took place on July 13, 2011.The s. 490.012(4) exemption was not\navailable when the respondent was sentenced.This was not brought to the judge’s attention nor, indeed, to this Court’s attention before or at the hearing of the appeal.The Crown acted properly in writing to this court when it realized that the\nsubmissions by it and defence counsel were not well-founded in the law.[53]In its most recent letter, the\nCrown drew to the Court’s attention the very recent decision of the New\nBrunswick Court of Appeal in R. v. Chisholm, 2012 NBCA 79 (CanLII).There,\nDrapeau C.J.N.B. writing for the court reiterated that appeals are creatures of\nstatute and that there must be a statutory basis for appellate intervention.After reviewing the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code and the\njurisprudence pertaining to whether such orders are sentences, he concluded\nthat there is no right of appeal for SOIRA orders issued under s.\n490.012(1), as here.As a result, the Crown’s appeal against the duration of the order had been initiated without\nlawful authority, and its Notice of Appeal was quashed.[54]Although the question in Chisholm\npertained to the duration of the SOIRA order, here the appeal is of the\njudge’s decision not to impose any such order.However,\nthat difference does not affect the careful analysis undertaken in Chisholm.In my view, the reasoning is persuasive.Accordingly, the Crown had no right\nof appeal from the judge’s decision.I would quash its ground of appeal\nregarding SOIRA.The Appropriate\nSentence and Reincarceration[55]The judge sentenced the respondent\nto a five month jail sentence for the sexual assault on his former spouse, an\neight month conditional sentence with house arrest for the assault on her the\nsame night, and a three month conditional sentence for the earlier assault.The sentences were consecutive.The respondent has served the term of\nimprisonment for sexual assault, the conditional eight month sentence with\nhouse arrest for the assault that same night, and the final conditional three\nmonth sentence for the first assault.There have been no reporting problems.[56]The lowest sentence in the\njurisprudence presented by the parties for sexual assault alone is two years\nless a day.In seeking a conditional sentence at trial, counsel for the\ndefence could not and did not strenuously argue that a penitentiary term would\nnot be fit.Rather, he stated:“less\nthan two years is not inappropriate.I’m\nnot saying that more than two years is outside the range either.”[57]Where I determined that the trial\njudge committed an error in principle, the sentence he imposed is no longer\nentitled to deference and it falls to this court to impose the sentence it\nthinks is fit.What is an appropriate sentence for this offender in the\nparticular circumstances of these offences?Does that sentence include\nimprisonment?[58]The Crown submits that, in light\nof a sentence that it describes as “woefully\ninadequate sentence”, the appellant should be reincarcerated.In its\nwritten submission on appeal, the Crown reiterates its recommendation at trial\nfor a sentence of two to three years imprisonment for the sexual assault and\ntwo assaults.Asked at the hearing to refine its recommendation, the Crown\nsuggested two and one-half years, perhaps adjusted down to two years because of\nthe reincarceration, less time already served.[59]The Crown relies on several cases\nwhere courts ordered reincarceration because the sentence imposed at trial was\nso manifestly unfit.In R. v. Escott (1985), 10 O.A.C. 89, 1985\nCarswellOnt 1461 (C.A.), the respondent plead guilty to aggravated assault.After drinking heavily, he picked up a prostitute, choked her with his hands\nuntil she lost consciousness, and left her unconscious on the road with a belt\ntied tightly around her neck.He was 21 years old when he committed this\ncrime, and had no prior record.[60]The Ontario Court of Appeal held\nat ¶ 7 that the 90-day intermittent sentence followed by\n3-years probation was “wholly inadequate to reflect the gravity of the\noffence and to express society’s revulsion of\nthe conduct involved in the commission of the offence.”It took into account the respondent’s sincere efforts in the eight years since the offence\nto rehabilitate himself, his abstention from alcohol, his success in\nuniversity, his employment, and his compliance with the terms of his\nprobation.It recognized the strong character evidence presented in support of\nthe respondent.Nevertheless, the Ontario Court of Appeal determined that\nreincarceration was required:13An appellate court is always reluctant to re‑incarcerate\nan accused after he has served the sentence imposed by the trial judge and will\nonly do so where the sentence is so inadequate that the interests of justice\nrequire the court’s\nintervention. This is such a case.The respondent received credit\nfor the 90 days he had served and was ordered to spend one year less 90 days in\nprison.[61]The Crown also drew our attention\nto two recent decisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal which dealt with\nreincarceration, namely R. v. D.G.F., 2010 ONCA 27 (CanLII), and R. v.\nLeo-Mensah, 2010 ONCA 139 (CanLII), leave to appeal to the SCC refused [2010]\nS.C.C.A. No. 170.In D.G.F., the appellant plead guilty to two counts\nof sexual assault, three of making child pornography, and one each of\npossessing and distributing child pornography.The facts were horrific.The\nvictim of his sexual assaults was his own four year old daughter.The child\npornography he transmitted included images of her.His actions included a live\nsexual assault of his daughter which the respondent transmitted by webcam in an\ninternet chat room set up for pedophiles.The respondent, 35 years old at sentencing,\nhad no criminal record.Although the Crown requested a seven-year sentence,\nthe trial judge gave the offender 28 months credit for time in pre-trial\ncustody and ordered 20 more months in custody, followed by three years on\nprobation.[62]Writing for the court, Feldman\nJ.A. observed at ¶ 29 that the range for such offences can extend “well into the double-digit level.”She determined that the effective sentence of four\nyears imposed by the trial judge was manifestly unfit and failed to reflect the\ngravity of the conduct and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.She\nstated:33In most cases, this court is reluctant to\nre-incarcerate an offender who has served the sentence originally imposed and\nhas been released into the community:see, for example, R. v. C.N.H.\n(2002), 2002 CanLII 7751 (ON CA), 62 O.R. (3d) 564 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Mann, [1995] O.J. No 474\n(Ont. C.A.).The factors referred to, Crown delay and the respondent’s progress in the\ncommunity, would also militate against an order that would require the offender\nto be re-incarcerated: R. v. Crazybull, 1993 ABCA 197 (CanLII), [1993] A.J. No. 473 (Alta.\nC.A.); R. v. Banci, [1982] O.J. No. 58 (Ont. C.A.).34However, this is a case where the sentence\nimposed was so far below the sentence that was required and was “so inadequate that the\ninterests of justice require the court’s\nintervention”: see R.\nv. Cheng (1991), 50 O.A.C. 374 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 5.The appellate court imposed the\nsentence of seven years which had been recommended by the Crown at trial and\nhad been the basis for the respondent’s\nguilty plea.Although the respondent had already been on release for nine\nmonths and was receiving treatment and making progress, and although the Crown\nhad caused pre-appeal delay, the respondent was re-incarcerated.[63]The Crown also pointed to Leo-Mensah\nto support its argument for reincarceration.There the respondent who prepared\nincome tax returns provided false charitable donation receipts to clients.Over a three-year period, he submitted over 800 returns which led to over\n$3,000,000 in tax refunds.At trial, he plead guilty to two counts of tax\nevasion and one of fraud.The judge gave him double credit for pre-trial\ncustody, sentenced him to one further day in jail, and ordered a fine of\n$145,766.[64]The Ontario Court of Appeal\ndetermined that the judge had made several errors, including the imposition of\na sentence below the range for large-scale fraud cases which usually attract a\npenitentiary sentence unless there were extraordinary mitigating\ncircumstances.After determining that the sentence was manifestly unfit, it\nreiterated:15While this court has been reluctant to re‑incarcerate\nan offender who has served the sentence originally imposed and been released\ninto the community, reincarceration is warranted where the original sentence\nwas so far below that which was required that the interests of justice require\nthe court intervene: see R. v. D.G.F., 2010 ONCA 27 (CanLII) at paras. 33‑34.\nIn my view, this is such a case and a period of reincarceration is necessary.It allowed the Crown’s appeal and imposed a further two-year period of\nincarceration.[65]In his submissions on a fit\nsentence and against reincarceration at the hearing of the appeal, the\nrespondent argued vigorously that he had already served most of the sentence\nimposed by the trial judge, he was doing well, and no purpose would be served\nby his reincarceration.He relied heavily on the recent decision of this court\nin R. v. Best, 2012 NSCA 34 (CanLII).There the trial judge found the appellant\nguilty of break and enter and aggravated assault committed with another\nperson.He ordered a 90-day intermittent sentence followed by a two-year term\nof probation, based on the offender’s\nsecondary involvement in the assault (not landing any blows) and the apparent\nspontaneity of the attack.[66]On appeal, MacDonald C.J.N.S.\nwriting for the court, concluded that the sentence was unfit - it should have\nbeen around the three-year mark.However, he declined to substitute an\nadditional sentence involving incarceration.In his reasons, the Chief Justice\nexplained why exceptional relief could be given.In doing so, he addressed\nrelevant criteria as set out in certain case law:[34]...in my view, this is one of those rare cases where,\ndespite the initial inadequate sentence, it is no longer in the interests of\njustice to re‑incarcerate Mr. Best.I say this because he has completed\nhis term of incarceration and is well into his period of probation.Furthermore, by all accounts he is doing well.In these exceptional\ncircumstances, I am convinced that sending him back to jail would not serve the\ninterests of justice.[35]I realize that this represents an exceptional form of\nrelief.However it is not unique.For example, in R. v. Butler, 2008\nNSCA 102 (CanLII), the Crown appealed a community sentence for armed robbery (robbing a\ntaxi driver at knife point by an offender suffering from addictions).This\ncourt found this disposition to be demonstrably unfit in the circumstances and\ndeclared a 30‑month sentence to be appropriate:...[36]However, despite this conclusion, the court resolved not\nto incarcerate Mr. Butler:¶39Although\nI have concluded that the sentence imposed by the trial judge, notwithstanding\nthe need for rehabilitation, inadequately reflects denunciation and general\ndeterrence, in view of the sentence served and the post‑sentence update,\nI am not persuaded that it is in the interests of justice to now substitute\nincarceration for the conditional sentence.(See, for example, R. v. C.S.P.\n2005 NSCA 159 (CanLII), [2005] N.S.J. No. 498 (Q.L.) (C.A.); and R. v. Hamilton,\n2004 CanLII 5549 (ON CA), [2004] O.J. No. 3252 (Q.L.) (C.A.) and R. v.Edmondson, 2005\nSKCA 51 (CanLII), [2005] S.J. No. 256 (Q.L.) (C.A.); leave to appeal refused [2005]\nS.C.C.A. No. 273).¶40Mr.\nButler has successfully completed the six month addictionprogram\nat Booth Centre.He is pursuing an upgrading program with a viewto entering\nCommunity College for which he has funding in place.It would notbe in the\ninterests of justice to now commit him to a prison environment which may\nadversely affect his rehabilitation (R. v. Bratzer, supra, at para. 47\nand R. v. Parker [1997] N.S.J. No. 194 (Q.L.) (C.A.)).I have\nconsidered, as well, the fact that Mr. Butler, having spent five and one half\nmonths on remand, prior to trial, is now aware of the realities of prison\nlife.Indeed, that experience may well have motivated him to get his life in\norder and will hopefully keep him moving forward on that path. (R. v.\nC.S.P., supra; R. v. Hamilton, supra; R. v. Edmondson, supra; R. v. Symes,\n[1989] O.J. No. 528 (Q.L.) (C.A.); R. v. Shaw, [1977] O.J. No. 147\n(Q.L.) (C.A.); R. v. Boucher, 2004 CanLII 17719 (ON CA), [2004] O.J. No. 2689 (Q.L.)(C.A.); R.\nv. Hirnschall, 2003 CanLII 46450 (ON CA), [2003] O.J. No. 2296 (Q.L.) (C.A.); R. v. Fox, [2002]\nO.J. No. 2496 (Q.L.) (C.A.); and R. v. G.C.F., 2004 CanLII 4771 (ON CA), [2004] O.J. No.3177\n(Q.L.) (C.A.)).[37]A similar approach has been taken by other Canadian\nappellate courts.For example, in R. v. Shaw, [1977] O.J. No. 147, two\nrespondents were convicted of “serious\ndrug trafficking offences”\nfor which the trial judge gave them no jail‑time, but rather, strict\nprobation for two years.The sentences were imposed ten months after the\noffence, and at the time of the appeals the two respondents had carried out\nfour months of their two‑year probation order.Post‑sentence\nreports meanwhile indicated that their work records were exemplary, and that\ntheir community involvement was providing needed services inthe community.The Ontario Court of Appeal observed:“[i]t\nis apparent that the rehabilitation program directed by the trial judge is\nworking” and “[t]o impose a custodial\nterm now would be a sentence far more crushing than it would have been if it\nhad been imposed at the time of trial”.The court moreover stated:¶15Although\nas I have observed this was a case in which an appropriate sentence should have\nincluded the imposition of a custodial term, in the circumstances which now\nconfront this Court general principles of sentencing are not paramount.[38]Then in R. v. Boucher, 2004 CanLII 17719 (ON CA), [2004] O.J. No. 2689, the\nrespondent was sentenced to two years (less one day) plus two years of\nprobation for attempting to murder his estranged wife.The Ontario Court of\nAppeal held that this sentence was unfit and that a term of six years less time\non remand was more appropriate. However, the sentence at trial was varied only\nto increase the probation period to three years.The court stated:¶33...\n[A]t the time this appeal was heard, [the respondent] had been out of custody\nfor several months.On the record before us, there is no indication that the\n[respondent] has made any attempt to contact the complainant, or otherwise\nrepeat his previous misconduct, since being released.This court has commented\non other occasions about the potentially deleterious impact of re‑incarceration,\nparticularly in relation to its effect on rehabilitation.... In all of the\ncircumstances, I do not consider that it would be in the interests of justice\nto re‑incarcerate the appellant at this time.See also:R. v. C.S.P., 2005 NSCA 159 (CanLII) and R. v.\nG.C.F., 2004 CanLII 4771 (ON CA), [2004] O.J. No. 3177 (ONCA).DISPOSITION[39]Therefore, despite the judge issuing a sentence that was\ndemonstrably unfit, it is no longer in the interests of justice to re‑incarcerate\nthe respondent.In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.[67]For a recent appellant court\ndecision where it was held that although a fit sentence would have been four\nyears imprisonment, in the particular circumstances of that case, the interests\nof justice were best served by allowing the conditional sentence of two years\nless a day to run its course, see R. v. Kane, 2012 NLCA 53 (CanLII).[68]In R. v. Veysey, 2006 NBCA\n55 (CanLII), the New Brunswick Court of Appeal provided a helpful overview of some of\nthe facts taken into account when appellate courts decide the difficult issue\nof reincarceration when the sentence imposed at trial was too low:32We find nothing inherently harsh or oppressive in\njailing a person who has served a sentence that was demonstrably unfit.The\nfact that the original sentence has been fully served does not, by itself,\nwarrant special consideration.At the same time, we are left with the Supreme\nCourt's caution that to require an accused to serve a fit sentence after having\ncompleted an unfit one may lead to an injustice. Thus, one must be prepared to\nrecognize that in certain instances reincarceration could work an injustice.The difficult task is to identify the circumstances in which reincarceration\nwould work such a result.In short:What constitutes special circumstances?Having regard to the jurisprudence discussed above, we have isolated four\nfactors that one could reasonably consider relevant to the issue of whether a\nstay should be granted.This is not to suggest that the list is exhaustive.\nOther pertinent factors may exist.However, for purposes of deciding this\nappeal, we are content to examine the following:(1) the seriousness of the\noffences for which the offender was convicted; (2) the elapsed time since the\noffender gained his or her freedom and the date the appellate court hears and\ndecides the sentence appeal; (3) whether any delay is attributable to one of\nthe parties; and (4) the impact of reincarceration on the rehabilitation of the\noffender.In addition to the factors in\nthis non-exhaustive list, others include that relied upon by the Crown in this\ncase, namely where the sentence imposed was so manifestly unfit that\nreincarceration is required; and the hardship occasioned by imposing sentences\nof imprisonment on appeal, such as where, had the offender received the\nappropriate sentences at trial, they would have been released from custody on\nparole months ago:see R. v. Hamilton, 2004 CanLII 5549 (ON CA), 2004 CarswellOnt 3214 at ¶ 165.[69]The crimes committed by the\nrespondent - two assaults and a sexual assault, all against the woman who was\nthen his wife - were serious offences.The evidence established a basis for\nthe trial judge’s concern about the respondent’s “propensity\ntowards violence”.[70]In the first assault, in order to\nengage another person, the respondent shoved the victim aside and onto the\nground.This sudden and public assault demonstrates his callous disregard for\nher personal safety.The respondent committed a reprehensible sexual assault\nby forcing anal intercourse on his victim.He responded to her saying “no”, which she was\nentitled to do, by domineering and humiliating her.He damaged her\npsychological health.The respondent then committed a further assault by\nkicking his victim following the sexual assault.[71]The victim of the crimes committed\nby the respondent was his then wife, the mother of their children.His\noffences are ones which involved domestic violence, and for which the level of\nmoral blame worthiness is high.They are factually distinguishable from the\nbreak and enter and secondary involvement in an aggravated assault on an\nacquaintance in Best, and the robbery of a taxi driver in Butler\nand the drug trafficking in Shaw, both of which are relied upon in Best.[72]The respondent has served the five\nmonth custodial portion of his sentence and all of the eight months conditional\nsentence with house arrest.He has just finished the final three month conditional\nsentence.[73]Another relevant factor concerns\nthe length of any delay in proceeding to the appeal and the party responsible\nfor such delay.Neither the Crown nor defence counsel suggests there was any\nsuch delay here.[74]This brings me to the impact that\nreincarceration would have on the rehabilitation of the respondent.The court\nwas not presented with a post-sentence report.However, both Crown and defence\ncounsel indicated that the respondent has been seeing a psychiatrist and is\ninvolved in a family violence program.The Crown does not say that he is not\nmaking progress or that his efforts are other than sincere.However, it\nsuggests that if the respondent is reincarcerated, he can continue his\ninvolvement in that program while imprisoned.The respondent is seeking\nreinstatement to his position as a firefighter and his grievance arbitration\nwas to be heard following his appeal.His counsel suggested that the\narbitration would be “pretty much”\ndetermined if the respondent was reincarcerated.The respondent isalso\nenrolled in a heavy equipment course.[75]I have given the determination of\nan appropriate sentence and whether such a sentence should include\nreincarceration most anxious consideration.The reincarceration aspect is a\nclose call.Having reviewed the case law, I agree with the Crown’s position that, for this offender and these offences,\na fit sentence for the sexual assault and two assaults would have been two and\none-half years in custody.However, while the sentence imposed was\ndemonstrably unfit, in my opinion it is no longer in the interests of justice\nto reincarcerate the respondent.[76]As the cases cited by the Crown\nillustrate, even if an offender has already been released from custody and\nthere are mitigating factors, an appellate court willreincarcerate an\noffender if the interests of justice require.The interests of justice require\na holistic assessment of the objectives of sentencing and the offender’s circumstances and what would be accomplished by him\nspending more time in custody.Resolution of this issue is not simply a\nmathematical or formulaic exercise, and number crunching alone will not\ndetermine whether reincarceration should be ordered.There is no stringent\nformula to follow, nor would one be appropriate.[77]In this case, the sentence was for\n16 months with 11 of those served in the community.When this appeal was\nheard, the respondent had completed the five month custodial portion of his\nsentence and the eight month conditional sentence portion which included house\narrest.When this decision is released, he will have served the final three\nmonth conditional sentence.He followed the terms of those conditional\nsentences without fail.He is involved in a family violence program, and\ntaking training that will assist in his finding employment should his efforts\nto be reinstated as a firefighter be unsuccessful.If those efforts should be\nsuccessful, reincarceration could adversely affect his employment.In my view,\nreturning him to custody would have a negative impact on the respondent’s rehabilitation.It would not serve the interests of\njustice.Disposition[78]I would quash the ground of appeal\nregarding the judge’s decision not to impose a SOIRA order, and\nwould dismiss the appeal.Oland,\nJ.A.Concurred in:MacDonald,\nC.J.N.S.Beveridge,\nJ.A."}

Cisorio........................................................................................................for the CrownPeter Chmiel\n.....................................................................for the\naccused Omar Baig MirzaBHABHA J.:Introduction[1]On September 20th\n2010, Omar Baig Mirza’s preliminary inquiry on a three count Information\nalleging two counts of robbery and one count possession of stolen property was\nscheduled to begin. Three days were set aside. Instead, on the morning of the\nfirst day, Mr. Baig pleaded guilty to one count of robbery, and one count of\nassault. The Crown withdrew the third count of possession of stolen property.[2]The two offences to\nwhich Mr. Mirza pleaded guilty were committed in September and October 2008\napproximately two weeks apart. Both complainants were young women who were\nstrangers to the defendant. The offences were not entirely random in that the defendant\ntargeted each of the complainants after he noticed them while riding the TTC.He then followed them as they made their way home and accosted them.The\ndefendant’s motive for the offences is unclear, but at least with respect to\nthe robbery, financial gain does not appear to be a factor.Position of the Parties[3]The Crown’s position\nis that these are serious and troubling offences which require a jail sentence\nnotwithstanding the fact that the defendant is a first offender.[4]Mr. Cisorio for\nCrown submitted that a conditional sentence is not available to the defendant\nas the circumstances surrounding the offences make them both “serious personal\ninjury” offences. As such, he submitted that the appropriate global sentence\nshould be a three to four month custodial sentence, to be followed by a lengthy\nperiod of probation. The Crown also sought ancillary orders, namely a DNA order\nas well as a weapons prohibition under s. 109 of the Code.[5]Mr. Chmiel for the\ndefence did not dispute the Crown’s characterization of the offences as\n“serious personal injury” offences. The defence submitted that the appropriate\ndisposition for the defendant given his lack of prior record and age, which at twenty-nine\nwas described as “youthful”, was a suspended sentence. Mr. Chmiel does not take\nissue with the ancillary orders sought by the Crown.Facts Relating to the\nOffencesThe Robbery[6]An agreed statement\nof facts was marked as exhibit #1 at the outset of the preliminary inquiry.\nThose facts reveal that on Thursday, September 25th at approximately\n9:20 p.m. the complainant Homa Badri was walking home when she noticed a male\nwho had been taking the same route as her using public transportation. She\nfirst noticed him at the Lawrence subway station at between approximately 8:00\nand 8:15 when they both boarded the same subway car. They both exited at Finch\nstation and Ms. Badri proceeded to the bus bay. The defendant boarded the same\nbus and sat across from Ms. Badri. When she exited the bus at her usual stop,\nso did he.[7]Ms.Badri began\nwalking towards a bridge and a pathway. She noticed the defendant walking on\nthe opposite side of the street. At some point, he crossed the street and stood\nat the entrance to the bridge. When Ms. Badri approached the bridge, the\ndefendant grabbed her by holding onto both of her upper arms with both of his\nhands. He told her to be quiet and when she asked what was wrong with him he\nresponded by telling her to “shut up”. When Ms. Badri began yelling, the\naccused then grabbed her purse off her shoulder and ran from the scene.[8]Ms. Badri suffered\nbruising on her wrists.Her purse contained several articles of her personal\nidentification, as well as credit and debit cards, but no money.The Assault[9]On Tuesday, October\n14th 2008 at approximately 10:45 p.m., the second complainant Ms.\nThucloan Lieu boarded the southbound Yonge subway at the North York station.\nShe proceeded to Yonge and Bloor where she transferred to the Bloor/Danforth\nline and heading east.It was at this time that she first noticed the\ndefendant who was in the same subway car as she was. Ms Lieu then exited at the\nPape station where she proceeded to the bus bays. She noticed that the\ndefendant boarded the same bus directly after she took her seat. He seated\nhimself directly across from Ms. Lieu causing her to become suspicious of him.[10]When Ms. Lieu exited\nthe bus through the front doors of the bus, and she noticed the defendant\nexiting from the rear doors. As she walked north on Pape Avenue she noticed the\ndefendant following her. When she turned to go eastbound she noticed that he\nappeared to be looking around waiting for the area to clear.As the\ncomplainant neared her home she heard rapid footsteps approaching from behind\nher. The defendant approached Ms. Lieu and grabbed her by the front of the neck\nby one hand. The victim screamed for help and the defendant let go of her and\nran off. No words were exchanged.[11]Ms Lieu suffered a\nsore neck as a result of the assault.The Investigation and Items Seized\nduring a Search[12]Surveillance video\nfrom the TTC assisted in identifying the defendant as a suspect and on January\n28th 2009 the police executed a Search Warrant at the defendant’s\nresidence in Richmond Hill. Among the many items seized as a result of the\nsearch were:(a)the personal identification of Ms. Badri\n(Health card, Social Insurance card, credit and debit cards;(b)photographs\nof Ms. Badri displayed tucked in the mirror of a dressing stand;(c)a blow up\ndoll;(d)a rubber\nvagina;(e)a substantial\nquantity of pornography DVD’s, and lastly(f)a newspaper clipping from the Toronto Sun\ndated October 16th 2008 regarding the two attacks which included a\nphotograph of Mr. Mirza simply identified as a possible suspect. This clipping\nwas found in Mr. Mirza’s wallet.Facts Relating to the\nOffender[13]In addition to\ncounsel’s submissions, the Court also had the benefit of both a pre-sentence\nreport as well as an assessment from Dr. MacDonald, a staff psychiatrist at\nCAMH.[14]Mr. Mirza is twenty-nine\nyears old. He has no prior record.[15]He was born and\nraised in Denmark. He is an only child. He immigrated to Canada with his mother\nand step-father in 1997 when he was approximately sixteen years old. He has a\nvery close relationship with both his parents.[16]The defendant\ncompleted grade school in Denmark and, in fact, went as far as grade 9 which is\nthe equivalent of early completion of high school, with the tenth year being\noptional before progressing to college or university. The defendant’s mother reported\nthat he had no issues in school in Denmark either scholastically or\nbehaviourally. After coming to Canada, he was placed back in grade 6 at a\npublic school at the age of 18 having found that his 9th year level\ndid not compare with a completed high school in Canada. When that did not work\nout, he attended Sheridan College for a few years attempting to complete his\ngrade 12 there. He then left Sheridan and obtained his OSSD at a private\nschool.[17]The defendant\nenrolled in a vocational training program working towards a licence as an auto\nmechanic but he never completed the program. He did complete a program to become\nan automotive technician. At the time of the pre-sentence report he was working\nfull time at a Mr. Lube earning an hourly wage and working 1:00 p.m. to 8:00\np.m.[18]Between 2001 and 2008\nthe family has suffered a number of significant events that have affected them\nall emotionally, and financially. Firstly, Mr. Mirza’s step-father was involved\nin a very serious car accident leaving him in considerable pain and unable to\nwork. Mr. Mirza’s mother had to quit her job to take care of him. There is a\npending civil lawsuit relating to the motor vehicle accident. The accident led\nto changes in the family dynamic. Both parents stay at home full time. They\ncannot do many of the things they once did. Then, in 2006 the family attempted\nto purchase a pizza franchise. They turned out to be the victim’s of a\nsignificant fraud and lost hundreds of thousands of dollars.In 2008, prior to\nthe two offences before the court, the defendant’s step-father attempted\nsuicide by overdosing on painkillers. The defendant’s mother reports that this\nhad a significant profound effect on the defendant.[19]Dr. MacDonald in his\nreport notes that “as [Mr. Mirza] described the family’s living situation, it\nsounded claustrophia, (sic)i.e. a small residence with little privacy and\nlittle joint income except from his near minimum wage job. He admits to being\nfrustrated at times irritable with the family, in which he is the only child”.[20]Dr. MacDonald met\nwith the defendant for the purpose of an out of court assessment under the\nMental Health Act. Part of the reason for the assessment was the nature of some\nof the substantial collection of pornographic material found at the defendant’s\nresidence. This raised concerns on the part of the police and the Crown about\nhis sexual proclivities that extend well beyond the specific offences to which\nhe pleaded guilty.[21]In his meeting with\nDr. MacDonald, the defendant seemed unaware of whether or not the assessment\nwas for the purpose of sentencing. Because of this uncertainty, Dr. MacDonald\ndid not even attempt to refer the defendant for phallometric assessment. He\nindicates that he would not have done so even if the defendant had been willing\nat that point.[22]Dr. Macdonald noted\nthat the defendant has no prior criminal record, nor any history of any known\nsexual aberrations. He has no psychiatric history or any such history in his\nfamily of origin.[23]The defendant denied\nany sexual or monetary motive for the offences, while acknowledging that the\nvictim’s were selected on the basis of their physical attraction to him. He\ndismissed his behaviour as a stupid lapse in judgment eventually conceding that\nhe may have wanted to scare the victims. He denied having any special interest\nin pornographic material containing violence or aggression and maintained that\nsome of the relevant DVD’s were only present in his collection due to bulk\nbuying of sets of such DVD’s at a time.[24]The pre-sentence\nreport indicates that for a period of six months after his arrest the defendant\ndid see a psychologist, Dr. Deilami, for treatment. Dr. Deilami did not perform\nan assessment. The psychologist was aware that Dr. MacDonald’s assessment was\nongoing. When the pre-sentence report was prepared, he had not seen the\ndefendant for some time.[25]The defendant\nexpressed to Dr. MacDonald that he did not feel the need for treatment for\nsexual deviation or anything else. Dr. MacDonald found that the defendant was ingenuous\nwhen he declared that he just needed to be caught and that having been under\nhouse arrest for two years played a role in permanently breaking the cycle in\nhis behaviour as a collector of pornographic material. It is to be noted in the\npre-sentence report, the defendant’s mother with whom he lived at the relevant\ntime (and with whom he continues to reside) was aware that he possessed some\npornography but was unaware of the full extent of the collection. She noted\nthat she grew up in Denmark where having pornographic material was considered\nnormal.[26]The defendant did not\nreport any intimate relationships of any significance. He also did not\nacknowledge any substance use or abuse. He denied any serious mood disorders\nand expressed to Dr. MacDonald that he believed his problem with pornographic\nmaterial and preoccupation with sex had been broken since his arrest. Yet, Dr.\nMacDonald noted that the defendant reported no sexual outlets, nor any\nresultant sexual frustration.[27]The defendant\nreported having no real hobbies or interests. He reported that he would often\npass the time riding public transit without any specific goal or aim,\nostensibly to “clear his mind”.[28]Dr. MacDonald found\nit difficult to summarize the defendant’s problems and possible treatment\nneeds. This was because “the probability of [the defendant] being forthright\nabout his personal intimate concerns is remote”.That said, Dr. MacDonald\nfound no evidence whatsoever that the defendant suffers from any major mental\nillness. Nor was there clear evidence of any obvious personality disorder. In\nhis opinion the defendant likely suffers from a form of paraphilia. He\nconcluded that the likelihood of fascination with sexual violence is\nsubstantial, but currently unverifiable”. He shared the concerns reported by\nthe arresting officers in this regard.[29]Dr. MacDonald\nrecommended a specific referral to the Sexual Behaviours Clinic at the Clarke\nsite of CAMH, which he opined could potentially be very useful, with a specific\nreferral to Dr. Robert Dickey.Victim Impact[30]The impact of the\noffences on both complainants was significant. Not surprisingly, they both\nreported feelings of anxiety, depression and insecurity following the offences.\nThey both felt their sense of independence was taken away from them.[31]Ms. Badri, the first\ncomplainant whose purse was snatched from her, reported that while the physical\ninjuries she suffered as a result of the robbery were minor (bumps and\nscratches), the emotional impact was longer lasting and serious. She continued\nto be fearful long after the incident and suffered panic attacks as well as\nheadaches among other physical symptoms of her anxiety. She searched for\nanswers as to why this happened to her and also had feelings of guilt for\nfeeling as though she could have done more to prevent the attack.Financially\nthe incident had an impact in that she had her locks changed, and had a\nsecurity system installed. She also dropped out of school. In short, Ms. Badri\ndescribed the impact of the incident as “life altering”.[32]The victim of the\nsecond attack, Ms. Lieu reported that she moved out of Toronto as a result of\nthe assault. For months she had to endure a long inter-city commute. Whereas\nshe was once very independent and a “go-go kind of person”, she found herself\nnot being able to come home after dark and having to call someone or have\nsomeone with her for a period of at least six months following the incident.\nShe reports that she now rarely goes out alone anymore. Her sleep pattern in\nparticular was impacted by the offence. She has since moved back to Toronto,\nbut she has yet to ride the TTC. The incident has even had an impact on her\nliving arrangements. While she can afford to live by herself, she now has a\nroommate so that she is not always home alone. In her words, “[s]omething like\nthis changes your life…”. Ms. Lieu suffered a bruised neck for approximately\none week. She did not seek medical attention.Sentencing Objectives[33]Section 718 of the\nCriminal Code sets out the main purpose and principles of sentencing. The\nfundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute to respect for the law and\nthe maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions\nthat have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from\ncommitting offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where\nnecessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims\nor to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in\noffenders and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.[34]Section 718.1 sets\nout the fundamental principle of proportionality. While section 718.2 mandates\nthat all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the\ncircumstances should be considered for all offenders…”Analysis[35]The real question at\nthe heart of this hearing was whether a sentence other than a jail sentence\ncould adequately address the principle of denunciation.[36]In my view the\nrelevant principles that require particular emphasis in the circumstances of this\ncase are denunciation and both specific and general deterrence. Rehabilitation\nis also an important consideration, but not the predominant one.[37]After much\ndeliberation, and upon balancing of all of the relevant factors, I concluded\nthat a term of imprisonment was not required in the particular circumstances of\nthis case and this offender. What follows are the considerations I took into\naccount in arriving at that conclusion.[38]No doubt the offences\nof robbery and assault are serious offences. The victims were targeted and\nvulnerable. They were terrified as anyone would be, but especially women travelling\nalone and relying on public transport to get home. However, one cannot lose\nsight of the fact that the degree of physical violence used was not extreme.\nThe first incident, without minimizing the offence, was effectively a purse\nsnatching. In the second incident, no words were exchanged and force was\napplied to the complainant’s neck for a very short period of time.[39]In my view, the\nCrown’s position for a custodial disposition was driven primarily by the\nstalking aspect of the offences coupled with concerns arising from the vast\ncollection of pornographic material found at Mr. Mirza’s residence when he was\narrested, some of which was violent in nature. Those concerns are legitimate\nand deserve careful consideration.They were in fact echoed by Dr. MacDonald.However, Dr. MacDonald made no clear, unequivocal or specific findings that Mr.\nMirza is in fact sexually deviant, or that the offences were likely sexually\nmotivated, much less that there is a real risk that he may be violent,\nparticularly against women, in the future.At best all Dr. MacDonald was able\nto conclude was that “[i]n all likelihood, he has some form of paraphilia. …the\nlikelihood of an unreported fascination with sexual violence is substantial,\nbut currently unverifiable”. One thing that emerged from the report was that\nfurther assessment was necessary and a specific referral to another doctor specializing\nin sexual behaviours was recommended.[40]The record confirms\nthat Mr. Mirza appears to have little insight into his conduct and this is of\nsome concern. However, the court in my view ought to be careful not to place\nundue emphasis on this failing.While I rejected the submission that at\ntwenty-nine Mr. Mirza is a “youthful offender”, what emerges from the record\n(the pre-sentence report, Dr. MacDonald’s assessment, and the DVD statement of\nthe defendant) is that Mr. Mirza is immature for his age both emotionally,\nsocially, and psychologically. He is an only child and although he is an adult\nwho contributes financially to the household, he appears to behave and to be\ntreated by his parents almost as a teenager.At the time of sentencing, Mr.\nMizra continued to live at home with his parents in a state of co-dependency.Aggravating Factors[41]In balancing all of\nthe relevant factors, I considered the following aggravating factors that\nmilitated for a custodial disposition:•The defendant preyed on two young women in two\ndifferent parts of the city several weeks apart. These were not entirely random\nacts, in that the women were targeted once they caught the defendant’s eye.\nBoth women were selected because he found them attractive. He followed a\nsimilar pattern, effectively following them some distance, then keeping a\nlook-out before accosting them. He applied force to each of them in varying\ndegrees before running away.•The psychological impact of the offences on the\nvictims has been significant. Both complainants have been robbed of their sense\nof security and independence which they will not easily recover, if ever.Mitigating\nFactors[42]I also considered the\nfollowing mitigating factors; the defendant pleaded guilty and saved the\ncommunity the time and expense of a preliminary inquiry and a trial. The plea\nwas not as early a plea as possible as it was entered on the first day of what\nwas expected to be a three day preliminary inquiry. Still, Mr. Mirza is to be\ngiven credit for accepting responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty\nand for sparing the complainants the ordeal of reliving the incidents by having\nto testify about them in detail, not once but possibly twice.[43]The defendant has no\nprior criminal record.[44]He has a supportive\nfamily and is gainfully employed.[45]He has complied with\nstrict house arrest bail conditions for well over two years without any\nincident.[46]He attended for\npsychological counselling while on bail and was generally cooperative with the\npreparation of the presentence report and psychiatric report of Dr. MacDonald.\nIt is to be noted that there were some concerns expressed about how forthright\nhe was about his proclivities.Conclusion[47]Ultimately, in\nbalancing all of the relevant principles and factors, I concluded that\nsubstantial weight ought to be given to the fact that this twenty nine-year old\nman has no prior record and spent over two years on strict house arrest without\nany incident. That type of curtailment of one’s liberty for such an extended\nperiod of time sufficiently denounces his conduct and can be expected to deter\nhim from re-offending.I also took into account two days of pre-sentence\ncustody following Mr. Mizra’s arrest.[48]Any residual concerns\nabout the likelihood of recidivism can be appropriately addressed through the\nterms and duration of a probation order which will address any public safety\nconcerns in a more meaningful way. The process of assessment for deviant sexual\nbehaviours can begin right away and that risk, if it is found to exist, can be\nproperly assessed and perhaps treated, if the defendant is willing. At a\nminimum, he is required to attend for appropriate counselling and to provide\nproof of participation and compliance in any such program.[49]Given the legitimate\nbut, as yet unsubstantiated concerns, the Crown expressed about any possible\nsexual motive underlying the offences, the maximum period of probation is not\ninappropriate. That way Mr. Mirza will be under the court’s supervision for a\ntotal ofin excess of five years.Sentence Imposed[50]For the reasons\nindicated, I determined that suspending the passing of sentence does not\nundermine the relevant principles of sentence especially if Mr. Mirza is under\nprobation for the maximum period of time: three years. The terms include a\nreporting condition. In addition, he is required to reside with his parents. He\nis subject to a curfew for the first year of his probation. He is required to\nattend forthwith for an assessment with Dr. Robert Dickey at the Sexual\nBehaviours Clinic at the Clarke Site of the Centre for Addiction and Mental\nHealth, and to provide proof of compliance to the probation officer. He is not\nto have any contact with the named complainants or to be within 100 meters of\nany place they live, work, attend school, or any place he knows them to be.[51]I also imposed both\nancillary orders requested by the Crown.Robbery is a primary designated\noffence so a mandatory DNA order was made. As well, a section 109 order for a\nperiod of ten years prohibiting the possession of firearms, ammunition,\nrestricted weapons, explosive devices, cross bows, etcetera.Released:February 8, 2011Signed: “Justice F.

Morgan J.COUNSEL:Tracy Vogel, for the CrownDonald Powell, for the DefendantHEARD:Trial: March 10 -12 and 23-24,\n2015; sentencing submissions: June 9, 2015Subject to any further\nOrder by a court of competent jurisdiction, an Order has been made in this\nproceeding directing that the identity of the complainant and any information\nthat could disclose such identity shall not be published in any document or\nbroadcast in any way pursuant to s. 486.4 of the Criminal Code of Canada.SENTENCING JUDGMENT[1]The Defendant was charged with three counts of sexual interference and\nthree counts of sexual assault in relation to acts of oral and anal sex he\nperpetrated on his biological son.[2]On April 14, 2015, after a four day trial before me as judge alone, convictions\nwere entered on two counts of sexual interference and one count of sexual\nassault. The balance of the charges are stayed under the principle set out in R v Kienapple, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1975]\n1 SCR 729 barring multiple convictions for the same cause.[3]The incidents in issue occurred in April 2004, when the victim was 6\nyears old. He is now 17 years old.[4]It is an understatement to say that the sexual acts done to this child\nby his father have had a serious effect on his life. The impact has been\ndevastating for him and his family. He suffers from personality disorders, has\nfound it impossible to maintain healthy relationships with those around him\n(including with his own mother), has been placed in group homes, has performed\npoorly in school, and has generally been an angry and anti-social youth.[5]Indeed, his victim impact statement says that the Defendant’s violation\nhas caused him over the years to act out in physical aggression, to engage in\ninappropriate sexual actions with the other people around him, and to suffer\ndepression. It also caused him to blame his mother and himself for all his\ntroubles, and has caused his family serious economic impact. The victim’s testimony\nat trial expressed the shame and degradation of these events.[6]The Defendant has a criminal record, including one previous conviction\nfor sexual interference with a minor. However, the current offenses pre-date\nthat offense; the Defendant was a first time offender when the acts in issue\nwere committed.[7]After the previous conviction, the Defendant attended the Sexual\nOffender Relapse Prevention Program and the Sexual Offender Group program at\nCAMH. He has been diagnosed with Pedohebephilia (a sexual preference for\npre-pubescent children). He has not committed any offense since 2009, and is in\nthe process of upgrading his job skills to suit the contemporary employment\nmarket.[8]In R v M (C), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 SCR 500, at 566, Lamer CJC articulated the\nobjectives of sentencing in an instructive way:The determination of a just and appropriate sentence\nis a delicate art which attempts to balance carefully the societal goals of\nsentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the\ncircumstances of the offence, while at all times taking into account the needs\nand current conditions of the community.[9]For cases of sexual assault of a child, the Court of Appeal has\nindicated that the key factor is protection of the child and other children in\nsociety. In R v Woodward, 2011 ONCA 610 (CanLII), [2011] OJ No 4216, at para 76, the court\nspecifically noted that,…when trial judges are sentencing adult sexual\npredators who have exploited innocent children, the focus of the sentencing\nhearing should be on the harm caused to the child by the offender’s conduct and\nthe life-altering consequences that can and often do flow from it. While the\neffects of a conviction on the offender and the offender’s prospects for\nrehabilitation will always warrant consideration the objectives of\ndenunciation, deterrence, and the need to separate sexual predators from\nsociety for society’s well-being and the well-being of our children must take\nprecedence.[10]The Defendant’s offense is a particularly heinous one. He is convicted\nof performing oral sex and compelling oral sex to be performed on him, as well\nas forcing anal intercourse on a six year old. The Court of Appeal has said on\na number of occasions that, “Harm occasioned to children by adult sexual\npredators is cause for concern”: R v DD, 2002 CanLII 44915 (ON CA), [2002] OJ No. 1061, at para 45;\nR v Woodward, supra, at para 73. If anything, the cause for\nconcern is all the greater where the perpetrator is the child’s own father.[11]Generally speaking, sentencing must be proportionate to the gravity of\nthe offense, taking into account mitigating factors. In the Defendant’s case,\nthere is limited mitigation. He opted for a full preliminary inquiry and trial,\nwhich is his legal right for which he cannot be faulted; however, this course\nof action did nothing to mitigate the traumatic effect on the child\ncomplainant. Moreover, the Defendant continues to be in denial; although it was\nclear at trial that he had a good relationship with his son in the past and\nthat he feels bad about the problems his son has had in recent years, he does\nnot take personal responsibility and thus shows no remorse for the offense.[12]The offense itself was an act of aggression that attacked the emotional\nand physical integrity of the child. It was not a momentary loss of control by\nthe Defendant, but a violation of a person for whom he was in a position of\ntrust. A child’s loss of the ability to love and trust a parent is something\nthat is impossible to restore. The victim in this case has suffered a kind of\npsychic damage from which he may never fully recover.[13]An appropriate sentence should be in line with sentences imposed on\nsimilar offenders who perpetrate similar offenses in similar circumstances. Counsel\nfor the Crown suggests that the range of incarceration in these circumstances, where\nthere is breach of trust and sexual assault culminating in penetration, is 5-8\nyears. Counsel for the defense suggests that the appropriate range is somewhat\nshorter, 3-5 years, given that the offenses did not occur over a protracted\nperiod of time, but rather stopped when the victim was six years old and never\nrecurred.[14]In R v D(M), 2012 ONCA 894 (CanLII), [2012] OJ No 6059, at para 66, Laskin JA stated\nthat, “We have recognized that sexual abuse of children by a person in a\nposition of trust or authority now warrants more severe sentences, and where\nthe abuse includes sexual intercourse, in most cases, a three-to-five year\nrange is too low.” He went on to specify, at para 68, that aggravating\ncircumstances for such offenses include, inter alia, “sexual intercourse\n(vaginal or anal), oral sex, incest…” These are the very acts for which the\nDefendant has been convicted here.[15]Likewise, in DD, supra, Moldaver JA (as he then was)\nindicated that a 9 year sentence is at the low end of the spectrum where there\nwas breach of trust together with intercourse with a multiple underage victims.\nAs a follow-up, the Court of Appeal has commented in subsequent decisions that,\n“…while the number of victims will be a factor, the instruction from DD\ndoes not become inapplicable where there is only one victim”: R v DM\n2012 ONCA 520 (CanLII), [2012] OJ No 3616, at para 36 (Ont CA).[16]On the other hand, one factor leading to the number of years imposed in\nthe DD case was that the sexual assaults were committed on “a regular\nand persistent basis over substantial periods of time”. That is a\ndistinguishing point in the present case, where the Defendant’s offending conduct\nceased almost as suddenly as it began. The acts for which the Defendant has\nbeen convicted took place over the course of two weeks in April 2004, and were\nnever repeated.[17]In R v PM, 2012 ONCA 162 (CanLII), Rosenberg JA reviewed the historic\nevolution of sentencing for this type of case. At para 43, he noted that, “Each\ncase will, of course, turn on its own acts and sentencing is a highly\nindividualized exercise.” He then went on to explain, at para 46, that, “where\na father has committed repeated acts of incest with his daughter over many\nmonths, as in this case, it will be highly unusual for the court to impose a\npenitentiary sentence of less than five to six years.”[18]Counsel for the defense cites R v B(J), [1990] OJ No 36 (Ont CA),\nwhere Blair JA indicated that 3 to 5 years is the appropriate range in a case of\nthis nature. He concedes, rightly, that this calculus has been modified more\nrecently, and that Laskin JA specifically qualified this in D(M), supra,\nat para 66, where he stated: “However, several decisions of this court in the\nlast decade demonstrate that the range outlined in R v B(J) is no longer\nappropriate.”[19]To this end, Rosenberg JA opined in PM, supra, at para 47,\nthat a 5 year sentence is “a lenient one and at the bottom end of the range.”\nIn that case, the victim was the defendant’s daughter and the abuse took place\nover a period of 13 months when the child was 13 to 14 years old. The defendant\nthere had pleaded guilty and was remorseful, and had the support of his family\nincluding the support of the victim herself.[20]In R v DM, 2012 ONCA 520 (CanLII), [2012] OJ No 3616, at para 32, Feldman JA provides a\nrelevant summary of aggravating and mitigating factors in a case such as this\none: “…the age of the victim, the duration and frequency of the sexual\nassaults, the criminal record of the offender, the effects on the victim and\nthe presence or absence of collateral violence and remorse.” The Defendant here\nhas no criminal record that is relevant to this offense, and his sexual acts\ndid not take place in a context of collateral violence in the form of beatings,\netc. On the other hand, as indicated above, he expresses no remorse and\nperpetrated his acts when his son was at a young and very vulnerable age.[21]Overall, the Crown and the defense are not that far apart on what they\nconsider to be the appropriate range of sentence. Having regard to the range\nset out in the more recent cases, and the comments made by the Court of Appeal,\nI am of the view that the low end of this spectrum as articulated by Blair JA\nin B(J) is too low, and that the high end of this spectrum as articulated\nby Moldaver JA in DD is too high.[22]Under the circumstances, the Crown posits that 5 years is at the low end\nof the appropriate range, and the defense posits that 5 years is at the high\nend of the appropriate range. I consider 5 years to be the appropriate term of\nimprisonment, taking all of the aggravating and mitigating factors into\naccount.***[23]Mr. DH, please stand at this time.[24]In all of your\ncircumstances and those of the offence, I sentence you to a period of 5 years’\nincarceration.[25]In addition, as suggested by counsel for the Crown, you are\nprohibited for the rest of your life from possessing any firearm or other\nweapon or ammunition as set out in s. 109 of the Criminal Code. I also make a DNA order pursuant to section 487.051(2) of the Criminal\nCode.[26]Further, pursuant to s. 161 of the Criminal Code, you\nshall not(a) attend\na public park or public swimming area where persons under the age of 16 years\nare present or can reasonably be expected to be present, or a daycare centre,\nschoolground, playground or community centre;(b) be within two kilometres of any place where\nyour son, the complainant/victim in this matter, ordinarily resides, is\nemployed, or attends school;(c) seek,\nobtain or continue any employment, whether or not the employment is remunerated,\nor become or be a volunteer in a capacity, that involves being in a position of\ntrust or authority towards persons under the age of 16 years;(d) have\nany contact – including communicating by any means – with a person who is under the age of 16 years, unless you\ndo so under the supervision of a person whom the court considers appropriate.[27]Finally, you are to register as a sex offender\nunder the relevant provincial and federal registries.[28]Mr. DH, the Court of Appeal has been clear that where sexual\nacts are performed on a young person by a parent or a person in loco\nparentis, the sentence must reflect society’s abhorrence not only at the physical\nabuse, but at the breach of trust. The\nterrible consequences of this incident for your son have underscored the need\nfor you to control any and all sexual impulses toward children. I trust that\nyou will contemplate this in the years ahead.Morgan J.Date: July 9, 2015"}

Fallofield, the British Columbia\nCourt of Appeal made a number of observations regarding the discharge\nprovisions, including the following:1) Discharges\nare not limited to technical or trivial violations;2) Generally,\nthe requirement that a discharge would be in the best interest of the accused\nwould presuppose that the accused is a person of good character, without\nprevious conviction, that it is not necessary to enter a conviction against him\nin order to deter him from future offences or to rehabilitate him, and that the\nentry of a conviction against him may have significant adverse repercussions;\nand3)While the\npublic interest in the deterrence of others must be given due weight, it does\nnot preclude the judicious use of the discharge provisions.[1][12]I also notethe following comments by Justice\nHill of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in two summary conviction\nappeals:Discharges are not restricted to trivial\nmatters: Regina v. Vincente (1975), 18 Crim. L.Q. 292 (Ont. C.A.). Where an\noffender has acted entirely out of character, perhaps in the context of unusual\npressure or stress, a discharge may be a fit sanction: Regina v. Taylor (1975),\n24 C.C.C. (2d) 551 (Ont. C.A.), at 552. Where a criminal record will have a\ntendency to interfere with employment, a discharge should be given serious\nconsideration: Regina v. Myers (1978), 37 C.C.C. (2d) 182 (Ont. C.A.) at pp.\n184-5; Regina v. Culley (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 433 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 435 per.\nA suspended sentence is not necessarily a greater deterrent to others than a\nconditional discharge: Regina v. Cheung and Chow (1976), 19 Crim. L.Q. 281\n(Ont. C.A.).[2]CONDITIONAL SENTENCE OF IMPRISONMENT[13]The conditional sentence came into being when\nsection 742.1 of the Criminal Code was proclaimed in 1996.[14]The Supreme Court of Canada subsequently stated\nin R. v. Proulx that \"Parliament clearly mandated that certain\noffenders who used to go to prison should now serve their sentence in the\ncommunity.\"[3][15]The Supreme Court of Canada stated further that\nan offender who meets the criteria of section 742.1 will serve a sentence under\nstrict surveillance in the community instead of going to prison.His liberty\nwill be constrained by conditions to be attached to the sentence.In case of\nbreach of conditions, the offender will be brought back before a judge who may\norder him to serve the remainder of the sentence in jail, as it was intended by\nParliament that there be a real threat of incarceration to increase compliance\nwith the conditions of the sentence.[4][16]Section 742.1 lists five criteria that a court\nmust consider before deciding to impose a conditional sentence.These are:(1)the offender must be convicted of an offence\nthat is not specifically excluded by the legislation;(2)the offender must be convicted of an offence\nthat is not punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment;(3)the court must impose a term of imprisonment of\nless than two years;(4)the safety of the community would not be\nendangered by the offender serving the sentence in the community; and(5)a conditional sentence would be consistent with\nthe fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to\n718.2.[17]The first four criteria are prerequisites to any\nconditional sentence.These prerequisites answer the question of whether or\nnot a conditional sentence is possible in the circumstances.Once they are\nmet, the next question is whether a conditional sentence is appropriate.That\ndecision turns upon a consideration of the fundamental purpose and principles\nof sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2.[18]In Mr. Lund’s case, the first four prerequisite\ncriteria have been satisfied.[19]His offence is not excluded pursuant to section\n742.1.[20]It is not punishable by a minimum term of\nimprisonment.[21]Crown counsel asked for a sentence of\nimprisonment for much less than two years.[22]Finally, I find that Mr. Lund serving his\nsentence in the community, subject to appropriate conditions, would not endanger\nthe safety of the community.[23]That then leaves the question of whether a\nconditional sentence is appropriate in all of the circumstances of this case.In\nmaking this decision, I must consider the fundamental purpose and principles of\nsentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code.[24]I must also consider whether, after taking into\naccount the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing, I am satisfied\nthat a period of imprisonment would have been theFUNDAMENTAL PURPOSE AND PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[25]The fundamental purpose of sentencing as\nexpressed in section 718 is to contribute to respect for the law, the\nmaintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions\nthat have one or more of the objectives of denunciation; deterring the offender\nand other persons from committing offences; separating offenders from society,\nwhere necessary; assisting in rehabilitating offenders; providing reparation\nfor harm done to victims or to the community; and promoting a sense of responsibility\nin offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the\ncommunity.[26]The relevance and relative importance of each of\nthese objectives will vary according to the nature of the crime and the\ncircumstances of the offender.[5][27]The fundamental principle of sentencing is that\nthe punishment should be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the\ndegree of responsibility of the offender.The punishment should fit the crime.There is no single fit sentence for any particular offence.[6][28]Doherty J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal\nstated in R. v. Hamilton that:The \"gravity of the offence\"\nrefers to the seriousness of the offence in a generic sense as reflected by the\npotential penalty imposed by Parliament and any specific features of the commission\nof the crime which may tend to increase or decrease the harm or risk of harm to\nthe community occasioned by the offence.[7][29]He went on to state that:The \"degree of responsibility of the\noffender\" refers to the offender's culpability as reflected in the\nessential substantive elements of the offence - especially the fault component\n- and any specific aspects of the offender's conduct or background that tend to\nincrease or decrease the offender's personal responsibility for the crime.[8][30]He then quoted Rosenberg J.A. who had previously\ndescribed the proportionality requirement in R. v. Priest:The principle of proportionality is rooted\nin notions of fairness and justice. For the sentencing court to do justice to\nthe particular offender, the sentence imposed must reflect the seriousness of\nthe offence, the degree of culpability of the offender, and the harm occasioned\nby the offence. The court must have regard to the aggravating and mitigating\nfactors in the particular case. Careful adherence to the proportionality\nprinciple ensures that this offender is not unjustly dealt with for the sake of\nthe common good.[9][31]Proportionality is the fundamental principle of\nsentencing, but it is not the only principle to be considered.[32]Section 718.2(d) provides that “an offender\nshould not be deprived of liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be\nappropriate in the circumstances”.[33]Section 718.2(e) provides that “... all\navailable sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the\ncircumstances should be considered for all offenders.”[34]The Supreme Court of Canada discussed the\napplication of this section in Gladue v. The Queen and said that section\n718.2(e) applies to all offenders, and that imprisonment should be the penal\nsanction of last resort.Prison is to be used only where no other sanction or\ncombination of sanctions is appropriate to the offence and the offender.[10][35]The Supreme Court also noted that section 718\nnow requires a sentencing judge to consider more than the long-standing\nprinciples of denunciation, deterrence and rehabilitation.Now a sentencing\njudge must also consider the restorative goals of repairing the harms suffered\nby individual victims and by the community as a whole, promoting a sense of\nresponsibility and an acknowledgment of the harm caused on the part of the\noffender, and attempting to rehabilitate or heal the offender.[11]As a general\nmatter restorative justice involves some form of restitution and reintegration\ninto the community.A conditional sentence is much more effective than jail in\nachieving these restorative justice goals.[12][36]Counsel for Mr. Lund also argued that parity of\nsentences is a factor to be considered by me in this case.I should take into\naccount the sentences I imposed on the three young men who pled guilty to the same\noffence in the Youth Criminal Justice Court.[37]Crown counsel argued that this is not a relevant\nfactor here.He relied upon the comments by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R.\nv. Wobbes where Epstein, J.A. wrote:72The basis of the parity argument is\nthe fact that each of the co-accused received a non-custodial sentence of 18\nmonths.73The primary difficulty the appellant\nfaces in relying on the parity argument is that the co-accused were young\noffenders sentenced under the regime established under the Youth Criminal\nJustice Act S.C. 2002, c. 1 (\"YCJA\") -- a regime completely\ndifferent from that established under the Criminal Code.Most notably\nthe sentencing principles of general deterrence found in s. 718(1)(a) of the Criminal\nCode are not applicable under the YCJA.Furthermore, the YCJA places\nmandatory restrictions on the use of custodial sentences.74In addition to the impact of the\noperation of these two distinct regimes on the disparity between the sentences\nof the appellant and his co-accused, another factor that explains the\ndifference between the sentences is the fact that the co-accused pled guilty\nand they were therefore entitled to rely upon that important mitigating factor.[13][38]I also note the comments of Justice Vaillancourt\nof the Ontario Court of Justice in R. v. Woodley where after referring\nto R. v. Wobbes, he wrote:59Mr. DeMarco plaintively pointed out\nthat Mr. Woodley committed the initial offence a mere twenty-nine days after\nhis eighteenth birthday and was involved in the last offence thirty-four days\nafter his eighteenth birthday.60Regrettably, once an individual\ncrosses the line of adulthood, the rules and procedures that apply to young\noffenders cease to be available. Nevertheless, I take Mr. DeMarco's point that\nbut for a few days, his client would have benefited from the advantages of a\nyoung offender's sentence.61However, it is to be remembered that\nMr. Woodley was a very young adult at the time of the commission of these\noffences.[14][39]Mr. Lund was also a very young man when he\ncommitted this offence, which I note was his first offence.[40]In R. v. Priest, Rosenberg J.A. wrote:The primary objectives in sentencing a\nfirst offender are individual deterrence and rehabilitation.Except for very\nserious offences and offences involving violence, this court has held that\nthese objectives are not only paramount but best achieved by either a suspended\nsentence and probation or a very short term of imprisonment followed by a term\nof probation.[15][41]The Court of Appeal repeated this, with further\nreference to youthful offenders in R. v. Kutsukake, stating;the primary objectives in sentencing a\nyouthful first offender are individual deterrence and rehabilitation.A\nsentence imposed on a youthful first offender should constitute the minimum\nnecessary sanction that is adequate, community-based dispositions must be\nconsidered, and more serious forms of punishment imposed only where necessary. [16][42]Before applying these principles, I must take\ninto account the facts underlying the offence, the impact on the victim and the\nbackground of Mr. Lund.THE OFFENCE[43]On Sunday April 10, 2016, Mr. Lund was 18 years\nold having celebrated his 18th birthday only six days earlier.[44]That day, he met up with a number of friends\nbehind a grocery store in Milton.All of these friends were under 18 years of\nage.J.G. was driving a 2011 Toyota Scion. T.H. was driving a 2006 Dodge\nCharger.J.D. was a passenger in the Charger.T.G. was driving a 2014 Kawasaki\nmotorcycle.F.A. was driving a 2007 Nissan 350Z and D.S. was a passenger in\nthat vehicle.Mr. Lund was driving his mother’s 2014 Chevrolet Equinox.[45]The meeting was prearranged for the purpose of\nthem driving around.They agreed to drive together but did not have a\nparticular destination.It was agreed that they would follow whoever was\nleading.As they drove, they kept their vehicles close to one another.The\norder of the vehicles changed on occasion.As one sped up, the others sped up\nto keep together.[46]An independent witness observed them at one\npoint.They were also caught on video by two surveillance cameras.Speed\nanalysis based on one of these cameras showed them travelling well in excess of\nthe speed limit.It was admitted that all of the drivers knew that this was\nthe case.They also knew that as any one of them sped up, the others would\nalso speed up in order to keep pace.[47]This all ended when F.A. lost control of his\nvehicle and struck a light pole.Both he and his passenger, D.S. were killed.[48]T.G., J.G. and T.H. all pled guilty to dangerous\ndriving before me in Youth Criminal Justice Court.I was presented with a\njoint submission and sentenced all of them to probation for two years.In\naddition, I prohibited each of them from driving for two years.[49]T.G. was less than one month away from his 18th\nbirthday on the day of the offence.J.G. was slightly more than two months shy\nof his 18th birthday.T.H. had 6 ½ months to go before his 18th\nbirthday.VICTIM IMPACT[50]I must stress the fact that Crown counsel very\nspecifically chose not to proceed with charges of dangerous driving causing\ndeath.The charge was simply dangerous driving.[51]There was no admission that the dangerous\ndriving on the part of Mr. Lund caused the deaths of F.A. and D.S.[52]Accordingly, I cannot impose a more serious\nsentence based upon these consequences.[17][53]The families of those two young men declined to\nfile Victim Impact Statements. They were present in Youth Court when I dealt\nwith the other young men.They did not attend when Mr. Lund pled guilty.BACKGROUND OF MR. LUND[54]Andrew Lund is 19 years old as of today.[55]He has no previous criminal record.[56]He has completed his schooling and is working\nfull time as a fork-lift operator.[57]The events of April 10, 2016 were traumatic for\nhim too.Both deceased were his friends.ANALYSIS[58]I must craft a sentence that is proportionate to\nthe gravity of the offence committed and the degree of responsibility of Mr.\nLund and yet, at the same time, one that is responsive to his unique\ncircumstances.In doing this, I must consider both the aggravating factors and\nthe mitigating factors.[59]The aggravating circumstances can be found in\nthe facts surrounding the offence.[60]This was a planned and deliberate crime.It\ncontinued for an extended period of time.These young men put themselves and\nother members of the community at risk when they set out on this joint venture.Two of them died.[61]There are a number of mitigating factors.[62]Mr. Lund pled guilty.I take this to be an\nacceptance of responsibility as well as an expression of remorse.Most\nimportantly, it made it unnecessary for anyone from the families of the\ndeceased young men to testify.[63]Mr. Lund has expressed his remorse repeatedly\nsince being charged.[64]He appears to fully appreciate the impact that\nthis had on the families of his deceased friends.[65]He had no prior criminal record.[66]He is still very young.[67]There is no suggestion of a problem with either\ndrugs or alcohol.[68]He has strong support from his family and\nfriends.[69]All of these factors bode well for his future\nrehabilitation.[70]In the circumstances I am satisfied that it\nwould not be appropriate to send Mr. Lund to jail.A conditional sentence of\nimprisonment is also not appropriate.[71]The issue before me is whether to suspend\nsentence or to grant Mr. Lund a conditional discharge.[72]Counsel for Mr. Lund has argued that a\nconditional discharge for an adult carries just as much stigma, if not more,\nthan probation pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act.Neither\nfinding results in a conviction being registered.However, the records\nretention period is longer for the adult discharge and the victim fine\nsurcharge provisions apply.[73]Counsel stressed the fact that Mr. Lund was only\nsix months older than the youngest member of the group and only six weeks older\nthan the one closest in age to Mr. Lund.[74]I read R. v. Wobbes, supra as saying that\nan adult is not entitled to parity with others who have been dealt with in the\nYouth Criminal justice Court.It does not however say that a judge cannot\nconsider parity as a factor.[75]I note also that this case is different from R.\nv. Wobbes, supra in that general deterrence is not the predominant\nprinciple of sentencing here.Specific deterrence and rehabilitation are.Further,\nMr. Lund pled guilty, just like the young offenders did. Finally, there was no\nsuggestion that Mr. Lund was any more (or less) culpable than the others in\nwhat happened.[76]After considering all of the above, I am\nsatisfied that a conditional discharge is in Mr. Lund’s best interest.[77]I am also satisfied that, if I include the\nfollowing conditions, it would not be contrary to the public interest.[78]I will include a community service order.This\nwill allow Mr. Lund an opportunity to give something back to the community.This\nprovides a degree of restorative justice to the sentence.It also provides a\nfurther punitive component to the sentence, thereby contributing to\ndenunciation and deterrence.[79]I am also imposing a curfew during the first six\nmonths of the order.This too provides a further punitive component to the\nsentence, thereby contributing to denunciation and deterrence.[80]Finally, I note that I have already prohibited\nMr. Lund from driving for two years. This also contributes to denunciation and\ndeterrence.SENTENCE[81]I sentence Mr. Lund as follows.[82]He is granted a conditional discharge with a\nprobation order to run for two years.[83]The terms of the probation will require that Mr.\nLund:1.keep the peace and be of good behaviour;2.appear before the court when required to do so\nby the court;3.notify the court or the probation officer in\nadvance of any change of name or address and promptly notify the court or the\nprobation officer of any change of employment or occupation;4.report in person to a probation officer\nimmediately and after that, at all times and places as directed by the\nprobation officer or any person authorized by a probation officer to assist in\nhis supervision;5.cooperate with his probation officer.He must\nsign any releases necessary to permit the probation officer to monitor his\ncompliance and he must provide proof of compliance with any condition of this\norder to his probation officer onrequest;6.For the first six months of this order, he will\nremain in his residence or on the property of his residence daily between the\nhours of 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. except:(a)for any medical emergency involving him or any\nmember of his immediate family (spouse, child, parent, sibling),(b)he must present written justification to the\nprobation officer within 72 hours of any such absence during his curfew hours;(c)for going directly to and from or being at\nschool, or employment,(d)he will confirm his schedule in advance with his\nprobation officer setting out the times for these activities(e)with the prior written approval of the probation\nofficer.The written permission of the probation officer is to be carried with\nhim during these times.7.not contact or communicate in any way, either\ndirectly or indirectly, by any physical, electronic, or other means, with Raed\nAnani, Lina Noufal, Rania Anani, Rima Anani, Manar Anani, Adam Anani, or\nStefanie Bourque.8.not be within 20 metres of any place where he\nknows any of them to live, work, go to school, frequent, or any place he knows\nthem to be,9.attend and actively participate in all assessment,\ncounselling, or rehabilitative programs as directed by the probation officer,\nand complete them to the satisfaction of the probation officer.10.perform 75 hours of community service work.This work is to\ncommence by June 1, 2017 and shall be completed at a rate of not less than 5\nhours per month.He shall complete the work as directed by and to the\nsatisfaction of the probation officer.He shall complete all of his community\nservice hours by / within 18 months.11.not operate or be in the driver’s seat of a\nmotor vehicle unless he is the holder of a valid Ontario driver’s licence[84]I have already prohibited Mr. Lund from driving\nfor two years.[85]I give Mr. Lund four months to pay the victim\nfine surcharge.Released:April 4, 2017Signed:\nJustice D.A.

Huh, 2015 ONCA 356DATE: 20150519DOCKET: C59460Gillese, Tulloch and Lauwers\nJJ.A.BETWEENHer Majesty the QueenAppellantandBenjamin HuhRespondentKatie Doherty, for the appellantBreana Vandebeek, for the respondentHeard:May 5, 2015On appeal from the sentence imposed on September\n15, 2014 by Justice Heather E. Perkins-McVey of the Ontario Court of Justice.By the Court:[1]The Crown appeals the sentence imposed on the\nrespondent. It is common ground that deference is the guiding principle of\nappellate review of sentences, and intervention is only permitted if the\nsentencing judge committed an error in principle, or imposed a sentence that is\ndemonstrably unfit: R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 90.[2]The respondent\nwas found guilty of assault causing bodily harm under s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. He was 21 years of age when he committed the offence. The sentencing\njudge imposed a conditional discharge with two years’ probation.[3]The sentencing\njudge declined to impose a DNA order under s. 487.051 and a weapons prohibition\norder under s. 109. The respondent properly concedes that the sentencing judge erred\nin refusing to make these ancillary orders which, in the circumstances of this\ncase, were mandatory.[4]The assault\ncommitted by the respondent while he was severely intoxicated, was\nextraordinarily violent. The beating left the victim with facial fractures and\npost-concussion syndrome. He suffered brain damage with impairment in the\nhigher executive functions. The victim was forced to withdraw from his\nuniversity courses in finance. He has problems communicating in a fluent manner\ndue to difficulties in organizing his thoughts.He also is fearful for his\nsafety and for his future.[5]The\npre-sentence report about the appellant was not especially positive. He was\npresented as a multi-substance abuser in denial of his need for rehabilitation.\nThe Crown proposed a “significant” jail sentence within the reformatory range,\non the basis that, according to the pre-sentence report, the respondent had no\ninsight into his behaviour and the public ought to be protected from him. However,\nthe Crown did not propose a specific sentence.[6]The sentencing judge adjourned the proceedings,\nat least in part in order to give the respondent an opportunity to show her\nthat the public interest would not be offended by the imposition of a\ndischarge.[7]In the months\nbetween the sentencing submissions on June 2, 2014 and the sentencing date of September\n15, 2014, the respondent completed 144 hours of community service. He also met\nwith a social worker at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and was\nawaiting placement into a counselling program.[8]Several\nadditional positive letters of reference were filed, including from Reverend\nMathias Kim. As a member of St. Andrew’s Church, the respondent had participated\nin a mission trip to Mexico and regularly helped organize youth activities. He had\nalso been working at his family’s convenience store.[9]The sentencing judge relied primarily on\nthe sentencing objectives of individual deterrence and rehabilitation in the\ncircumstances of young first offenders. She was\nimpressed by the respondent’s progress, and noted that he had “gained some\nmaturity, some insight” and demonstrated his recognition of the importance of\nthe matter. She said:In the circumstances\nI am going to grant you that conditional discharge because you have earned it, sir.You have done, as indicated, significant amount of community service, you have\nshown now some insight, and appropriately I am going to grant you that\ndischarge.I’m going to place you on probation for two years, sir, because you\ndo need that continued support and access to treatment.[10]The respondent submits that the two-year\nprobationary term was carefully crafted to include a curfew term during the\nfirst six months, a requirement that the respondent perform an additional 50\nhours of community service and a requirement that the respondent provide a\nletter of apology to the complainant. The fresh evidence shows the respondent\nremains committed to a counselling program, has taken classes related to drug\nand alcohol abuse, has completed the additional 50 hours of community service,\nand is employed full-time. The respondent has expressed\nremorse for his crime.[11]The Crown submits that the sentence imposed in\nthis case was manifestly unfit.We agree. The sentence was not proportionate\nto the gravity of the offence. The conditional discharge did not reflect the degree\nof violence of the respondent’s assault, the seriousness of the injuries he\ninflicted on the victim, or the applicable sentencing principles.[12]We adoptthe observation in R. v. Wood\n(1975), 24 C.C.C. (2d) 79 (C.A.), at para 4: “[i]n cases of violence\nresulting in injury the requirement of general deterrence to the public\nmilitates, in almost every case, against the grant of a conditional discharge,\nnotwithstanding considerations personal to the accused.”In our view, a conditional discharge\ndoes not meet the public interest in this case.While a discharge may have\nbeen in the interest of the appellant, in this circumstance, it was not in the\npublic interest. Accordingly, leave to appeal the sentence is granted, and the\nsentence appeal is allowed.It now falls to this court to impose what we deem\nto be an appropriate sentence.[13]The respondent submits that he should not now\nbe incarcerated and that this court should take the route in R. v. Smickle,\n2014 ONCA 49 (CanLII), 306 C.C.C. (3d) 351, where, at para. 12, Doherty J.A. endorsed\nthe view of Green C.J.N.L. in R. v. Taylor, 2013 NLCA 42 (CanLII), at para 133:... there is nothing inconsistent with saying\nthat the sentencing judge, with the record in front of him, should have\nsentenced the offender to greater incarceration than he did and at the same\ntime saying that, with what the court now knows, the application of the\nsentencing principles does not now require the offender actually to serve the\nremainder of the sentence. Unlike the sentencing judge, the court of appeal\nwill be deciding whether the offender should actually serve the rest of his\nsentence with the benefit of hindsight, a perspective that the sentencing judge\ndid not have. The corrective appellate function of giving guidance as to what\nthe sentencing judge ought to have done can therefore be achieved while at the\nsame time the court can make an appropriate practical disposition, based on\ncurrent circumstances. [Emphasis by Doherty J.A.][14]Our task is to fashion a fit sentence based on\ncurrent circumstances, not those at the time of sentencing.The respondent is\na young offender without a criminal record. He has expressed remorse. He has served\nhis conditional sentence thus far without incident. He has, moreover, shown a\ncommitment to change his life for the good and has continued in that path.[15]However, we do not agree with the respondent\nthat no incarceration should now be imposed. This was a crime of violence that\nleft the victim with serious and longstanding injuries.The principles of\ndeterrence and denunciation cannot be met without a period of incarceration. The\nCrown has urged a period of six to eight months’ incarceration, followed by two\nyears of probation. That appears to be at the low end of the appropriate range.Having said that, the fresh evidence shows that the respondent is a very\ndifferent person today than he was when sentenced.He has taken responsibility\nfor his actions, continued with extensive community work, obtained professional\nhelp and is drug-free.In these circumstances, we accept the Crown’s\nsubmission as to the range.DISPOSITION[16]We therefore set aside the sentence imposed by\nthe sentencing judge, and exercising authority under s.\n732 (1) of the Criminal Code,convict the respondent of assault\ncausing bodily harm, and impose a sentence of six months’ incarceration,\nfollowed by a two-year term of probation. This sentence pays due regardto the principles of deterrence and\ndenunciation, but also to the age and character of the\noffender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surroundingits\ncommission, and the respondent’s commendable efforts at rehabilitation.We also make the mandatory ancillary DNA and weapons prohibition\norders.Released:May 19, 2015 “EEG”“E.E.\nGillese J.A.”“M.\nTulloch J.A.”“P.\nLauwers J.A.”"}

The commission of the offense needing to be put in\nperspective since the accused was assaulted first with the victim’s knife and that\nhe became an assailant afterwards. She adds that he is ready to make a\ncharitable donation in the amount 1000$.[5]The reasons for such an order would be based on\nthe fact that the accused is a volunteer firefighter and that he can not have a\ncriminal record to keep his employment; he is an asset to society and his\ngesture was an isolated one from a person who does not have aggressive\nbehaviours.The facts[6]On March 17th, 2013, at around 2h30 a.m., at the\nBistro bar, in Sutton, a fight occurred between Antoine Léger and the accused, Ethan\nO’Donnell. The altercation started as to the respective languages of the\nbelligerents.[7]It quickly became a fist fight. Léger then\npulled out a knife because he was afraid of the accused and of his friends who\nwere intimidating. At this point, the accused screamed out “he’s got a knife”\nand was struck five times by it. Someone else came to help out.The accused\nwas able to remove the knife from Léger’s hand.[8]Léger then took off running but he was caught\nup not long after and held down on the ground. At that point the accused\nassaulted Antoine Léger, stabbing him with his own knife.[9]The accused collaborated with the police\nofficers and gave an incriminating statement.[10]The injuries sustained by Léger required surgery.[11]The parties have asked for a presentencial report which describes a\n23 years old individual, who is in a relationship, with no criminal record, who\nhas had regular work for some time and is a volunteer firefighter for the town\nof Sutton.[12]The accused has had a hard academic path because of learning\ndisabilities (dyslexia). It was only after hard work that he was able to\nsucceed and obtain his high school diploma.[13]He has had seasonal employments since he was 12 years old, namely\nseven consecutive years at Mont Sutton. He quickly acquired the value of work.[14]He does not have any addiction to psychotropic or alcohol.[15]The report indicates that the accused admits his fault and regrets\nhis behaviour. He explains that he “freaked out” during the crime fearing for\nhis life.[16]He feels bad towards the man that he injured and says that he never\nthought that the situation would degenerate to that point.[17]In hindsight, he understands that he could have acted differently to\nassure his security, without using that kind of violence.[18]His social analysis does not denote much criminogenic elements. He\nis a stable individual in all spheres of his life and was able to abide by the\nconditions of his release.[19]What may have caused his acting out was his alcohol intoxicating\nlevel and his sense of self-defence which may have influenced him to use an\nexcessive force towards his assailant.[20]The report concludes to a low risk of recurrence and no need of any\nspecific intervention from professionals.[21]The accused says that he is ready to take responsibility for the\nconsequences of his actions and to comply with any decision that the Court may\nrender.[22]The victim’s written statement mentions internal bleeding after his\nliver was perforated.[23]After his release from the hospital, the victim alleges that he\nneeded rest for a month an a half and that this situation has put an end to his\nsnowboarding season.[24]It should be pointed out that Antoine Léger may have needed rest but\nit is not accurate to pretend that the end of his season was the consequence of\nthe altercation since he was detained for a murder attempt following the\nabove-mentioned event and had contravened for a second time to the conditions\nof his undertaking (to keep the peace and have a good conduct, interdiction to\nbe in bars, to respect a curfew and prohibition of drinking alcohol).[25]As for the medical report, it appears that the victim had surgery because\nof a liver haemorrhage and that there were two lacerations due to a knife and a\nfracture of his eleventh rib.[26]During his testimony, Mr. Léger mentioned five scars, a post\ntraumatic impact and that he still wakes up sweaty reliving the event.[27]He believes that he will not be able to train again because of his\npain when he does twisting motions, which he used when he did snowboarding\ncompetition.[28]His mother also submitted a letter explaining her son’s problems.\nThe Court understands that her son lived some fears which required locking the\ndoors, being unable to go to work alone. She says that he has changed and that\nhe met a psychologist on a few occasions.[29]This situation where he was stabbed, hospitalised and detained was a\ndifficult one for all the family.[30]His cross-examination revealed that the beginning of 2013 was\neventful for Antoine Léger (arrest, release, several conditions to respect).[31]On the night of March 17th, 2013, he was arrested for\nthree charges namely murder attempt.[32]The accused declared, at Léger’s preliminary enquiry, that he did\nnot intend to pursue any criminal charges against him since he had already suffered\nsufficient consequences for his actions. It is in these circumstances, that the\ncharges were dropped against Mr. Léger.[33]The accused introduced as evidence, two letters and a medical\nreport. He has worked for the same employer since March 2013 and the Court\nconsiders relevant to quote his employer:“Kubota Canada sends a survey and\nhow the new customer ranks the sales person and the delivery technician (Ethan)\nand we rank first in the country out of 150 dealers. We contact the customers\ndirectly at the end of 30 days to see how they are satisfied with their new\nproduct and without exception, all of them mentioned how great the delivery guy\n(Ethan) was with them. Knowledgeable, friendly, courteous, and easy to\nunderstand.Our family business is 75 years\nold, I have a waiting list of people wanting to work for us and Ethan was\nplaced above the pile for a reason when it came time to hire someone in March\nof 2013. I have no regret and hope he will be with us for a very long time.”[34]Similar comments were made from the security and fire services of\nSutton referring to an excellent worker who is polite and courteous, working with\nrigour. It is also confirmed that a criminal record would mean that he could no\nlonger be a firefighter.[35]As for the accused, he had four lacerations of one centimeter, namely\none on his scalp.Analysis[36]The Criminal Code provides a maximum jail sentence of eighteen\nmonths for this offense.[37]The Court must apply the purpose and the principles of sentencing as\nmentioned in articles 718 and following of the Criminal Code.[38]The sentence may be imposed to denounce, deter and separate the\noffender, assist in his social reinsertion and promote a sense of\nresponsibility in the recognition and the acknowledgement of the harm done.[39]A sentence is adequate when it is proportional to the gravity of the\noffense and the degree of responsibility of the offender.[40]Punishment must suit all mitigating\nand aggravating circumstances and be consistent with those made for similar\noffenses by similar offenders.[41]The mitigating circumstances are:•A guilty plea of the accused;•A favourable presentencial report;•His young age;•Sincere regrets;•Stability in all spheres of his life, namely in\nhis work;•The fact that he is an asset to society and has\nno previous convictions;•The fact that it is an isolated gesture,\nextemporaneous with no planification and that he is not the instigator of the\nassault;[42]The aggravating circumstances are :•The use of a knife;•The fact that he chased the victim after the\ninitial altercation;•The seriousness of the consequences on the\nvictim.[43]The Crown refers the Court to decisions in similar matters, namely Therrien[1] and Normandeau[2].[44]Therrien was a 42 years old man who had punched his victim in the\nface causing many fractures (lower spine, nose and left orbit) for which the\nvictim kept some important after-effects, namely double vision.[45]This individual had previous convictions related to violence. He was\nsentenced totwelve months imprisonment to be served in the community.[46]As for the defence, it is submitted that judgments in Taylor[3] and Craig[4] should be considered.[47]As for Taylor, the court granted a conditional discharge to an accused\nwhile imposing one hundred and fifty hours of community work given his age and\nthat he had a permanent job. The victim in this file was hospitalized and had\nsustained two fractures of the jaw that required surgery.[48]It was also specified that his accomplice, David Grenier, originally\naccused of assault causing bodily harm who plead guilty to common assault was\nsentenced to a pecuniary penalty.[49]In Craig, the Court granted a conditional discharge to a 43 years\nold individual, who was a police officer for 21 years, who had been an\ninvestigator for a squad dedicated to fight organized crime. He had slapped a\nhitchhiker in the face, who did not respect his authority. He also committed\nother assaults (grabbing his throat and pushing him hardly against a fence).[50]It is important to mention that there was no bodily harm involved.[51]Article 730(1) of the Criminal Code provides that and absolute\ndischarge may be ordered if it is in the real interests of the accused without being\ncontrary to the public interest.[52]To establish that it is in his real interest, the accused needs to\nprove the harmful consequences of a criminal record considering his employment,\nhis reputation, his probability of rehabilitation, consequences that would be incommensurate\nconsidering the offense committed.[53]On the other hand, public interest should take into account the\ngeneral and specific criterion of dissuasion of crimes of same nature, while\nconsidering the frequency of this type of crime and their reprobation in the\ncommunity.[54]As part of the analysis of the public interest, it is important that\nthe accused might assure his subsistence, the one of his family and remain an\nasset to society.[55]In some cases, a well informed public, knowing that absolute and\nconditional discharge are ordered or confirmed for different type of offenses[5], would agree that the accused may benefit from an absolute\ndischarge taking in consideration the circumstance of the offense and the\nsituation of the accused[6].[56]The fact that the victim first provoked the accused must be taken\ninto consideration. In these circumstances[7],\nother courts have pronounced absolute and conditional discharges.[57]In Tajer[8], the Court makes an exhaustive analysis and lists several cases\nregarding assault. In this particular decision, the Court refused a conditional\ndischarge to an accused who had hit an individual and broke some of his teeth;\nhe was sentenced to imprisonment for fourteen days in order to denounce and\ndeter this type of unprovoked assault.[58]As the probation officer wrote in the presentencial report, it is an\nisolated incident and the delinquency displayed was situational and associated\nto an excessive consumption of alcohol.Decision[59]The Court understands that the accused’s work as a volunteer\nfirefighter is not his main source of income and agrees that firefighters serve\nthe public interest.[60]But emphasis needs to be placed on the fact that the victim who was\nstabbed twice, needed surgery. On the basis of denunciation of such a conduct, an\nabsolute discharge should not be granted in the present file.[61]However, a conditional discharge may be appropriate under the\ncircumstances considering the above-mentioned principles of sentencing.[62]It is in the best interest of the accused and not contrary to the\npublic interest to grant a conditional discharge.[63]FOR THESES REASONS, THE COURT:[64]GRANTS a conditional discharge;[65]ORDERS that the accused be under\nprobation for a period of one year under the following conditions:•Keep the peace and be of good behaviour;•Appear before the court when required to do so\nby the court;•Notify the court or the probation officer in\nadvance of any change of name or address, and promptly notify the court or the\nprobation officer of any change of employment or occupation;•Perform 100 hours of community service, within\ntwelve months under the supervision of approbation officer , sign the assiduity\ncard on each presence, sign and respect the working schedule of the probation\nofficer;•Abstain from communicating or attempting to\ncommunicate in any manner with Antoine Léger, directly or indirectly;[66]ORDERS, under subsection 487.051 of the Criminal\ncode, the accused to give a sample of bodily substances that is reasonably\nrequired for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis, which should be done by the\nBrome-Missisquoi SQ within 30 days.[67]EXEMPTS the accused of the payment of\nthe costs and the victim surcharge.__________________________________JULIE BEAUCHESNE,J.C.Q.Me DavidSt-Georges,Avocat de lapoursuiteMe MireilleLeblanc,Avocate de la défense[1]R.

Mr. McKay loaded\nmeat and other products in garbage bags and passed them through a window to his\ntwo accomplices. The three then removed the bags of stolen goods from the\npremises. The value of the meat was estimated at $960.00. Some of the stolen\nproduct was later recovered. Mr. McKay claimed he and his accomplices needed\nthe stolen goods for food. He pled guilty to the offence.The principal ground of Mr. McKay's appeal is that\nthe sentence is excessive. With that, he advances a number of other complaints\nwhich he alleges combined against him so that in the end he was ill‑served\nby the justice system.These include a falling out with his Legal Aid\nlawyer when he was unable to be in Antigonish for the sentencing hearing\nresulting in it being delayed and him being unrepresented at the later\nproceedings. This arose after he and a friend drove to Halifax the day before\nhis sentencing and he was unable to get back to Antigonish. There are two\nversions of reasons for this. One is that the car broke down: the other is that\nhe and his friend had a disagreement while in Halifax so that return\ntransportation was not available. It appears that he tried by telephone to\nexplain his problem to his lawyer during which their disagreement arose,\nresulting in Mr. McKay hanging up on his lawyer.He says the owner of the meat market, where the\noffence occurred, promised to come to give evidence at Mr. McKay's sentencing\nbut the owner's house burned the previous day and he was unable to be there. He\nsays a deal was struck between counsel in return for a guilty plea and the\nCrown defaulted. He claims that his failure to appear three times for the\npreparation of a pre‑sentence report was due to the fact that winter\nstorm conditions made it impossible for him to travel from where he was working\n(not far from Antigonish) to the probation office in Antigonish and that he\ntelephoned his regrets, with reasons. He alleges that there was inequity in the\nsentences between him and his accomplices, the latter having received lighter\nsentences. He asserts that a correctional officer informed him he overheard a\nconversation between the Crown counsel and the judge, in advance of his\nsentencing hearing, at which time they agreed on what the sentence would be. He\nclaims the record of his prior convictions, certified by the Royal Canadian\nMounted Police and offered by the Crown to the Court, is wrong. And there are\nothers.Through all of this one important and significant\nfact remains constant: he pled guilty to this serious offence and he reaffirmed\nhis admission of guilt during his lengthy oral submissions to this Court on\nappeal. It is for this Court, pursuant to section 687 of the Criminal Code,\nto determine \"the fitness of the sentence appealed against\".At the time the offence was committed, Mr. McKay was\na trifle short of twenty- two years of age. He had been living in a common law\nrelationship to which three children were born. Prior to the time of the\noffence he separated from his common law companion and he was living with the\ntwo gentlemen who became the accomplices, and later two accused, in this\nmisadventure. Afterward, he resumed his relationship with his common law\ncompanion and before his sentencing, a fourth child was born.Mr. McKay's record, as certified by the R.C.M.P. and\nadvanced by the Crown as being correct, ,reveals that on October 23, 1986, he\nwas found responsible, in youth court, for six charges of break, enter and the\ncommission of an indictable offence contrary to then section 306(1)(b) of the Code.\nThe disposition was twenty‑four months open custody on each count, to be\nserved concurrently.On June 19, 1989, he was charged, again in youth\ncourt, with one similar offence of break and enter together with the commission\nof an indictable offence. The disposition was one year of open custody. Mr.\nMcKay confirms these charges and dispositions but he says they occurred while\nhe was a youth and should not now be taken into account. Respecting the first\nsix charges, he says he was thirteen years old when they were committed but\ndispositions were not imposed upon him by the youth court until he was fifteen\nyears old, thereby making the first six even more stale for present purposes.It is appropriate for this Court to consider the\nyouth record by relying on the dates the dispositions were imposed. In these\ncircumstances, there was an insufficient lapse of time between the dates of the\ncompletion of the dispositions in youth court and the time of this sentencing\nin adult court to erase the earlier dispositions from his record.Finally, the record advanced by the Crown as\ncertified by the R.C.M.P. at Ottawa on January 21, 1993 records that on July\n17, 1990 Mr. McKay was convicted at Halifax on one count of theft over\n$1,000.00, contrary to section 334(a) of the Criminal Code for which he was\nsentenced to five months in jail. Mr. McKay disputes this recording. Instead,\nhe says that while he was charged with this offence, it arose out of\ncircumstances where it was thought he had stolen a car which a female friend\nrented, but loaned him. He claims that when the Crown discovered the true\nfacts, the charge which is shown on his record was withdrawn. In its place, he\nsays he was charged with four counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm\nand sentenced to serve from four to fourteen months on these four charges. The\nsentences were concurrent with the result that he was sentenced, in total, to\nfourteen months. After serving nine months and ten days, Mr. McKay says he was\nreleased from the Sackville Correctional Centre on mandatory supervision. In\nspite of these assertions, Crown counsel appearing before the Court on appeal\noffered the official record as being accurate and reliable.Whichever version one adopts, Mr. McKay was\nsentenced for a serious offence or offences on July 17, 1990. If it be as the\nCrown asserts, it becomes the eighth offence in this young man's career with\nconnotations of theft related circumstances. If it be as Mr. McKay asserts, it\nrepresents serious violations of the criminal law for which he served a longer\ntime in jail than the Crown record reflects.The end result is that Mr. McKay does not have a\ngood record. It is one that the trial judge could, and did, take into account.Mr. McKay alleges that his accomplices received\nlighter sentences and as a result he suffered discrimination in the sentencing\nprocess. The position taken by this Court on such a submission is reflected in\nR. v. Lockhart (1976), 14 N.S.R. (2d) 262, where MacKeigan, C.J.N.S. stated\nat p. 264:“The other cases are not before us and\nwe cannot suggest, since we are not familiar with all the circumstances, that\nthe sentences imposed were wrong as to quantum, ... We have to consider only\nwhether the sentences imposed upon the appellant Lockhart are fit sentences. We\ncannot be influenced, assuming for present purposes that the other cases may be\nsimilar, by the fact that lesser sentences were there imposed.\"To the same effect, Macdonald, J.A., wrote in R.\nv. Tobin (1977), 17 N.S.R. (2d) 534 at p. 538:\"I would but add that assuming\nthe same court sentenced both the appellant and his accomplice, and assuming\nthat the accomplice was treated with excessive leniency, such does not bind\nthis Court to repeat such error with the appellant. The function of this Court\nis to consider the fitness of the sentence imposed upon an appellant having\nregard only to proper sentencing principles, excessive leniency in sentence on\naccomplice or co‑accused has no place in such consideration.\"(See also R. v. Dunlop (1981), 44 N.S.R. (2d)\n277)It is to this offence, this offender and the fitness\nof this sentence that this Court must direct its attention. That it is a\nserious offence is evidenced by the fact that parliament has prescribed a\nmaximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment (Criminal Code, section\n348(1)(e)).In R. v. Zong (1986), 72 N.S.R. (2d) 432,\nwhich also involved a break and entry of a commercial establishment, this Court\nobserved at p. 433:\"[7] This court has frequently observed that it\nlooks seriously upon the invasion of property by break and enter and it has\nexpressed the view that three years' imprisonment is a benchmark from which a\ntrial judge should move as the circumstances in the judgment of the trial judge\nwarrant.\"In determining an appropriate sentence in circumstances\nsuch as exist here, the trial judge must consider, in addition to the facts\nrelated to the commission of the offence, that which is likely to deter the\noffender from repeating this offence another time, how best the public can be\nprotected from an unwarranted invasion of their property by this and other like‑minded\noffenders, and how the personal circumstances of the offender can best be\naddressed. The difficult judicial function involved in sentencing obliges the\ntrial judge to fashion a sentence that displays an acknowledgment and concern\nfor all these factors.This Court is one of review and not retrial. Recent\ndecisions of this Court on appeals from sentences imposed for offences contrary\nto s. 348 of the Criminal Code indicate that while the sentence imposed\non Mr. McKay may be at the higher range, it is not excessive considering the\npronouncements of this Court and the fact that the offender has a related\nrecord. The challenge to Mr. McKay, from this unfortunate experience, is to\nbecome a law abiding citizen.Having reviewed the record in these proceedings and\nhaving considered the submissions of Mr. McKay on his own behalf, and counsel\non behalf of the Crown, the sentence imposed on Mr. McKay satisfies the test of\n\"fitness\" described in the Criminal Code. Therefore, after\ngranting leave to appeal, I would dismiss the appeal.C.J.N.S.Concurred in:Hallett, J.A.Roscoe, J. A.CANADAPROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA1991C. AT.

She says now she accepts the decision of this court and recognizes\nthat what she did was wrong.Principles Of Sentencing[6]By recent amendments to the Criminal Code, Parliament\ncodified the principles of sentencing as follows:\"PURPOSE.\"718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to\ncontribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and\nthe maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions\nthat have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing\noffences;(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the\ncommunity; and(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and\nacknowledgement of the harm done to victims and to the community.\"FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE\"718.1. A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity\nof the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\"OTHER SENTENCING PRINCIPLES\"718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take\ninto consideration the following principles:(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for\nany relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or\nthe offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice\nor hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion,\nsex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other\nsimilar factor, or(ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence,\nabused the offender's spouse or child, or,(iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence,\nabused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim shall be\ndeemed to be aggravating circumstances;(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on\nsimilar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;(c) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined\nsentence should not be unduly long or harsh;(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less\nrestrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are\nreasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with\nparticular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.. . . .\n.\"742.1 Where a person is convicted of an offence, except\nan offence that is punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, and the court(a) imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years,\nand(b) is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community\nwould not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with\nthe fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to\n718.2,the court may, for the purposes of supervising the offender's\nbehaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the\ncommunity, subject to the offender's complying with the conditions of a\nconditional sentence order made under section 742.3.\"(The underlined portion came by an amendment, effective May 2,\n1997.). . . .\n.\"742.3(1) The court shall prescribe, as conditions of a\nconditional sentence order, that the offender do all of the following:(a) keep the peace and be of good behaviour;(b) appear before the court when required to do so by the\ncourt;(c) report to a supervisor(i) within two working days, or such longer period as the\ncourt directs, after the making of the conditional sentence order, and(ii) thereafter, when required by the supervisor and in the\nmanner directed by the supervisor;(d) remain within the jurisdiction of the court unless written\npermission to go outside that jurisdiction is obtained from the court or the\nsupervisor; and(e) notify the court or the supervisor in advance of any\nchange of name or address, and promptly notify the court or the supervisor of\nany change of employment or occupation.\"(2) The court may prescribe, as additional conditions of\na conditional sentence order, that the offender do one or more of the following(a) abstain from(i) the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicating\nsubstances, or(ii) the consumption of drugs except in accordance with a\nmedical prescription;(b) abstain from owning, possessing or carrying a weapon;(c) provide for the support or care of dependents;(d) perform up to 240 hours of community service over a period\nnot exceeding eighteen months;(e) attend a treatment program approved by the province; and(f) comply with such other reasonable conditions as the court\nconsiders desirable, subject to any regulations made under subsection 738(2),\nfor securing the good conduct of the offender and for preventing a repetition\nby the offender of the same offence or the commission of other offences.\"[7]In R. v. R.H. (1997), 1997 CanLII 10855 (NL SCTD), 149 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 195; 467\nA.P.R. 195 (T.D.), I reviewed authorities on the effect of the new sentencing\nprovisions. A brief summary of some of the case law follows.[8]In R. v. Pierce (M.) (1997), 1997 CanLII 3020 (ON CA), 97 O.A.C. 253 (C.A.); [1977] O.J. No. 715 (Ont. C.A.), the court considered an appeal from a sentence of\n21 months for fraud. Pierce asked that the sentence be reduced to 12 months and\nthat she be permitted to serve the sentence in the community. The court\nconcluded that the sentencing guidelines set by Parliament should be\nconsidered, not only in determining the length of the sentence but also in\ndetermining whether it should be served in the community. The court upheld the\ncustodial disposition in the case but reduced it from 21 months to 12 months.[9]The Ontario Court of Appeal considered conditional sentencing\nagain in R. v. J.W. (1997), 1997 CanLII 3294 (ON CA), 99 O.A.C. 161; [1997] O.J. No. 1380 (Ont. C.A.). There the court overturned a custodial sentence of 12 months and allowed the sex\noffender to serve the sentence in the community.[10]The court referred to Pierce, and considered the weight to\nbe attached to the principles of sentencing, in particular general deterrence\nand denunciation, in determining whether a sentence should be served in the\ncommunity. At paragraph 35 of its decision, the court pointed out that\nParliament's specific reference to only one factor in s. 742.1, namely that\nserving in the community would not endanger the safety of the community, must\nmean that this factor is entitled to more weight than certain other factors of more\ngeneral application. The court found that the objectives of general deterrence\nand denunciation may be achieved through the conditional sentence and do not\nrequire reserving the conditional sentence for rare or exceptional cases.[11]In R. v. Porter (W.P.) (1997), 1997 CanLII 16003 (NL SCTD), 148 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R.\n246; 464 A.P.R. 246 (Nfld. T.D.), I accepted that specific and general\ndeterrence and denunciation may be achieved by a non-custodial conditional\nsentence in a case involving spousal abuse.[12]In a recent decision, R. v. Fraser (G.) (1997), 1997 CanLII 10848 (NL SCTD), 150 Nfld.\n\u0026 P.E.I.R. 151; 470 A.P.R. 151 (Nfld. T.D.), I agreed with the comments of\nVancise, J.A., in R. v. McLeod (R.G.) (1993), 1992 CanLII 8279 (SK CA), 109 Sask.R. 8; 42 W.A.C.\n8; 81 C.C.C.(3d) 83 (C.A.), where he questioned the effectiveness of\nimprisonment for general deterrence, concluded the likelihood of apprehension\nis probably more important than the length of sentence in reducing the crime\nrate, and expressed concern that we in Canada are incarcerating too many\nindividuals for non-violent offences.Analysis[13]As has already been noted in Porter, the recent amendments\nto the sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code must not be viewed as\nrequiring business as usual, with incarceration the norm for certain offences\nand conditional sentences the exception.[14]The amendment of May 2, 1997, to s. 742.1, does not require this\ncourt to change its approach, since, in determining whether a sentence should\nbe served in the community we have been considering whether this would be\nconsistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in\nss. 718 to 718.2.[15]The Crown concedes the appropriate sentence in this case would be\nless than two years, suggesting six to 12 months.[16]This range is supported by cases, such as R. v. Penney\n(1984), 46 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 271; 135 A.P.R. 271 (Nfld. C.A.), (six months\nand three years probation for three fictitious loans by bank loans officer\ntotalling $18,200.00); R. v. Rennie, 1988 Nfld. C.A. No. 71, unreported\n(three months for theft by town bookkeeper of $30,000.00 - sentence would have\nbeen more but for delay in appeal); R. v. Pelley (AJ.) (1990), 84 Nfld.\n\u0026 P.E.I.R. 176; 262 A.P.R. 176 (Nfld. C.A.), (six months for unemployment\ninsurance fraud of more than $100,000.00); and R. v. Collins (D.S.)\n(1995), 1995 CanLII 10512 (NL SCTD), 129 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 340; 402 A.P.R. 340 (Nfld. T.D.), (eight\nmonths for fraud by collecting disability insurance under two policies,\ninvolving over $40,000.00).[17]I conclude, on consideration of the authorities, that nine\nmonths' imprisonment would have been the appropriate sentence in the present\ncase, prior to the amendments to the sentencing provisions of the Code.\nThe question is whether Molloy should be allowed to serve her sentence in the\ncommunity.[18]In R. v. R.H. I noted that, until further guidance is\navailable from our Court of Appeal, I intend to take a liberal approach in the\nimposition of non-custodial sentences. I said I believed Parliament's reference\nto \"all offenders\" in s. 718.2(e) requires this court to no longer\nassume that general deterrence requires a custodial disposition. The Chief\nJustice of Canada in R. v. C.A.M., 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500; 194 N.R. 321; 73\nB.C.A.C. 81; 120 W.A.C. 81; 105 C.C.C.(3d) 327, at p. 376, noted \"the\nexistence of some empirical studies which question the general deterrence\neffect of sentencing\". In J.W., the court interpreted ss. 718.2(d)\nand (e) as Parliament's acceptance of the many reports which concluded\ncustodial sanctions are overused in Canada. The court stated we must now give\n\"real effect in practice\" to Parliament's expressed concern by\nliberal resort to the conditional sentencing regime. I agree. Our problem now\nis to determine which cases, with sentences less than two years, should see the\nsentence served in prison rather than the community.[19]Clearly, our exercise of the discretion to impose a non-custodial\nconditional sentence must be on a principled basis. We must seek to identify\nthe factors in each case which weigh in favor or against a custodial\ndisposition.1. General deterrence[20]As pointed out in the Crown's authorities, general deterrence is\nthe primary objective in crimes involving a breach of trust by an employee. It\nis not clear that a conditional sentence for Molloy would subvert the message a\njail sentence has previously been employed to convey. Many of the same considerations\napply to conditional sentencing as to parole, where Lamer, C.J.C., noted for\nthe full court in C.A.M., at pp. 359-360, that the offender on parole is\nsubject to strict limits on his or her freedom.[21]In J.W. the Ontario Court of Appeal applied the considerations\nin C.A.M. regarding parole to the conditional sentence after noting\nseveral Royal Commission reports which supported its conclusion \"that the\ndeterrent effect of incarceration has been and continues to be somewhat\nspeculative and that there are other ways to give effect to the objective of\ngeneral deterrence\".[22]As should be evident from my comments in Fraser, I agree\nwith this conclusion. I also accept the testimony of Anita Molloy that the\neffect of her being charged and convicted of a criminal offence has devastated\nher life. She has lost her employment with the bank and had family and friends\nwatch her disgrace in being put on trial and convicted. Like-minded individuals\nshould receive a deterring message from her experience.2. Specific Deterrence And Rehabilitation[23]In J.W. the court noted the tentative conclusion of the\nauthors of the Corrections Utilization Study, A Review of the National and\nInternational Literature and Recommendations for a National Study on Recidivism\n(January, 1997), Canadian Centre of Justice Statistics, which suggest\nrecidivism rates are increased, not decreased by incarceration.[24]My assessment of the evidence in this case leads to the\nconclusion that Molloy offers slight risk to the community. The evidence also\nestablished that facilities for adequate supervision of Molloy exist in the\ncommunity.3. Retribution And Denunciation[25]In C.A.M., at p. 369, Lamer, C.J.C., stated for the court:\"Retribution requires that a judicial sentence properly\nreflect the moral blameworthiness of that particular offender. The\nobjective of denunciation mandates that a sentence should also communicate\nsociety's condemnation of that particular offender's conduct.\"[26]Jack Gemmell, in his article The New Conditional Sentencing\nRegime (1997), 39 Crim. L.Q. 334, at p. 338, suggests that denunciation and\nretribution are the two factors which \"are a particularly poor fit with\nthe notion of an immediate conditional release\".[27]Lamer, C.J.C., noted, in C.A.M. at p. 360, concerning\nparole:\"... the goal of denunciation continues to operate, as\nthe offender still carries the societal stigma of being a convicted offender\nwho is serving a criminal sentence.\"[28]I agree with J.W. that the same considerations apply to\nthe conditional sentence. The objectives of retribution and denunciation may\nadequately be met by a noncustodial sentence with appropriate conditions.4. Aggravating And Mitigating Factors[29]The aggravating factors in this case are:1. The breach of trust. See, s. 718.2(a)(iii).2. The offence was an ongoing one and continued until she was\ndiscovered.3. The offence involved a large amount, in total more than\n$38,000.00 in improper advances, to bring the total loans to over $60,000.00\nand the total debt still owing to approximately $105,000.00.[30]The mitigating factors are:1. These are first offences.2. She has two young daughters who need her support.Summary And Disposition[31]The recent amendments to the sentencing provisions of the Criminal\nCode are recognition by Parliament that imprisonment has been excessively\nused in this country as a sanction. As Vancise, J.A., noted in McLeod, Canada has the second highest rate of incarceration in western\nnations, behind only the United States. And as the Ontario Court of Appeal\npointed out in J.W., there is evidence incarceration may be\ncounterproductive to our efforts to reduce crime and protect the public. New\napproaches are needed. The non-custodial conditional sentence is such a new\napproach and we must give it a chance to show its effectiveness.[32]Certain courts have refused to grant conditional sentences in\nfraud cases. See, R. v. Katz (Z.) (1996), 17 O.T.C. 4; [1996] O.J. No.\n4291, (Gen. Div.), filed October 30, 1996 (bookkeeper fraud over $347,000.00); R.\nv. Hill (L.A.) (1997), 1997 CanLII 1647 (NS CA), 160 N.S.R.(2d) 21; 473 A.P.R. 21; [1997] N.S.J. No.\n97 (S.C.), filed February 18, 1997 ($144,000.00 fraud by clerk from Dalhousie\nUniversity); R. v. Noel, [1996] O.J. No. 4730 (Gen. Div.) ($243,000.00\nfraud by employee of Canadian Bar Association); and Pierce, above. Other\ncourts have granted conditional sentences in fraud cases. See, R. v. Verma\n(P.K.) (1996), 9 O.T.C. 341 (Gen. Div.); [1996] O.J. No. 3670 (Gen. Div.)\n(unemployment insurance fraud over $400,000.00); and R. v. Defreitas\n[1996] O.J. No. 3490 (Prov. Div.) (bookkeeper fraud, $56,500.00).[33]Balancing all factors discussed above, I conclude a non-custodial\nconditional sentence is appropriate. Anita Molloy is sentenced to nine months\nto be served in the community under the following conditions, namely, that she\nshall:(a) keep the peace and be of good behaviour;(b) appear before the court when required to do so by the\ncourt(c) report to a supervisor, being a probation officer\ndesignated by the Adult Corrections Division of the Department of Justice(i) within seven working days after the making of this\nconditional sentence, and(ii) thereafter, when required by the supervisor and in the\nmanner directed by the supervisor;(d) remain within the jurisdiction of the court unless written\npermission to go outside that jurisdiction is obtained from the court or the\nsupervisor;(e) notify the court or the supervisor in advance of any\nchange of name or address, and promptly notify the court or the supervisor of\nany change of employment or occupation;(f) remain at her home or residence or on her property\nadjacent thereto except for(i) attendance for medical or dental treatment for herself or\nher immediate family;(ii) attendance at scheduled meetings with legal counsel;(iii) attendance at church services;(iv) attendance at her place of employment for employment\npurposes only, at her place of community service for that service, and at any\nschool or training institute for purposes of education and training but\nexcluding social activities;(v) shopping for groceries and the necessities of life no later\nthan 7:00 p.m. one day each week;(vi) one hour each day, between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00p.m., when she shall be permitted to take exercise within walkingdistance of her residence;(vii) attendance at her daughters' school to discuss their\neducational requirements and progress;(viii) attendance to vote in municipal or other elections;(ix) other attendances for periods no longer than one day,\nwhich may be required for significant and presently unforeseen reasons, in the\ndiscretion of her supervisor;(g) perform 20 hours of community service each month as\ndesignated by her supervisor, for a total of 180 hours;(h) if she obtains employment during the nine months involving\ndealing with money in a position of trust, notify her employer within 30 days\nof working there, that she has been convicted for breach of trust in respect of\nfraud on an employer.[34]There will also be a three year probation period after the nine\nmonths of house arrest have terminated. The conditions of the probation order\nare the same as the conditional sentence, except for paragraph (f) dealing with\nhouse arrest and except that, during this period she shall serve an additional\n36 hours community service at a minimum of one hour each month.[35]In accordance with s. 742.3(3) I direct that a copy of this\nconditional sentence order shall be given to Molloy and that her counsel\nprovide her with an explanation of the substance of ss. 742.4 and 742.6\ntogether with an explanation of the procedure for applying under s. 742.4 for\nchanges to the optional conditions. Mrs. Molloy you must understand that by s.\n742.6(9) this court will have the option of having you serve any unexpired\nportion of the sentence in custody, in the event you breach this conditional\nsentence order.[36]Also, in accordance with s. 732.1, I direct that a copy of the\nprobation order be given to Molloy and that her counsel provide her with an\nexplanation of ss. 732.2(3), 732.2(5) and 733.1 and an explanation of the\nprocedure for applying under s. 732.2(3) for a change to the optional conditions.\nMrs. Molloy, your counsel will explain that failure to comply with this\nprobation order is a separate offence for which you may be tried and punished.[37]Because of the restitution order and Molloy's financial\ncircumstances, a victim fine surcharge is not appropriate. Accused sentenced."}

(“I”)\nunder s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada.[4]“I”\nand his twin “J” and their older sister “M” are Smith’s children and he has\njoint custody of them.He exercises that custody from Friday evening until\nMonday morning every weekend.“I” and “J” were born on August 13, 2001, so “I”\nwas not quite 7 when these events occurred.Their sister “M” was one year\nolder.On the weekend of May 16, 2008, allthree children were at their father’s house.According to Smith, they\nwere having supper and they “misbehaved”.Smith took all three to “M’s”\nbedroom, directed them to lower their garments and struck all three, three\ntimes on their bare bottoms.They then returned to the table and, again,\naccording to Smith, he took all three back and struck each six times on their\nbottoms.Smith says he used the palm of his hand.When “I” returned home\nafter school on Monday, he told his mother that his bottom hurt.When she saw\nthe marks on his bottom, she called Social Services.Photos of “I’s” body were\ntaken on Tuesday, May 20.They show a large area of bruising on both buttocks\nand a large bruise on “I’s” left side above his waist.[5]In\nspeaking to sentence, the Crown Prosecutor reported that the children told\ninvestigators that there is to be no talking or laughing at the table and that\nis what they were doing when they were beaten.[6]Smith\nand the mother of these three children had been separated since before the\ntwins were born.Smith also has three children from an earlier marriage who\nare now between 17 and 21.There is evidence that Smith has been actively\ninvolved in the lives of all six of his children and the older three wrote\nletters to the court in praise of their father.[7]In\nthe taped interview with “I” he said that when his father finished spanking\nhim, he took out his belt and slammed it against the door and told them to be\nquiet, this would be their last chance.“I” said, “I was so scared.”[8]In\nthe Victim Impact Statement given by “I” in April 2009 (almost a year after the\nevent) he said:1.I\nfelt bad.2.I\nwas frightened.3.I’m still a\nlittle mad at Dad.[9]There\nwas evidence before the sentencing judge that an employee of Social Services\nhad spoken to Smith in November of 2007 about his use of “spanking” and advised\nhim that they “promoted other methods of discipline”.The social worker was\nquoted as saying, “Jeff would not hear of it.”[10]The\ngist of Smith’s address to the court (Transcript, pp. 45-53) can be summarized\nas follows:1.He\nhad not seen his children in 12 months and believes that he and they have\nsuffered enough and is punishment enough.2.He\nis a very good father and has been very involved in the lives of all six of his\nchildren.3.“I’ve\nused corporal punishment and I’m an affirmed believer in it.”4.He\nloves his children and has “always spanked my children”.5.He\nbelieves “I” said what he said in his statement because “children are easily\nput in a situation where they can be made to say almost anything”.6.He\nsaid, “I never intended to bruise my son that day.I intended to spank him,\nbut I never intended to leave bruises on his rear end.”Decision of the Provincial Court[11]In\nhis reasons for sentencing, the Trial Judge referred to the guidelines\ncontained in the Criminal Code and case law regarding assaults on\nchildren.He also referred to s. 43 of the Criminal Code of Canada which\nstates that a parent may use force if it “does not exceed what is reasonable\nunder the circumstances”.He then noted that Smith was in a position of trust\nwith respect to “I” and his siblings and the harm done to “I” was “more than\ntrifling”.He said “I” “was deeply upset with what happened to him”.He also\nsaid that “there’s no doubt … that the defendant acted in anger”.[12]The\nTrial Judge also said that the paramount sentencing principle which applies is\ndeterrence, specific and general.He then stated, “It’s not necessary, I\nthink, to punish the parent in this circumstance.He has expressed a level of\nremorse …”[13]In\nrejecting defence counsel’s argument that Smith should receive a discharge, the\nJudge concluded that the first criterion was satisfied, that is, a discharge\n“is in the best interests of the accused”.He then held that a discharge\nwould be contrary to public policy.“I think it’s wrong to send a message out\nto the community that you can inflict injuries on a child.”[14]The\nJudge also rejected the Crown’s argument that Smith should be sentenced to\nincarceration.The Crown is appealing this determination.Grounds of Appeal[15](i)That the learned trial Judge erred in law by imposing a sentence\nthat was manifestly inadequate and clearly unreasonable having regard to all of\nthe circumstances;(ii)That the learned trial Judge erred in law by\nfailing to adequately consider the provisions of sections 718.01 and 718.2 of\nthe Criminal Code of Canada;The Law[16]Both\ncounsel presented case law regarding the deference which Courts of Appeal must\ngive to trial judges in the matter of sentencing.[17]In\nR. v. Shropshire (M.T.), 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, Justice Iacobucci stated:The question, then, is whether a consideration of the\n\"fitness\" of a sentence incorporates the very interventionist\nappellate review propounded by Lambert J.A. With respect, I find that it does\nnot. An appellate court should not be given free reign to modify a sentencing\norder simply because it feels that a different order ought to have been made.\nThe formulation of a sentencing order is a profoundly subjective process; the\ntrial judge has the advantage of having seen and heard all of the witnesses\nwhereas the appellate court can only base itself upon a written record. A variation\nin the sentence should only be made if the court of appeal is convinced it is\nnot fit. That is to say, that it has found the sentence to be clearly\nunreasonable.[18]In\nR. v. R.K.J., 1998 CanLII 12252 (NB CA), [1998] 207 N.B.R. (2d) 24 (NBCA), Justice Drapeau, as he\nthen was, stated:Indeed, if the sentencing court commits an error of law or an error\nin principle, or if the sentence imposed is clearly unreasonable, there is no\nlonger room for deference and this Court is required to impose the sentence\nwhich it considers fit. See R. v. F.S.A. (1996), 1996 CanLII 10270 (NB CA), 182 N.B.R. (2d) 20 (C.A.), and\nR. v. Melanson (E.R.) (1998), 1998 CanLII 12185 (NB CA), 199 N.B.R. (2d) 338 (C.A.).[19]In\nR. v. LeBlanc, 2003 NBCA 75 (CanLII) Chief Justice Drapeau stated:In this context, an error in law most commonly occurs as a result of\na misapprehension of the evidence or a misapplication of judicial precedents.\nAs for an error in principle, it typically involves one or more of the\nfollowing: the application of wrong sentencing principles, a failure to\nconsider relevant factors or the taking into account of irrelevant\nconsiderations. As well, there will be cases where the failure to give proper\nweight to each relevant circumstance will amount to an error in principle. (Our\ncourt will necessarily be slow to find an error of this nature for, if it was\notherwise, professions of deference would soon ring hollow.) Finally, a\nsentence will be clearly unreasonable where it is either inordinately long or\ninordinately short. It will reach this level only if it is a substantial and\nmarked departure from the sentence customarily imposed for similarly situated\noffenders committing similar crimes.[20]Although\nthe learned Trial Judge referred to the principles of sentencing, he does not\nappear to have applied these to the facts before him.As was stated by Chief Justice\nDrapeau in R. v. LeBlanc (supra), “These principles command more than\nlip service; they must impact upon the sentencing process and help shape its\noutcome.”[21]As\nwas recognized by the Trial Judge, the fundamental principle applicable here is\nthat which dictates that a sentence should “deter the offender and other\npersons from committing offences” (Section 718(b) and 718.01).A review of\nSmith’s remarks to the Court indicates to me that this experience has not\ndeterred him from repeating the conduct which brought him to court.[22]In\naddition, the following considerations are relevant:1.He\nbeat his six year old son so hard that he left bruises which were clearly\nvisible two days later.2.He\nhas a previous conviction for assault.3.He\nhas not acknowledged the harm he did to “I” and his other children (s.\n718(f)).4.He\nabused a person under the age of eighteen years (s. 718.2(ii.1)).5.He\nabused a position of trust and authority in relation to “I” (s. 718.2(iii)).[23]I\nfind that the learned Trial Judge did not adequately consider the principles of\nsentencing in relation to the circumstances.I therefore sentence Smith to 45\ndays incarceration for his assault on his son.[24]I\nam unwilling to hold that all cases involving assaults on children should\nresult in incarceration.____________________________________Paulette\nC.

Sosna\nof the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without a jury.ENDORSEMENT[1]Mr. Landriault appeals his convictions for one\ncount of fraud and 2 counts of forgery together with the 18 month sentence\nimposed.Conviction Appeal[2]The appellant alleges ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel on two grounds: first, he did not call Heather\nBeaumont as a witness; and second he – the appellant – was not called to\ntestify.[3]Ms. Beaumont was a teller at the Bank where\nforged cheques were drawn. It is suggested that she knew that the appellant had\nauthority to sign his partner’s name on cheques. The evidence before this court\ndoes not establish that Ms. Beaumont had any relevant information. There is no\naffidavit from her. It appears that, at best, her evidence would have been\ndouble hearsay. We note that trial counsel did call the customer service\nrepresentative from the bank. On this issue, the appellant has not met the\nthreshold test of establishing prejudice resulting from the alleged actions of\ntrial counsel.[4]The appellant submits that he wanted to testify\nin his own defence. Trial counsel’s explanation for not calling him as a\nwitness discloses intelligent strategic reasons for his recommendation that the\nappellant not testify. The appellant’s testimony would have assisted the Crown\nby expanding the length of time the fraud was ongoing, it would have put in\nevidence his criminal record for crimes of dishonesty, his ATM withdrawals and\nhis fraudulent Employment Insurance claims. The appellant has not met the\nprejudice threshold with respect to this ground of appeal.[5]We add however, that, were we to embark upon\nthe next steps and consider a credibility analysis of trial counsel as opposed\nto the appellant, we would have accepted the evidence of trial counsel. The\nappellant contradicted himself on numerous occasions: he said the lawyer never\ntold him he could testify then he said the lawyer did tell him but advised\nagainst it; he said he did not agree not to testify, but other times said he\naccepted his lawyer’s advice; he said they never directly discussed testifying,\nthen said they did; he said he was told he had no choice then he said it was\nhis choice. In addition, the appellant said they never discussed his criminal\nrecord, a statement difficult to believe. He said at one point that the lawyer\nnever discussed the election for trial by judge alone, then said they discussed\nit a few times. In the context of the appellant’s convictions for crimes of\ndishonesty, an admitted fraud on Employment Insurance and his motive to\nfabricate, we have no hesitation in accepting trial counsel’s evidence.Sentence Appeal[6]The appellant submits that the sentencing judge\nerred by using lack of remorse as an aggravating factor. The sentencing judge\nrecognized that remorse is not an aggravating factor. He added, however that\nthe appellant shows a “lack of insight into the moral blameworthiness of his\nconduct resulting in financial losses.”His reasons make it clear that he was\nnot referring to lack of remorse as aggravating, but rather the appellant’s\nresponse to the financial losses suffered by others as a result of the\nappellant’s actions. He considered this an important factor referable to\nspecific deterrence.[7]It is not in dispute that the 18 month sentence\nis within the appropriate range.

the road was straight and flat, with an\nunobstructed view.A line of traffic had stopped to allow a city work crew to\nmove equipment across the road.Their truck was parked along the side of the\nroad, with a flashing amber light on the roof.Both the line of cars and the\nflashing light would have been visible to eastbound traffic for some\nconsiderable distance.[4]Hansell was texting on his cell phone as he drove.He did not\nsee the stopped cars.By both his account and that of the driver of the last car\nin the line, who was watching in his rear view mirror, Hansell did not slow\ndown as he approached; he swerved to the left at the last second to avoid colliding\nwith the stopped car.In doing so, he entered into the westbound lane of traffic\nand collided head on with an oncoming car.The driver, Mark Derry, was fatally\ninjured and died in hospital the next day.[5]Hansell was not injured in the collision.On seeing the nature\nof the damage to the other vehicle he was immediately distraught and horrified by\nwhat he had done, telling people at the scene that he was “being\nstupid and texting\".He underwent a neurological examination by a\nparamedic at the scene.Nothing in what she observed suggested that he had\nbeen drinking.However, her face was very close to his when she was speaking\nto him and she thought she detected a very faint odour of beer.She inquired, and\nhe told her he had had a beer while at his friend’s house sometime earlier.[6]Analysis of a sample of Hansell’s blood subsequently taken at the\nhospital revealed an alcohol level between 100 and 120 milligrams per 100\nmilliliters of blood at the time of the collision.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE\nOFFENDER[7]Hansell was 19 years old at the time of this incident.He has a\ngrade 12 education.Since graduating from high school he has been steadily\nemployed.He has no prior criminal involvement.I accept that his driving\nhistory includes only one moving vehicle offence.[8]Hansell has demonstrated from the outset his great remorse and regret\nover his actions.He has accepted responsibility both factually and formally\nby pleading guilty to these charges, albeit that the plea was not entered until\npartway through the trial.He acknowledges that the enormous loss he caused –\nto Mr. Derry, but also to his wife and son, and to a lesser extent to his own\nfamily – are due to choices he made that day, and he clearly carries the burden\nof this.In his own way he has taken whatever steps he can to make amends for\nhis actions:he attended programming at the Addictions Foundation of Manitoba;\nhe has spent time at his former high school speaking to students about what he\ndid.Since this happened he has tried to live his life responsibly, by working\nhard at his job, two jobs, actually, focusing on his relationship with his\ngirlfriend, and avoiding alcohol and marihuana.He stopped driving until just\nrecently, because he was too traumatized.He has the good fortune of a loving\nand committed family, particularly his girlfriend and his grandmother, both of\nwhom submitted letters to the court emphasizing their own sorrow for what\nhappened and bearing witness to how deeply Hansell has been affected by the\nharm he has caused.VICTIM IMPACT\nSTATEMENTS[9]Mr. Derry’s wife and son prepared victim impact statements which\nthey read in court.They have lost a loving husband and father.Their lives are\nshattered and their scars may never heal.While not something they have\ncomplained of, the protracted nature of these proceedings have inevitably made\nit more difficult for them to heal.To their credit, they understand that a\ncourt is not a place for revenge, nor is it what they seek.They struggle to honour\nthe man they loved by not being angry.On behalf of the community, I say how truly\nsorry I am that this terrible tragedy happened.I know their loss is\nimmeasurable.THE LAW[10]The offence of dangerous driving causing death is concerned with\nthe manner of driving which resulted in a person’s death, rather than what the\ndriver was intending.It is based on negligence and is the most serious of a\ncontinuum of unacceptable driving which begins with a momentary lapse of\njudgment resulting in civil liability, through to careless driving, a\nregulatory offence under The Highway Traffic Act, C.C.S.M. c.\nH60, to dangerous driving, which requires a marked departure from the standard\nof care of a reasonable person in those circumstances.It is the extent of the\nnegligence that takes the behaviour into the realm of the criminal law.That it\nbrings criminal sanctions reflects the reality that motor vehicles, while ubiquitous\nin our society, are extremely dangerous if not handled with the necessary\ndegree of caution.[11]The culpable conduct in the offence of driving with a blood\nalcohol content in excess of .08 is driving a vehicle after consuming alcohol.This\nbehaviour is criminalized because of the significant danger created by a driver\nwho has been drinking.While a matter about which judicial notice can be\ntaken, the report of the forensic analyst in this case points out that alcohol\nconsumption causes sensory, motor and mental functioning to deteriorate.Even\nat a level of 1.00 – slightly less than Hansell’s – all individuals will be\nimpaired to some extent in their ability to safely drive a vehicle.As the\nOntario Court of Appeal chillingly observed in R. v. McVeigh\n(1985), 1985 CanLII 115 (ON CA), 22 C.C.C. (3d) 145, \"every drinking driver is a potential\nkiller\".[12]The fact is, no one takes to the road after drinking with the\nthought they might kill someone.To the contrary, most people do not think\nabout such a possibility.In part, no doubt because they often do not\nappreciate the degree of their impairment.Thus, unlike most crimes, many people\nwho commit alcohol-related driving offences are otherwise good citizens who\nhave not and likely will never again be involved in criminal activity.[13]Given all this, then, it has long been accepted that general\ndeterrence and denunciation are the primary considerations in sentencing, even\nin cases where public safety, rehabilitation and individual deterrence play no\nrole.[14]In R. v. Ruizfuentes, 2010 MBCA 90 (CanLII), 262 C.C.C. (3d)\n540, our Court of Appeal established a sentence range for first time offenders\nwho commit the offence of impaired driving causing death from two to five years'\nimprisonment.[15]Sentences for dangerous driving causing death vary greatly, and\nare not amenable to a sentence range due to the fact that the circumstances and\nconduct that give rise to the offence encompass a wide range of situations.The\nonly case I was referred to involving a conviction for dangerous driving where\nthe offender was using a cell phone is R. v. Ali (Provincial\nCourt of Manitoba, September 22, 2014.)The offender drove through a red light\nwhile talking on his cell phone, injuring two pedestrians.He was found guilty\nof two counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm and sentenced to nine\nmonths in jail.(Leave to appeal refused, 2015 MBCA 64 (CanLII).)[16]Against this backdrop, then, the Crown seeks a period of\nimprisonment of four years on the charge of driving over .08 cause death, and\nthree years concurrent for dangerous driving cause death.The defence argues\ntwo years' imprisonment concurrent is appropriate.ANALYSIS AND DECISION[17]I am satisfied that none of the sentencing\nobjectives of public safety, individual deterrence or rehabilitation are a\nconcern in this case.The likelihood that Mr. Hansell will engage in this\nbehaviour again is exceedingly low.There is no suggestion that he has any\nunderlying difficulties with alcohol or any substances.His actions since this\nevent show a strong sense of responsibility and he has taken steps to make\nreparations to the community.What remains, then, is a sentence which reflects\nthe community’s condemnation of the conduct, and serves as a message to others\nto not behave likewise.[18]However, balancing this is the principle of restraint. A very\nsignificant consideration in this case is the fact that Hansell was only 19 at\nthe time of this incident.Courts\nunderstand that young adults sometimes behave foolishly, and some commit\ncriminal acts.While they must not escape unpunished, their immaturity and\nlack of experience diminishes their level of responsibility and moral\nblameworthiness for crimes they commit as compared to mature adults.This\nshould be reflected in the sentence imposed.(See Regina v. Demeter and Whitmore (1976), 32 C.C.C.\n(2d) 379 (Ont. C.A.).[19]R. v. Carleton (J.K.), 2012 MBPC 54 (CanLII), 282 Man.R. (2d) 247,\noffers a comprehensive review of the approach by courts to sentencing youthful\nfirst time offenders.Smith P.C.J., referring to Demeter, goes on to say:[109]Courts have also held that\nparticularly in the case of a youthful offender, the first sentence of\nimprisonment should focus on the particular offender, including the\nrequirements of individual deterrence.Its length ought not to be governed by\nthe factor of general deterrence.See R. v. Vandale and Maciejewski (1974),\n21 C.C.C. (2d) 250 (Ont. C.A.), and R. v. Demeter and Whitmore (1978) 3\nC.R. (3d) 55 [sic, (1978) 3 C.R. (3d) S-55] (Ont. C.A.).[110]Both of these cases were\nconsidered, quoted from and applied with approval by the Manitoba Court of\nAppeal in R. v. McCormick, [1979] 4 W.W.R. 453; 7 Man.R. (2d) 30 (C.A.).In that case the Appeal Court upheld a three month sentence for a 20 year old\noffender who committed an armed robbery of a motor vehicle service station at\nknifepoint.[111]According to the Manitoba\nCourt of Appeal, the primary consideration in determining the length the\nsentence for youthful first offenders is what period is needed to impress on\nthe particular offender before the court the gravity of the offence.Such a\nterm need not be lengthy.As Huband, J.A., observed in para. 20 in McCormick:20The\npunishment should be tempered by virtue of a clear record.Punishment of the\nindividual is intended to so impress the accused that he is unlikely to run\nfoul of the law again.Having no prior experience to determine its\neffectiveness, the benefit of the doubt should go to the accused, and this is\ndoubly so when the accused is young in years.In Regina v. Vandale and\nMaciejewski (1975), 21 C.C.C. (2d)\n250, the Ontario Court of Appeal, in a\njudgment by Martin, J.A., expressed the view that with youthful first\noffenders, the prime consideration in determining the custodial period is the\nneed to impress upon the accused the gravity of his offence.That sentiment\nwas re-stated in the same court by Dubin, J.A., in Regina v. Demeter and\nWhitmore (1978), 3 C.R. (3d) 55 [sic].The Demeter case involved\ntwo young men, aged 16 and 17, who committed an armed robbery of a kind similar\nto the robbery committed by McCormick.Dubin, J.A., in imposing a three month\nsentence to be followed by a period of probation, wrote as follows:In\nconsidering what is an appropriate sentence for the very young, the paramount\nconsideration must be their immediate rehabilitation.Speedy apprehension,\narrest, public trial and a criminal record, with its consequences, should be\nthe best deterrent for those young persons who may be tempted to commit an\noffence such as this.In the\ninstant case there is no reason to believe that these two youths had set upon a\ncourse of criminal activity as a pattern for their future.Indeed, the\ncontrary appears clear.A short custodial term, followed by a period of\nprobation, in my opinion, affords the best prospect for their immediate\nrehabilitation, and if that is accomplished, the protection of the public and\nthe interests of society are best served.(emphasis added)[Emphasis in Carleton][112]Moreover it is wrong to\npostulate that general deterrence can only be effected by incarceration.In\nR. v. Leask (J.C.) et al., [1996] M.J. No. 586 ... the Court of\nAppeal overturned a one year prison sentence and imposed substantial fines ($5,000)\nor community service (300 hours) on three young first offenders for assault\ncausing bodily harm, the circumstances of which were described as\n\"brutal\".Twaddle, J.A., for a unanimous court, explained at para.\n5:5The\nsentence must be a deterrent one, to discourage these young men and others from\nengaging in such callous behaviour, but a deterrent sentence does not have to\nbe an incarcetory one.A fine or order of community service, accompanied by\nsupervised probation, can have a deterrent effect if substantial enough ...[20]Consideration of a youthful first offender was not addressed in Ruizfuentes\nwhen it decided the starting point for a sentence for a first time offender.This is why the court stated:[22]... these ranges are but\nguidelines and, as was recently explained in R. v. McCowan (K.J.),\n2010 MBCA 45 (CanLII), 251 Man. R. (2d) 295 ... by Steel J.A. (at para. 11):....\nSentencing ranges are useful in promoting consistency and parity because they\nprovide guidelines to sentencing judges for the imposition of similar\npenalties for similar offences of a similar nature involving similar offenders.See R. v. McDonnell, 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948.But they are nothing\nmore than guidelines and are\ncertainly not conclusive of the appropriate sentence in any given case.The\nSupreme Court of Canada recently confirmed this basic principle in R. v.\nNasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII), 2010 SCC 6, [[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206] 251 C.C.C. (3d)\n293, when it repeated that a judge can order a sentence outside of a guideline range so long as it is in accordance with the\nprinciples and objectives of sentencing.Thus, a sentence falling outside the\nregular range of appropriate sentences is not necessarily unfit.See also, R.\nv. Sinclair (W.J.), 2009 MBCA 91 (CanLII), 245 Man. R. (2d) 237 at para. 6.[21]Looking at the circumstances of this situation, Hansell was not driving\nerratically, or at a high rate of speed:he was actually travelling under the\nspeed limit.While his guilty plea formally acknowledges that his consumption\nof alcohol contributed to the collision, compared to most cases I was referred\nto, his blood alcohol level was low and he demonstrated no outward signs of\nimpairment.The significant causative factor was his lack of attention caused\nby texting on his cell phone.Of course, this additional circumstance makes\nhis conduct much more blameworthy.[22]So, in light of the guideline established in Ruizfuentes\nand the principle of restraint which is important because Hansell is a youthful\nfirst offender, I conclude a sentence of twenty-six months’ imprisonment, which\nwill have to be served in a federal penitentiary, will adequately denounce\nHansell’s conduct and will send a powerful message, to the public and to young\npeople in particular, who might be tempted to engage in such behaviour.[23]Therefore, Vann Hansell I hereby sentence you to twenty-six\nmonths’ imprisonment for the offence of driving with a blood alcohol over .08\ncausing death; and twenty-six months’ imprisonment for the offence of dangerous\ndriving causing death, to be served concurrently.DRIVING PROHIBITION[24]Section 259(1) of the Code requires that a\nsentencing court impose a prohibition on operating a motor vehicle for a\nminimum of one year and a maximum of three years for a first offence.Such\nprohibitions are recognized as civil disabilities rather than punishment, and\nare intended to protect the public.Absent concerns over specific deterrence\nor aggravating circumstances, the minimum period of one year is generally\nconsidered appropriate.[25]Given that the conduct here involved both texting and consuming\nalcohol, I am of the view that the prohibition should be more than the minimum,\nand set it at 18 months.[26]A victim fine surcharge of $200 is imposed and is to be paid\nwithin three months of today.[27]I am declining to make a DNA order._______________________________\nJ."}

C-46EDITED ORAL REASONS FOR SENTENCEWALSH,\nJ.:INTRODUCTION[1]The\naccused has entered guilty pleas to breaches of s. 380(1)(a) and s. 122 of the Criminal\nCode.[2]The\n52 year old accused was employed with Service Canada from 1990-2010.Her employment\nwas terminated as a result of the matters before the court.[3]The\nfacts of this case are as outlined in the synopsis tendered by Crown counsel\nand referred to as Consent 1 (copy of which is appended to this decision).The\naccused was the common-law partner of Alfred Eisan for over seven years that\nencompassed the time-period of these offences.The pre-sentence report (PSR),\nand submissions of Ms. Summers, indicate that Mr. Eisan was gambling and\nspending very heavily.This put the couple in serious financial trouble.[4]The\naccused has admitted to using Mr. Eisan’s social insurance number to create\nfalse employment insurance claims.In the period from January 2007 until\nAugust 10, 2010, the net amount of $75,526.00 was illegally taken by Ms. Esteves.[5]There\nhas been a joint submission on sentence submitted by the Crown and defence.This proposes a conditional sentence of 18 months imprisonment, to be served in\nthe community, together with a period of supervised probation in addition to a\nrestitution order for the full amount illegally obtained.[6]In\nsupport of the joint submission, counsel have referred me to the decisions of\nour Court of Appeal in R. v. Bradbury (2004), 2004 NLCA 82 (CanLII), 243 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 1\nand R. v. Briand and Matthews (2010), 2010 NLCA 67 (CanLII), 302 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I. R. 67, as\nwell as decisions from our trial division in R. v. Champion (2011), 2011 NLTD 17 (CanLII), 306 Nfld.\n\u0026 P.E.I. R. 39 and R. v. McGrath (2012), 329 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I. R.\n10.[7]It\nis not uncommon in this jurisdiction for fraud against an employer or criminal\nbreach of trust to carry a term of imprisonment to be served conditionally in\nthe community as was the case in the four cases cited above.PRINCIPLES\nOF SENTENCING[8]The\nprinciples of sentencing are outlined in s. 718 of the Criminal Code.718.Purpose\n- The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime\nprevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just,\npeaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of\nthe following objectives:(ato\ndenounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement\nof the harm done to victims and to the community.718.1Fundamental\nprinciple - A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and\nthe degree of responsibility of the offender.718.2Other\nsentencing principles - A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into\nconsideration the following principles:(a)a\nsentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating\nor mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender and,\nwithout limiting the generality of the foregoing,...(iii)evidence\nthat the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or\nauthority in relation to the victim,...shall\nbe deemed to be aggravating circumstances;(b)a\nsentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for\nsimilar offences committed in similar circumstances;(c)where\nconsecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly\nlong or harsh;(d)an\noffender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may\nbe appropriate in the circumstances; and(e)all\navailable sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the\ncircumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention\nto the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.[9]Pursuant\nto s. 742.1, before a conditional sentence is imposed a sentencing judge must\nbe satisfied that neither a penitentiary term (of greater than two years’\nimprisonment) nor a suspended sentence with probation is appropriate.[10]Given\nthe precedents submitted by counsel together with the principle of sentencing\noutlined above, I believe that a penitentiary term is not warranted in this case.Further, I am also satisfied that a suspended sentence with probation would be\ncontrary to the public interest.[11]I\nnow turn to the range of sentence.Bradbury carried a sentence of 12\nmonths conditional; Briand also carried 12 months conditional; Champion\nwas sentenced to 18 months conditional; and McGrath received a sentence\nof 7 months conditional after serving 7 days on remand.[12]In\ncases of breach of public trust, the cases of R. v. Byrne (2009), 2009 CanLII 17117 (NL PC), 286\nNfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 191 (NLPC); R. v. Collins, 2010 NLTD 7 (CanLII); R. v.\nWalsh, 2009 CanLII 69063 (NL PC), [2009] N.J. No. 340 (NLPC); R. v. Anderson (2009), 2009 NLTD 143 (CanLII), 290\nNfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 59 (NLSCTD); and R. v. Murray, [2010] N.J. No. 84 (NLSCTD) all\ncarried jail terms that were in the range of 15 months to 2 years imprisonment.[13]The\nmaximum sentence for a breach of s. 380 (1) (a) was 10 years in prison at the\ntime the offence was committed.The maximum sentence for a breach of s. 122 is\nfive (5) years in prison.[14]It\nis important to note that if this fraud has been committed on or after November\n20, 2012, a conditional sentence would not have been an option.AGGRAVATING\nFACTORS[15]In\nreaching my decision on whether the proposed sentence is appropriate, I have\nconsidered the following aggravating factors:1,This\nis a serious breach of trust – a statutory aggravating factor.2.She\nabused her position with the federal government.3.There\nwere many transactions over many years.4.Her\nfrauds were planned and premeditated.5.There\nwas a high monetary loss to the taxpayers.6.There\nis a loss of public confidence in the E.I. system.MITIGATING\nFACTORS[16]I\nhave also considered the following mitigating factors:1.The\naccused is a first-time offender.2.She\nentered a guilty plea at the first reasonable opportunity.3.She\ncooperated fully with the investigations.4.She\nhas accepted full responsibility for her actions.5.She\nis considered a low risk to reoffend.JOINT\nSUBMISSION[17]Both\nMr. LeFeuvre and Ms. Summers submit that a conditional sentence of 18 months\nplus two years supervised probation together with a restitution order in the\namount of $75,526.00 should be imposed.[18]They\nboth rely on the decisions in Bradbury, Briand and Matthews, and Champion\nthat I referred to earlier.They both state that the preconditions of s.\n742.1 have been met.They both submit that Ms. Esteves will find it difficult\nto find employment due to her criminal history especially in a position of\ntrust.[19]Ms.\nSummers advises that Ms. Esteves lives alone, is depressed and wants the matter\nover.She identifies issues from a medical perspective including psoriatic\narthritis and depression.She has been seeing a counselor for a number of\nsessions according to the PSR.[20]Ms.\nEsteves apologized to her employer and her coworkers.ASSESSING\nA JOINT SUBMISSION[21]I\nhave to be guided by the principles enunciated by our Court of Appeal in R.\nv. Druken, 2006 NLCA 67 (CanLII), [2006]\nN.J. No. 326; R. v. Oake, 2010 NLCA 19 (CanLII), [2010] N.J. No. 94; and R. v. Oxford,\n[2010] N.J. No. 232 with respect to joint submissions.[22]I\nwill highlight paragraphs 17-19 of the Court of Appeal’s decision in R. v.\nDruken, supra:17To\nsummarize, a sentencing judge should depart from a joint submission by counsel\nonly if accepting the submission would bring the administration of justice into\ndisrepute or would otherwise be contrary to the public interest.18In making\nthis determination, the question of whether the sentence is unreasonable must\nbe considered. This requires an assessment of the facts as presented to the\ncourt, normally in the form of an agreed statement. Counsel must provide\nsufficient facts to permit the sentencing judge to determine whether the\nsentence is reasonable in the circumstances. The court is bound by the agreed\nstatement of facts; the sentencing judge cannot \"find\" additional\nfacts. As well, any inferences the judge may draw must follow clearly from what\nis set out in the agreed statement. It is preferable that counsel provide a\nfactual basis for the judge to assess the proposed sentence that does not\nrequire the judge to draw factual inferences.19The\nacceptable range of sentence must be such that the accused has an incentive to\nplead guilty, i.e. a quid pro quo. That requires an adjustment down from the\nnormal range of sentence to take account of the accused's agreement to forgo\nhis right to a trial. Of course, there must be some minimum, having regard to\nthe facts of each case, below which a proposed sentence cannot be accepted.[23]As\nto whether a conditional sentence would be an appropriate sentencing option, I\nlook to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000]\n1 S.C.R. 61 at paragraphs 99 and 100.99The\nconditional sentence facilitates the achievement of both of Parliament's\nobjectives. It affords the sentencing judge the opportunity to craft a sentence\nwith appropriate conditions that can lead to the rehabilitation of the\noffender, reparations to the community, and the promotion of a sense of\nresponsibility in ways that jail cannot. However, it is also a punitive\nsanction. Indeed, it is the punitive aspect of a conditional sentence that\ndistinguishes it from probation. As discussed above, it was not Parliament's\nintention that offenders who would otherwise have gone to jail for up to two\nyears less a day now be given probation or some equivalent thereof.100Thus, a\nconditional sentence can achieve both punitive and restorative objectives. To\nthe extent that both punitive and restorative objectives can be achieved in a\ngiven case, a conditional sentence is likely a better sanction than incarceration.\nWhere the need for punishment is particularly pressing, and there is little\nopportunity to achieve any restorative objectives, incarceration will likely be\nthe more attractive sanction. However, even where restorative objectives cannot\nbe readily satisfied, a conditional sentence will be preferable to\nincarceration in cases where a conditional sentence can achieve the objectives\nof denunciation and deterrence as effectively as incarceration. This follows\nfrom the principle of restraint in s. 718.2(d) and (e), which militates in\nfavour of alternatives to [page115] incarceration where appropriate in the\ncircumstances.[24]Mr.\nLeFeuvre also highlighted that it is not uncommon in our courts for a\nconditional sentence to be for a somewhat longer duration.In Proulx,\nthe Supreme Court of Canada stated:… As a corollary\nof the purposive interpretation of s. 742.1(a), a conditional sentence need not\nbe of equivalent duration to the sentence of incarceration that would otherwise\nhave been imposed. The sole requirement is that the duration and conditions of\na conditional sentence make for a just and appropriate sentence.[25]That\nsaid, I likely would have imposed a somewhat shorter period of incarceration in\nthis case but it still would have been close to the 18 months being proposed.[26]Under\nall of these circumstances, I accept the joint submission.The sentence will\nbe:1.18\nmonths conditional on Count 12.12\nmonths conditional concurrent on Count 23.A\nrestitution order in the amount of $75,526.00 to the credit of the Receiver\nGeneral for Canada4.Probation\nfor 2 years[27]The\nconditions are contained in the orders.____________________________JAMES G.

The court was advised that the appellant abandoned his\nconviction appeal. He appeals his sentence of 16 months custody (after credit\nof 20 months pre-sentence custody), followed by 3 years probation.[2]The appellant is a young man who, at the time of\nthe offence and of sentencing, suffered from serious mental illness. He was,\nhowever, found fit to stand trial. The trial judge expressed significant\nconcerns regarding the appropriate sentence, as the appellant was in need of\npsychiatric treatment without which he posed a risk to others. She recommended\nthat he serve his sentence in the Ontario Correctional Institute where he could\nreceive psychiatric treatment. She also ordered that he not return to live with\nhis parents until a psychiatrist gave permission for him to do so.[3]The appellant advised the court that he has not\nbeen sent to OCI and that he is not receiving any psychiatric treatment. There\nis also a concern that upon release, he has nowhere to go other than his\nparents’ home, and because he is not being assessed by a psychiatrist in the\ninstitution, his living arrangements on release may be an unresolved issue. His\nparents are very supportive and anxious to have him come home and live with\nthem, despite the offence.[4]The court was advised that he is in segregation\nat his own request.[5]The court discussed with duty counsel the possibility\nof requesting that one of the psychiatrists who saw him for the NCR assessment\nsee him again in the institution with a view to having him admitted under the\ncivil mental health jurisdiction to a psychiatric hospital such as CAMH, and\nthat the sentence be reduced to accommodate and facilitate such a transfer. The\nappellant did not agree to this proposal.[6]We see no error in the sentencing decision of\nthe trial judge. The court is very sympathetic to the appellant and his family\nbecause he needs psychiatric help and he is not getting it. However, his\nprobation conditions are intended to ensure that he does receive the help he\nneeds upon release. In light of the appellant’s rejection of any proposed\nvariation by this court, the appeal must be dismissed.“K. Feldman J.A.”“M.L. Benotto J.A.”“B.W. Miller J.A.”"}

or(b)\ntwo or more offences being dealt with in the same proceeding, at least one of\nwhich is an offence referred to in any of subparagraphs (a)(i) to (iii).”By the Court:[1]This is a joint sentence recommendation\nfollowing an early guilty plea by Mr. M..[2]I have reviewed the decisions of R. vs.\nMacIvor and R. vs. Cromwell, that basically establish a joint recommendation is\ngenerally accepted by the courts,where it falls within the acceptable range\nand is not contrary to the public interest or otherwise unreasonable.[3]Both the crown and the defence have\nrecommended the global sentence of four and a half years imprisonment.This\nrelates to two separate Indictments, one containing ten counts involving four\nvictims and one containing two counts with respect to one victim.In order to\nconsider the recommendation I must be mindful of the purposes and principles of\nsentencing as set out in Section 718 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code.[4]Our courts have consistently repeated the\nprinciple that general deterrence and denunciation are the objectives to be\nemphasized where dealing with sentences of sexual assaults against children.The sentence must not be unduly lenient in order to provide the necessary\ndeterrence and denunciation that is required.[5]With respect to offences of this nature, as\nindicated by Judge Tuft’s in the decision referred to by the crown, the court\nconsiders the degree of invasiveness, presence or the form of any physical\nviolence beyond the abuse itself, threats of any kind, ages of the victims,\nrelationship between the victims and the offender, the number of incidents and\nover what period of time is relevant, as well as the impact on the victims.[6]In this particular case there are\naggravating factors.The five victims were all under the ages of eighteen\nyears when these offences were committed.This is a historical sexual assault\nscenario.The age of the victims at the time is an aggravating factor pursuant\nto Section 718.2 of the Code.The offender was in a positon of\ntrust with respect to these victims.Three of the victims were his daughters,\nincluding a step daughter.Regarding the daughters, there were a number of\nincidents over a fairly lengthy period of time.The acts committed were not\nidentical with respect to the victims.There would have been premeditation in\nsome instances, especially when alcohol was involved.[7]One of the victims, S.M. has provided a\nVictim Impact Statement, that profoundly describes the psychological and\nemotional effects that this crime has had on her life.[8]On the mitigating side of the matter the\naccused entered a plea of guilty, avoiding the necessity of preliminary\nhearings, trial and testimony by his family and other victims.He has\nexpressed remorse throughout.There is a Pre-sentence Report.The offender is\nnow fifty nine years of age, he is unemployed.A medical report indicates that\nhe has a medical condition, specifically heart disease.[9]With respect to the victims B.T. and L.Y,\nthese were isolated incidents and can fairly be described as the lower end of\nthe scale.The most serious forms of assault definitely related to his\ndaughter S.M.[10]I have reviewed the authorities prior to\ntoday’s appearance which were provided by the crown.Although the offences are\nserious they appear not to be at the extreme end of the scale, in that there\nwere no acts of intercourse or oral sex, there was no touching or exposure of\nthe penis and no direct physical violence beyond the abuse itself.Courts have\noften stated that sexual abuse involving sexual intercourse by persons who are\nin a position of authority over a long period of time calls for a minimum\nsentence of five to six years.[11]Again I repeat that this is a negotiated\njoint sentence recommendation.Although the sentence recommendation appears to\nbe on the low end of the scale,it is within the range having considered the\ncases.[12]So, Mr. M. have your client stand please.[13]For the offence of sexual assault on S.M.\nthe sentence is twenty four months consecutive.For the offence of sexual\ninterference against S.M., one year concurrent.[14]For the offence of sexual assault on D.M.,\nthe sentence is twelve months consecutive.One year concurrent for sexual\ninterference of D.M.[15]For the offence of sexual assault against\nT.M., the sentence is sixteen months consecutive.One year concurrent for the\nsecond count, sexual assault against T.M. One year concurrent for each count of\nsexual interference against T.M.One year concurrent for the offence of\nindecent assault against T.M.[16]With respect to the offence of sexual\nassault against B.T. the sentence is one month consecutive.[17]With respect to the offence of sexual\nassault against L.Y. the sentence is one month consecutive.For the offence of\nsexual interference against L.Y. the sentence is one month concurrent.[18]The total sentence therefore is four and one\nhalf years in prison.[19]The court will also order a Weapons\nProhibition Order for a period 10 years pursuant to Section 109 (1) (a) of\nthe Code.In addition the court will issue a D.N.A. Order as well as a\nS.O.I.R.A. Order for life.The court will also order a Prohibition Order\npursuant to Section 161 (1) (a) of the Code regarding attendances at\npublic places for 10 years.Scaravelli, J."}

C.[2]The accused opposes the application and suggests\nthat he be designated a long-term offender instead.BACKGROUND[3]On May 8, 2008, X\nwas convicted of the following offences:[translation]Case 525-03-037949-070:-sexual assault against A, under section 271(1)(a) Cr. C.;-threats to cause bodily harm, under section 264.1(a)\nCr.

C.;-sexual assault against\nC, section 271(1)(a) Cr. C.;[4]He was the\nsubject of an application for an adult sentence made by the Crown on June 26,\n2008. He does not oppose such application.Section 64(5) - YCJA:If the young person gives notice to the youth justice court that the\nyoung person does not oppose the application for an adult sentence, the youth\njustice court shall, without a hearing, order that if the young person is found\nguilty of an offence for which an adult is liable to imprisonment for a term of\nmore than two years, an adult sentence must be imposed.[5]As a result, the Court subjects X to an adult\nsentence.[6]On September 12, 2008, an assessment under\nsection 752.1 Cr. C. was ordered.Section 752.1(1) Cr. C.Application for remand for assessment: On application by the prosecutor,\nif the court is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds to believe\nthat an offender who is convicted of a serious personal injury offence or an\noffence referred to in paragraph 753.1(2)(a) might be found to be a\ndangerous offender under section 753 or a long-term offender under section\n753.1, the court shall, by order in writing, before sentence is imposed, remand\nthe offender, for a period not exceeding 60 days, to the custody of a person\ndesignated by the court who can perform an assessment or have an assessment\nperformed by experts for use as evidence in an application under section 753 or\n753.1.[7]The accused was then taken to the Pinel\nInstitute, where he met with the psychiatrist Louis Morissette.[8]On November 27, 2008, Mtre Pascal Lescarbeau,\nlegal counsel for X, filed a motion to cease representing. The motion, which\nwas not opposed, was allowed.[9]Mtre Sophie Picard appeared on December 15,\n2008. At her request, an additional period of time was granted so that a second\nassessment could be prepared by Dr. Serge Gauthier.THE FACTS[10]The judgments referred to earlier are the\nsubject of three separate written decisions.[11]The excerpts below summarize the essence of the\nrelevant facts:[translation]525-03-037949-070 (A): During the evening (of November 3 to 4,\n2006), the police intervened because the noise was too loud. X then took A to\nthe basement of a neighbouring building. They found themselves in a garage.\nThey sat down on a car seat outside a pickup truck.X soon began to kiss A on her neck and\nlips. A expressed her unwillingness and wanted to leave. X nevertheless\ncontinued, pulling down A’s top and kissing her breasts. A started to cry. He\nsaid to her: [translation]\n\"if you make too\nmuch noise, I’ll hit you\". At the time, he was holding the complainant by\nthe throat with his fist near her face.X undid A’s belt and pants and touched her\nbuttocks. He then put a finger inside her vagina. She did not stop repeating\nthat she was unwilling and that she wanted to leave. X told her again to keep\nher voice down or he would hit her.A was threatened with physical reprisals if she did not comply with her\nassailant. In addition, she was prevented from leaving the premises until the\nassault was over.[1]525-03-038012-076 (B): One evening in August 2006, B was coming\nback from the movies on the bus. It was the first time her mother had let her\ngo out in the evening. She noticed a group of people get on the bus during the\ntrip. When B got off the bus, the group followed her. She walked faster, since\nshe was already a little worried.She was then approached by a member of the\ngroup who told her to come with them. She refused. Then another one approached\nher and threatened her at knifepoint. She was therefore forced to follow them.\nThey found themselves in the schoolyard of A school. She was grabbed and held\nfrom behind.The one she identified as the leader of the\ngroup approached her and forced her to kiss him. He then stepped back a little\nand asked B to masturbate him. She said no, crying. The leader started to\nmasturbate himself. She did not want to look at him but was forced to.Afterwards, he approached her and asked for\nher cell phone. She answered that she did not have one. He retorted, [translation] \"Stop fooling around, we saw you with\nyour cell on the bus\". At the time these words were exchanged, the\nassailant was about 10 feet away from B. She then gave him her cell. He took\nnote of the number and gave the cell phone back to her. That was when she ran\naway.She heard him yelling: [translation] \"I\nknow your number, I’m going to find you\".[2]525-03-038012-076 (C): On September 9, 2006, in the evening, C\nwas on her way to her father’s place. She left the A Metro station to wait for\nthe bus. Just at that moment, a group of people approached her. Among them was\nsomeone named X. He approached C and paid her a number of compliments. He\nsuggested that they go to a park a short distance away to wait for the bus. He\ntold her the bus would not be coming for another twenty minutes.The two of them went to the park and sat\ndown on a bench.X continued to compliment C on her\nappearance. A little uncomfortable, she told him that she had a boyfriend, D.\nIn spite of everything, he continued his advances.He started to kiss C on her neck while continuing to tell her she was\nbeautiful.C refused, got up and left. She walked quickly. X followed her,\ncaught up with her and pushed her down, her face to the ground. He fondled her\nbreasts and kissed her neck. C asked him to stop. She felt paralyzed. The\nassault continued. X pulled down C’s pants and raped her…[3]CRIMINAL RECORD[12]On September 30, 2004, X signed a surety under\nsection 810 Cr. C. following a complaint of sexual assault.[13]Less than two months later, on November 26,\n2004, he committed a sexual assault and was convicted on April 25, 2005. On\nJune 21, 2005, he was given a sentence of twelve months’ custody and\nsupervision, followed by probation with various conditions, including regular supervision.[14]On January 25, 2007, he pleaded guilty of\nrobbery (344(b) Cr. C.) and fabricating evidence (137 Cr. C.).\nHe was sentenced to forty hours of community service and probation with supervision\nfor six months, and was prohibited from owning a firearm for two years.[15]Between 2005 and 2007, he also violated various\nconditions and undertakings.[16]A detailed list of his prior offences (R-3) was\nadmitted by the defence.[17]Finally, after the judgments of the undersigned,\nX was convicted of a further sexual assault. He was no longer a minor, and the\nproceedings took their course in the criminal division.[18]Although given an opportunity to clarify the\ncircumstances of this latter crime, the Crown prosecutor chose not to do so,\nexplaining that a similar application (application to be found a dangerous\noffender) would eventually be filed as part of these specific proceedings.EVIDENCE[19]In addition to the list of his criminal record\n(R-3), the Crown filed a psychiatric assessment and an update prepared by Dr.\nLouis Morissette.[20]Two letters from the Pinel Institute were also filed,\nand their content was admitted by the defence.[21]The first witness, [intervener 1], monitored X\nduring his period of supervision (February 2006 to June 2006) and during his\nprobation (June 2006 to April 2007, the time of his arrest).[22]He came to most of his appointments. His\nparticipation was perfunctory and superficial. He was polite but showed no\nmotivation to change.[23]More specifically, when it came to his sexual\nbehaviour, he refused to participate in a meaningful way.[24]Thus, although he claimed to be open to\nreceiving assistance, he did not follow through on his commitments. He went to\nthe Pinel Institute in March and November 2006 and each time, the same scenario\nplayed out wherein he attended two meetings, to which he arrived late, and then\nhe refused to continue.[25]Despite this, [intervener 1] suggested an\nalternative: the A program. The result was the same. In fourteen months of intervention,\nit was impossible to deal with X’s sexual dynamics.[26]The minimum objectives of the probationary\nsupervision were as follows: understand the meaning of the offence, put\nmechanisms in place to prevent reoffending, and change behaviours.[27]The approach recommended, while structured, was\nrespectful and even generous. However, no progress was observed.[28]In fact, X committed four new sexual assaults\nduring Mr. [intervener 1]’s intervention, including one in November 2006, when\nhe said he was ready to go back to the Pinel Institute.[29]The psychiatrist Dr. Morissette describes X as a\nsexual predator.[30]He presents narcissistic and anti-social\nqualities, including an almost complete lack of empathy and respect for the\nintegrity of others. He suffers from sadistic paraphilia.[31]Because of the number of victims, the number of\ncharges, the fact that his victims were generally strangers to him, his assaults\nwhile in treatment and under supervisiton, and his young age (under 25), he represents\na very high risk of reoffending.[32]The psychiatrist states that, compared to the\naverage of sexual assailants who have received a sentence of two years and more,\nX is in the top 20% at risk.[33]The psychiatrist does not see any real chance of\ncontrolling his risk of reoffending in the community even after a term of\nimprisonment.[34]The treatments given during detention would not\nbe effective, mainly because of the accused’s personality, his resistance to\nthe treatments given, and the large number of assaults committed during these\ntreatments.[35]He concludes by stating that X's recognition of\nhis wrongdoing, as expressed to the psychiatrist Mr. Gauthier (called for the\ndefence), was merely superficial and perfunctory.[36]It should be noted that Dr. Morissette met with\nX on three separate occasions, for a total of five hours of interviews.[37]During the defence, X's mother and brother\nexpressed their sorrow. They offer support and supervision in the event of a\npossible release.[38]As for the accused, during his brief testimony,\nhe timidly expressed some remorse. He said that he had not really cooperated\nwith the psychiatrist Dr. Morissette because he did not feel comfortable.\nHis period in detention had made him realize that he needed therapy.[39]His testimony, which was heard on May 29,\n2009, lasted only a few minutes, during which he made certain generalizations,\nand nothing more. The examination-in-chief was between 10:27 a.m. and\n10:31 a.m. Remorse was expressed in the first thirty seconds, and his plans for\ntherapy and school, in the last ninety seconds. The remaining two minutes were\nused to justify his lack of cooperation with regard to the assessment.[40]Serge Gauthier, the psychiatrist retained by the\ndefence, identifies two major problems.[41]First, based on X's significant, if not daily,\nconsumption of alcohol, the psychiatrist infers a diagnosis of [translation] “paraphilia under the influence of alcohol”. After drinking, he opines, X loses his inhibitions and commit the\nassaults.[42]Secondly, the psychiatrist hypothesizes that X\nhas an attention deficit disorder. This is in fact the crux of his argument.[43]In his opinion, X has suffered from this\ndisorder for a number of years and was never properly treated. Moreover, as\nlong as this disorder is not treated, he will never be able to benefit from any\ntherapeutic support to correct his sexual deviances.[44]An attention deficit disorder (ADD) would imply\nlower self-esteem, the emergence of behavioural problems and, above all, great\nimmaturity. The treatment proposed by Dr. Gauthier would therefore be as follows:[translation]-a long term of incarceration;-taking medication;-learning a trade;-participating in a therapeutic process for his sexual\ndeviances;-assessment and treatment for alcohol abuse.[45]This would all be take place over several years.[46]According to this expert, there is a real chance\nof success in using such an approach, although quantifying it is not possible.[47]The psychiatrists do not agree on two points.[48]The first concerns the statement that there is\nsignificant consumption of alcohol and therefore a diagnosis of paraphilia\nunder the influence of alcohol.[49]In this regard, the evidence heard at trial\ngiving rise to the application now before us does not indicate any drinking.[50]Furthermore, [intervener 1], who monitored the\naccused for over a year, has not indicated a drinking problem. Mr. X's family,\nwhich has shown exemplary cooperation, also never mentioned it.[51]Nevertheless, when questioned on the subject,\nDr. Gauthier explains that even if there is no drinking problem, the proposed\ntreatment would be the same. The disagreement therefore becomes moot.[52]Another point of contention concerns whether\nthere is an attention deficit disorder and, especially, its impact.[53]Dr. Morissette states that if X suffers from an\nattention deficit disorder (which he does not readily admit), it is a minor\naspect that is not related to the acts with which he is charged.[54]As previously mentioned, Dr. Gauthier makes it\nthe main consideration of his assessment.[55]Although this hypothesis definitely has some\nmerit, caution is needed. The report states that there is a [translation] “probable attention deficit disorder” (page 7).As the psychiatrist himself\nadmits, two or three additional meetings would have been desirable in order to\nmake a clear diagnosis. Furthermore, there does not seem to be a study\nestablishing a link between paraphilia and an attention deficit disorder.[56]Beyond their differences of opinion, the\npsychiatrists agree that X is considered a high risk to reoffend and that the\nmere passage of time in custody is not likely to improve his condition.APPLICATION OF THE LAW[57]Section 753(1)(b) Cr. C. provides as\nfollows:Application for finding that an offender is a\ndangerous offender: On application made under this\nPart after an assessment report is filed under subsection 752.1(2), the court\nshall find the offender to be a dangerous offender if it is satisfied...(b) that the\noffence for which the offender has been convicted is a serious personal injury\noffence described in paragraph (b) of the definition of that expression in\nsection 752 and the offender, by his or her conduct in any sexual matter\nincluding that involved in the commission of the offence for which he or she\nhas been convicted, has shown a failure to control his or her sexual impulses\nand a likelihood of causing injury, pain or other evil to other persons through\nfailure in the future to control his or her sexual impulses.[58]First, section 752(b) clearly states that\nsexual assaults constitute a “serious personal injury offence”.[59]Secondly, has the offender shown a failure to\ncontrol his sexual impulses?[60]At the time of the said offences, X was under\nsupervision. His probation officer acted specifically in such a way as to\nreduce X's risk of reoffending. Two attempted treatments at the Pinel Institute\ndid not prove to be useful.[61]Not only did X not take the treatments offered,\nbut he also committed four new sexual assaults.[62]There is no doubt about his failure to control\nhis sexual impulses. In addition, the two psychiatrists agree that X is at high\nrisk to reoffend. This aspect of the evidence has not been contradicted.[63]The criteria of section 753(1)(b) Cr.\nC. have been proved beyond any reasonable doubt.[64]Now for the sentencing:Section\n753(4) Cr. C.Sentence for dangerous offender: If the court finds an offender to be a\ndangerous offender, it shall(a)impose a sentence of detention in a\npenitentiary for an indeterminate period;(b)impose a sentence for an offence for\nwhich the offender has been convicted — which must be a minimum punishment of\nimprisonment for a term of two years — and order that the offender be subject\nto long-term supervision for a period that does not exceed 10 years; or(c)impose a sentence for the offence for\nwhich the offender has been convicted.Section 753(4.1) Cr. C.Sentence of indeterminate detention: The court shall impose a sentence of detention\nin a penitentiary for an indeterminate period unless it is satisfied by the\nevidence adduced during the hearing of the application that there is a\nreasonable expectation that a lesser measure under paragraph (4)(b) or (c)\nwill adequately protect the public against the commission by the offender of\nmurder or a serious personal injury offence.[65]In accordance with the teachings of the Supreme\nCourt,[4] even\nthough an offender may be found to be a dangerous offender, the court must ask\nitself if a less restrictive measure is sufficient....a judge ought to\nimpose an indeterminate sentence only in those instances in which there does\nnot exist less restrictive means by which to protect the public adequately from\nthe threat of harm, i.e., where a definite sentence or long-term offender\ndesignation are insufficient.[66]Accordingly, determining whether there is a real\nchance that the risk can be controlled in the community is warranted.[67]The psychiatrist Dr. Morissette stated that\nafter a prison sentence, the risk may not be controllable in society. X is in\nthe most dangerous category for reoffending (the top 20%). His intolerance, his\nlack of cooperation, his many offences committed during his treatment and\nprobation, and finally his narcissistic and anti-social qualities make him an\nindividual whom it will not be possible to control in a few years.[68]Dr. Morissette's testimony contains no\ncontradictions or gaps. His opinion is based on his lengthy experience (twenty-six\nyears at the Pinel Institute) and on premises for which there is a consensus in\nthe scientific community.[69]However, the psychiatrist Dr. Gauthier claims that\nif X's condition is properly treated, there is a real chance of success, although\nthat success is unquantifiable. As mentioned earlier, his reasoning is based on\na diagnosis that is yet to be confirmed and on premises that are not supported\nby scientific literature.[70]The Alberta Court of Appeal has pointed out that\nan application for imposing a dangerous offender designation cannot be\ndismissed on the basis of a “remote” possibility of treatment.[5][71]The Quebec Court of Appeal has stated that to conclude\nthat such treatment is sufficient to meet the criteria of section 753(4.1) Cr.\nC., the court must rely on the evidence, and not on mere speculation or\nwishful thinking (R. v. Boyer, 2006 QCCA 1091 (CanLII)).[72]The defence aptly pointed out the accused's\nyoung age. Unfortunately, that is not enough to set aside overwhelming\nevidence. [translation]\n“Giving X a chance”, as his legal counsel\nsuggests, would be tantamount to wishful thinking.[73]The evidence adduced for the defence does not\nsuggest that after a prison sentence, the public may be sufficiently protected against\nnew serious injury offences.[74]In R. v. Jones, 1994 CanLII 85 (SCC), [1994] 2 S.C.R. 229, the Supreme\nCourt asserted that:The overriding aim [of a\nfinding that an offender is a dangerous offender] is not the punishment of the\noffender but the prevention of future violence through the imposition of an indeterminate\nsentence.An indeterminate sentence is not an unlimited sentence...The offender faces incarceration only for the period of time that he poses a\nserious risk to the safety of society.In the interim, it is hoped that\nhe will receive treatment that will assist him in controlling his\nconduct.To release a dangerous offender while he remains unable to\ncontrol his actions serves neither the interests of the offender nor those of\nsociety.FOR THESE REASONS, THE\nCOURT:[75]ALLOWS the\napplication;[76]FINDS that X is a dangerous offender;[77]SENTENCES him to imprisonment for an indeterminate period;[78]ORDERS that copies of the psychiatric assessments of Dr. Morissette and\nDr. Gauthier, as well as this judgment, be delivered to the Correctional\nService of Canada, in addition to the transcript;[79]ORDERS the collection of the number of bodily samples deemed necessary for\nDNA testing;[80]PROHIBITS\nX from possessing any firearm, cross-bow,\nrestricted weapon, ammunition and explosives for life;[81]ORDERS that X comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act.Signed at the city of A, on\nSeptember 30, 2009.__________________________________PATRICE HURTUBISE,J.C.Q.Mtre Sylvie LemieuxCrown ProsecutorMtre Sophie PicardCounsel for the defence[1] Court file 525-03-037949-070, judgment of May 8, 2008, paras. 9,\n10, 11 and 24.[2] Court file 525-03-038012-076, judgment of May 8, 2008, paras. 4, 5,\n6, 7 and 8.[3] Court file 525-03-038012-076, judgment of May 8, 2008, paras. 7, 8,\n9, 10 and 16.[4] R. v.

(Orally):INTRODUCTIONOn February 24th,\n2015, D.R.W. entered guilty pleas to six charges on information,14-03579, which is a\nreplacement information:-to count one, which is a count of voyeurism, pursuant\nto section 162(1)(c), in relation to D.S.;-count three, which is a charge of mischief, pursuant to\nsection 430(4), which also relates to the victim D.S.;-count seven is a count of voyeurism contrary to section\n162(1)(c), in respect of the victim, L.T.;-count eight is a charge of voyeurism as it relates to\nthe victim, J.T., also pursuant to section 162(1)(c) of the Criminal\nCode;-count ten relates to a charge of unlawfully in a\ndwelling house, which relates to M.K.W. and videos that were taken in that\nhouse; and-finally, count thirteen is a charge of voyeurism\ncontrary to section 162(1)(c) as it relates to the victim, M.K..The Crown elected to\nproceed by indictment in respect to each of these charges and an agreed\nstatement of fact was entered on that date and apre-sentence report\nwas ordered.The matter was adjourned to May 13th, 2015 for sentence.On May\n13th, 2015 the defence advised D.R.W. was going to be seen by a forensic\npsychiatrist, Dr. Woodside, at CAMH and a report would be forthcoming.Consequently the matter was adjourned.The matter was then adjourned on a\nnumber of other occasions because the psychiatric report was not prepared.The report, dated\nJanuary 10th, 2016, has finally been prepared and was released to the court and\nthe Crown by Mr. Khehra on January 26th, 2016.On that date the matter was\nadjourned to February 1st, 2016 for submissions and sentence.The matter was\nfurther adjourned because we did not complete submissions by counsel until today’s\ndate, February 9th, 2016 and I am now giving my reasons for sentence.THE AGREED STATEMENT\nOF FACTSI will not go through\nthe facts in great detail, but I think it is important to deal with some of\nthese facts.As I will discuss later in my reasons, D.R.W. was convicted of\nvoyeurism in the Ontario Court of Justice on July 15th, 2011 and he received a\nsuspended sentence and two years probation.That probation ended in July of\n2013.On October 18th, 2013,\nYork Regional Police were notified of a voyeurism complaint by Shayne Husain,\nwho is a loss prevention officer at the Walmart store located at 25 Silver\nLinden Drive in Richmond Hill.Mr. Husain told police he observed security\nfootage taken on August 16th, 2013 from a known male, D.R.W., walking around\nthe cosmetic department.D.R.W. was observed walking behind a young unknown\nblack female, wearing blue jeans and a pink sweater, crouched down looking at\nsomething on the shelf.As he walked by the female, D.R.W. appeared to be\ntaking a photo, using his cell phone, of the female’s buttocks area as her\nunderwear was exposed as she crouched.D.R.W. was observed returning to the\nlocation of this female several times.It is unknown if D.R.W. in fact took\nphotos of this female.Mr. Husain was\nfamiliar with D.R.W. from the previous conviction where D.R.W. was arrested and\ncharged for taking photographs up a skirt of a 16-year-old female at the same\nWalmart location.The video footage that\nwas taken on August 16th, 2013 was provided by Mr. Husain to police and it was\nreviewed by Detective Constable Terry Seow, and in comparing the close-up\nfacial shots of D.R.W. in this video footage to a police mug shot photo of D.R.W.\ntaken in 2011, the police were satisfied that the male in the video footage was\nin fact D.R.W.Police then subsequently sought a warrant to search D.R.W.’s\nresidence located at 1040 W[…] in Oshawa.That warrant was granted on November\n20th, 2013 by a justice of the peace and D.R.W.’s residence was searched for a\ncellular phone and/or cellular media storage device capable of storing data,\ncomputer and computer systems as defined by the Criminal\nCode, section 342.1, external media storage\ncards, billing records pertaining to the cellular phone number assigned to the\ncellular phone being used by the suspect, and any cellular device particulars\npermitting identification of the cellular phone used in this offence, and any\nother data storage devices and data as defined by the Criminal\nCode at section 342.1.A search was conducted\non November 21st, 2013 and during the execution of that search warrant D.R.W.\nreturned home and he was arrested for voyeurism.This, I think, is what\nis of importance because of submissions that were made to me with respect to D.R.W.’s\nprevious charge and a forfeiture order that was made.I was provided the\ninformation relating to D.R.W.’s original guilty plea from July 15th, 2011\nwhere there is a forfeiture order for the computer and a cell phone that had\nbeen seized from D.R.W. in respect of this charge of voyeurism.It should be noted\nthat D.R.W. was originally in court on July 13th, 2011.A bail hearing was not\ncommenced and it was on July 15th that he actually entered his guilty plea in\n202 court here in Newmarket, having been in custody at that point for what\nappears to be three days.In any event, on the\n21st of November, 2013, during the execution of the search warrant, the\nfollowing items were seized:-computer hard drive, there were six of them seized, not\njust one, and they are all listed in the agreed statement of facts, I won’t\nindicate;-item two was another computer hard drive, and there are\ntwo, and they are listed;-there is a jump drive with a serial number, which is\nlisted;-there are four DVDs, 4.7 gigabytes contained in a black\nsleeve;-there are two SD cards;-there were adapters, transcend micro adapter, a PNY\nmicro adapter;-there is a Samsung cell phone with a serial number;-a BlackBerry with a serial number;-a black Casio camera with a serial number;-a Lexar platinum, which apparently, I think, is an SD\ncard, has 16 gigabytes on it;-there is a Duracell 8 gigabyte SD card; and-there was another BlackBerry seized.So there were numerous\nitems that were seized, and maybe these were things that were around when D.R.W.\nwas arrested in 2011, but it would appear that only a computer and a cell phone\nwere actually seized by the police at that time and were not returned because\nthe information indicates they were forfeited to the police to be destroyed.On December 9th, 2013,\na further search warrant was granted to allow the search of the items seized\nduring the search of D.R.W.’s residence on November 21st, 2013.It was during\nthe search of the seized items that several videos were recovered of a male in\nan office environment masturbating and ejaculating onto a desk and into a\ncoffee mug.That male person was later identified as D.R.W.There were a\nnumber of other videos discovered of females in an office environment who were\nvideotaped.On March 13th, 2014\npolice attended D.R.W.’s place of employment, which at that time was P[…],\nwhere D.R.W. was shown a still photograph taken from a video, that had been\nlocated during the search of the devices, showing a female in her office\nenvironment.D.R.W. identified the female as D.S., an ex-coworker.This\nperson was ultimately identified by police as D.S., who is the victim on the\nfirst two charges to which D.R.W. pled guilty.D.S. was a coworker\nand actually his superior, whom he worked with for seven years.D.S. attended\nthe police station where she was shown two videos of D.R.W. masturbating in an\noffice environment, ejaculating onto a desk and into a coffee mug.She\nidentified that office to be hers.Based on the person’s clothes, watch and\nwedding ring, she identified the male as D.R.W..D.S. had brought the coffee\nmug observed in the videos and it was seized by the police as evidence.D.S.\nfurther identified herself as one of the females in the office environment from\nsome of the videos that were recovered.There were\napproximately 20 short video clips located depicting D.S.’s buttocks area where\nher underwear is exposed, upper leg area where she is wearing a skirt, and\nbreast area, in an office setting.There were also 25 short video clips\ndepicted of D.R.W. masturbating and ejaculating into D.S’s coffee mug and onto\nher desk.Some of the videos show D.R.W. rubbing his penis on D.S.’s office\nphone, where she would be speaking into the receiver.As a result of the\nsearch of the devices further charges were laid against D.R.W..D.R.W. was\narrested at his work place on March 14th, 2014 for a number of offences, which\nare set out in the agreed statement of facts.After speaking to counsel and\nbeing cautioned, D.R.W. was interviewed by Detective Constable Morton and\nduring this interview D.R.W. admitted to having a pornography addiction.D.R.W.\nfurther stated there would be a substantial amount of pornography on the data\nstorage devices seized, and further stated he did not know if there would be\nother victims, as he did not recall every detail of the videos that were\ndownloaded or recorded.D.R.W. admitted during the interview that he started\nshooting the “up skirt videos” again a month after his probation ended.He\nalso indicated he bore no animus towards his former boss, D.S.Following further\nexamination of the devices that were seized during the search of November 21st,\n2013, additional videos and photos consisting of “up skirt” videos and photos\nof unknown females, as well as videos and photos of the buttocks area of\nunknown females whose underwear is exposed, primarily taken in public forums.These were located on the devices seized.A further warrant was\nsought by the police on March 25th, 2015 to search further data storage devices\nthat are listed in the agreed statement of facts.Upon review of the data\nstorage devices indicated in the agreed statement of facts, numerous videos\nwere recovered and the videos contained recordings of the following:-unidentified females in public places.These videos\nare taken at Walmart stores and various other locations;-D.R.W. masturbating in D.S.’s office;-D.R.W. in a bedroom rubbing female undergarments on his\npenis while masturbating;-D.R.W. in another bedroom retrieving undergarments from\na bag and rubbing them against his penis while masturbating;-D.R.W. masturbating in his basement while reviewing a\nvideo of a female in the shower.A video was located\nshowing D.R.W. setting up the camera in the basement of his residence.The\ncamera was pointed at the bathroom shower area in D.R.W.’s basement.The\nbasement was roughed in, but not dry walled.He can be seen concealing the\ncamera in this video, moving objects around so it has an unobstructed view of\nthe bathroom shower area, which is in the basement.The video of an\nunidentified female showering was located and this video shows the unidentified\nfemale undressing and using the shower facilities and then coming out, drying\nherself off and also dressing.On April 14th and\nApril 15th, 2014 numerous more videos were discovered as a result of further\nsearch of the data storage devices.On April 24th, 2014,\npolice attended T[…]in Richmond Hill, where D.R.W. had worked, and spoke with L.T.,\nan ex-coworker of D.R.W.She was shown two still photographs from a video\nlocated during the search of the devices.She identified herself as being the\nunknown woman in an office environment.April 26th and April\n28th, 2014, police conducted an open source search on social media in an\nattempt to identify several unidentified females shown in pictures and videos\ncontained in separate file folders found in the storage devices that were\ntitled using women’s first names.By information gained through the social\nmedia website searches, M.K., the sister of M.K.W., D.R.W.’s brother’s wife,\nwas identified by the police as one of the unidentified females.She was interviewed\non May 6th, 2014 by the police, she identified herself in three still\nphotographs.They show the upper leg area of M.K. when she is wearing a dress\nand there were photos that were attempts at up skirt photos of M.K., whose\nunderwear is not depicted.M.K. also identified\nthe unknown bedroom in one of the recordings as belonging to her sister, M.K.W.\nand D.W., D.R.W.’s brother.On May 7th, 2014 police attended the residence of\nD.W., and M.K.W. and M.K.W. confirmed, by looking at a still shot of the\nbedroom taken from a video recording found in one of the data storage devices\nseized at D.R.W.’s residence, that the bedroom was her bedroom.As a result of these\nfurther videos and photos that were discovered in the data storage devices, D.R.W.\nwas arrested a third time for further offences on May 15th, 2014.These\nincluded charges of voyeurism relating to L.T., mischief under relating to M.K.W.,\nunlawfully in a dwelling, also related to M.K.W., and voyeurism with respect to\nthe unknown female in D.R.W.’s basement.May 16th, 2014 police\nconducted an open source search of the Facebook account of J.W., it’s the wife\nof D.R.W., the accused, in an attempt to identify the unknown female recorded\nin the shower in D.R.W.’s basement.They identified the woman as J.T.There\nwere three videos located of J.T. undressing, using the shower facilities\nlocated in D.R.W.’s basement.One of the videos also depicts D.R.W. watching\nand masturbating to one of the videos of J.T. while naked and entering in and\nexiting the shower.She was interviewed on June 18th, 2014 and was shown\neither the videos or photographs and identified herself as the unknown female.Those are the facts of\nthis case.PRE-SENTENCE AND\nFORENSIC PSYCHIATRIC REPORTThe pre-sentence and\nthe forensic psychiatric report by Dr. Woodside also include admissions by D.R.W.\nof his amassing 14,000 images of unknowing women from 2005 until his arrest in\n2011 on a single charge of voyeurism involving a woman at Walmart bending over\nand D.R.W. taking pictures of her exposed buttocks.D.R.W. admitted to police\nhe began “up skirt videos” about a month after his probation ended in July 2013\nand did this two to three times a week, anywhere there was a large number of\npeople, including malls, Walmart, Superstores, any place where there were\nwomen.He stated he would typically crouch down and then move his camera under\nthe unsuspecting victim’s skirt.He noted he used an application called “spy\ncam” as something similar that allowed the user to appear to be using the\nphone, example dialing, while it was actually taking video, or where it\nappeared to be locked or inactive, but was actually taking video.That is at page\n16 of Dr. Woodside’s report, Exhibit 8, tab 1.D.R.W. originally\nestimated to Dr. Woodside that between July 2013 and his arrest in November\n2013 he might have shot 1,000 videos. In his second interview D.R.W. adjusted\nthis number and indicated he shot perhaps 1,000 videos in total from 2005, but\nonly 50 between July and November 2013.VICTIM IMPACT EVIDENCEThe offences had a\nsignificant emotional and traumatic impact upon the three victims who provided\nand read their victim impact statements during D.R.W.’s sentencing.I am just\ngoing to highlight some of the comments.They are a part of the record and Mr.\nKhehra indicated to me today that D.R.W., after hearing those victim impact\nstatements read by the victims, three of three victims in this matter, that he\napparently had greater insight into the impact that his behaviour had upon\nthem.In my view, I will say\nthis now, that is something that is yet to be determined.I do not know that I\naccept that, given the reports that I have read, both the pre-sentence report\nand then the most recent psychiatric report, which was prepared January 10th,\n2016.D.S. says in her\nvictim impact statement:“The crimes committed by D.R.W. have greatly affected\nme.Just trying to put into words how the crimes have impacted me has caused a\ngreat deal of emotional distress.”When D.S. was told of\nthe crime she said she went into a state of shock and disbelief.She was\ncompletely overwhelmed, started to tremble, she had a pain in her stomach,\nwhich felt like someone had punched her.When she was on her way back to her\noffice after speaking with the police she had to stop her car at the side of\nthe road as she started to dry heave at the realization that she had been\nexposed to D.R.W.’s ejaculate in her coffee cup.She described how D.R.W.\nwould often bring her a coffee and it would often have a foul taste.This\ncaused her great concern for her health.She immediately went to her doctor,\nwas tested for HIV, but it took weeks for the results to come back, and that\nwas overwhelming to her and filled her with anxiety.For weeks after learning\nabout the crime she woke up feeling nauseous, felt as if she was going to\nvomit.She became very emotional, would often cry in the morning when she\nwould get up, getting ready to drive to work.If she had to discuss the crime\nshe would break down in tears.She started to experience severe anxiety; she\nfelt a pressure in her chest, a horrible ache in her stomach.She suffered\nfrom tension headaches most of the time and had very little appetite.When she\nate she would have an upset stomach.Her sleeping changed, she couldn't sleep\nat night, she was too anxious and fearful.Some nights she was awake all\nnight.She avoided socializing, something that she used to do, but now she was\noverwhelmed by a feeling of sadness that resulted in her wanting to be by\nherself.She started getting hives all over arms, stomach and legs, which for\nthe first time had to take Benadryl to control the itching and the burning.This was coming about, according to her doctor, from stress.D.S. viewed her\nrelationship with D.R.W., and I will refer to this later in my reasons, that he\nwas a person who had a position of trust in their office.She could never have\nimagined him doing something so grotesque.His crimes towards her have\naffected the level of trust that she now has in other people.She now has to\nthink twice about what she wears.She says in her victim impact statement that\nshe struggles every day as a result of D.R.W.’s crimes.D.S. sought out the\nassistance of a therapist and part of her victim impact statement are the\nreceipts from those therapy sessions, which I understand there is a total that\nMs. Castiglione will indicate at a later point.J.T. wrote a victim\nimpact statement on April 10th, 2015.She also describes how when she had to\nwrite down how D.R.W.’s actions had affected her life that it filled her with\nanxiety and stress.It took her a significant amount of time to even build up\nthe courage and strength to be able to put her feelings down on paper.She had\ngreat conflict because of her close relationship with J.W., who had been like a\nsister to her for 25 years.She also refers to the fact that D.R.W. breached a\ntrust that she and he had shared for many, many years, given her relationship\nwith D.R.W.’s wife.J.T. describes how D.R.W.’s\nconduct destroyed a long-term friendship that they shared.She viewed him like\nfamily and that she never thought that he would violate her in such a sick\nway.She said when she received the phone call from the police saying that\nthey believed she was the victim of voyeurism her world was rocked, she felt an\nimmediate sickness in the bottom of her stomach that is still with her today.She describes how the crimes of D.R.W. that were committed against her caused\nher pre-existing panic attacks to resurface.She had overcome those panics\nattacks and had not suffered from them in many years, but watching the videos\nthat D.R.W. took of her, she had an immediate anxious feeling wash over her and\nsince that time she has had multiple panic attacks.If she closes her eyes she\ncan see the videos replaying in her mind.Sometimes she says the images of\nthose disturbing videos will replay while her eyes are open as she is trying to\nfunction with every day tasks.It even affected her relationship with her\nfiancé because of the sexual nature of the crime committed against her.J.T. describes how D.R.W.\nwas actually mad when he found out that she was going to verify herself as a\nvictim and watch the videotapes that he took of her.She describes how he made\nzero effort to make retribution for violating her, despite having numerous\nopportunities to do so.She talks about how he never sent her a written letter\nof apology.She views his lack of remorse as a concerning issue for her.L.T. provided a victim\nimpact statement which she read in court.She describes being in constant fear\nsince she has learned of the crime, for her own safety as well as the publics.She knew D.R.W. for a number of years, they were colleagues, sometimes\ncarpooled together, he knows where she lives, he has been in her home.She\nfinds it unsettling that he lives in the same town as she does, not far from\nher home.She has a fear of running into him at local establishments, grocery\nstores, gas stations and so on.She is also fearful of being alone in her\nhome, which she never felt prior to being told of these crimes.L.T. describes the\nfact that D.R.W. betrayed her trust in him and she was in disbelief that he\ncould commit such heinous crimes and she is sickened by what he did.She\ndescribes how D.R.W. would often use the women’s washroom at their place of\nwork and she was afraid for a great deal of time that there were videos taken\nof her in compromising positions in that washroom when she used it.There is no doubt in\nmy mind that all of the complainants, the ones who provided victim impact\nstatements, as well as those who did not, were greatly impacted by the conduct\nof D.R.W..THE PERSONAL\nCIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ACCUSEDD.R.W. is 41 years of\nage.He has been married for 12 years and has two children, a son aged 8 and a\ndaughter aged 5.D.R.W.’s wife is currently his surety on these charges, but\nhas expressed her intention to separate from D.R.W. upon his being sentenced on\nthese charges.This matter unfortunately has been adjourned for almost a\nyear.J.W. has not been able to move on with her intention to separate from\nher husband, as she is his surety.D.R.W. has a younger\nbrother who is married and whose wife is the victim relating to the unlawfully\nin a dwelling house.The information available indicates D.R.W. is currently\nestranged from his brother as a result of the offence committed in respect of D.R.W.’s\nsister-in-law.D.R.W. has completed\nhis high school and then went on to obtain a three-year college diploma as an\nengineering technician.He worked for seven years at T[...], followed by a\nperiod of employment at P[...], working as a technical equipment specialist.D.R.W.’s\nemployment at T[...] ended when he was not given a financial bonus due to his\ntaking extended lunches, which he refused to rectify.D.R.W. admitted to the\nprobation officer in the pre-sentence report, Exhibit 4, and to Dr. Woodside in\nthe forensic psychiatric report, Exhibit 8, Tab 1, that he would often take\nextended lunches, lasting four hours, to engage in his voyeuristic activities.He worked with P[...] until 2014, when he was fired as a result of\ninappropriate use of his computer, involving pornography.After this employment\nhe was operating his own company where he works as a house framer, however, he\nis currently unemployed as a result of his detention in November 2015, when he\nwas arrested on another alleged breach of his recognizance.D.R.W. was quite\nforthcoming when asked to discuss his sexual behaviours, both with the\nprobation officer and with Dr. Woodside.He admitted to both the probation\nofficer and to Dr. Woodside, first engaging in voyeuristic behaviour at age 15\nwhen by chance he observed his neighbour undressing, and thereafter from age 15\nto 25 engaging in “peeping tom” behaviours.This behaviour apparently ceased\nafter he was married, as D.R.W. advised he was able to control his urges.However,\nin 2005 his voyeuristic tendencies were resurrected, which he blames on stress\nat his work.It was during his\nemployment at T[...] where D.R.W. met D.S., who was his supervisor, and as he\ndescribes, he became “infatuated” with her.D.R.W. initially began to\nvideotape and photograph D.S.’s and L.T.’s cleavage and buttocks areas in the\noffice setting.This led to his engaging in videotaping his activities of\ndisrobing in D.S.’s office, partially and fully, masturbating and ejaculating\ninto her coffee mug, onto her desk and the portion of the phone that she would\nspeak into.Apparently there were 25 videos found by police of D.R.W. engaging\nin this behaviour.He had a key to D.S.’s office and he would enter it after\nhours using this key.D.R.W. admitted to being infatuated with D.S. for seven\nyears.D.R.W. advised the\nprobation officer and Dr. Woodside he had accumulated some 14,000 images of\nunsuspecting women, which he then used to masturbate and which he viewed for\nhis own personal sexual purposes.He admitted being helpless to this behaviour\nand stated his pornography addiction has cost him two jobs and now familial\nrelationships.Yet despite this, according to the probation officer, he does\nnot appear to appreciate the gravity of his behaviours because he told her, “I\nam fine now”.D.R.W. has a criminal\nrecord, Exhibit 9, which reflects D.R.W. has a prior criminal record.It\nstarts in 1994, April 6 in Brighton, Ontario, a theft, for which he received a\nsuspended sentence and probation for one year.Then on January 18,\n1995 in Brighton, Ontario, there are nine counts of break and enter and theft,\ntwo counts of attempted break and enter and theft, possession of a narcotic,\ntwo charges of fail to comply with probation, and two charges of fraud under\n$1,000.On the first three sets of charges he received a month on each charge\nconsecutive, which would have been for a total of about 11 months, and then on\ncount four, which is the breach of probation, he received two months on each of\nthose charges, concurrent, and on the fraud charges he received a month on each\ncharge, concurrent, and then a year of probation.D.R.W. was paroled on\nMay 19th, 1995.There is then a gap\nuntil July 15th, 2011 in Newmarket, Ontario, where he was convicted of\nvoyeurism, given a suspended sentence, probation for two years and four days of\npre-trial custody, indicated on the information.August 4th, 2015, D.R.W.\nwas convicted of three charges of fail to comply recognizance, it was the\nrecognizance relating to the charges that are before the court and those three\nbreaches occurred after D.R.W. had entered pleas of guilty of six charges that\nI have already described.He received a 36-day intermittent sentence with nine\ndays of pre-trial custody noted on the information and six months probation.This occurred in Oshawa.As indicated, D.R.W.\nhas a prior record for voyeurism from July 15th, 2011 and a suspended sentence\nwith probation for two years.As part of his probation he was referred to the\nCentre for Addiction and Mental Health, Sexual Behaviours Clinic.He was assessed\nwith a diagnosis that apparently, according to Dr. Woodside, is unclear, although\nvoyeurism was not ruled out.He attended a ten-week group therapy, which met\nonce weekly.D.R.W. was arrested on\nNovember 21st, 2013 respecting the charge of voyeurism as a result of his being\nobserved by the same security officer in the same Walmart store from his 2011\nconviction, apparently photographing a woman bending over in the cosmetics\ndepartment.As a result of this information, police, as I have indicated, obtained\na number of search warrants to search his residence and then searched the\ndevices seized.Further charges were laid in March 2014 and again in May 2014\nas a result of images and videos discovered by the police.At some point D.R.W.\nwas referred to Dr. Hunchak at Lakeridge Health, who diagnosed D.R.W. as\nsuffering from voyeurism, with ADHD and Bipolar disorder.He was subsequently\nmedicated with Paxil and Abilify to control his moods and sex drive and he was\nseen by Dr. Hunchak for four sessions, although there were no follow up\nappointments after July 2015, according to Dr. Woodside’s report at page 11.D.R.W. also attended\ncounseling with Paul Lavergne for sex therapy at Turning Point Centre in\nPeterborough, from April until August 2014.Mr. Lavergne advised D.R.W.\nstopped counseling, as reflected in the pre-sentence report at page six.Mr.\nLavergne provided correspondence to the probation officer in which he indicated\nD.R.W.’s attendances were sporadic and after August 1st, 2014 he lost contact\nwith D.R.W..The probation officer\nspoke to D.R.W.’s wife, who advised she did not believe her husband is taking\nownership for the offences, that he minimizes the impact his conduct had on the\nvictims and his family and he has little remorse for his behaviour.She advised\nshe did not believe her husband was committed to therapy and had stopped\nprematurely.D.R.W. admits to a\nchronic daily use of marijuana.At the time of both the pre-sentence report as\nwell as the psychiatric forensic report he admits to two marijuana cigarettes a\nday, or seven grams a week.This was confirmed by his wife.D.R.W. did not\nview his use of cannabis as particularly dysfunctional, although he noted he\nwas spending $100 a week.He indicated only his mother did not approve of his\nuse, but denied anyone else expressed to him any concerns.He did not believe\nhis marijuana use was related to his legal problems.D.R.W. admitted to Dr.\nWoodside he was still looking at voyeuristic pornography on his computer,\nlooking primarily at “hidden camera” materials two to three times a week,\nspending one to two hours each time.Dr. Woodside obtained reports from\nLakeridge Health Corporation relating to D.R.W. attending the emergency room on\nMay 7th, 2014 complaining of suicidal thoughts consisting of cutting himself in\nthe hot tub.He apparently saw a Dr. Arshad Majeed.As indicated above, he\nthen began seeing Dr. Hunchak, who prescribed medication and saw him for\npsychotherapy.The last note from Dr. Hunchak, dated July 16th, 2015,\nindicated D.R.W.’s sentencing hearing was approaching and his wife was planning\nto separate, terminate the marriage, and then he reflects the following note,\nwhich is quoted by Dr. Woodside in his report, page 11, Exhibit 8, Tab l.I am\nquoting now from Dr. Hunchak:“The remarkable thing to me about him is that none of\nthis seems to really bother him.He continues to smoke dope and cigarettes,\nwhich I think he estimated cost him perhaps $10,000 annually.He does not seem\nto be nervous about his upcoming sentencing and he does not seem upset about\nthe separation.He just seems to be going along and nothing bothers him.I\nsuspect this might be the effect of the dope that he uses.”D.R.W. told Dr.\nWoodside the following at pages 16 to 17, Exhibit 8, Tab 1, respecting his\ntreatment at CAMH:“Treatment at CAMH was helpful in terms of\nunderstanding his triggers, but noted he did not use the techniques, “they\ndidn't come to me at the right time, I didn't practice them as much as I\nshould”.He noted that his cravings for voyeurism were quite low\nfor most of his probation, but resurfaced about six months prior to the end of\nprobation.He stated he simply tried to ignore the cravings\ninitially, however, he acknowledged having continued to look at voyeuristic\nmaterials online throughout his probation period and while in treatment.He\nnoted he looked primarily for, “up the skirt” materials and spy cam videos.He\ndid not disclose his use during treatment.He stated, “I wasn’t asked, but I\ndidn't disclose”.He reported rationalizing his use by telling himself that,\n“it was not illegal” and “it was not as bad as doing it myself.”Dr. Woodside diagnosed\nD.R.W. as suffering from a voyeuristic disorder, a paraphilic disorder.This\nis at page 26 of his report.He also conducted an assessment of the risk D.R.W.\nposes for future re-offending.He found D.R.W.:“Embodies a number of clinical variables know to be\nrelated to sexual recidivism, including more significantly, the presence of a\nsexual paraphilia, voyeuristic disorder, and a possible substance use\ndisorder.These variables should likely be considered static variables, which\nwill not be specifically responsive to intervention.”That is at page 29.Dr. Woodside\ncontinues:“The absence of other clinical variables such as the\npresence of significant anti-sociality/psychopathy, a history of hands-on\noffending and a history of non-sexually violent offending suggests a lower risk\nin this individual.Consideration of dynamic factors which relate to\nfluctuating or situational factors, such as response to treatment and\nsupervision, treatment of alcohol and substance abuse difficulties, etcetera,\ndoes not suggest a lower overall risk in this individual, although it does\nhighlight areas that one might hope to intervene and better manage D.R.W.’s\nrisk.”That is also page 29.Then over at page 30:“Overall, I would view D.R.W. as being at a moderate\nrisk for sexual recidivism from a purely clinical perspective, as well as from\nan actuarial perspective.”Mr. Lavergne makes a\nnumber of recommendations to the probation officer respecting D.R.W.’s future\ntreatment.This is at page six of the pre-sentence report at the bottom.In\nhis note to the probation officer he says:“Recommendations:Intensive therapy with a sexual addiction counselor, 12\nstep attendance at an SLAA group, and ideally an intensive in-patient treatment\nprogram for 60 to 90 days, like Bellwood, to deal with his sexual addiction.”He continues and says:“D.R.W.’s addiction has escalated to what we call,\n“Level 3”, addiction as it involves criminal activity and the victimization of\nothers.If he is not integrated into a treatment program specifically for\nsexual addicts and offenders he will not be helped.”Dr. Woodside also\nmakes a number of treatment recommendations for D.R.W. to follow through with\nat the conclusions of his report.This is at Exhibit 8, Tab 1, at page 30,\nunder the heading:“Treatment Recommendations:D.R.W. should receive further evaluation and treatment\nfor a possible substance use disorder, cannabis, including both involvement in\na structured program, along with a possible use of community support groups\nsuch as Alcoholics Anonymous.The goal for him should be at a minimum a\nsignificant reduction in use of cannabis or total abstinence.His ongoing\nsubstance use may act to disinhibit him, such that he is more likely to act out\non his paraphilia when intoxicated.Although he has denied that his substance\nuse directly influenced his offending behaviour.He appeared ambivalent in\nthis regard, not seeing his use of cannabis as particularly problematic and is\nunrelated to his offending.D.R.W. would benefit from further treatment for sexual\noffending, primarily using a cognitive behavioural and relapse prevention\nmodel.This treatment can be provided either in an incarceral setting or in a\ncommunity setting, such as at CAMH or elsewhere.He has already received some\ntreatment previously through CAMH and from other treatment providers since his\nmost recent arrest.It is unclear to what extent he benefited from the same,\ngiven his rapid return to offending behaviour upon completing his probation and\nhis limited use of treatment since his most recent arrest.I would also recommend that he consider further\ntreatment with sex-drive reducing medication to further reduce his risk for\nre-offence.He reported some limited impact from the treatment received to\ndate, but could possibly benefit from a trial of stronger medication, for\nexample, Provera, Androcur or Lupron.He defines that further psychological\ntreatment and treatment with antidepressant medications are insufficient to\nreduce his fantasies or behaviours.D.R.W. should be encouraged to maintain\nongoing employment as this may help to assist in his rehabilitation and to\nreduce his risk of re-offence.”Dr. Woodside indicates\nthat he would be happy to facilitate further referral to the sexual behaviours\nclinic at CAMH if D.R.W. so desires.He also says he would be happy to\nfacilitate a consultation in the future regarding use of sex-drive reducing\nmedication for this individual.Mr. Khehra advises me today\nthat D.R.W. apparently is prepared to follow through with Dr. Woodside’s\nrecommendations, but to date has not done so.THE POSITION OF THE\nPARTIESPosition of the CrownCrown counsel, Ms.\nCastiglione, seeks the imposition of a reformatory sentence between 12 and 18\nmonths, although she stresses the appropriate custodial sentence should be at\nthe upper end of this range.In addition she submits D.R.W. should be subject\nto a three-year probationary term with strict conditions, including restitution\nfor D.S.Ms. Castiglione argued a conditional sentence is not legally\navailable for the offence of unlawfully in a dwelling house, which is\npunishable by a potential maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment and is an\ninappropriate sentence in respect of the charges of voyeurism and mischief,\nhaving regard to D.R.W.’s record, respecting breach of recognizance and prior\noffence of voyeurism.It is the Crown’s\nposition the court could not be satisfied a custodial sentence served in the\ncommunity would not endanger the safety of the community or would be consistent\nwith the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2.The Crown also seeks\nancillary orders involving DNA and a weapons prohibition for ten years.The\nSOIRA provisions under section 490.011 of the Criminal\nCode do not apply to the offences to which D.R.W.\nentered guilty pleas.The Crown advised D.R.W. will be automatically subject\nto Christopher’s Law in the Province of Ontario as section 162 is a designated\noffence.The Crown relies on\nthe following aggravating circumstances present in this case in advancing their\nposition:1.Previous conviction for voyeurism:The Crown points\nto D.R.W.’s previous conviction in July 211 for voyeurism.2.D.R.W. continues to engage in his voyeuristic behaviour\ndespite treatment.D.R.W. admitted he began engaging in similar voyeuristic\nbehaviour, making 50 to 1,000 videos of unsuspecting women’s cleavage, up skirt\nor buttocks showing their underwear, a month after his probation ended in\nAugust 2013, despite receiving treatment atCAMH.D.R.W.’s conduct was\nobserved in August 2013 by the same security officer, in the same Walmart as\nhis previous conviction, engaging in the same behaviour.3.Number of offences before the court:Although the\nmajority of the offences to which D.R.W. pled guilty occurred before or\nimmediately around the time of his previous conviction, the allegations are far\nmore serious.One of the offences of voyeurism is after he was originally\nsentenced in 2011.That is count 10, unlawfully in a dwelling house.4.Many of the offences involve a serious breach of\ntrust:D.R.W. videotaped his wife’s best friend and his close friend, J.T.,\ncoming out of the shower in the basement of his home by means of a hidden\ncamera.Further, D.R.W. entered his superior’s office, set up a camera on a\ntripod, disrobed, both fully and partially, and then videotaped himself\nmasturbating and ejaculating into her coffee cup, on her desk, and onto the\nmouthpiece of her telephone.He also took photographs of his superior’s and\nanother coworker’s cleavage and buttocks areas and used these for his personal\nsexual arousal.Finally, D.R.W. entered his brother’s bedroom and videotaped\nhimself masturbating and ejaculating on his sister-in-law’s lingerie.5.D.R.W. abruptly stopped the counseling he started\nafter being charged with these offences:Although D.R.W. started counseling\nwith a sex therapist, he stopped his sessions without explanation.He was\nprescribed medication to assist in controlling his sexual urges, yet he adjusted\nthe doses without disclosing this to his psychiatrist.He also stopped his\npsychotherapy sessions with his psychiatrist.D.R.W. maintains he is fine, yet\nadmits he is continuing to view up skirt videos, spy cam videos and pornography\non the Internet on a daily basis.When asked by Dr. Woodside about his\ntreatment at CAMH while on probation, D.R.W. advised he did not practice the\ntechniques, he learned as much as he should have.He rationalized the video\ntaking after his probation ended by telling himself he would not get caught.He admitted he was engaging in voyeuristic behaviour for a few hours every day,\nfive to seven days week.When asked by Dr. Woodside why he thought his\ntreatment had not been effective he indicated he believed he, “could beat it\nwith just willpower, that I was stronger than it”, referring to his voyeuristic\ndisorder.6.Conduct was sophisticated, deliberate and planned:D.R.W.\ntargeted his victims.There were 25 videos of his masturbating and ejaculating\nin his superior’s office.He set up a hidden camera, videotapedhimself\nstanding outside the shower in the basement to make sure the camera was in the\ncorrect position.He had apps on his phone to be able to record activity\nwithout appearing to be recording.7.D.R.W. minimizes the impact his voyeuristic behaviour\nhas on his victims and shows little remorse:D.R.W.’s wife expressed this\nopinion.Dr. Hunchak, a psychiatrist D.R.W. was seeing, noted D.R.W. did not\nseem to be bothered by the sentencing, which was pending, or the fact his wife\nplanned to separate and terminate their marriage once he was sentenced.8.D.R.W. is a daily chronic user of marijuana:D.R.W.\nsmokes two marijuana cigarettes each day, about seven grams a week.He has no\nintention of stopping and continued to use marijuana even after his arrest.9.Dr. Woodside assessed D.R.W.’s risk of recidivism and\nfound D.R.W. as being at moderate risk for sexual recidivism from a purely\nclinical perspective, as well as from an actuarial perspective.10.D.R.W. breached his recognizance of bail prior to his\nsentencing:D.R.W. pled guilty to three counts of fail to comply with his\nrecognizance in August 2015.I was advised that those breaches related to his\nbeing outside of his residence when he was required to be subject to a house\narrest and curfew and he received the equivalent of a 45-day sentence, which he\nwas permitted to serve intermittently.The Crown argues this further\ndemonstrates D.R.W.’s risk of reoffending and why a conditional sentence is not\nappropriate.Ms. Castiglione\nstressed the fact that the imposition of a custodial sentence was necessary to\neffectively denounce the voyeuristic behaviour engaged in by D.R.W..Further,\nany sentence imposed needed to address the sentencing principles of general and\nspecific deterrence.It was clear D.R.W., according to Ms. Castiglione, had\nlearned very little from his first sentence for voyeurism.Position of the\nDefenceDefence counsel, Mr.\nKhehra, submitted I should impose a blended sentence of both a period of\nimprisonment and a conditional sentence.He submits, in addition to the credit\nfor pre-trial custody served by D.R.W., he should be sentenced to a 60 to 90\nday intermittent jail sentence in respect of the unlawfully in a dwelling house\nand a nine months conditional sentence respecting the remaining charges of\nvoyeurism and mischief.Mr. Khehra submits that these sentences should be in\naddition or on top of the credit I allow for pre-trial custody and strict bail\nconditions.Mr. Khehra takes no issue with the length of probation sought by\nthe Crown or any of the terms of probation.He also takes no issue with any of\nthe ancillary orders sought by the Crown.The defence relies\nupon the following mitigating circumstances present in this case for arguing\nthis position:1.D.R.W. has sought treatment and counseling with\nrespect to his sexual paraphilia, voyeurism disorder:D.R.W. sought treatment\nand counseling for his sexual paraphilia prior to his plea of guilty.He\nunderwent an extensive assessment by Dr. Woodside, head of the Sexual\nBehaviours Clinic at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.2.D.R.W. has expressed his remorse and acceptance of\nresponsibility through his guilty plea, as well as his section 726 statement to\nthe court:D.R.W., according to Mr. Khehra, always intended to plead guilty to\nthe charges before the court.He expressed to Dr. Woodside he now finds his\nactions disgusting and has a hard time believing he had done the things he did\nrespecting his superior.3.D.R.W.’s guilty pleas have spared the victims from\nhaving to testify and have saved court expense:The victims of D.R.W.’s crimes\ndid not have to testify at a preliminary inquiry or trial as a result of D.R.W.’s\nguilty pleas.Further, had these matters proceeded to trial they would have\nrequired significant court resources and expenses, which is obviated by D.R.W.’s\nacceptance of responsibility.4.D.R.W. has served 18 days of pre-trial custody, which\nwill receive credit of 27 days on a one point five to one basis, and further he\nserved two and a half months from November 8th, 2015 to January 21st, 2016 on a\ncharge of breach of recognizance, of which he was acquitted on January 21st,\n2016.Mr. Khehra relies upon two decisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal,\nwhich deal with similar circumstances where an accused is facing other charges\nat the same time they are facing charges for which they have been granted bail\nand they are in custody and either the Crown withdraws that second set of\ncharges, or as in D.R.W.’s case, the accused is acquitted of those charges. The\nCourt of Appeal has instructed sentencing judges that the time spent in\npre-trial custody should be taken into account in assessing the appropriate\nsentence to be imposed.Those two cases are R. v.\nTsai, [2005] O.J. No. 2574, as well as R. v.\nReid, 2005 CanLII 14964 (ON CA), [2005] O.J. No. 1790.Ms. Castiglione agrees with Mr. Khehra’s interpretation of\nthose cases.There is some issue, which I will address later,\nrespecting whether D.R.W. should receive any credit for his restrictive bail\nconditions, which have included house arrest pursuant to R. v.\nDownes and R. v. Ijam, both from the Ontario Court of Appeal.5.The defence argues the majority of the charges to\nwhich D.R.W. pled guilty relate to conduct that predated his previous\nconviction for voyeurism:the Crown is unable to prove when the various videos\nand photographic image were taken by D.R.W..D.R.W. advised Dr. Woodside and\nthe probation officer the majority of the charges relate to conduct he engaged\nin prior to his conviction on July 15, 2011.Consequently, D.R.W. should be\nconsidered a first offender with no criminal record for at least five of the\nsix charges he pled guilty to.The defence\nconcedes the paramount sentencing principles in the circumstances of this case\nare denunciation and deterrence.Mr. Khehra also agrees the most significant\naggravating features relate to D.R.W.’s record, his voyeuristic behaviour,\nwhich continued a month after his probation ended, and the breach of trust\naspects involving many of D.R.W.’s victims.Mr. Khehra also concedes that the\naggravating circumstances respecting D.R.W.’s conduct towards J.T., M.K.W. and\nD.S. should be treated as a breach of a trust relationship, which under the Criminal\nCode is an aggravating circumstance and a\nfactor to be taken into account on sentence.THE APPLICABLE\nSENTENCING PRINCIPLES ANDTHE APPROPRIATE\nSENTENCE TO BE IMPOSEDUnder section 718\nof the Criminal Code, the fundamental\npurpose of sentencing is to contribute to respect for the law and the\nmaintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing a just sanction.Any sanction imposed must be the result of a fair and balanced consideration of\nthe need to:(a) Denounce the\nunlawful conduct;(b) Deter the offender, and others, from committing such an\noffence;(c) Separate the offender from society, where necessary;(d) Assist in the rehabilitation of the offender;(e) Provide reparation for the harm done to “victims”, or\nthe community; and(f) Provide a sense of responsibility in the offender,\nwhile acknowledging the harm done to the “victims” and the community.According to\nsection 718.1 of the Criminal Code, the “fundamental principle” of sentencing is that a\nsentence “must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of\nresponsibility of the offender”.Section 718.2\nprovides that a sentence should be increased or decreased to account for any\naggravating and mitigating circumstances.Section\n718.2(a)(iii) provides the statutorily aggravating circumstance of the offender\nbreaching a position of trust in committing the offence, which the Crown and\nthe defence agree is present in this case.Generally the section also requires\nthat a sentence be similar to other sentences imposed on similar offenders in\nsimilar circumstances and that the combined duration of consecutive sentences\nnot be unduly long, and that an offender not be deprived of liberty if less\nrestrictive sanctions may be appropriate, and that all available sanctions\nother than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances be considered.I was provided a\nnumber of cases by the Crown and the defence, which set out some basic\nconsiderations in determining the appropriate sentence in a voyeurism case.Voyeurism offences violate the essential human dignity of the people shown and\nare a serious invasion of their privacy and personal space.In this case, as I\nhave already set out, the impact on the victims was particularly significant.The disclosure by the police to the victims of their being videotaped\nsurreptitiously by D.R.W. was shocking and emotionally overwhelming, causing\nsignificant fear and anxiety in the victims.Sentences across Canada vary\ndepending on the nature of the offences, the accused’s background, the impact\non the victims and they range from suspended sentences with probation to\nconditional sentences followed by probation, to jail sentences followed by\nprobation.Often voyeurism offences are involved with other more serious offences,\nsuch as sexual assault or possession of child pornography.What follows is a\nsampling of the cases provided by counsel.I have not set them all out, but I\nhave set a sample:In R. v. Grice, [2008] O.J. No. 3870 (Ont. C.J., Pugsley J.), the accused\nphotographed his former wife undressing to take a shower in the matrimonial\nhome after they had separated.The accused had no prior record, none of the\nimages were shared, and he spent five days in pre-trial custody.On a guilty\nplea a suspended sentence with 18 months probation was imposed.In R. v. Rocha, [2012] A.J. No. 163 (Alta. Prov. Ct.), the accused was\nemployed as a fueller at an airport.He approached the victim at a luggage\ncarousel, crouched behind her and took an up-skirt photo of her with his cell\nphone.The accused had no record, sought counseling and expressed remorse.The Crown sought a conditional sentence and the defence argued a suspended\nsentence was the appropriate sentence.A suspended sentence and 15 months\nprobation was imposed.R. v. Weinheimer, 2007 ABPC 349 (CanLII), 2007\nABPC 349 (Alta. Prov. Ct.), the\naccused surreptitiously took photographs of 15 men using the urinal at his\nplace of employment. He stored these photographs together with the names,\nbirthdates, addresses, insurance account numbers and notes regarding the\ngenitals of the victims on his computer.The court found that the primary\nsentencing objective was rehabilitation, deterrence and denunciation being\nsecondary objectives, and sentenced the accused to a two year suspended\nsentence with supervised probation.In R. v Dekker, [2014] A.J. No. 288 (Alta. Prov. Ct.), the accused\nsurreptitiously videotaped, at least 80 persons, using public washrooms on four\noccasions, as well as one occasion videotaping individuals using the washroom\nin his own home.A nine-month conditional sentence followed by two years\nprobation was imposed.He was 56, a first offender, remorseful for his conduct\nand was assessed by a psychologist as a low risk to re-offend.See also R.\nv. Muggeridge, [2015] N.J. No.\n80 (Nfld. Prov. Ct.); R. V. Bosomworth, [2015] B.C.J. No. 546 (B.C. Prov. Court.) and R.\nv. J.H.N., 2010 BCPC 155 (CanLII) where suspended\nsentences and probation were imposed for first offenders who were receiving\ncounseling, remorseful and low risk of re-offending.In R. v Brandt, [2013] M.J. No. 2014 (Man. Prov. Ct.), the accused became\nobsessed with a coworker, had sexual fantasies about her.He surreptitiously\nwatched her as she showered and videotaped her twice with his cell phone while\nshe showered.He masturbated and ejaculated in her underwear.He was a first\noffender, had enrolled in sex addiction counseling and was a low risk to\nre-offend.On a guilty plea he received an 18-month conditional sentence.In R. v. Ennis, unreported, January 12th, 2016, Ontario Court of Justice,\nGorewich J.This was not provided to me by counsel; I obtained this.The\naccused pled guilty to two counts of voyeurism.The accused was seeing a\npsychiatrist for counseling, 64 hours at the time of sentencing, and was\nassessed as a low risk to re-offend.He had no criminal record.The offences\ntook place over a prolonged period of time, two and a half years.There were\napproximately 500 victims.Justice Gorewich imposed a 20-month conditional\nsentence and probation for one year with conditions.In R. v. Morton, [2012] O.J. No. 4604 (Ont. C.J., Wright J.), the accused\nsurreptitiously videotaped a tenant undressing and dressing by means of a\nhidden camera.On June 21, 2012, an unreported decision, the sentence obtained\nfrom a certified copy of the information, Justice Wright sentenced Mr. Morton\nto three months in jail with two years probation with terms.In R. v. M.S.A., [2013] A.J. No. 489 (Alta. Prov. Ct.), the accused, on two\noccasions, surreptitiously videotaped his 15-year-old stepdaughter while she\nwas getting dressed in her bedroom.At sentencing the accused was separated from\nhis wife, but was providing half of his income to support his ex-wife and the\nvictim.He was obsessed with pornography and he had sought counseling.There\nwas a joint submission of a three to six month sentence, followed by\nprobation.Defence was seeking that the sentence be conditional.The judge\nsentenced the accused to five months imprisonment and two years probation.In R. V. DaSilva, [2011] O.J. No. 1298 (Ont. C.J. Robertson J.), also a\ndecision that I found, the accused made a sexually explicit video of himself\nand his girlfriend without her knowledge.After the relationship went sour he\nposted the video to his Facebook page and sent 13 friends and family an email\ninviting them to view it.There was a trial, which took ten days.Justice\nRobertson found the voyeurism offence under section 162(4) to be the most\nserious offence.The accused had a criminal record from 1999 for assault\ncausing bodily harm, for which he was sentenced to a short period of jail.Justice Robertson found the Crown had not proven the aggravating circumstance\nthat the video was widely distributed on the Internet and as a result he\nimposed a sentence of five months incarceration on the section 162(4) voyeurism\noffence and two months consecutive respecting the creation of the video some\ntwo months prior, before it was sent.In addition he imposed a concurrent\nsentence for the criminal harassment offence.The accused was also placed on two\nyears probation with terms.In R. v. Berry, B.C.J. No. 306 (B.C.S.C.), the accused surreptitiously\nvideotaped himself sexually touching and digitally penetrating his common-law\nwife’s vagina and anus, without her consent, while she was sleeping or\nunconscious.There were four video recordings made by Mr. Berry.In addition,\nhe videotaped another victim using the bathroom in his sister’s house, which\nvideo shows the victim's genital area.The accused had a dated, unrelated\ncriminal record.He was sentenced to two years less fifty-nine days pre-trial\ncustody on the sexual assault and nine months imprisonment consecutive on the\nvoyeurism charge connected to the sexual assault.With respect to the second\nvoyeurism charge the sentence was two months concurrent to the nine-month\nsentence.In R. v. Aguas, 2015 ONSC 5732 (CanLII), [2015] O.J. No. 4739 (Ont. S.C. Campbell J.), the accused,\na male nurse in an emergency ward, took photographs of a patient who had been\nthrown from a vehicle by her ex-boyfriend.The accused had her disrobe and\nthen took photos with his personal cell phone of her naked breasts and genitals\nand he touched her.The victim believed he was documenting the photos to\nfurther a police investigation.The accused also took a photo of another\npatient’s bare breasts as she slept.He was sentenced to 14 months, less 5\nmonths credit for pre-trial custody and stringent bail conditions and placed on\nthree years probation after his jail sentence.The sentencing judge found a\nbreach of trust and took into account the accused was losing his ability to\ncontinue his profession as a nurse because of his conviction.As can be seen\nfrom the cases I have summarized, the sentences imposed for offences involving\nvoyeurism are determined by the peculiar facts disclosed in each case.None of\nthe cases provided by counsel address the fact situation of an accused who had\nbeen previously convicted of a similar offence, or who had been assessed by a\npsychiatrist as being a moderate risk to re-offend.In fact, in all of the\ncases the psychiatric evidence was that the accused were either at no risk to\nre-offend, or a low risk to re-offend.Clearly the\nparamount sentencing principles are deterrence and denunciation.Rehabilitation is also applicable, but to a lesser extent.Based on the\nassessment of the probation officer who prepared the pre-sentence report and\nDr. Woodside, who conducted the forensic psychiatric evaluation and assessment\nof risk, they found that D.R.W. did not demonstrate great insight into the\nimpact his behaviour had on his victims, and further that he showed very little\nremorse.In addition, D.R.W. commenced videotaping unsuspecting women in\ndepartment stores, malls and other public places within a month after his\nprobation ended from his first conviction in August of 2013.He told Dr.\nWoodside he had taken 1,000 videos from August to November of 2013, but later\nrevised that figure to 50 at a second interview.It is difficult to reconcile\nthese two estimates.D.R.W. told the\nprobation officer and Dr. Woodside he had approximately 14,000 images on his\ncomputer.I am of the view his description of how many images he had collected\nwas an act of bragging and that he was proud of this accomplishment.D.R.W.\nused these surreptitious videos for sexual purposes, as he would view them\nrepeatedly for his own personal sexual arousal.On some occasions he videotaped\nhimself masturbating and ejaculating while watching these videos or looking at\nthese pictures.D.R.W. took\npictures with a video camera and with his cell phone.He had a number of cell\nphones that were seized from his residence.His actions were deliberate and\npremeditated.In some instances he utilized apps on his cell phone to make it\nappear he was talking on the cell phone, but in reality he was videotaping.He\nadvised he was taking four-hour lunches, seven days a week, in order to engage\nin videotaping or taking pictures of the cleavage of women’s breasts or women’s\nbuttocks and their exposed panties.These were expeditions where he\ndeliberately looked for women to videotape and photograph.When he was asked\nby Dr.Woodside where he\nwent, he indicated he went wherever women were.D.R.W. set up a\nhidden camera in his basement to take videos of his wife’s best friend dressing\nand undressing and taking a shower, which in my view demonstrates a level of\nplanning and sophistication that separates his conduct from many, if not all,\nof the cases counsel have provided.He took a video of himself masturbating\nwhile watching the video he took of his wife’s best friend.He videotaped\nhimself masturbating and ejaculating in his superior's office into her coffee\ncup, onto the receiver of her phone and on her desk.He gained access to her\noffice after hours by using a key.He videotaped his superior and another coworker\nin his office showing their cleavage and their buttocks.Finally, D.R.W.’s\nbrother provided a house key to allow D.R.W. to check on his brother’s house\nwhen the brother was away.D.R.W. used that key to gain access to his\nbrother's house, go to the master bedroom and then videotaped himself going\nthrough his sister-in-law’s lingerie drawer and masturbating and ejaculating\nonto the sister-in-law’s undergarments.The defence\nagrees the above conduct has the added aggravating circumstance of D.R.W.\nbreaching the trust given by his brother in providing a key to check on his\nhouse,D.S. either\nproviding a key to her office to D.R.W., or D.R.W. obtaining a key to her\noffice, and J.T. believing that she could take a shower in privacy, by herself,\nwithout being videotaped or observed.What is\nparticularly concerning about D.R.W., in my view, is his lack of insight into\nhis psychiatric disorder, or the impact it has had on his victims.D.R.W.\ncontinued to view videos on the Internet involving “spy cams”, women being\nvideotaped without their consent or awareness, even after his first conviction,\nthroughout his probation and after he was finished his probation, and even\nafter he pled guilty to the six charges before me.Mr. Khehra says\nhis client is now prepared to agree to chemical castration after reading Dr.\nWoodside’s report.I find this to be a little too coincidental with the fact D.R.W.\nis about to be sentenced today.It lacks sincerity, given his failure to\nproperly and diligently address his voyeurism disorder.When one adds Dr.\nWoodside’s assessment that D.R.W. is a moderate risk for sexual recidivism\nthere is, in my view, a very real concern for the safety of the community as it\nrelates to D.R.W..D.R.W., through\nMr. Khehra, wants me to impose an intermittent sentence of 60 to 90 days so he\ncan work; yet he is currently unemployed.He has been out of custody since\nJanuary 21st, 2016, when he was acquitted of the breach of recognizance charge,\nbut he has taken no steps to attempt to even secure any kind of employment to\ncome to court today with a letter indicating he is in fact working.In my view,\nan intermittent sentence is inappropriate, having regard to this, as well given\nthe seriousness of the conduct he has engaged in.In my opinion an\nintermittent sentence would not adequately address deterrence, both specific\nand general, as well as denunciation of D.R.W.’s conduct.I have been asked\nto impose a conditional sentence.Mr. Khehra provided to me, and I am well\nfamiliar with the decision of R. v. Proulx 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61 (S.C.C.).There have been many changes\nto the conditional sentence regime under section 742.1 of the Criminal\nCode since it first came into being.In fact\nthere have been so many changes under the previous government that it is\ndifficult to know where a particular case might fall or whether it is\napplicable or not applicable, just having regard to the different criteria that\nhas now been set out.As to the\nappropriateness of a conditional sentence I accept that a period of\nincarceration in this case is warranted.I think even Mr. Khehra accepts that\nand that what is warranted is less than two years, which is one of the first\ncriteria set out in section 742.1.There are no minimum sentences for any of the\noffences that D.R.W. has pled guilty to and that I have found him guilty and\nconvicted him in respect of.I also agree that\nno other statutory prohibitions exist precluding consideration of a conditional\nsentence, but as a condition precedent to determining if an offender should be\npermitted to serve their sentence in the community, I must be satisfied that the\nsafety of the community would not be in danger by the offender serving his\nsentence in the community.In considering risk I am directed to look at both\nthe risk of re-offending and the gravity of the damage that would ensue from\nthe further offence.D.R.W. is not a\nlow risk to re-offend.There was an extensive assessment done by Dr. Woodside\nand the conclusion of that assessment was that D.R.W. is a moderate risk to\nre-offend, particularly as it relates to his voyeuristic disorder.I have\nalready expressed my concerns surrounding D.R.W.’s conduct, both during his\nprobation order from July 15th, 2011 until July 15th, 2013, while he was still\nlooking at the type of videos that he, himself, had been taking, his admission\nto Dr. Woodside that his feelings and his urges six months before the end of\nhis probation overpowered him and became more intense, to the point where only\na month after his probation ended he was out and about, as he had been during\nhis employment at T[...] and P[…].Even after he received counseling and treatment at CAMH\nduring his probation and sex addiction counseling from Mr. Lavergne from April\ntill August of 2014, he continued to look at up skirt videos and spy cam\nvideos.He did not stop.He thought this was okay because he was not taking\nthe videos.It is the very thing that he has been diagnosed with.Mr. Lavergne\nindicates in his correspondence with the probation officer that D.R.W. needs\nintensive therapy and treatment.Dr. Woodside indicates the same thing.Even\nafter he pled guilty before me in February of 2015 he admitted to Dr. Woodside\nthat he was still viewing up skirt videos and spy cam videos and pornography on\nthe Internet.While these things may not be against the law, for someone with D.R.W.’s\nparaphilia disorder, namely voyeuristic disorder, and someone who maintains\nthat smoking marijuana has no impact on his commission of the offences before\nthe court, Dr. Woodside dispelled any misunderstanding with respect to that\nattitude and that belief, as did Dr. Hunchak, who believed the reason D.R.W. was not concerned about his imminent divorce or the\nsentencing that was about to take place, this would have been back in May of\n2015, is because of his use of cannabis on a regular basis.That is one of the\nreasons why Dr. Woodside’s assessment is that D.R.W. is a moderate risk of\nsexual recidivism.In my view those risks speak very strongly against a\nconditional sentence being an appropriate sentence.I think the final\nconsideration for me is the fact that while D.R.W. was on bail, after his pleas\nof guilty, pending his sentence, and after being told by me on the day that he\npled guilty, that the period of time between when his sentence occurred and\nwhile he was out on the bail, and the steps that he was taking, would all be\nextremely important in determining the nature of the sentence that would be\nimposed.He breached his bail.He breached it at least three times, because\nthat is what he pled guilty to and received an intermittent sentence.Part of a conditional\nsentence is being on house arrest.In my view, if D.R.W. was unable to abide\nby house arrest while he was on bail, I do not see how I can justify releasing\nhim on a conditional sentence.I recognize that a conditional sentence does in\nmany instances, and can in may instances, address the principles of deterrence\nand denunciation, even in serious criminal charges, but D.R.W.’s conduct, the\nassessment of his risk, all point to putting the community at risk and that the\nsafety of the community, in my view, is not protected.Further, as I have\nalready indicated, the paramount principles of sentencing in this case are\ndeterrence, both specific and general, as well as denunciation; there are few\nmitigating circumstances that I can point to.Many of the mitigating\ncircumstances pointed to by Mr. Khehra are refuted by the Crown, in her\nsubmission they are aggravating.There is very little remorse shown, there is\nvery little insight into the impact that the actions and behaviour of D.R.W.\nhad on the victims in these matters.Those are normally mitigating\ncircumstances because an accused shows their remorse through their guilty plea,\nbut in my view, much of D.R.W.’s continued viewing of this type of material,\nknowing that he has a serious psychiatric disorder, because that certainly\nwould have been conveyed to him during the period of time that he was seeing\nMr. Lavergne, as well as Dr. Hunchak, I find it difficult to accept that those\nare mitigating circumstances in this case.There are numerous\naggravating factors.Perhaps the only thing that can be said that stands in D.R.W.’s\nfavour is that he did not publish any of the videos that he took, because I can\ntell you, based on the facts of this case and the circumstances of this case,\nif that had existed, and I know the police were looking for it, they didn't\nfind it, if it had existed D.R.W. potentially would have been looking at a\npenitentiary sentence.I want him to hear that.That is how serious I view\nthese charges.As I have indicated, D.R.W.\ndoes not appear to have gained a whole lot of insight into his offending\nbehaviour and in my view a conditional sentence would fall far short of what D.R.W.\nrequires.There needs to be a sentence that promotes a sense of responsibility\nin D.R.W. and other offenders who engage in similar conduct.That is what is\nboth referred to as the specific and general deterrence.There needs to be an\nacknowledgement of the harm done to the victims and to the community and in my\nview these are sentencing principles that are not achievable in the case of D.R.W.\nin the context of a conditional sentence.In my view he needs a sentence,\nparticularly as it relates to specific deterrence, that is going to get his\nattention.As I have indicated as\nwell, there is an importance with respect to general deterrence, because in my\nview this plays an enhanced role in the facts of this case.Everyone has a\ncell phone today.Everyone has a smart phone.Everyone has a phone that can take\npictures.I can recall a number of years ago, not so long ago, when I got a\nnew phone and I asked if I could have a phone that did not take pictures\nbecause I did not need that feature.I thought it might be cheaper.Apparently they do not make phones that do not take pictures.Therefore,\ngiven the nature of smart phones today, this increases the need for sending a\nmessage to the general public that taking pictures of individuals in\ncompromising positions, for example, women who might be wearing a top that is\nloose and if they bend over, shows cleavage.It is inappropriate to take\nphotographs of that.It is inappropriate to take pictures of a man or a woman\nbending over and exposing their buttocks because the pants they are wearing are\ntoo tight or too low in the hip.That is what D.R.W. did and apparently that\nis what a lot of other people do, because it appears the Internet is filled\nwith this type of pornography.Therefore, in my view, this is one of those\ncases where I think general deterrence may actually play an enhanced and\nmeaningful role in sentencing.I believe that\nsatisfying the principle of general deterrence when it plays an enhanced role\nis difficult within the context of a conditional sentence.The significant\ndenunciatory effect of jail, in my view, is needed in expressing that message.So it is my conclusion that a conditional sentence is not an appropriate\ndisposition in D.R.W.’s case, it would fail to strike the right balance in\nemphasizing the paramount principles and it would fail to place the right\nweight on denunciation and specific deterrence to D.R.W., and very importantly\nin this case, it fails to address adequately general deterrence.And so, in my\nview, a sentence of a period of incarceration to be served in a jail is the\nappropriate sentence.There are many words\nwhich come to mind to describe D.R.W.’s conduct, despicable, demeaning, vile,\nappalling, horrendous, horrific, inexcusable, unforgiveable.I know that there\nare many others.A conditional sentence does not express the denunciation\nnecessary in this case, having regard to those descriptions; only real jail can\ndo that.As I have indicated,\nin my view, a conditional sentence will not ensure the safety of the community\nand I think what is most telling, despite knowing that the Crown was seeking a\nsignificant upper reformatory jail sentence, D.R.W. discontinued his treatment,\ncontinued throughout to view the kind of offending videos he is charged with\ncreating and breached his recognizance as it related to a condition of his\nhouse arrest.I should address just\nbriefly stringent bail conditions and the decision in R. v.\nDownes, 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA), [2006] O.J. No. 555 OCA, as well as R. v.\nIjam. 2007 ONCA 597 (CanLII), which also deals with\nstringent bail conditions.D.R.W. was on bail for a long period of time and\ndid comply, apparently, with those conditions, but in August of 2015 he was\ncharged with at least three counts, I don't have the information from that proceeding\nto which he pled guilty, but at least three counts of breach of recognizance\nthat related to his being outside his residence in contravention of the house\narrest.That was probably the most important condition of his bail.I am prepared to give credit\nwith respect to the two and a half months that he spent in custody when he was\ncharged with a second breach of recognizance and again, I don't know if it was\none offence or more than one offence for which he was acquitted after a trial\non January 21st, 2016.In my view there is no formula, and that is made very,\nvery clear in respect of both R. v. Downes, as well as R. v. Ijam, but taking into account the pre-trial custody that he has\nserved, the stringent bails that he was on, I am prepared to give a total\ncredit of six months.I am taking into account that he, for the most part,\nappeared to comply with those stringent bail conditions and it did affect his\nliberty.I know the things that Justice Rosenberg indicates in the Downes decision that should be taken into account in assessing\nwhether or not to assess any credit.Therefore, in effect,\nI am going to be giving him a little more than a month of pre-trial credit in\nrespect of that.So the total pre-trial credit that I am giving for both the pre-trial\ncustody, as well as stringent bail conditions, is six months and in my view the\nappropriate sentence in this case, having regard to all of the circumstances,\nconsidering both mitigating and aggravating factors, the appropriate sentence\nprior to giving credit for pre-trial custody and stringent bail conditions is a\nsentence of imprisonment for 18 months.That means there will be 12 months remaining.In addition, D.R.W.\nwill be subject to a section 110 order for 10 years.After D.R.W.’s release\nfrom custody he will be placed on probation for three years.Statutory\nconditions will apply, namely:- you will keep the peace and be of good behaviour;- appear before the court when required to do so;- notify the court or probation officer in advance of any\nchange of name or address;- promptly notify the court or probation officer of any change\nin employment or occupation.In addition, you will:- report to a probation officer in person within five\nworking days of your release from custody and thereafter at all times and\nplaces as directed by the probation officer, or any person authorized by the\nprobation officer to assist in your supervision;- cooperate with your probation officer;- sign any releases necessary to permit the probation\nofficer to monitor your compliance; and- you must provide proof of compliance with any condition\nof this order to your probation officer on request;- you will live at a place approved of by the probation\nofficer and not change that address without obtaining the consent of the\nprobation officer in advance;- you are not to contact or communicate in any way,\ndirectly or indirectly by any physical, electronic or other means with the\nfollowing named persons:D.S., L.T., J.T., M.K.W. and M.K..There are no\nexceptions;- you are not to be within 100 metres of any place where\nyou know any of these persons named live, work, go to school, frequent, or any\nplace you know those persons to be.Again, no exceptions.I am not going to make\na weapons prohibition under the probation order, I do not see the need.I am going to make a\nterm that you are not to possess or consume any unlawful drugs or substances,\nrefer to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, except with a valid prescription in your name or those\nover the counter.It is my view, D.R.W.\nthat the comments by Dr. Hunchak, as well as Dr. Woodside clearly indicate that\nyour use of marijuana had a disinhibiting impact on you with respect to the\nbehaviours that you have engaged in:- you are to attend and actively participate in all\nassessment counseling or rehabilitative programs as directed by the probation\nofficer, complete them to the satisfaction of the probation officer, for\nsubstance abuse, psychiatric/psychological issues, sexual offences, or any\nother reason as recommended by your probation officer;- you shall sign any release of information forms as will\nenable your probation officer to monitor your attendance and completion of any\nassessments, counseling or rehabilitative programs as directed; and- you shall provide proof of your attendance and\ncompletions of any assessments, counseling or rehabilitative programs as\ndirected;- you are not to possess or use any device, electronic or\notherwise, that is designed for or capable of making or capturing visual\nrecordings, including a photograph, film or video recording, included, but not\nlimited to cameras, camcorders, video recorders, or camera equipped cellular\ntelephones or BlackBerrys; and- you shall not possess or use any computer or any other\ndevice that has Internet access, except with the advance written permission of\nyour probation officer, as required for purposes of your work.Those are the\nonly two exceptions.THE COURT:Did you want a DNA order?MS. CASTIGLIONE:Yes, Your Honour.THE COURT:I think\nthese are secondary, aren’t they, offences?MS. CASTIGLIONE:Secondary?THE COURT:Secondary,\nyes.I will exercise my\ndiscretion and order that a DNA sample be taken, to be included in the DNA\ndatabase.D.R.W., I want you to\nunderstand if you engage in this kind of behaviour again in the future and are\nfound out by police and are charged, and you are found guilty of any of these\ntypes of offences, the sentences that you will be facing will very likely be\npenitentiary sentences.I also want to\nindicate to you, sir, if it did not already occur to you, it was certainly\nsomething that occurred to me, is that your behaviour had the beginnings of a\nvery famous criminal in southeastern Ontario, and you shake your head at me,\nsir, but the kind of breaking into houses, using the key to get into your\nbrother’s home, going into your sister-in-law’s pantie drawer and lingerie\ndrawer and doing what you did and videotaping is exactly what that individual\ndid, and that’s where it started.That should say something to you, you need\nto curb these urges, you need to get them under control.Mr. Khehra, I would\nlike the psychiatric report of Dr. Woodside to go to the probation officer, is\nthat on consent?MR. KHEHRA:That’s on\nconsent, Your Honour.THE COURT:All right,\nthank you.So, Madam Clerk, I have it in several places, so I think you have\nan original as an exhibit, you can photocopy that, perhaps, and attach it with\nthe probation order, thank you.Anything further on D.R.W.’s matter?MS. CASTIGLIONE:Just\none thing, Your Honour, two things actually, just in terms of the probation\nterms, they are the standard of reside at an address approved by the probation\nofficer.THE COURT:I put that\nin.MS. CASTIGLIONE:Yes,\nthank you.Your Honour, as well, has Your Honour considered the restitution\norder?THE COURT:Oh, I\napologize.It will be a stand-alone restitution that was agreed to by Mr.\nKhehra.What is the total amount, please?MS. CASTIGLIONE:Six\nthousand one hundred and forty dollars, Your Honour.THE COURT:And it is\nmade payable in favour of D.S....MS. CASTIGLIONE:D.S.,\nyes.THE COURT:...D.S..All right.What I will indicate to my understanding to D.S., and she can get\nfurther advice from a lawyer, but my order, once it is signed and once you get\na certified copy, it can be filed in civil court to get a judgment against D.R.W.\nfor repayment of those monies.There are ways that a civil lawyer can assist\nyou in obtaining that restitution.My hope for all of the\nvictims in this matter is that either through counseling or through friends and\nfamily, that they can overcome the impact that they have felt and continue to\nfeel as a result of D.R.W.’s conduct.MS. CASTIGLIONE:There is also the forfeiture order the Crown has requested.The forfeiture\norder, Your Honour.Forfeiture order.THE COURT:Yes,\nabsolutely.Every hard drive, every SIM card, everything seized by the police,\nI understand Mr. Khehra indicated previously to me that he had no difficulty in\nhaving a forfeiture order made in respect of all of those items.MR. KHEHRA:Yes, I\ntake no issue and my friend has put an appendix, which coincides with what I\nrecall seeing on the....THE COURT:I am sure\nit coincides with what is in the agreed statement of facts.MR. KHEHRA:Correct.MS. CASTIGLIONE:And\nthere is, yes, there is some that have been printed and added on, so I’ve shown\nto my friend, that being items that were seized during the search warrant.THE COURT:I have no\ndifficulty signing that.MR. KHEHRA:Madam\nClerk, can you confirm the remaining counts, whether they were withdrawn on the\nlast occasion?CLERK OF THE COURT:Nothing has been withdrawn.MR. KHEHRA:Okay,\nso....THE COURT:No, I\nthink all the other charges are outstanding, and so all remaining charges\nagainst D.R.W., Ms. Castiglione, are withdrawn...MS. CASTIGLIONE:Yes,\nYour Honour.THE COURT:...at the\nrequest of the Crown.Thank you.CLERK OF THE COURT:And\nthe victim fine surcharge?THE COURT:This is - there\nare six charges, it will be a $200 victim surcharge in respect of each charge.D.R.W., I know you are going to be in custody for a while, so I am going to\ngive you 18 months to pay those victim surcharges, sir.D.R.W.:Is that after\nI am released?THE COURT:I’m sorry?D.R.W.:Is that after\nI am released?THE COURT:No, it is 18\nmonths from today.That is why I am giving you 18 months.D.R.W.:Yeah.THE COURT:So it will\nbe – you can apply for an extension of time to pay those, but what I say to\neverybody, I do not believe anybody should go to jail for the non-payment of\nfines, but if you show me good faith, that you are making some payments, you\nhave a good explanation for why you cannot pay the full amount in the time that\nI am giving you, I guarantee you will get an extension.If you thumb your nose\nat those fines you probably will not get an extension, okay?You may have a\ngood reason though, you may not have found work, you may not have – you may not\nbe able to pay them, so in those circumstances you will explain to me why, but\nI do view that very seriously.I do not believe people should go to jail for\nthe non-payment of fines, but if people do not show any sense of wanting to take\nresponsibility for what they owe, that says something, right?Just demonstrate\nsome good faith and if you do that then you will get the same back from me.**********FORM 2CERTIFICATE OF TRANSCRIPT (SUBSECTION 5(2))Evidence ActI,\nCarol P.

LambertDate: 19940926Docket: 1993No.173The judgment of the court was delivered bySTEELE J.A.:—The appellant was sentenced to four years' impris­onment on\nconviction for sexual assault. Pursuant to s. 741.2 of the Criminal Code of\nCanada, the sentencing judge ordered that the appellant serve one-half of the sentence\nbefore eligibility for full parole. The appellant appeals that order on the\nground that s. 741.2 is a punishment that was not law at the date of the\noffence and as he has a right to the lesser punishment where the punishment for\nthe offence has been varied between commission and sentence (s. 11(i) of the Canadian\nCharter of Rights and Freedoms), the s. 741.2 order must be set aside.BackgroundThe appellant was charged with the offence of\nsexual assault contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code arising out\nof an incident in early August of 1989. On June 25, 1993, the appellant\nappeared before a judge of the Trial Division of the Supreme Court at the City\nof Corner Brook and pleaded guilty to the offence. The trial judge imposed a\nsentence of imprisonment of four years adding: \"I also make an order under\ns. 741.2 of the Code that the accused not be admitted to parole until at\nleast one-half of his four year sentence has been served.\" In addition,\nthe trial judge imposed a lifetime ban on weapons and explosives pursuant to s.\n100(l) of the Code and a $25 victim surcharge fine. This appeal is only\nfrom the order made pursuant to s. 741.2 of the Code.Section 741.2 of the Code reads as\nfollows:741.2 Notwithstanding subsection 120(1) of\nthe Corrections and Condi­tional Release Act, where an offender is\nsentenced, after the coming into force of this section, to a term of\nimprisonment of two years or more on conviction for one or more offences set\nout in Schedules 1 and 11 to that Act that were prosecuted by way of\nindictment, the court may, if satisfied, having regard to the circumstances of\nthe commitment of the offences and the character and circumstances of the\noffender, that the expression of society's denunciation of the offences or the\nobjective of specific or general deterrence so requires, order that the portion\nof the sentence that must be served before the offender may be released on full\nparole is one half of the sentence or ten years, whichever is less.Section 11(i) of the Canadian Charter of\nRights and Freedoms states:11. Any person charged with an offence has\nthe right(i) if found guilty of the offence and if\nthe punishment for the offence has been varied between the time of commission\nand the time of sentencing, to the benefit of the lesser punishment.For purposes of this appeal the following dates\nare relevant: Offence committed August 3, 198;Section 741.2 of the Code proclaimed November\n1, 1992; Appellant sentenced June 25, 1993.Counsel for the appellant referred to s. 11(i)\nof the Charter and pointed out that s. 741.2 of the Code was not law in\nAugust of 1989, when the offence was committed. He stressed that the appellant\nwas sentenced June 25, 1993, but in the meantime, November 1, 1992, s. 741.2\nhad been proclaimed. Counsel maintains that the punishment for the offence was\nvaried (November l, 1992) between the time of the commission of the offence\n(August 3, 1989) and the time of sentencing (June 25, 1993). He asks that the\norder under s. 741.2 be set aside pursuant to s. Mi) of the Charter, entitling\nthe appellant to the benefit of the lesser punishment existing at the date the\noffence was committed.Crown counsel submits that the clear intent of\ns. 741.2 is that the section apply to all of the \"scheduled\" offences\nif the sentence imposed is subsequent to the date that the section was\nproclaimed in force. He contends that the date of the commission of the offence\nis irrelevant. Crown counsel's argument is that s. 741.2 clearly states that\nthe section applies to \"an offender [who] is sentenced after the\ncoming into force of this section\" and that the appellant was sentenced\nwell after proclamation date.Crown counsel also points out that s. 741.2\nrefers to offences set out in Schs. I and II to the Corrections and\nConditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20, including:3. …(a) Rape (s. 144)(b) Attempt to Commit Rape (s. 145)(c) Indecent Assault on a Female (s. 149)(d) Indecent Assault on a Male (s. 156)(e) Common Assault (s. 245)(f) Assault with Intent (s. 246)He argues that all these offences were repealed\nprior to Novem­ber 1, 1992 (date of proclamation), and therefore could not\npossibly have been committed after the date of the proclamation of s. 741.2. He\nsays this fact clearly reveals Parliament's intent that s. 741.2 apply to all\noffences as long as the sentencing is after proclamation of the section. His\npoint is that Parliament expressed the clear intention that s. 741.2 have a\nretrospective effect.Crown counsel acknowledges that even if\nParliament clearly expressed its intent that s. 741.2 have retrospective\napplication to offences committed prior to the section coming into force, it is\nnevertheless subject to the Charter.In his factum, Crown counsel submits that s. 11(i)\nshould not be interpreted so as to apply to every change in parole eligibility ...\nthat the setting of a parole eligibility period is not part of the punishment\nimposed for the offence but part of the decision as to what portion of the\nsentence will be served in the penitentiary ... that being released on parole\ndoes not reduce the sentence ... and that a person granted parole is still\nserving the sentence that was imposed. He points out that the difference lies\nin the manner in which the sentence is to be served, not in the length of the\nsentence. He comes to the conclusion that the effect of s. 741.2 is not to\nincrease the \"punishment\" but rather that it potentially affects\nthe manner in which the \"punishment\" is served. He says that\nthe punishment or sentence imposed here may have been altered or varied but it\nwas not increased.The thrust of Crown counsel's submission is\nsimply that s. 741.2 of the Code permits a judge to order that an\naccused serve one-half of his sentence before eligibility for full parole,\nwhich is not an order increasing or imposing greater punishment. It is merely\nan order that directs the manner in which the sentence, already imposed by the\ntrial judge, must be carried out. It is authority or jurisdiction once\nexercised by the Parole Board.In his factum, Crown counsel states the issue in\nthis case as follows:The issue is to determine whether or not\nthe application of s. 741.2 to an offence committed prior to the proclamation of\ns. 741.2 results in the \"punishment\" which is imposed having\nbeen increased.Section 674 of the Code lists various\ndeclarations and orders that are regarded as included in a\n\"sentence\". No mention is made of an order under s. 741.2. Section\n673 is not intended to be the definitive description of the composition of a\nsentence. Crown counsel's contention is that an order pursuant to s. 741.2 is\nan order made subsequent to sentence.On reading Crown counsel's factum, it is\napparent that the term \"sentence\" is frequently used synonymously\nwith the term \"pun­ishment\". Knowledge of the Criminal Code, criminal\ncase and legal literature make it apparent that the term \"sentence\"\nand \"punishment\" are often equivalent terms. The sentence imposed\nfollowing conviction is the punishment for the offence. On reflec­tion, it\nseems that the interplay of these two words has contrib­uted to some of the\nmisunderstanding.The definition of the terms \"sentence\"\nand \"punishment\" appearing in Black's Law Dictionary, revised, 4th ed.,\nare very similar:SentenceThe judgment formally pronounced by the\ncourt ... after conviction in a criminal prosecution, awarding the punishment\nto be inflicted;Punishment(In Criminal Law) any pain, penalty ... or\nconfinement inflicted ... by the authority of the law and the judgment and\nsentence of a court, for some crime ...Black's legal dictionary defines\n\"sentence\" and \"punishment\" in essentially equivalent\nterms.Webster's New World Dictionary, 3rd College ed.,\nhas three definitions for \"punishment\":(1) A punishing or being punished.(2) A penalty imposed on an offender for a\ncrime or wrongdoing.(3) Harsh or injurious treatment.The Random House Abridged Dictionary, 2nd ed.,\nhas a fourth meaning, though similar to No. 3 in Webster's: \"Severe handling\nor treatment.\"The reference to \"sentence\" in the\nCanadian Criminal Code usually refers to the formal sentence pronounced\nby the sentenc­ing judge following conviction for an offence. In the following\nphraseology found in s. 741.2, \"... order that the portion of the sentence\nthat must be served before the offender may be released on full parole is\none-half of the sentence ...\", the term \"sentence\" is\nclearly a reference to the formal sentence of the court.Section 741.2 uses the term \"sentence\"\nwithout any reference to \"punishment\". In s. Mi) of the Charter,\nhowever, Parliament selected the term \"punishment\" that appears in\nthe phrases \"punishment for the offence\" and \"benefit of\nthe lesser punishment\". I can only assume that in drafting s. 11(i)\nof the Charter, the term punishment was intentionally chosen.As I construe s. 11(i) of the Charter,\n\"punishment\" means or includes the formal sentence of the court\n(which is the punishment inflicted for the commission of the offence), but in\naddition, also means or includes any other \"severe handling\" or\n\"harsh or injurious treatment\". The term \"punishment\"\nappearing in s. 11(i) of the Charter is not confined to the narrow legal\ndefinition that corresponds exclusively to the formal sentence of the court.\nPunishment may also encompass any coercive or punitive treatment likely to\ndiscourage or deter an accused (and sometimes others) from a repetition of\ncriminal activity.The framers of the Canadian Charter of Rights\nand Freedoms knew or are presumed to have known that the Canadian Criminal\nCode authorizes a sentencing judge, in addition to imposing imprisonment or\na fine, or both, to grant various orders or declarations that may qualify as a\nfurther punishment. Such orders may or may not be considered part of the formal\nsentence of the court, but they may comprise an integral part of the punishment\nlevied by the sentencing judge. Section 199(3) \"forfei­ture\"; s.\n100(1) or (2) \"firearms prohibition\"; s.259(1) or (2) \"driving\nprohibition\"; s. 725 \"restitution to victim\", and s. 737(1)\n\"probation orders\", and the like, all are examples of orders made at\nthe time of sentencing that have the potential to be additional punishment. Whether\nsuch orders are or are not part of the formal sentence or deemed to be\n\"punishment\" within the antici­pation of s. 11(i) of the Charter is\nanother matter and one that will not be considered here. The only observation\nto be made is that many of the orders or declarations similar to those above\nare ancillary or secondary to the primary penalty of imprisonment or a fine. In\nour case, the order under s. 741.2 has the potential or implicit consequence of\nprolonging the period of incarceration and is, therefore, in a very real sense\nso closely coupled or linked to the primary penalty as to be a component of the\npunishment itself.Choice of the term \"punishment\" rather\nthan \"sentence\" in s. Mi) of the Charter is significant. The Charter\nwas not written in a diction intended exclusively for the eyes of the legal profession\nand the judiciary, and I suspect the word \"punishment\" was adopted as\nit is less formal, broadly understood and capable of a generous and\nfar-reaching interpretation.It is against this background, therefore, that\nthe position taken by Crown counsel must be assessed.I repeat, Crown counsel's position is that an\norder under s. 741.2 is merely the fixing of the parole eligibility period and\nis not part of the punishment or sentence imposed for the offence; it is a\ndecision as to what portion of the sentence may likely be served in the\npenitentiary. He argues that in our case the sentence was four years'\nimprisonment and that that sentence is not increased by (subsequently) ordering\nthat the appellant serve one-half of the sentence before he is eligible for\nfull parole. In other words, a person granted parole is still serving the same\nsentence, subject of course to various conditions. Crown counsel emphasizes the\npoint that the difference lies in the manner in which the sentence is to\nbe served, not in the term of the sentence. I reiterate Crown counsel's\nposition that the effect of s. 741.2 is not to increase the punishment but\nrather it only \"potentially\" affects the way in which the punishment\nis served, and that an order under s. 741.2 of the Code is not part of\nthe formal sentence. Crown counsel's conclusion is that the sentence not having\nbeen varied or altered (between the time of commission of the offence and the\ntime of sentencing), the Charter right to the benefit of the lesser\n\"punishment\" is not applicable.Strictly speaking, the Crown may well be correct\nin saying that an order under s. 741.2 affects the manner in which a sentence\nwill be served, without altering or causing a variation in the length of the\nterm of the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge. That conclusion, however,\nis not determinative of the real question. Juggling the words punishment and\nsentence tends only to cause puzzlement.Scrutiny must be directed to the expression\n\"punishment\" in s. 11(i) of the Charter. If the consequence of the\norder made under s. 741.2 by the sentencing judge in this case is the mandating\nof \"punishment\", and if that punishment (for the offence) constitutes\na variation in the \"punishment\", that occurred between the time of\nthe commission of the offence and the sentencing of the appellant, the\nappellant is entitled to the benefit of the lesser punishment.I have no doubt that postponing the eligibility\ndate for full parole, thereby creating a veiled warning and risk of a longer\nperiod of incarceration, on any reasonable interpretation is an additional\nprice or disadvantage for a prisoner. It is obviously an extra burden to be\nendured. Unquestionably, the s. 741.2 order adversely affected the appellant.\nIt is true that the four-year \"sentence\" remains the same, but the\norder giving rise to a potentially longer period of imprisonment, or at least\nto an extended span of strict supervision and control, means an escala­tion of\nthe sanction or punishment for the offence. The variation in the\n\"manner\" in which the sentence is to be served clearly entails a more\n\"severe treatment\".Although the intention of Parliament is clear\nthat s. 741.2 applies to all offenders where the offender is sentenced after\nthe coming into force of the section, Charter s. 11(i) grants to any person\ncharged with an offence the benefit of the lesser punishment if the punishment\nfor the offence has been varied between the time of its commission and the time\nof sentencing. The offence was committed August 3, 1989. The appellant was\nsentenced July 25, 1993, the section having been proclaimed previously on\nNovember l, 1992. The order made under s. 741.2 constituted a greater\npunishment (as opposed to a lesser punishment in the absence of the s. 741.2\norder) and is, therefore, a breach or a denial of the appellant's Charter right\nto the benefit of the lesser punishment. On this basis the order made by the\nsentencing judge under s. 741.2 of the Code has no validity.In arriving at this result, I am encouraged by\ndecisions of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Steel (to my knowledge\nnot yet reported), No. C. 14365, October 26, 1993 [summarized 21 W.C.B. (2d)\n325], and the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Boone (to my knowledge\nnot reported), Suit No. AR 93/30/01223, dated Septem­ber 13, 1993 [since\nreported 51 W.A.C. 110, 88 Man. R. (2d) 110, 20 W.C.B. (2d) 588], and R. v.\nC. (T.J.) (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 181, 18 C.R.R. 340, 51 W.A.C. 183. In Steel,\nthe Court of Appeal for Ontario in giving an oral judgment stated:Moreover, the application of s.741.2 was\nimproper as the punishment provided therein and imposed here was greater than\nthat to which the accused was liable at the time of the commission of the\ncrime.The Ontario Court of Appeal expressed the view\nthat s. 741.2 deals with an aspect of sentencing and that it would have been\npreferable had Parliament amended s. 673 expressly providing that\n\"sentencing\" include an order under s. 741.2. That comment was made\nbecause the court felt it had a duty on an appeal under s. 675(1)(b) to review\nan order under s. 741.2.In R. v. C. (T.J.), commencing at p. 186,\nHelper J.A. of the Manitoba Court of Appeal commented:Crown counsel concedes that the sentencing\njudge had no authority to apply s. 741.2 of the Code.\nSection 11(i) of the Canadian\nCharter of Rights and Freedoms (the Charter) states\nthat an accused is entitled to the benefit of a lesser punishment if the\npunishment for an offence has been varied between the time of its commission\nand the time of sentencing. Section 741.2 of the Code was proclaimed\nafter the commission of the offences for which the appellant stands convicted.In R. v. Henderson (1992), 13 C.R.R. (2d) 238, 18 W.C.B. (2d) 530, Judge Zabel of the\nOntario Provincial Court, relying on s. 11(i) of the Charter, gave reasons for\nnot imposing an order under s. 741.2 of the Code.Finally, Crown counsel and counsel for the\nappellant expressly requested that this court not address the question of the\njurisdic­tion of this court to review, on an appeal from sentence, an order\nmade under s. 741.2 of the Code. Consequently, I have not considered the\njudgment of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in R. v. Watson (1993), 1993 CanLII 5409 (NB CA), 87\nC.C.C. (3d) 285, 142 N.B.R. (2d) 327, 22 W.C.B. (2d) 5.Accordingly therefore, I would hold that the\nsentence of the trial judge of June 25, 1993, should be varied to the extent\nonly of excluding the order made pursuant to s. 741.2 of the Code.I am advised by Chief Justice Goodridge, who is\nat present out of the province, that he is in agreement with the disposition of\nthis case.Appeal allowed.[ScanLII Collection]"}

He is before the court today for\nsentencing.A. The Offence[2]On the afternoon of August 3, 2011, a Lexus SUV operated by Mr. Ceballos\nwas pulled over for investigation into whether Mr. Ceballos was driving while\nhis license was suspended. In the course of the subsequent interaction, the\npolice observed a quantity of cocaine in plain view on the floor of the cargo\narea of the SUV. Mr. Ceballos was placed under arrest, the SUV was searched and\nthe cocaine – weighing 326 grams – was seized. The wholesale value of the\ncocaine was approximately $10,000. If sold at the gram level, it would be worth\nbetween $26,000 and $32,600.[3]Mr. Ceballos was charged with possession of cocaine for the purpose of\ntrafficking. The matter came on for trial on March 25, 2014. Upon arraignment,\nMr. Ceballos pleaded not guilty. At the outset of the trial, he brought an\napplication for an order excluding the evidence of the finding of the cocaine\non the basis of infringements of his rights under ss. 8 and 9 of the Canadian\nCharter of Rights and Freedoms. On April 16, the application was dismissed.\nIt was agreed that the evidence called on the application would be applied to\nthe trial and neither the Crown nor the defence called any further evidence. It\nwas formally conceded that the only reasonable inference from the evidence was\nthat Mr. Ceballos was in possession of the cocaine and that he was in\npossession of it for the purpose of trafficking.[4]There was no evidence with respect to how Mr. Ceballos came to be in\npossession of the cocaine or what, specifically, he intended to do with it. I\nwill return to this later in these reasons.B. The Offender[5]Mr. Ceballos is now 40 years of age. At the time of the offence, he was\n36 years old and he had no criminal record. He was, however, awaiting trial on\na charge of drinking and driving for which he was subsequently convicted and\nfined.[6]Mr. Ceballos was born in Ecuador and came to Canada about 20 years ago.\nHe is now a Canadian citizen. He has been married for 21 years and he has three\nchildren – two girls, aged 8 and 6, and a son aged 2. Mr. Ceballos and his wife\nsponsored his mother and his three younger siblings to Canada. He is close to\nthem and sees them at least once a week.[7]Mr. Ceballos completed his high school credits in Canada and attended\ncommunity college to train as a chef. He worked in the restaurant business\nuntil around 2010 when he and his wife decided to purchase his employer’s\nrestaurant. He went into significant debt to finance the transaction, but the\ndeal fell through and Mr. Ceballos lost both his investment and his employment.\nThe family has been in financial difficulty ever since. His wife works\nfull-time with a bank, but with three young children it has been difficult to\nmake ends meet. In 2011, Mr. Ceballos began working part-time as a caretaker at\nthe University of Toronto. That position is now full-time. Mr. Ceballos is\nquite concerned that if he is incarcerated for any significant period he will\nlose his job.[8]On the sentencing hearing, twelve letters were presented from friends\nand family of Mr. Ceballos. The consistent theme of those letters is that the\noffence is completely out of character for Mr. Ceballos, whom the writers\ndescribe not only as a dedicated and loving husband and father but also as a\ncaring and generous friend. Further, both before and after he was charged with\nthe offence before the court he was engaged in volunteer work in the community.[9]Following his arrest, Mr. Ceballos was released on a bail order that\nincluded a term of house arrest. After some eight to twelve months, that term\nwas deleted and he was put on a curfew from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. I accept that both\nthe house arrest and the curfew were restrictions on Mr. Ceballos’s liberty but\nthere is no evidence as to the extent to which they interfered with his\nlifestyle: see R. v. Downes (2006), 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA), 205 C.C.C.\n(3d) 488, at paragraph 37 (Ont. C.A.)[10]A presentence report was obtained to assist in the determination of an\nappropriate sentence. The report was quite positive. The author indicated that\nMr. Ceballos was co-operative, that he took full responsibility for the\noffence, and that he was remorseful. The author further noted that Mr. Ceballos\nhas been a very involved father and that he is extremely anxious about the\nprospect of separation from his wife and his children.[11]Mr. Ceballos told the author of the presentence report that the offence\noccurred when a person he knew from Ecuador offered him $500 to deliver the\ncocaine. He told the author that he had never done anything like this before\nbut he was desperate for money. The Crown was not prepared to accept that\nexplanation and Mr. Ceballos was given an opportunity to call evidence to\nsupport it. No such evidence was called. In the end, there is no evidence, one\nway or the other, with respect to how Mr. Ceballos came to be in possession of\nthe cocaine, where he was going with it, or to whom he intended to give it.[12]Given the opportunity to speak, Mr. Ceballos expressed his remorse for\nhis ‘mistake’, and he asked for the forgiveness of the court and of his family.C. The Positions of the Parties[13]The position of the Crown is that a sentence of 3½ years in the\npenitentiary is called for. The position of the defence is that a conditional\nsentence of 2 years less one day would be fit and appropriate. Alternatively,\nthe defence submits, if a sentence to be served in a custodial facility is\nrequired, it should be in the range of 9 to 12 months.D. Discussion[14]Section 718 of the Criminal Code provides, in part, that the\nfundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute to respect for the law and\nthe maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing sanctions that\nhave one or more of six objectives. Those objectives include denunciation of\nthe conduct of the offender, deterrence of the offender and others who might to\ntempted to similar conduct, separation of the offender from society where\nnecessary, rehabilitation, and the promotion of a sense of responsibility in\nthe offender. Section 10(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act\nmandates sentencing courts to pursue the fundamental purpose set forth in s.\n718 of the Code “while encouraging rehabilitation…and acknowledging the\nharm done to victims and to the community”. Whatever sanction is imposed must\nbe proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility\nof the offender.[1][15]As has been noted on countless occasions, the objectives and aims set\nforth in s. 718 of the Code and s. 10(1) of the CDSA sometimes pull\nin different directions. The determination of which should be given greatest\nweight will be a case-specific exercise. With respect to the trafficking of\nsignificant amounts of cocaine, however, denunciation and deterrence will\nalmost always be the primary objectives. In R. v. Daya, 2007 ONCA 693 (CanLII),\nJustice Moldaver stated, at paragraph 18: “This court and the Supreme Court of\nCanada have time and again elaborated on the perils of cocaine and the\nimmeasurable harm it causes to society.” In R. v. Hamilton (2004), 2004 CanLII 5549 (ON CA), 186\nC.C.C. (3d) 129 (Ont. C.A.), at paragraph 104, Justice Doherty stated:The immense\ndirect and indirect social and economic harm done throughout the Canadian\ncommunity by cocaine is well known… The use and sale of cocaine kills and harms\nboth directly and indirectly. The direct adverse health effects on those who\nuse the drug are enormous and disastrous. Cocaine sale and use is closely and\nstrongly associated with violent crime. [citations omitted][16]See also R. v. Pearson, 1992 CanLII 52 (SCC), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 665, at paragraphs 60-61;\nR. v. Bajada (2003), 2003 CanLII 15687 (ON CA), 173 C.C.C. (3d) 255, at paragraph 13 (Ont. C.A.); R.\nv. Marton, [1980] O.J. No 868, at paragraph 7 (C.A.); R. v. Migalski,\n[1999] O.J. No. 1235, at paragraph 4 (C.A.).[17]In determining what disposition will achieve the paramount objectives of\nsentencing in any particular case, a sentencing court is required to take into\naccount the principle that \"a sentence should be similar to sentences\nimposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar\ncircumstances\".[2]\nThis principle requires that consideration be given to sentences imposed in\nanalogous cases, and to that end both the Crown and the defence have referred\nto precedents that they say support their positions as to the appropriate\nsentence in this case. While sentencing precedents will almost always contain\nfeatures that make them distinguishable, taken as a whole they can point to a\nrange to be considered and to the factors that will assist in placing a\nparticular case within that range.[18]The cases make clear that in relation to trafficking in cocaine or possession\nof cocaine for the purpose of trafficking the quantity involved will be an important\nconsideration. Drug trafficking is a hierarchical business. Generally speaking,\nthe greater the amount of the drug, the more likely that the offender is at a\nhigher place in the hierarchy; the higher the place in the hierarchy, the\ngreater the potential for profit; the greater the potential for profit, the\ngreater the incentive to offend; and the greater the incentive to offend, the\ngreater the need for deterrence.[19]However, the amount possessed is not the only relevant consideration in\ndetermining the level of an offender’s involvement. It is not uncommon for\ntraffickers to enlist others to transport drugs from place to place. To the\nextent that the role of an offender was limited to performing that function,\nthe sentence imposed for possession may be lower in the range that would be the\ncase for someone more actively involved: see, e.g., R. v. Manjoon,\n2009 ONCA 876 (CanLII), R. v. Bertrand, 2012 ONSC 7519 (CanLII), R. v. Ramos, 2007\nMBCA 87 (CanLII), and R. v. Salazar, [2007] O.J No. 4974 (Sup. Ct.). There may be\nother circumstances, as well, that tend to negate an inference of involvement\nat the higher levels of a trafficking enterprise notwithstanding the amount\ninvolved: see, e.g. R. v. Williamson, 2013 ONCJ 55 (CanLII); R. v. Archibald,\n[2012] N.J. No. 95 (Supreme Court, Trial Division).[20]Mr. Ceballos told the author of the presentence report that he was\nmerely a courier, and that this was the only occasion on which he had performed\nthat role. If true, that would be an important consideration in determining\nsentence. However, the Crown disputed whether it was true. Section 724(3) of\nthe Criminal Code provides that where there is a dispute with respect to\na fact that is relevant to the determination of sentence, “including a fact\ncontained in a presentence report”, the party wishing the rely on the fact has\nthe burden of proving it. Where the party relying on it is the offender, the\ncourt must be satisfied of the existence of the fact on a balance of\nprobabilities. As I indicated earlier, Mr. Ceballos was given an opportunity to\ncall evidence to support what he told the author of the presentence report but\nhe declined to do so. In the end, there is no evidence that that his\ninvolvement was merely as a courier or that it was a ‘one off’. Nor has any\nother explanation been offered that would mitigate the gravity of possessing\none-third of a kilogram of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. Although there\nis no direct evidence of Mr. Ceballos’s place in the trafficking scheme, the\namount that he had in his possession was significantly higher than amounts associated\nwith street level involvement.[21]The greatest number of cases to which counsel for Mr. Ceballos referred in\nsupport of her submission for a sentence substantially lower than that sought\nby the Crown were cases in which guilty pleas were entered: R. v. Bertrand,\nsupra; R. v. Fillatre, [2011] N.J. No. 119(S.C.T.D.); R. v.\nWilliamson, supra; R. v. Ramos, supra; R. v. Salazar, supra; R. v. Archibald,\nsupra; R. v. Byrne, 2009 NUCJ 7 (CanLII), [2009] N.J. No. 6 (C.A.); R. v. Reis, [2012]\nO.J. No. 2623 (C.J.); R. v. Rebello, [2010] O.J. No. 650 (Sup. Ct.). A\nguilty plea is a significant mitigating consideration on sentencing: R. v. R. W. E., 2007 ONCA 461 (CanLII), at\nparagraph 40; R. v. Drabinsky, 2011 ONCA 582 (CanLII), at paragraph 166.\nHowever, Mr. Ceballos did not plead guilty. As was his right, he elected to be\ntried in the Superior Court and had a full preliminary inquiry. While he conceded\nthe case against him once he lost the application to exclude the evidence\nsurrounding the finding of the cocaine, the application was effectively a full\ntrial on the merits. To be clear, the fact that Mr. Ceballos elected to plead\nnot guilty and to follow that course is not an aggravating circumstance.\nHowever, the situation here is much like that presented to the Court of Appeal\nin R. v. Peltier, 2013 ONCA 141 (CanLII). In that case, Justice MacPherson\nstated, at paragraphs 12-13:[The] appellant contends that the trial judge failed\nto consider the mitigating fact that the appellant kept his trial limited to\nthe Charter application and, through counsel, invited the trial judge to\nenter convictions once the application was dismissed.I would reject this submission. The appellant did not\nplead guilty to the charges. The voir dire on the Charter application\ninvolved 11 witnesses testifying over four days. This was not a mitigating\nfactor. Moreover, when the Charter application was dismissed, the\nconvictions that followed were inevitable, as defence counsel properly\nrecognized.E. Conclusions[22]Mr. Ceballos is a first offender. The evidence shows that he is a\ndevoted husband, father, brother and son and a loyal and generous friend. I\naccept that the offence is out of character and that there is no reason to fear\nthat he will again become involved in drug trafficking. His prospects for\nrehabilitation are excellent. However, the offence he committed was very\nserious: he was found in possession, for the purpose of trafficking, of 326\ngrams of cocaine with a value, depending on how it was sold, between $10,000\nand $32,600. The authorities binding on me have repeatedly emphasized that\noffences such as this cause “immeasurable harm” to society. With respect to the\noffence itself, there are no mitigating circumstances. In my opinion, the\nparamount objectives of sentencing in this case must be denunciation and\ndeterrence.[23]While the sentence of 3½ years sought by the Crown is not outside of the\nrange for the offence, it does not give sufficient weight to Mr. Ceballos’s\nprior good character and his rehabilitative prospects. After giving the matter\nmy best consideration I conclude that the sentence that would be proportionate\nto the gravity of the offence and Mr. Ceballos’s degree of responsibility would\nbe a period of imprisonment of 2½ years.[24]That sentence is outside of the range for which a conditional sentence\nis available. However, even if I had been persuaded that a sentence of less\nthan two years would be appropriate, I would not have been satisfied that\nserving the sentence in the community would be consistent with the fundamental\npurpose and principles of sentencing in this case.MacDonnell J.Delivered: February 5, 2015[1]\ns. 718.1 of the Code[2]\ns. 718.2(b) of the Code"}
