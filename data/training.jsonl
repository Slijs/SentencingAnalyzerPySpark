Galway, for the Accused))HEARD:June 25, 2014K.L. Campbell J.:Reasons for SentenceA.Overview[1]On the night of May 25, 2012, the accused, Tom Le, was arrested in possession of a fully-loaded restricted firearm, namely, a .45 calibre semi-automatic Ruger pistol, and 13 grams of crack cocaine.At the time, there were valid court orders in effect prohibiting him from the possession of any firearm.He was also on probation.[2]The accused was charged with ten criminal offences, namely: (1) possession of a firearm without holding a licence; (2) possession of a firearm knowing he was not the holder of a licence; (3) possession of a loaded restricted firearm without having an authorization, licence, or registration certificate; (4) careless storage of ammunition; (5) carrying a firearm in a careless manner; (6) two counts of breaching previous court orders prohibiting him from possessing a firearm; (7) possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking; (8) possession of cocaine; and (9) possession of the proceeds of crime (Canadian currency) not exceeding $5,000.The accused pled not guilty to all of these alleged offences.[3]The accused challenged the admissibility of the firearm and the drugs, arguing that they had been obtained by the police in violation of his rights under ss. 8 and 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and ought to be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter.In reasons released on April 1, 2014, I dismissed this application by the accused, and found that the evidence was admissible.See: R. v. Le, 2014 ONSC 2033 (CanLII), [2014] O.J. No. 1515.The parties agreed that, if admissible, this evidence established the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to the firearms and drug-related offences.[4]Subsequently, the Crown established that the accused, by his possession of the firearm, breached two previous court orders which expressly prohibited him from possessing a firearm.I am also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused, who was arrested with $650 of drug money in his pocket, was in possession of the proceeds of crime under $5,000.Accordingly, the accused is guilty of all ten of the offences alleged in the indictment.[5]To date, the accused has served close to two years and two months (783 days to be precise) in pre-sentence custody.There is no issue between the parties that the accused should be given enhanced credit for this period of pre-sentence detention, as permitted by s. 719(3.1) of the Criminal Code.I agree.This result is required by the application of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v Summers, 2014 SCC 26 (CanLII), at paras. 7, 34, 68-80, affirming: 2013 ONCA 147 (CanLII), 114 O.R. (3d) 641, in order to fairly compensate the accused for his lost eligibility for early release and the relative harshness of the conditions of his pre-sentence detention.Giving the accused the maximum enhanced credit legally available means that the accused receives a total credit for having already served the equivalent of three years, two months and 20 days.I give him this credit.[6]The Crown contends that the accused should receive a global sentence of seven years imprisonment.More specifically, the Crown argues that, before the accused is given any credit for his pre-sentence custody, the accused should receive a five year sentence of imprisonment for his firearms offence, a one year term of imprisonment (consecutive) for his drug offence, and a further one year term of imprisonment (consecutive) for breaching the previous court orders prohibiting him from possessing a firearm.This would result, once the accused is given the agreed credit for his pre-sentence custody, in a sentence of three years, nine months and ten days.[7]Defence counsel contends that the accused should receive a global sentence of between three and four-and-a-half years imprisonment.More specifically, defence counsel argues that, before the accused is given any credit for his pre-sentence custody, he should receive a sentence of between two and three years imprisonment for the firearms offence, a sentence of between six and twelve months imprisonment (consecutive) for breaching the previous court orders prohibiting him from possessing a firearm, and a sentence of six months imprisonment (consecutive) for the drug offence.This would result, once the accused is given the agreed credit for his pre-sentence custody, in a sentence of no more than one year, three months and 10 days, even if the accused received a sentence at the very upper end of that proposed range.Defence counsel accurately observed that, if the accused was now sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years or less, a term of probation could also be imposed upon the accused, which would extend the period of supervisory control over the accused for potentially an additional three years.B.The Facts of the Firearm and Drug Offences[8]On the evening of May 25, 2012, the three Toronto Police Service (TPS) officers were directed by security guards working in the Atkinson Housing Co-operative to a particular townhouse backyard.When the officers attended at that location, they found five young males talking in the backyard area.The officers entered the backyard through the open gateway.[9]While the police were talking to some of the young men, the accused began acting nervously and started “blading” his body in order to conceal from the police the bag on his hip area – the bag that contained the fully-loaded semi-automatic firearm.Shortly thereafter, when the accused was asked about the contents of the bag, he fled.[10]The police gave chase and eventually tackled the accused to the ground.After a short but frantic struggle, during which the accused reached for his bag, the accused was subdued and arrested.The gun had nine rounds in the magazine and one in the chamber and, as the firearm had no “safety” mechanism, it was ready to fire.The accused needed only to pull the gun out of the bag and pull the trigger.[11]Later, at the police station, when he was being further searched, the accused pulled a bag containing 13 grams of crack cocaine out of the crotch area of his pants, and provided it to the police.The accused was also found in possession of two cell phones, which he admitted he used in his drug trafficking exploits.[12]In his trial testimony, the accused admitted that he had purchased the firearm a couple of months earlier, for his own protection, for approximately $2,000.The accused also admitted that he had purchased the 13 grams of crack cocaine for approximately $700, and it was not for his personal use, but rather was for purposes of sale to others.The accused also admitted that the $650 in cash in his pocket was from a drug sale he had made the previous day.C.The Personal Circumstances of the Accused[13]The accused is now close to 23 years old.At the time of the offences he was just 20 years of age.Despite his young age, the accused has already amassed a significant history of criminal conduct.As a youth, he was found guilty of three counts of assault with a weapon, failing to comply with conditions of an undertaking, robbery, being disguised with intent, trafficking in cocaine, and possession of the proceeds of crime.His longest custodial sentence as a youth was four months in custody.As an adult, the accused has only been found guilty of one prior criminal offence, an assault, for which he was given a conditional discharge and a 12 month period of probation in March of 2012.[14]The accused has five siblings, some older and some younger.His brothers and sisters appear to remain largely supportive.At the time of the offences, the accused was living at home with his disabled mother, in a subsidized housing unit in Toronto.His father is deceased.His mother has indicated that, when he is ultimately released from custody, he is welcome to return to her residence and continue living with her.[15]The accused has a grade 12 education, and completed his secondary school education with good grades.While he wanted, at one point, to go to law school, he did not immediately take any productive steps toward such an education.In the fall of 2010 the accused was registered to attend a paralegal program in a Toronto college.However, just as he was commencing this program, he was arrested in relation to his one adult offence, and the conditions of his release (i.e. house arrest) prevented him from continuing with this educational program, or seeking employment.The accused has since accepted that he will not be able, realistically, to continue in this program, and will not be able to become a paralegal.The only “job” in which the accused has been engaged, during the short period between the completion of his high school studies and the onset of his paralegal program, was drug trafficking.The accused has indicated, however, that eventually he wants to study a trade and secure employment in the construction industry.D.The Rule Against Multiple Convictions[16]The accused contends that, pursuant to the rule in R. v. Kienapple, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, at pp. 744-754, he cannot be convicted of all of the crimes of which he has been found guilty.This rule prevents an accused from being convicted of multiple offences arising from the same transaction where the elements of the offences are substantially the same.This rule prevents multiple convictions where there is both a factual and legal nexus amongst the offences.In such circumstances, the accused should only be convicted of the most serious of the offences, and the findings of guilt in relation to the other similar offences should be conditionally stayed.See also: R. v. Prince, 1986 CanLII 40 (SCC), [1986] 2 S.C.R. 480, at pp. 491-503; R. v. Provo, 1989 CanLII 71 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 3, at pp. 12-18; R. v. K.(R.) (2005), 2005 CanLII 21092 (ON CA), 198 C.C.C. (3d) 232 (Ont.C.A.), at paras. 27-56; R. v. Crevier, 2013 ONSC 2630 (CanLII), [2013] O.J. No. 2257, at paras. 37-46; Mr. Justice E.G. Ewaschuk, Criminal Pleadings \u0026 Practice in Canada (Loose-Leaf, 2nd ed.), vol. 2, at § 16:6000.[17]I agree that the Kienapple principle applies in the circumstances of the present case.More particularly, in my view, the application of this rule prevents the accused from being convicted of the offence of possession of a firearm without being the holder of a licence under which he may lawfully possess it, contrary to s. 91(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.The very similar offence created by s. 95(1) of the Code arose from the same factual transaction, and is clearly the more serious offence, as indicated by its greater maximum sentence.The accused will, accordingly, be convicted of the s. 95(1) offence, but the finding of guilt in relation to the s. 91(1)(a) offence will be conditionally stayed.See: R. v. Naples, 2009 BCCA 141 (CanLII), 268 B.C.A.C. 233, at paras. 2-4; R. v. Vidal, 2009 BCSC 1095 (CanLII), [2009] B.C.J. No. 1602, at paras. 1, 10; R. v. Duhamel, 2013 ONSC 1340 (CanLII), 1 C.R. (7th) 200, at paras. 12, 52.[18]While defence counsel argued that the same result should obtain with respect to the finding of guilt for the offence of possession of a firearm knowing that he was not the holder of a licence under which he may lawfully possess it, contrary to s. 92(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, the authorities emanating from this court that have analyzed the issue have held to the contrary.See: R. v. Stephens, [2009] O.J. No. 6102 (S.C.J.), at paras. 21-24; R. v. Brown, 2013 ONSC 4230 (CanLII), [2013] O.J. No. 3095, at paras. 39-44; R. v. Saikaley, 2013 ONSC 2699 (CanLII), [2013] O.J. No. 2331, at paras. 14-34; R. v. Hamilton, 2013 ONSC 3127 (CanLII), [2013] O.J. No. 2715, at paras. 1, 3; R. v. Williams, [2007] O.J. No. 1354, at paras. 2-3; R. v. Harutyunyan, 2012 ONSC 58 (CanLII), affirmed: 2012 ONCA 637 (CanLII), at paras. 4-8; R. v. Crevier, at paras. 37-46.These authorities collectively suggest that there are significant and sufficient legal differences between the offences created by ss. 95(1) and 92(1) such that an accused may properly be convicted of both without violating the rule in Kienapple.Some of these authorities note that the main legal difference between these offences is that the s. 92(1) offence requires proof of a specific intent, namely, that the accused had possession of the firearm “knowing” that he or she was not the holder of the requisite licence and registration certificate, whereas the s. 95(1) offence does not require proof of this specific intent.Accordingly, the accused will also be convicted of the offence contrary to s. 92(1) of the Criminal Code.[19]The Crown has conceded that the accused cannot properly be convicted of both the offences of careless storage of ammunition and carelessly carrying a firearm, given that the only evidence that the accused carelessly stored ammunition was the evidence that the accused was carelessly carrying a loaded firearm.Accordingly, the accused will be convicted of the more serious offence of carelessly carrying a firearm, and the finding of guilt in relation to the offence of careless storage of ammunition will be conditionally stayed.[20]The Crown has also conceded that the accused cannot properly be convicted of both the offences of possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking and simple possession of cocaine.Accordingly, the accused will be convicted of the more serious offence of possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking, and the finding of guilt in relation to the lesser offence of simple possession of cocaine will be conditionally stayed.[21]The accused will be convicted of the three remaining offences of which he has been found guilty, namely, possession of proceeds of crime and two counts of breaching firearms prohibition orders.These other offences are all sufficiently different, in terms of their respective legal components, that the rule against multiple convictions for the same delict has no further application.E.The Governing Sentencing Principles[22]Pursuant to s. 718 of the Criminal Code, the “fundamental purpose” of sentencing is to contribute to “respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society” by imposing “just sanctions” that have one or more of the following objectives: (1) to denounce unlawful conduct; (2) to deter the offender and others from committing offences; (3) to separate offenders from society where necessary; (4) to assist in rehabilitating offenders; (5) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or the community; and (6) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and the community.[23]Further, according to s. 718.1 of the Code, the “fundamental principle” of sentencing is that a sentence “must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.”[24]As required by s. 718.2 of the Code, in imposing sentence, the court must also take into account a number of principles including the following: (1) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender; (2) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances; (3) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh; (4) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and (5) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.F.The Aggravating and Mitigating Circumstances of this Case[25]As outlined by Crown counsel in her submissions, the aggravating circumstances of this case include all of the following:•While the accused is still a young man, he has a lengthy youth record for serious offences, and has already been found guilty of one criminal offence as an adult.•The semi-automatic firearm in the possession of the accused was fully loaded and ready to fire, in that the magazine contained nine rounds of ammunition, there was one round in the chamber and the firearm had no “safety” mechanism.•The accused was clearly using the loaded firearm to protect himself in connection with his drug trafficking enterprise.•In his trial testimony, the accused candidly admitted that he was engaged in trafficking in cocaine.Indeed, the accused admitted that the cocaine in his possession on the night of the offences was for purposes of sale, and the significant amount of cash in his pocket was the proceeds of an earlier drug transaction.•The flight by the accused and his struggle with the police caused a great risk to public safety, in that if the gun had been fired, either intentionally or accidentally, one of the police officers, a member of the public, or the accused himself might easily have been wounded or killed.•These offences took place in an area of Toronto plagued by an inordinately high incidence of violent and dangerous crime, and the vulnerability of the members of the community who live in this area of the city was well known to the accused.[26]As outlined by defence counsel in her submissions, the mitigating circumstances of this case include all of the following considerations:•The accused is still a very young man and, given his personal circumstances, the accused has reasonable prospects for rehabilitation.•While the accused has a youth record, and has been found guilty as an adult with respect to one earlier matter, these offences are his first adult convictions.•In terms of the previous sentencing dispositions that have been imposed upon the accused, either as an adult or a youth, the most serious disposition required him to serve but a few months in custody.•There is no evidence that the accused ever shot the firearm, or used it as a weapon or threat against any person.•The firearm found in the possession of the accused has not been traced back to the commission of any earlier criminal offences.•The accused took steps to expedite his trial, and did not contest some aspects of the case against him.G.The Global Sentence Merited by the Offences and the Offender[27]I have reached the conclusion that, for the following reasons, the appropriate global sentence, in all of the circumstances of the present case, is a sentence of five years imprisonment.More particularly, in my view, the accused should receive an effective sentence of three years imprisonment for the firearms offences, an additional one year term of imprisonment for the drug offence and the proceeds of crime offence, and an additional one year term of imprisonment for breaching the two weapons prohibition orders.That is the effective sentence that will be imposed upon the accused today, less the enhanced credit for his time in pre-sentence custody.[28]Accordingly, after appropriately crediting the accused with having already served the equivalent of three years, two months and 20 days, the accused shall now be sentenced to a total reformatory term of incarceration of one year, nine months, and 10 days.In an effort to sensibly break down this total figure into smaller terms of imprisonment, and making some of the sentences appropriately consecutive, I sentence the accused as follows:•For the firearms offences outlined in counts two, three and five of the indictment, the accused is sentenced to a term of seven months and ten days imprisonment on each count (concurrent);•For the two breach of court order offences described in counts six and seven of the indictment, the accused is sentenced to a further seven month term of imprisonment (concurrent – but consecutive to the sentence for the firearms offences); and,•For the drug offence in count eight of the indictment and the proceeds of crime offence in count 10 of the indictment, the accused is sentenced to an additional seven month term of imprisonment (concurrent – but consecutive to the sentences for the firearms offences and the breach of court order offences).[29]Totaling these three groups of consecutive sentences, results in the imposition of a total sentence of one year, nine months and ten days imprisonment.I will also impose a three year term of probation and the ancillary sentencing orders to which the parties have essentially agreed.H.The Firearms Offences[30]The circumstances of the present case have led me to conclude that the firearms offences call for the imposition of a three year penitentiary term of imprisonment.I appreciate that there is no longer any three year mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment for the offence of unlawfully possessing a loaded prohibited firearm while not the holder of an authorization or licence and registration certificate, pursuant to s. 95(2)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code.I impose this sentence on the accused only because I consider it is fair and appropriate in all of the circumstances.See: R. v. Nur, 2013 ONCA 677 (CanLII), 117 O.R. (3d) 401, at paras. 4, 6, 51-52, 107-109, 144, 206.[31]The accused was walking the streets of Toronto with a fully loaded semi-automatic handgun that was ready to fire.The magazine was full of ammunition, there was a bullet already in the firing chamber, and there was no functioning safety mechanism anywhere on the firearm.All that was required to discharge the firearm was for the accused to pull the trigger.In R. v. Ferrigon, 2007 CanLII 16828 (ON SC), [2007] O.J. No. 1883 (S.C.J.), at para. 25, Malloy J. made these observations about the grave danger inherent in just such a situation:Guns are dangerous.Handguns are particularly dangerous.Loaded, concealed handguns are even more dangerous.A person who loads a handgun with bullets and then carries that handgun, concealed on his person, into a public place is by definition a dangerous person.Handguns are used to shoot people.A person who carries a loaded handgun in public has demonstrated his willingness to shoot another human being with it.Otherwise there would be no need to have loaded it.That person is dangerous.He is dangerous to those with whom he associates; he is dangerous to the police and other law enforcement personnel; he is dangerous to the members of his community; he is dangerous to innocent bystanders, including children, who may be killed or maimed by stray bullets.And equally importantly, he is dangerous to a way of life that is treasured in Canada and to which all residents of Toronto are equally entitled – a way of life that respects the rule of law to ensure the peace and safety of those who live here.[32]The attempted escape by the accused and his strenuous struggle with the police served only to increase this great risk to public safety.Had the gun been fired, either intentionally or accidentally, one of the investigating police officers, an innocent member of the public nearby, or the accused himself, might easily have been wounded or killed.[33]The criminal possession of handguns in these circumstances remains an all too prevalent threat to the people of Toronto, and to others in the Greater Toronto Area.These firearms are almost invariably tools employed in some other criminal activity, and their possession and use, on occasion, tragically results in serious bodily harm or death.In the present case, the accused used his firearm as protection in furtherance of his illicit drug trafficking.In so doing, the accused could easily have caused grievous bodily harm or death to others.Accordingly, the criminal possession of such illegal firearms must be met with custodial sentences that proportionally reflect the gravity of the offence, and which appropriately stress the need to denounce and deter such crimes.The public simply must be adequately protected.See: R. v. Danvers (2005), 2005 CanLII 30044 (ON CA), 199 C.C.C. (3d) 490 (Ont.C.A.), at para. 78; R. v. Brown, 2010 ONCA 745 (CanLII), 277 O.A.C. 223, at para. 14; R. v. Morris, 2011 ONSC 5206 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 3995, at paras. 10, 58, affirmed: 2013 ONCA 223 (CanLII), 305 O.A.C. 47, at para. 17; R. v. Chambers, 2012 ONSC 817 (CanLII), [2012] O.J. No. 462, at paras. 15-17, affirmed: 2013 ONCA 680 (CanLII), 311 O.A.C. 307; R. v. Scarlett, 2013 ONSC 562 (CanLII), [2013] O.J. No. 644, at paras. 13-14, at paras. 13-14; R. v. Peterkin, 2013 ONSC 2116 (CanLII), at paras. 22, 24; R. v. Brown, 2013 ONSC 4230 (CanLII), [2013] O.J. No. 3095, at paras. 48-50, 76-78.[34]As the Court of Appeal for Ontario stated in R. v. Smickle, 2014 ONCA 49 (CanLII), 306 C.C.C. (3d) 351, at para. 19, “[m]ost s. 95 offences will attract a penitentiary term even for first offenders,” and even “less serious” versions of the crime than are typically committed “will demand the imposition of sentences at or very near the maximum reformatory sentence, even for first offenders.”See also: R. v. Nur, at paras. 107-109, 206, affirming on this point: 2011 ONSC 4874 (CanLII), 275 C.C.C. (3d) 330, at paras. 41-45, 49-52, 70, 145-149; R. v. Velez-Lau, 2011 ONSC 4805 (CanLII), [2011] O.J.

No. 1749, at paras. 21-28.I.The Drug Trafficking Offence[35]In all of the circumstances of this case, the accused should receive an additional one year term of imprisonment for the drug trafficking offence and the proceeds of crime offence.In R. v. Peterkin, I concluded that a 22-year-old accused, with no prior criminal record, who had been found in possession of a fully loaded semi-automatic firearm and commercial quantities of marihuana and crack cocaine, should receive a sentence of three years for the firearm offence and a one year consecutive term of imprisonment for the drug offence.In arriving at that conclusion, I made the following observations, at para. 23, which I consider to be equally applicable in the present case:This firearms offence was not, however, the only offence committed by the accused.He was also found in possession of commercial quantities of cocaine and marihuana and the other typical trappings of the drug trafficking trade.In my view, this changes the complexion of the case and renders the criminal conduct of the accused significantly more serious.Indeed, whether the accused’s drug offence, namely, the unlawful possession of a controlled substance (cocaine) for the purpose of trafficking, is treated as an aggravating circumstance of the firearms offence, or requires the imposition of a separate consecutive sentence, in my view, this offence must increase the effective custodial sentence on the accused by at least a year.The combination of illegal loaded firearms and the sale of illicit drugs is a very dangerous and toxic mix that requires the imposition of serious penitentiary terms of imprisonment.See: R. v. Grant, 2006 CanLII 18347 (ON CA), [2006] O.J. No. 2179 (C.A.), at para. 82; varied: 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII), [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353; R. v. Brown, [2007] O.J. No. 5338 (S.C.J.), at paras. 34-38; R. v. Dass, [2008] O.J. No. 1161 (S.C.J.), at paras. 19-33; R v. Manning, [2007] O.J. No. 1205 (S.C.J.), at para. 16; R. v. Williams, [2007] O.J. No. 1354 (S.C.J.), at para. 34; R. v. Duhamel, 2013 ONSC 1340 (CanLII), at para. 39.[36]There are a number of other authorities to a similar effect.See: R. v. Marshall, 2013 ONSC 6206 (CanLII), at paras. 31-38; R. v. Johnson, 2013 ONSC 4217 (CanLII), [2013] O.J. No. 2957, at paras. 12, 26-28, 31-34.J.Breach of the Weapons Prohibition Order[37]At the time of his firearm offences, the accused was subject to two court orders which strictly prohibited him from the possession of such a weapon.In R. v. Ellis, 2013 ONSC 3092 (CanLII), [2013] O.J. No. 2409, at para. 30, I commented that the weight of authority strongly suggests that, as a general rule, in such circumstances a consecutive sentence ought to be imposed for the breach of the weapons prohibition order.I also expressed my own agreement with that principled perspective, and suggested that, in the absence of a consecutive sentence, the accused would effectively receive no greater punishment as a result of his or her clear violation of a previous court order.Accordingly, the intentional violation of an unequivocal court order requires some effective additional sanction as offenders must understand that court orders governing their conduct must be followed or there will be real consequences for their violation.See also: R. v. Manning, at paras. 42-43; R. v. Ferrigon, at paras. 60-65; R. v. W.C.A., [2010] O.J. No. 2677 (C.J.), at paras. 49-51, affirmed: 2013 ONCA 385 (CanLII), 116 O.R. (3d) 500; R. v. Brown, 2010 ONCA 745 (CanLII), 277 O.A.C. 233, at para. 15; R. v. Sadat and Mensah, 2011 ONSC 3303 (CanLII), at paras. 41-48; R. v. Jones, 2011 ONSC 5330 (CanLII), [2011] O.J.

Husaini, at paras. 49-51.[38]Applying that principled approach in all of the circumstances of this case, and paying particular attention to the totality of the sentence ultimately imposed, in my view, the accused ought to be sentenced to an additional one year term of imprisonment for his breach of these two earlier weapons prohibition orders.These sentences should be concurrent to each other but, as I have indicated, consecutive to both the firearms offences and the drug offence.See: R. v. Mohamed, 2014 ONCA 103 (CanLII), [2014] O.J. No. 574, at para. 4.K.The Global Sentence Effectively Imposed[39]In the result, the accused receives an effective global sentence of five years imprisonment.More particularly, he receives an effective sentence of three years imprisonment for the firearms offences, an additional one year term of imprisonment for the drug trafficking offence and the proceeds of crime offence, and a further additional one year term of imprisonment for the breach of the two weapons prohibition orders.However, having regard to the fact that the accused must be credited with having already served the equivalent of three years, two months and 20 days, I now sentence him to a total reformatory term of incarceration of one year, nine months and 10 days, distributed amongst the offences as I have indicated.The imposition of this sentence, after considering the pre-sentence custody already served by the accused, will effectively achieve the global five year term of imprisonment that I seek to impose.[40]Viewed in its totality, this is a significant sentence of imprisonment, especially given the age of the accused.However, in my opinion, in light of the gravity of the crimes committed by the accused, and the clear need to denounce and deter these kinds of dangerous offences, this is a fit, fair and proportionate sentence in all of the circumstances.While the young accused certainly remains someone with clear rehabilitative potential, at this point, he is not headed to the penitentiary, but rather is obliged to serve a lengthy provincial reformatory term of incarceration.A sentence of that duration should ensure that the accused remains optimistic about his future, and focused on the positive changes he can make to his life upon his release from custody.He is an intelligent young man and he can become a valuable and contributing member of society.Moreover, given the length of this sentence of imprisonment, it can be productively combined with a lengthy period of probation which will, hopefully, provide the necessary measure of continued support and guidance to the accused once he has served the custodial portion of his sentence.[41]This sentence is significantly less than the sentence sought by the Crown.However, in my view the Crowns argument failed to give due and effective consideration to the youthful age of the accused, and his positive prospects for rehabilitation.In my opinion, now sending the accused to the penitentiary for close to another four years of imprisonment would likely prove to be counter-productive in terms of his ultimate rehabilitation and the ultimate, long-term interests of public safety.[42]This sentence is somewhat greater than the upper end of the range of sentence suggested by defence counsel.In my view, however, her argument failed to fully acknowledge the sheer gravity of the cluster of related offences committed by the accused, and the need to denounce and deter others from engaging in conduct which involves the combination of guns and drugs.The message must be sent that such inherently dangerous criminal activity will not be lightly tolerated by the courts, and that weapons prohibition orders must be strictly obeyed, or there will be significant practical consequences.L.The Accompanying Probation Order[43]As I have indicated, the imposition of a reformatory sentence of this duration, permits the imposition of a probation order.In my opinion, it is clearly in the best rehabilitative interests of the accused that, following his release from the custodial portion of his sentence, he should be subject to the terms of a probation order for a period of three years.This probation order will include the statutory terms outlined in s. 732.1(2) of the Criminal Code, together with the following additional terms:•The accused shall report to a probation officer within two working days of his release from custody, and thereafter as directed by the probation officer;•The accused shall abstain absolutely from the possession or consumption of any non-medically prescribed drugs.•The accused shall abstain from owning, possessing or carrying any weapon;•The accused shall perform 180 hours of community service, as directed by the probation officer.•The accused shall seek and maintain gainful full-time employment, or attend an educational facility on a full-time basis;•The accused shall be amenable to any counseling programs that may be recommended by his probation officer.M.Ancillary Sentencing Orders[44]In addition, in my view the following six ancillary sentencing orders are appropriate in the circumstances of this case.[45]First, pursuant to s. 491(1) of the Criminal Code, I order that the firearm and ammunition that has been seized and detained in this case be forfeited to Her Majesty in right of Ontario and thereafter disposed of as directed by the Attorney General.[46]Second, pursuant to s. 16(1)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, I order that the drugs seized and detained in this case be forfeited to Her Majesty in right of Canada and thereafter disposed of as directed by the Minister of Health.[47]Third, pursuant to s. 462.37 of the Criminal Code, I order that the proceeds of crime, namely, the $650 in drug money collected from the accused, be forfeited to her Majesty in right of Canada to be disposed of as directed by the Attorney General or otherwise dealt with according to the law.[48]Fourth, pursuant to ss. 109(1)(b) and 109(3) of the Criminal Code, I order that the accused be prohibited from the possession of any firearm, cross-bow, restricted weapon, ammunition, and explosive substance for life.[49]Fifth, as the accused has been found guilty of committing a “secondary designated offence,” pursuant to s. 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code, I make an order in Form 5.04, to have samples of bodily substances taken from the accused for purposes of forensic DNA analysis.[50]Sixth, I order that the accused pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $100 pursuant to s. 737(2)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code.This was the amount of the surcharge at the time the accused committed these offences.N.Conclusion[51]In the result, after appropriately crediting the accused with having already served the equivalent of three years, two months and 20 days, I now sentence the accused to a total reformatory term of incarceration of one year, nine months and 10 days.That amounts to the effective global sentence of five years imprisonment that I have sought to impose.The accused is also subject to the three-year term of probation and the various ancillary sentencing orders that I have issued.I will endorse the indictment and the warrant of committal accordingly.___________________________Kenneth L.

Mullins, 2016 ONCA 415DATE: 20160527DOCKET: C60200Watt, Tulloch and Huscroft JJ.A.BETWEENHer Majesty the QueenRespondentandMichael MullinsAppellantMichael Mullins, acting in personErica Chozik, duty counselKaren Papadopoulos, for the respondentHeard and released orally: May 11, 2016On appeal from the convictions entered on November 28, 2014 and the sentence imposed on March 24, 2015 by Justice Anne M. Molloy of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without a jury.ENDORSEMENT[1]The appellant was convicted after a judge alone trial in the Superior Court of Justice of counts of sexual assault and administering a stupefying drug for the purpose of committing that assault. The complainant, a sometime close friend of the appellant’s daughter, was eighteen. The appellant was forty-seven.[2]The trial judge imposed a sentence of 9 years on the conviction of sexual assault. She deducted 9 months from that sentence to reflect time spent in pre-trial custody, time spent on judicial interim release that included house arrest, and time served between conviction and sentence.[3]The appellant appeals both conviction and sentence.[4]On the appeal against conviction, the appellant advances on his own behalf several grounds of appeal. He submits that the trial judge made anumber of errors in reaching her conclusion that Crown counsel had proven his guilt of both offences beyond a reasonable doubt. Those errors, he submitted, included, but are not limited to:i.a failure to properly apply the burden and standard of proof to the body of circumstantial evidence which comprised the entirety of the case for the Crown;ii.a failure to properly assess the inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony, and thus reaching conclusions about the credibility of the complainant and the reliability of her evidence that were unwarranted in the circumstances of this case;iii. an unwarranted acceptance of evidence about alteration of a date in a photograph offered in defence; andiv. an unjustified rejection of the evidence of the appellant’s daughter on the basis that she and the appellant had colluded on their testimony.[5]The appellant also contends that the trial judge erred in failing to enter a stay of proceedings on two unrelated grounds:i.loss of an audio and videorecorded statement of the complainant; andii.failure to conduct the appellant’s trial within a reasonable time.[6]Leaving to one side for the moment the grounds that allege error in the failure to stay proceedings, the initial category of errors contests factual findings that were available to the trial judge on the evidence adduced at trial. It is not, indeed cannot, reasonably be suggested that these findings were not open to the trial judge. None are the product of legal error or any misapprehension of evidence. The conclusion of the trial judge was one that a reasonable jury, properly instructed, could reasonably have rendered. We are not entitled to re-try this or any case. And as it seems to us, this is precisely what we are being invited to do.[7]The claims of constitutional infringement sufficient to warrant a stay of proceedings fall on barren ground. Among other things, an endorsement on the indictment reveals that the appellant abandoned any reliance on s. 11(b) at trial. The lost evidence complaint moves no freight. It does not appear that this complaint was advanced at trial. Even if it had been pursued there, it is not a claim that could sustain a finding of constitutional infringement, much less one that would warrant a stay of proceedings.[8]On the appeal from sentence, we are satisfied that the sentence imposed falls within the range of sentence appropriate for these offences and the offender who committed them. Aggravating features predominated. Mitigating features were minimal. Even if we were to assume that the trial judge was wrong to characterize the offence as reflecting a breach of trust, we are not persuaded that if such a portrayal reflects error, that the error had any meaningful impact on the result. It did not take the sentence outside the appropriate range or mislocate it within the appropriate range.[9]In a similar way, we are not persuaded that had the Gladue material been before the sentencing judge, the result would have been any different. The sentencing judge did give consideration to the appellant’s troubled childhood in determining the sentence she would impose.[10]What does appear to us, however, is that the sentencing judge gave inadequate effect to the time spent in custody and on release in reaching her conclusion about the net sentence she would impose. In our view, the appropriate credit should be 373 days. That would leave, as a remanet, a sentence of 9 years less 373 days, or, by our reckoning, a net sentence of 8 years less 8 days, or put another way, 7 years, 357 days.[11]The appeal from conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal allowed to the extent that the sentence is reduced to one of 8 years, less 8 days, or 7 years plus 357 days.“David Watt J.A.”“M.

Kovacs,for the appellant)Appellant))))Heard:September 20, 2002On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice D.M. Stone on June 20, 2002.CRONK J.A.:[1][1]The appellant was convicted of two counts of robbery and sentenced to eighteen months incarceration and three years probation.A ten year weapons and firearm prohibition was also imposed.He seeks leave to appeal against his sentence and, if leave be granted, appeals against his sentence to this court.(1)Background[2][2]On June 25, 2000, at approximately 3:10 a.m., the appellant and two accomplices robbed a pizza store.The appellant drove the getaway car.His two accomplices wore masks and carried metal pipes.They stole approximately $1,500 from the cash register and the sum of $40 from the wallet of the clerk who was on duty in the store.The clerk was not physically harmed.[3][3]The second robbery occurred at approximately 10:30 p.m. on June 29, 2000 at a gas bar where two clerks were working.The appellant’s accomplices entered the gas bar, wearing masks.A scuffle ensued and one of the gas bar attendants was cut across his right temple and ear with a knife carried by one of the accomplices.The cut required six stitches to close.Both attendants were threatened and verbally abused.Approximately $160 was stolen from the cash register, together with cigarettes and cigars, $10 from one of the attendants and the cell phone and money pouch of the other attendant.The appellant again drove the getaway car.He also communicated by cell phone with his two accomplices, providing advice on the best time to rob the gas bar.[4][4]The appellant was nineteen years old at the time of the robberies and had no prior criminal record.[5][5]Following an extended period of pre-trials, the appellant pleaded guilty to both robbery charges.[6][6]At trial, the parties agreed that a reformatory sentence was appropriate, but disagreed as to whether a conditional sentence should be imposed.The appellant’s two accomplices received sentences of two years less one day after credit for pre-trial custody, and twelve months secure custody and two years probation, respectively, on two counts of robbery arising from the same incidents.(2)Issues[7][7]The appellant argues that his sentence is manifestly harsh and excessive given his personal circumstances and those of the case.In particular, he asserts that his pleas of guilty, his ultimate co-operation with the police, his relative youth and lack of a criminal record, his excellent rehabilitation prospects and the nature and extent of his role in the robberies warranted imposition of a conditional sentence or a sentence in the low to mid-reformatory range.He further submits that the trial judge failed to apply proper sentencing principles by over-emphasizing the aggravating factors here, and by giving inadequate consideration to the sentences imposed on the appellant’s accomplices.(3)Analysis[8][8]The trial judge delivered lengthy and considered reasons for the sentence imposed in this case.He referred to the many evident mitigating factors, including those relied upon by the appellant, and the positive indicators of the appellant’s potential for rehabilitation.The trial judge concluded, correctly in my view, that specific deterrence is not a major factor here.His approach to determining a fit sentence was aptly encapsulated in the following statement in his reasons:This case is difficult particularly because everything about the offence says jail, and almost everything about the accused says conditional sentence; it is the balancing of those matters and determining what the right disposition is that is the most difficult exercise here.[9][9]The trial judge recognized that robbery is a most serious crime.That is particularly so when, as here, the use of weapons is involved, one or more of the victims is injured, the commission of the offence occurs late at night and the victims occupy vulnerable and isolated positions.[10][10]The trial judge rejected the defence submission that the appellant’s role in the robberies was minimal.The appellant drove the getaway car, drove his accomplices to the robbery locations, knew the intention to commit the robberies, assisted his accomplices in implementing the second robbery by communicating with them by cell phone, and facilitated their escape.The trial judge observed that the circumstances in this case indicate “a very serious public need for denunciation, general deterrence, and ultimately a period of incarceration”.I agree.[11][11]The trial judge was also alert to the appellant’s eligibility for a conditional sentence and the fact that robbery is an offence which may attract a conditional sentence, in a proper case.He considered the applicable principles enunciated in R. v. Proulx (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) and the incidence of robberies in the community in which these crimes occurred, as he was entitled to do.[12][12]In balancing all of those factors, the trial judge concluded that a conditional sentence was not an appropriate disposition in this case.That decision is entitled to considerable deference from this court.I am not persuaded that in rejecting the defence submission for a conditional sentence, the trial judge erred in principle or failed to properly consider and apply the relevant sentencing principles.Accordingly, I would not interfere with that aspect of his decision.[13][13]It is important however, in my view, to emphasize several other features of this case.First, the appellant’s conduct in the robberies is to be contrasted with that of his accomplices.While the appellant’s role was serious, and not insignificant, it did not involve the use of violence or weapons, an attempt at disguise, threats to the victims of the robberies or verbal abuse of them.In contrast to the appellant’s sentence, one of his accomplices, a young person whose role in the robberies was materially different than that of the appellant, received concurrent sentences of twelve months secure custody and two years probation on similar robbery counts arising from the same situation.The different sentence for the appellant was not based on any clear distinction by the trial judge between the role of the appellant and the role of the relevant accomplice.Such a comparison would have favoured the appellant.Disparity in sentence is a principle which deserved considerable attention in this case.[14][14]Moreover, the trial judge found that there was evidence of a maturing in the appellant’s thought processes and a recognition by him of the shame and disgrace that he visited upon himself and his family.He undertook voluntary counselling prior to his arrest on the offences at issue and, unlike his accomplices, had no prior criminal record.In addition, he was not involved in any further criminal activity after the robberies and prior to his arrest on the offences for which he was sentenced by the trial judge.[15][15]In my view, with respect, the reasons of the trial judge do not reflect sufficient consideration of the cumulative importance and implications of all of the factors described above.Accordingly, I conclude that the proper jail sentence in this case for the appellant is twelve months, rather than eighteen months as imposed by the trial judge.(4)Disposition[16][16]For the reasons given, I would grant leave to appeal sentence and allow the appeal in part by substituting twelve months incarceration for the period of eighteen months incarceration imposed by the trial judge.In all other respects, I would dismiss the appeal.“E.A. Cronk, J.A.”“I agree Robert P. Armstrong J.A.”O’CONNOR A.C.J.O. (Dissenting):[17][17]I have read the reasons of my colleague, Cronk J.A.Like her, I would not interfere with the trial judge’s decision to impose a custodial sentence.However, I am not persuaded that the trial judge erred in imposing a term of imprisonment of eighteen months.[18][18]Although the appellant did not directly use violence or weapons, he played an integral role in the commission of two very serious offences.His accomplices, who were masked and armed, robbed two business establishments in which there were vulnerable victims working in isolated circumstances at night.The victim of one of the robberies received a cut to his temple requiring six stitches.The need for denunciation and general deterrence was a significant factor in determining what would be an appropriate sentence.[19][19]In imposing a sentence of eighteen months, the trial judge delivered very careful and thorough reasons.He took into consideration all of the appropriate factors, including the personal circumstances of the appellant and the sentences that were imposed on his two accomplices.[20][20]The appellant had no previous criminal record and did not spend any time in pre-trial custody.The accomplices both had criminal records.One of the accomplices, a young offender, received a sentence of twelve months secure custody, together with two years probation.The other, who was an adult offender, was sentenced to two years less a day in custody after having served 191 days of pre-trial custody.[21][21]I do not consider that the sentence of eighteen months imposed on the appellant offends the principle of treating similar offenders and offences in a similar manner.In considering whether there is an unacceptable disparity between the sentence imposed on the appellant and the sentences imposed on the accomplices, a comparison to the sentence imposed on the adult accomplice is the more appropriate gauge.The sentencing principles that apply to a young offender differ somewhat from those that govern adult offenders.[22][22]Depending on whether one allows 2:1 for the pre-trial custody of the adult accomplice, his sentence was the equivalent of either two and a half or three years imprisonment.In my view, a sentence of eighteen months for the appellant sufficiently recognizes the lesser role of the appellant in the offences and the differences in the personal circumstances of the two offenders.[23][23]I am satisfied that the sentence of eighteen months imprisonment imposed by the trial judge falls within the appropriate range for this offence and this offender.I would, therefore, grant leave to appeal the sentence, but would dismiss the appeal.RELEASED:“OCT 21 2002”“DOC”“D.

The evidence supported a finding of guilt in respect of those three counts. He was tried in respect of the three remaining counts, with Reasons for Decision delivered June 2, 2003.[3]I dismissed count #6, being the allegation of uttering a threat, at the conclusion of the Crown’s case, on application by the accused. I did this for the reason that there was insufficient evidence relating to this count. In my view, the evidence was such that no trier of fact, properly instructed, could find the accused guilty of this count.[4]The trial was concluded in respect of the remaining two counts, being counts #2 and #5, each being an allegation of sexual assault, in respect of which the accused had pleaded not guilty.Circumstances of the Offences[5]The sole witness for the Crown was Ms. M.O.She was 28 at the time of the trial. She had lived with Mr. Stender as her boyfriend for a year in an apartment at […] St. in Toronto, until about December 1, 2001. They were consensually intimate over that period. Ms. O. then moved out and to the home of a married sister in Toronto.[6]The accused testified. It was apparent from the evidence of both the complainant and the accused that he was obsessed (as he recognized himself at the trial) with Ms. O. and with attempting to revive their previously intimate relationship. As he testified, he was traumatized by the break-up. He testified as to how strongly he felt for her, how she had helped him overcome a problem with alcohol in the past, how she had cooked for him, looked after him and always encouraged him when they had lived together. He recognized that his behaviour toward Ms. O. was very irrational and that, as he said, he “was pretty pathetic.”[7]The complainant’s testimony confirmed Mr. Stender’s obsession with her. The complainant testified that he contacted her daily by e-mail and would drop in at her new residence uninvited. Many of the e-mails from Mr. Stender to her would have as attachments, pictures of her naked or engaged in sexual acts with the accused. She testified that she did not consent to these photos and did not know of their existence.[8]Mr. Stender testified that she consented to video camera pictures. He testified that he could stream the video into his computer. Mr. Stender has some expertise in computer application programs. He knew her e-mail account and password. She testified she learned that he was looking at her e-mail correspondence.[9]I accepted the testimony of the complainant where it was at variance with that of the accused. Moreover, Mr. Stender acknowledged that Ms. O was very upset about the existence of the pictures and wanted them destroyed and deleted from his computer. As well, he acknowledged that he threatened to send the pictures to her friends.[10]Ms. O testified that Mr. Stender often threatened to commit suicide. He was from a rural Ontario community and his only friends were through her.[11]Ms. O testified she did not fear for her personal safety in Mr. Stender’s company and that he had not hurt her physically to this point in time.[12]Ms. O testified that on January 14, 2001 she and Mr. Stender met in a park near her sister’s house in response to a telephone call from him. This was some six weeks after she had ended their relationship. She says he raised the name of a former boyfriend of hers and said he had talked with him about Ms. O. They argued and yelled at each other. She said he became angry and called her names. She says he then pushed her in the chest twice, knocking her down and on to her back. He apologized afterwards.[13]The next day they communicated by “chat” over the internet.Mr. Stender said that if she came over to the apartment and had sex with him that he would delete the computer files containing the pictures.She testified that she initially refused but that he then threatened to hurt her by e-mailing the offensive photos to her friends such that she would be embarrassed and her reputation hurt.[14]Mr. Stender frankly admitted in cross-examination that Ms. O was not interested in having sex except to get rid of the offending computer files. He admitted that he was in effect blackmailing her.[15]She said she went to his apartment January 15, 2001 for the purpose of talking to him and getting the photos deleted. Ms. O testified that he had moved his bed into the living room and had numerous pictures of her on the wall. She testified that he was adamant that she must have sex with him as a condition to having the photos deleted from his computer.[16]Ms. O testified that she believed she had no choice. In effect, Mr. Stender was blackmailing her. She said he started to massage her. He commenced to take her clothes off. He applied cocoa cream butter to her body.She was watching television, lying on her stomach with her head propped up on pillows. She says he kissed her. She allowed that she may have kissed him back. She says she pleaded with him but that he insisted on having sex with her before he would delete the photos from his computer.[17]Ms. O testified that she then had intercourse with Mr. Stender. She said in cross-examination that she did not know why she did so but perhaps he was being tender. She said he then showed her the many files on his computer with the photos and that she deleted them herself, deleting them also from the recycling bin.[18]Ms. O testified that the next day she again got e-mails with pictures from Mr. Stender. She says that in a phone conversation he said she would have to return to his apartment again to have sex one more time and delete the pictures. Apparently, Mr. Stender had been able either to recover the files deleted on January 15 or transmitted to the computer copies of the photos retained on the video camera.She says he again threatened to send the pictures to her friends. She said he again threatened to kill himself and that he wanted to see her one last time before doing so.[19]She said the e-mails with the pictures continued each day until January 20, 2001 when she met Mr. Stender at a donut shop. She says he told her he wanted to have sex with her on one more occasion and that the files had not yet been deleted. She says she made it plain to him that she did not want to have sex with him.[20]Ms. O testified that she returned to Mr. Stender’s apartment January 20. She then learned from Mr. Stender that he had hidden microphones and tape recorders in the bedroom and living room. She said he offered her what he called a “peace offering”, being a jean jacket.[21]She said he took her clothes off. She says she said she did not want this. She says she tried to give him advice and told him to go back to the town in which his parents live. She says she pleaded with him to delete the files with the embarrassing pictures.She said he threatened suicide and threatened again to send e-mails with the pictures to her friends. He admitted he would assert that he was suicidal to gain pity and sympathy.[22]She said he pleaded with her to have sex with him. She said she submitted to having sex on the basis that this was in exchange for having the files with the photos permanently deleted. She says she felt she had no choice but to let him have his way. She says she got tired of resisting and told him “fine” but “if you do this, it is not with M..” She says she shut her eyes and closed herself down mentally. She says that Mr. Stender knew that she did not want to have sex with him and did so only to obtain a deletion of the embarrassing photo files.[23]Mr. Stender frankly admitted in cross-examination that he had threatened to send the e-mails with the embarrassing pictures to her friends if she did not have sex with him.[24]On January 31, 2001 Ms. O attended at Sunnybrook Hospital for a preoperative examination relating to intended surgery in respect of a wrist. She testified that Mr. Stender unexpectedly appeared at the hospital and followed her about. Mr. Stender said he knew about the appointment and that he wanted to see “if there was anything worth pursuing any more.” He says he “wanted to rekindle what we once had.” She said that they left together by bus. She said that Mr. Stender did not get off the bus at his own stop but left the bus at her stop when she got off. She said he started yelling at her and she called him a coward. She said he punched her in the stomach and put her in a headlock, squeezing her head.[25]Ms. O is five feet tall and some 95 pounds. Mr. Stender is six feet six inches and weighs some 200 pounds. Mr. Stender says he only put his hands over her ears and grabbed her because she was enraged.[26]Ms. O testified she told Mr. Stender to “go home” but he said he had to go to the bathroom. She said that when they got to her house her younger sister opened the door whereupon Mr. Stender went in and to the bathroom. She said that he then went to her bedroom where she returned the jean jacket to him. She says she repeatedly told him to “get out” whereupon he pushed her against the wall and tried to squeeze her neck. At that point the younger sister heard the commotion and told Mr. Stender he must leave immediately, which he did. Mr. Stender admitted in his own testimony that “I put my hand around her throat, moved her aside and put her against the wall” and then took his hand away.[27]It was apparent from Mr. Stender’s testimony that he was very immature, obsessed with Ms. O and also spiteful. Ms. O testified she was very concerned about his claims to commit suicide because he had attempted to do so in the past. She said he would claim to be suicidal because he knew this “pulled on my heartstrings”.[28]There was little disagreement between the evidence of the complainant and the accused as to events.[29]The essence of the factual situation was that Ms. O agreed to have sexual intercourse with the accused January 15 and 20, 2001 to secure a deletion of the photos of her. Ms. O was put to a horrible choice.One’s revulsion to Mr. Stender’s despicable actions cannot be overemphasized. His actions and motives were morally reprehensible. Hence, the only issue at trial was whether Mr. Stender’s admitted actions amounted to a sexual assault in law such as to support a conviction under the Criminal Code.[30]Mr. Stender was not charged with extortion. It was not clear on the basis of Crown counsel’s submissions and the existing case law that Mr. Stender’s actions amounted to a sexual assault in law under the existing provisions of the Criminal Code. Accordingly, the accused was found not guilty in respect of the two counts of sexual assault. He was convicted on the three counts of ordinary assault and was sentenced in due course on these convictions. Mr. Stender received a conditional discharge with terms and conditions and two years probation in connection with the assault charges.[31]The Crown appealed the finding of not guilty in respect of counts #2 and #5 on a question of law. The sentence was not appealed. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and entered a conviction. R. v. Stender (2004), 2004 CanLII 7198 (ON CA), 188 C.C.C. (3d) 514 (Ont. C.A.).It was held that Mr. Stender’s conduct in threatening to disseminate the photographs unless Ms. O had sex with him amounted to extortion as defined in s. 346 (1) of the Code. Her participation in the sexual acts was the direct result and the intended consequence of the extortionate conduct. Accordingly, it was held Ms. O. did not voluntarily agree to sexual activity with Mr. Stender and it was directed that convictions be entered on those two counts.This conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada, R. v. Stender, unreported June 10, 2005 (S.C.C.).[32]I am now required to sentence Mr. Stender in respect of his convictions on these two counts of sexual assault.[33]A Presentence Report dated July 21, 2003 was obtained prior to the sentencing on the three assault convictions. A further updated Presentence Report dated July 17, 2005 (Exhibit #1) was obtained for the purpose of the sentencing at hand in respect of the sexual assault convictions. The Victim Impact Statement dated May 30, 2003 received at the original sentencing was again considered (Exhibit #2).Circumstances of the Offender[34]Mr. Stender is now 32 years of age. He was 27 at the time of the offences.[35]Mr. Stender reports a happy childhood with caring and supportive parents. At this point in time the offender has been under the supervision of the probation and parole officer for some two years. She states that throughout this duration he has presented as a lower risk for reoffence. He has complied fully with his supervision plan. He “reported as directed with reliability and an openness to engaging in purposeful dialogue.” He reportedly has “faithfully completed “ a total of 101 hours of community service work. He has not had any contact with the victim. He has abstained from alcohol and non-medically prescribed drugs. He attended a 16 session 50 hour program involving intervention tools, prevention techniques, problem solving skills and relapse prevention planning with respect to domestic violence.[36]Mr. Stender has a grade 12 level of education. Mr. Stender has maintained employment throughout the last two year period and has now secured a job with a company involved in highway construction. He has generally been employed since leaving high school in 1995. He resides in a small Ontario town with his spouse whom he married August 23, 2002. they now have a four month old daughter.[37]Mr. Stender had lived with his present spouse and her family for three years previously until 1999, before he met the complainant. His spouse reports Mr. Stender as being a gentle and kind person who has never been aggressive toward her. (This accords with the testimony of the complainant as to the offender’s nature in respect of the one year period in which they had lived together.) Mr. Stender and his spouse live with Mr. Stender’s brother and his family given a significant debt load because of the costs of the criminal proceedings.[38]Mr. Stender expresses regret for his past actions which have been the subject of the criminal charges. In my view, he is sincere in his expression of regret.[39]In brief, all reports indicate that Mr. Stender has fully complied with the conditions of his sentencing on the assault convictions and has followed a path of rehabilitation toward responsible citizenship over the past two years.[40]Mr. Stender has no criminal record predating the offences listed in the indictment at hand.Considerations in sentencing[41]The definition of a fit and appropriate sentence is governed by the purpose and principles of sentencing in ss. 718, 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code as applied to the circumstances of the case. I am mindful of s. 718 and its statement that the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society. This goal is to be achieved by imposing sanctions with the objectives of denouncing unlawful conduct, specific and general deterrence, the separation of offenders from society where necessary, rehabilitation, providing reparations for harm, and promoting a sense of responsibility.[42]The circumstances of this case make denunciation of the offender’s unlawful conduct, specific deterrence and general deterrence, together with rehabilitation, objectives for particular consideration in respect of the sentence to be imposed.[43]In my view, the prospects for rehabilitation as an objective for sentencing are very significant in this case. The offender is young. He has no prior criminal record. His behaviour since his conviction on the assault charges has reportedly been exemplary. He has complied fully with all the terms of his sentencing in respect of the assault convictions.[44]Without minimizing the seriousness of his sexual assault offences, they happened in the context of an immature, impulsive person who was obsessed with the complainant. The Crown states, correctly, that there is no evidence of a psychiatric disorder. The Crown states, correctly, that the admitted fact of Mr. Stender’s obsessiveness, in the absence of medical evidence, does not mitigate the offence.[45]However, there is an undisputed fact of obsession in the layperson’s use of the term. The pre-sentence report notes that in January, 2002 Mr. Stender went to his family doctor and received a referral to a psychiatrist, however, he was arrested before this session was realized. The pre-sentence report notes also that Mr. Stender attended in crisis at the emergency room of Humber RiverRegional Hospital in Weston on January 20, 2002 and that the attending physician’s report states a diagnosis of “emotional upset” and anxiety as a result of the break-up with Ms. O. This is one year (to the day) after the date of the second sexual assault but before he was charged and arrested in respect of the subject offences. The information was sworn February 6, 2002 with the first court appearance February 8, 2002.[46]Mr. Stender admitted readily at trial his unlawful conduct even though he and the complainant were the only witnesses to the incidents. He acknowledges responsibility for his actions. He acknowledges the pathetic stupidity of his actions. He is, in my view, remorseful. He has got on with his life and is doing his best to lead a productive life for the benefit of himself, his family and the community at large.[47]The objectives of denunciation of unlawful conduct, and specific and general deterrence must be balanced with the objective of rehabilitation.Submission of the Crown[48]Crown counsel submits that a penitentiary term is appropriate and suggests a sentence of two and one-half years. Crown counsel states that if the Court does not impose a penitentiary term then there should be a sentence to a provincial reformatory for two years less a day, followed by a probation period of three years.[49]Crown counsel has provided several cases in support of the Crown’s submission: R. v. Oyedeji (1987), 3 W.C.B. (2d) 348 (Ont. Dist. Ct.); R. v. D.K.P. [1991] B.C.J. No. 2998 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. R.L.B. [1992] A.J. No. 826 (Alta. C.A.); R. v. P.M.H. [1992] O.J. No.2715 (Gen. Div.); R. v. Davis [1993] N.J. 257 (Nfld. C.A.); R. v. Cerasuolo, 2001 CanLII 24172 (ON CA), [2001] O.J.No.359 (C.A.); and R. v. Alexandruk, [2003] A.J. No. 78 (Alta. Prov. Ct.).These cases included situations of extortion for sex (Oyedeji, P.M.H.) and extortion for monetary benefits through the threat to publish sexually explicit photographs (D.K.P and R.L.B.). All of the cited cases involved sentences of prison terms.[50]I do not intend to dissect the cited cases in detailed contrast to the one at hand. All of the cited cases involved egregious offences. The case at hand also involves an egregious situation. It is fair to say that sexual assault and extortion are always outrageous crimes deserving of severe punishment. In particular, sexual assault is a crime of violence, evidencing extreme anti-social conduct. I would go so far as to say the normative sentence in such situations will involve a sentence of incarceration. But while sentencing must, of course, take place within the framework of established principles set forth by the Code and established precedents, the sentence must be case-specific to the evidentiary record, factual base and particular, unique circumstances in the given situation before the Court.[51]Taking into account the entirety of the circumstances of the case at hand, in my view, an appropriate sentence would be in the range of twelve to eighteen months in a provincial prison. I sentence the offender, Mr. Stender, to a prison term of fifteen months for each sexual assault conviction, with the sentences to be served concurrently.[52]This then brings us to the question as to whether the sentence is to be served through incarceration or by way of a conditional sentence to be served in the community, considering the criteria set forth in s. 742.1. The sentence imposed is one that is less than two years. The second criterion is that the Court is to be satisfied that serving the sentence in the community “would not endanger the safety of the community.”[53]The Supreme Court of Canada emphasizes in R. v. Proulx (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) that the 1996 sentencing reforms seen with the conditional sentence order “must be understood as a reaction to the overuse of prison as a sanction, and must accordingly be given appropriate force as remedial provisions (para. 16). Restorative justice involves some form of restitution and reintegration into the community. The need for offenders to take responsibility for their actions is central to the sentencing process.[54]While incarceration is generally a harsher sanction, a conditional sentence may be as onerous as, or conceivably even more onerous than a jail term in certain circumstances.[55]“Safety of the Community” refers to the threat posed by the specific offender. To assess the danger to the community posed by the offender while serving his sentence in the community, two factors must be taken into account: (1) the risk of the offender re-offending; and (2) the gravity of the damage that could ensue in the event of re-offence. (Proulx at para. 69). The offender at hand has no prior criminal record and has been subject to probation for the two years without any apparent breach of conditions. The level of supervision in the community is a major factor in minimizing the risk of re-offending as well as the imposition of appropriate conditions of sentence. Mr. Stender is living in a supportive environment in terms of his immediate and extended family. Considering all the factors, I am satisfied that Mr. Stender serving his sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community. Indeed, Crown counsel allows that this criterion has been met.[56]Assuming the sentencing judge is satisfied that the offender would not endanger the community, a consideration is to then be made whether a conditional sentence “would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing” set forth in the Code.[57]It is clear that a conditional sentence is available in principle for all offences in which the statutory prerequisites are satisfied (Proulx, paras. 79, 80, 81 and 83). Sentencing is an individualized process with considerable discretion conferred upon the trial judge in fashioning a fit sentence.[58]A sentence must be proportional to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. A conditional sentence can achieve both punitive and restorative objectives.[59]I turn now to the question whether a conditional sentence is appropriate in the case at hand having regard to the sentencing objectives set out in s. 718. In sentencing, ajudge must engage in the ”delicate art” of balancing carefully “the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence.” R. v. Priest (1996), 1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.) per Rosenberg, J.A.[60]Denunciation represents the communication of society’s condemnation of the offender’s conduct. (Proulx para. 102.) Denunciation through a conditional sentence order can often be achieved by conditions that have a punitive aspect, such as with house arrest, and/or with the duration of the conditional sentence imposed extending beyond the duration of the jail sentence that would ordinarily be imposed.[61]There is uncertainty as to whether deterrence is more likely achieved with incarceration. The commonly expressed view is that the empirical evidence suggests that the deterrent effect of incarceration is uncertain. See generally Sentencing Reform: A Canadian Approach: Report of the Canadian Sentencing Commission (1987) at pp. 136-37, cited in Proulx at para. 107)[62]However, it is noted that the more recent empirical work of the eminent economist, Professor Steven Levitt of the University of Chicago, suggests that incarceration may indeed deter. See The Economist, January 10, 2004.[63]Restorative sentencing objectives, including rehabilitation, reparation and promotion of a sense of responsibility are generally viewed as more likely to be achieved through a conditional sentence order than with incarceration.[64]It is advantageous when assessing and weighing the factors relevant to a sentencing to have heard the testimony, and seen the witnesses, at trial. The Crown counsel making submissions as to sentencing was not the Crown counsel at trial (and had not read the transcript nor the Reasons for Decision at trial in advance of his sentencingsubmissions.)[65]Crown counsel emphasized the horrific experience for the complainant. It was unquestionably horrific, as it would be for any woman.The complainant has set forth her comments as to her ordeal in a well-written, articulate and thorough victim impact statement dated May 31, 2003. She refers to the despicable manipulation of her vulnerability by the offender in clear and poignant language.[66]Ms. O impressed me in her oral testimony at trial as someone who is very strong, tough and resilient (as she notes herself in her statement) and someone able to overcome these wretched events and get on with her life, notwithstanding the trauma of the past offences. She very understandably evidenced a great deal of anger toward Mr. Stender and very understandably evidenced a wish to see a strong denunciation and condemnation of his misconduct.[67]Crown counsel submits that the objective of general deterrence trumps the objective of rehabilitation in the circumstances of the sentencing at hand. I disagree. In my view, all the objectives of sentencing must be met but a suitable balancing requires recognition of the importance of the objective of rehabilitation.[68]Considering all the circumstances and balancing the interests seen in the principles of sentencing, in my view my discretion is to be exercised with a conditional sentence, to be served in the community.[69]Mr. Stender’s sentence of fifteen months is to be served in the community in accordance with a conditional sentence order, for each of the two sexual assaults, and followed by a one year probation.[70]I order that the offender shall serve his sentence in the community, The mandatory terms required by section 742.3 to be imposed in respect of the offender are as follows:(a)that he be of good behaviour and keep the peace;(b)that he appears before the Court when required to do by the Court;(c)that he reports to a supervisor within two working days after the making of this order, and thereafter as he may be required by the supervisor;(d)that he notifies the Court or the supervisor in advance of any change of name or address, and promptly notifies the Court or supervisor of any change of employment or occupation.[71]In addition, as further optional terms imposed in exercising the discretion of the Court:(a)he is to perform 100 hours of community service as may be assigned to him by his supervisor considering the talents of the offender and the needs of the community, to be completed within 10 months with a minimum of 10 hours to be performed in each and every month until the entire 100 hours has been performed;(b) he is to remain under house arrest at his residential premises for a period of ten months, being until July 20, 2006, subject to the following exceptions: he may leave the premises to go to and from and perform his duties of employment at his place(s) of employment; he may leave the premises for the purpose of performing and going to and from the place(s) of performing his community service; he may leave his premises for the purpose of attending any rehabilitative program prescribed by his supervisor; he may attend upon a physician or hospital in respect of any emergency medical treatment required in respect of himself or any member of his family; he may leave the premises for up to three consecutive hours on Saturdays for any personal purpose provided he is in his residence not later than 5:00 pm; he may go to and from any place of worship for the purpose of attending religious services therein provided he has advised his supervisor in advance; and he may be occasionally absent from his premises for any purpose seen as reasonable and necessary by his supervisor provided the supervisor has given approval in writing in advance;(c) at the end of the ten month period of his house arrest he is to observe a curfew for the balance of his conditional sentence, being five months, by remaining in his residence between the hours of 10:00 pm each day until 6:00 am the next day, until December 20, 2006; provided however, he may leave the premises in the event of any emergency medical treatment required in respect of himself or his family; and he may be absent from his premises during the curfew hours for any purpose seen as reasonable and necessary by his supervisor provided the supervisor has given approval in writing in advance.(d)he is to abstain from the consumption of any alcohol or drugs other than those prescribed by a licenses medical physician;(e) he is not to have nay communication, directly or indirectly, with the complainant or any member of her family;(f) he is to maintain his full-time employment and support his spouse and child; and(g) he is to attend and actively participate in Domestic Violence Intervention Programming and /or any such other rehabilitative program(s) as his supervisor may direct in the supervisor’s discretion and pay any fee (s) required of him.[72]Pursuant to s. 742.3(3), I order that he be given a copy of this order of the Court.[73]Additionally, I am required by s. 742.3(3) to explain to the offender the substance of ss. 742.4 and 742.6, relevant to the procedures relating to changes to the optional conditions and the procedure applicable upon a breach of any condition.[74]The supervisor may, because of a change in circumstances, propose a change to an optional condition upon notice to the offender, to the prosecutor and to the Court in writing indicating the proposed change and reasons for it. Upon receiving such a notice, the offender or the prosecutor or the Court may require a hearing to be held for the purposes of either allowing or refusing the changes or making any other change which the Court deems appropriate.[75]The procedure relating to a breach of any one of the conditions, whether mandatory or optional, is explained as follows. Upon a breach of a condition, the offender may be arrested and charged with the offence of breaching a condition pursuant to s.242.6 of the Criminal Code. The offender may be required to appear before a justice who may order him detained or released on conditions, and the allegation of breach of condition may then be tried by a Court having jurisdiction.[76]The allegation of breach of condition must be supported by a written report of the supervisor and signed statements of witnesses, if any. The prosecutor is required to give the offender reasonable notice and a copy of the report. Where the Court is satisfied on a “balance of probabilities”, being the same test which applies in civil cases, that the offender has breached the condition without reasonable excuse, the Court may either (a) take no action, or (b) change an optional condition, or (c) suspend the conditional sentence order and direct that a portion or all of the unexpired sentence be served in prison rather than in the community.[77]In addition, the offender is also placed on probation for a one year period following upon the expiration of the term of his conditional sentence order, on the following terms and conditions:(a)he reports to and is under the direction of a probation officer as required by the probation officer;(b)he makes reasonable efforts to maintain full-time employment or embarks upon or continues with full-time education;(c)he abstains from the consumption of alcohol and any drugs not prescribed by a licensed medical physician.[78]The offender, having been convicted of sexual assault, being a “primary designated offence”, is to be subject to an order under s. 487.051(1)(a) of the Code authorizing the taking from him of any number of one or more bodily substances that is reasonably required for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis. I am satisfied that the impact by such order upon the offender’s privacy and security of person is not grossly disproportionate to the public interest in the protection of society and the proper administration of justice.[79]Crown counsel has made an application under s. 490.012 for an order in Form 52 requiring Mr. Stender to comply with the Sex Offender Information Act, given that sexual assault is a “designated offence” under s. 490.011(1) (a). The offender has not sought to establish under s. 490.012(4) that an exceptional exemption should be made. Accordingly, such order is to issue.[80]This concludes my sentencing and reasons for sentence.__________________CUMMING J.Released:September 20, 2005COURT FILE NO.: 02-PR808DATE: 20050920ONTARIOSUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICEB E T W E E N:HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN- and -DAVID STENDERREASONSFOR DECISIONCUMMINGJ.Released:September 20, 2005"}

Hansen:Counsel for the Accused----------------------------------------An order has been made banning publication of theidentity of the Complainant/Witness pursuant to Section486.4 of the Criminal Code of CanadaOfficial Court Reporters1THE COURT:Jason Frank Paulette was2found guilty by a jury on January 17th, 20143for committing a sexual assault causing bodily4harm which occurred on December 8th, 2011.5Sentencing was adjourned and yesterday I heard6submissions from the Crown and the defence as7to what sentence should be imposed.8There is a publication ban prohibiting the9publication and broadcast of any information10that could identify the complainant in this11matter.I don't intend to refer to the12complainant by name but if there are portions13of my reasons where I do refer to her by name,14I am going to direct the court reporter to15refer to the complainant by her initials.16There can be no publication or broadcast of17any information that could disclose the18complainant's identity.19The Crown is seeking a sentence of six to20eight years imprisonment less credit for21remand time, and Mr. Paulette's counsel says22an appropriate sentence is three and a half to23four years less credit for remand time.24The evidence heard at trial was that the25complainant went to Mr. Paulette's residence26the evening of December 7th, 2011.27Mr. Paulette is her cousin and she went overOfficial Court Reporters11because she knew that his common-law spouse2was out of town and she thought that she would3help him out with his children and have dinner4with him.She spent the evening at his5residence and they smoked marijuana and drank6beer.After dinner, the complainant went to7the liquor store and bought some beer and when8she returned, they smoked the marijuana and9drank the beer.Mr. Paulette also touched up10a tattoo on the complainant's ankle with his11tattoo gun.12While Mr. Paulette was working on the13complainant's tattoo, the complainant was14texting a friend on her phone.She was15texting her friend throughout the evening.16Mr. Paulette got mad at the complainant for17being constantly on the phone.She thought it18was a joke at first but she realized he was19serious when he slapped the back of her head.20She was scared and put her phone away.21The complainant then went upstairs to the22bathroom.While she was in the bathroom she23blacked out.When she came to again, she was24on the bathroom floor and Jason Paulette was25choking her.She faked being unconscious so26he would get off of her, which he did.He27went downstairs and she pulled up her pantsOfficial Court Reporters21and went downstairs.The complainant then2began freaking out and asking Mr. Paulette how3he could do this to her.Mr. Paulette punched4her in the face, which cut her chin.Blood5went all over her clothes and on the floor.6The complainant continued yelling at7Mr. Paulette and he grabbed her by the neck8and pushed her to the floor and used her hair9to mop up the blood.He told her to \"shut the10fuck up, you stupid bitch\".The complainant11blacked out again and the next thing she12remembered was putting on her shoes and13running out the door into the minus 40 degree14weather, leaving behind her jacket, cell15phone, iPod, and a bag of clothes.When she16left the residence she did not know where17Jason Paulette was.18The complainant ran over to her friend19Ashleigh Stokes' residence which was a short20distance away.At Ms. Stokes' residence, she21knocked on the door.When there was no22immediate answer, she began banging on the23door, yelling and crying.24Ms. Stokes answered the door.The25complainant, in her evidence, testified that26Ashleigh Stokes asked her what happened and27she tried her best to explain.She was unableOfficial Court Reporters31to recall the words that she said when talking2to Ashleigh Stokes.There were portions of3the night that the complainant does not4remember as a result of blacking out due to5the consumption of alcohol and marijuana.She6does not recall any sexual relations with7Jason Paulette that night and said that she8did not consent to any sexual relations with9Jason Paulette.10Ashleigh Stokes also testified at the11trial and her evidence corroborates the12complainant's testimony about when the13complainant came to her residence early that14morning.15Ms. Stokes said that she was asleep at her16residence that morning.At around 4:30, she17heard knocking on her door.Initially she was18not going to answer the door but then she19heard yelling and screaming and realized that20it was the complainant so she got up and21answered the door.When she opened the door,22she saw the complainant, who was crying, her23hair was messy, there was blood on her face,24and she was shivering.She was not wearing a25jacket.She was wearing a sweater and jeans26which was not appropriate for the cold27weather.Official Court Reporters41The complainant said to Ashleigh Stokes2\"my cousin raped me\" over and over again.She3asked the complainant \"your cousin who?\" to4which the complainant responded \"my cousin5Jason raped me\".6Ashleigh Stokes took the complainant to7the hospital.A sexual assault examination8was later completed and Jason Paulette's9spermatozoa was located in the vaginal swab10and vaginal pool sample taken from the11complainant.12As the jury convicted Mr. Paulette of13sexual assault causing bodily harm, they must14have accepted the complainant's evidence about15the violence inflicted upon her by Mr.16Paulette which caused the injuries depicted in17the photographs.And they must have also18concluded that the assault causing bodily harm19occurred in circumstances of a sexual nature.20Defence counsel suggests that I cannot21conclude that the sexual intercourse between22Mr. Paulette and the complainant was23nonconsensual.He says there is simply not24enough evidence to draw a conclusion and that25a sexual assault causing bodily harm can arise26in circumstances where there was consensual27sexual contact which caused bodily harm.Official Court Reporters51In circumstances where the jury's verdict2leaves some ambiguity with respect to the3facts on which they have come to their4verdict, it is the obligation of the5sentencing Judge to come to their own6independent determination of the facts7consistent with the jury's verdict.I do not8have to come to a complete theory of the facts9but only to make those factual determinations10necessary to decide the appropriate sentence.11That is from The Queen v. Ferguson, a decision12of the Supreme Court of Canada from 2008.13In this case, the complainant, despite the14problems with her memory, was clear about what15she did remember.16She testified that in the basement, Jason17Paulette slapped the back of her head when she18was spending too much time on her phone.She19was scared and put the phone away.Prior to20this, they had not had sexual intercourse and21there had been no discussion of sexual22intercourse or any interactions of a sexual23nature.Then the complainant went upstairs to24the bathroom.While sitting on the toilet,25she blacked out.When she came to, she was on26the bathroom floor being choked by Jason27Paulette.When she feigned unconsciousness,Official Court Reporters61he stopped choking her and left the bathroom.2She pulled up her pants and went downstairs to3confront him and wanted to know how he could4do this to her.His response was to punch her5in the face which caused her chin to bleed.6She continued to yell at him, and he grabbed7her by the neck and pushed her to the floor8and used her hair to mop up the blood.She9blacked out again and when she came to, she10fled the residence.11Sometime during this series of events,12Jason Paulette would have had sexual13intercourse with the complainant.While the14complainant has no memory of the sexual15intercourse, I conclude that it was16nonconsensual.And I come to this conclusion17based upon the evidence and the circumstances18as related at trial.19The complainant blacked out in the20bathroom and her memories following that event21all involve Jason Paulette choking or22assaulting her.When she comes to in the23bathroom, she is being choked and her pants24are down and Jason Paulette is on top of her.25When she goes downstairs, he again assaults26her and she blacks out.It seems incredible27that consensual sexual intercourse would haveOfficial Court Reporters71occurred in these circumstances.2In addition, the complainant, when she3fled to Ashleigh Stokes' residence, told4Ashleigh Stokes that her cousin Jason had5raped her.This was a spontaneous utterance6which was subject to a voir dire at the trial.7While the complainant's injuries corroborate8that she had been assaulted, no one at that9point would suspect that there had been a10sexual aspect to what had happened to her11until she had said that she had been raped.12And when I say that, I mean she did not show13up at Ashleigh Stokes' residence naked or14missing clothing so that it would be clearer15to an observer that something sexual might16have happened.The complainant had no17knowledge of whether there would be any DNA18evidence and only she, when speaking with19Ashleigh Stokes, would have had knowledge of20the sexual contact between her and the21accused.At that point she had no reason to22lie about being sexually assaulted by the23accused.So when she said to Ashleigh Stokes24that her cousin Jason raped her, why would she25say that unless the intercourse between them26was not consensual?27The complainant's level of intoxicationOfficial Court Reporters81also raises concerns about her capacity to2consent to sexual intercourse.She had drank3beer and smoked marijuana to the point that4she blacked out several times during the5evening.As Jason Paulette was present while6the complainant consumed drugs and alcohol, he7should have been aware that the complainant8had consumed enough drugs and alcohol that her9capacity to consent due to intoxication might10be compromised.11In the circumstances, I find that Jason12Paulette had nonconsensual sexual intercourse13with the complainant.As stated above, I do14not need to come to a complete theory about15the facts so, other than saying that the16nonconsensual sexual intercourse happened17during a period when the complainant was18blacked out, I do not think it necessary to19come to a conclusion as to exactly when it20occurred in the sequence of events that night.21The complainant did not provide a victim22impact statement.Her father Wilfred Paulette23provided a brief one in which he wrote about24the impact this offence has had on the25complainant.It has been difficult for the26complainant to see the accused after the27offence, seeing him walking around on theOfficial Court Reporters91street as he was on release for a period of2time.She has had struggles with alcohol and3it continues to be tough for her to deal with4the offence.She is going to school and has5the support of her family.6I have no doubt that based on the facts,7hearing the complainant testify and seeing the8photographs of her injuries, that it has been9difficult for her.She suffered physical10injuries and emotional trauma.It will take11her time to heal and the psychological scars12may never heal.13Mr. Paulette, you and your lawyer spoke of14your problems, the issues that you need to15deal with, and the abuse that you suffered16while growing up.I hope you realize that17what you did to the complainant is similar to18what happened to you.You took the trust, the19trust of a family member, the relationship20that you had with the complainant, and broke21it in a violent and degrading way.You hurt22her physically and mentally, and I am not sure23that you fully appreciate that.But I hope24that, as part of a healing process that you do25come to that realization.26Mr. Paulette has a criminal record which27has been filed as an exhibit, and it is aOfficial Court Reporters101significant one.By my count, there are 332convictions on his criminal record and there3are some convictions which raise concerns for4the Court.5Mr. Paulette's criminal record begins in61993 with property offences and includes7numerous offences against the administration8of justice over the years.There are also9offences of violence.In 1995, he was10convicted of assault causing bodily harm and11received a fine and probation.In 1999, he12was convicted of assault and received a13sentence of a suspended sentence and14probation.In 2001, he was convicted of15assault, spousal assault, and a spousal16assault causing bodily harm, along with other17offences, and received a global sentence of 1218months.In 2010, Mr. Paulette was convicted19of a sexual assault and received a sentence of2021 months which was essentially a sentence of21time served as he had served ten and a half22months of remand time which was credited at23the rate of two to one.He was at that time24placed on a three year probation order which25required him to comply with a number of26conditions.And following his arrest on this27offence, he has three further convictionsOfficial Court Reporters111which have been entered for failing to comply2with conditions of his release.3Mr. Paulette is an aboriginal person and4this requires me to consider Section 718.2(e)5of the Criminal Code which states:6All available sanctions other than7imprisonment that are reasonable8in the circumstances should be9considered for all offenders, with10particular attention to the11circumstances of aboriginal12offenders.13The Supreme Court of Canada has given14directions to trial courts in how to interpret15this section in Gladue and, more recently, in16Ipeelee.I have considered the principles set17out in those cases and the requirement to18consider the unique systemic or background19factors which may have played a part in20bringing an aboriginal offender before the21Court and the type of sentencing procedures22and sanctions which might be appropriate23taking into account the circumstances of an24aboriginal offender's background.25I have heard that Jason Paulette is a26child of parents who attended residential27school and has suffered as a result of whatOfficial Court Reporters121happened to them.His parents struggled with2alcohol, abuse was a part of their lives, and3their ability to parent was negatively4affected by their residential school5experience.This obviously affected6Mr. Paulette to be surrounded, to witness this7on a daily basis can only have a negative8effect on a child.9I have also heard that Mr. Paulette was a10victim of sexual abuse by a family member and11it is apparent this has also had a profound12effect upon him and it is one that he is only13recently beginning to deal with.14Counsel for Mr. Paulette made thorough and15thoughtful submissions regarding16Mr. Paulette's background, and I won't repeat17everything that counsel and Mr. Paulette said18yesterday, but it is apparent that he has been19negatively affected by many of the factors20that are referred to in Gladue and Ipeelee.21But within this, I also heard some positive22things.23Mr. Paulette has a close relationship with24his mother and was very fond of his25great-great grandmother with whom he lived for26a period of time.They were, and in the case27of his mother, continue to be loving andOfficial Court Reporters131supportive parts of his life.He is also in a2loving relationship with his common-law spouse3who is committed to standing by him and4dealing with their problems.He has four5children who he loves and wants to be a better6father to.7Mr. Paulette's situation, while unique to8him, is not unusual in this jurisdiction.It9is unfortunate, heartbreaking really, but many10offenders who come before this Court have11lives that have been devastated by abuse and12the abuse of alcohol.Offenders have13witnessed their parents and family members14abuse each other and abuse alcohol.They have15begun abusing alcohol often at a relatively16young age and continue to do so as they grow17up and have children, and their abuse of18alcohol begins to affect their children.It19is a cycle that I hope you can break, Mr.20Paulette; if not for your sake then for your21children.22I accept there are factors in23Mr. Paulette's background which are relevant24to his aboriginal heritage and which25contribute to him being before this Court26today.At the same time the paramount27sentencing principles have to be deterrenceOfficial Court Reporters141and denunciation, which I will discuss2further.Overall, I do not think that the3factors referred to in Gladue and Ipeelee that4are applicable here are such that they can5involve consideration of anything but a6custodial sentence; and indeed, counsel for7Mr. Paulette is not suggesting that there is a8viable alternative to custody.9As acknowledged in Gladue, the more10violent and serious the offence the more11likely that a sentence of imprisonment for12aboriginal and non-aboriginal offenders will13be the same or close to the same.I have14taken the factors in Section 718.2(e) into15account in the overall sentencing.16There are a number of sentencing17principles that are engaged in this case.The18purposes and principles of sentencing are set19out in the Criminal Code.I am not going to20refer to all of them but I have considered the21principles enunciated in Section 718 to22Section 718.2.23The fundamental principle of sentencing is24that a sentence must be proportionate to the25gravity of the offence and the degree of26responsibility of the offender.The27fundamental purpose of sentencing is toOfficial Court Reporters151contribute to respect for the law and the2maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe3society by imposing just sanctions that have4one or more of the following objectives: to5denounce unlawful conduct; to deter the6offender and other persons from committing7offences; to separate offenders from society,8where necessary; and to assist in9rehabilitating offenders; to provide10reparations for harm done to victims or to the11community; to promote a sense of12responsibility in offenders, and13acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and14to the community.All of these factors are15applicable to one extent or another in this16case.17Crown and defence have each filed a book18of authorities with several cases and have19made very thorough helpful submissions.None20of the cases are exactly the same as this case21and even if they were, each sentencing has to22be approached individually taking into account23the facts of the offence and the circumstances24of the individual offender.The cases are25helpful in determining an appropriate range of26sentence and determining what sentencing27principles should be considered.Official Court Reporters161Sexual assault is a crime that occurs far2too often in the Northwest Territories.3As stated in The Queen v. Lafferty, 20114NWTSC 60 at paragraph 37:5Sexual assault is a crime that isterribly prevalent in the6Northwest Territories.ThisCourt, sadly, has cause to comment7on this fact very often becausethis Court very often has the task8of sentencing people for the crimeof sexual assault.These cases9seem to be happening in almostevery community in this10jurisdiction.They are committedby young people, middle-aged11people, sometimes older people.In particular, sexual assaults12committed against women or younggirls who are passed out or13intoxicated to the point of notbeing able to resist are very14frequent.15And it goes on later in the paragraph,16The fact that it happens sofrequently does not make it any17more understandable, does not makeit any less disturbing, and18certainly does not make it anyless wrong.1920I completely agree with the comments21expressed in Lafferty.It is sometimes hard22to believe that this offence occurs so often23in this jurisdiction, that a person can24demonstrate a complete disregard for the25sexual integrity of another person.And when26it is combined with the violence that was27present in this case, it is disheartening.Official Court Reporters171Because of the prevalence of this type of2offence in this jurisdiction, Courts have3repeatedly said that the sentencing principles4of deterrence and denunciation should be5emphasized.6Turning to the factors that are applicable7in this case, I do not see that there are any8mitigating factors.For example, Mr. Paulette9has not entered a guilty plea which can be a10significant mitigating factor.Mr. Paulette11had a trial, which is his right and it is not12aggravating that he did so, but what that13means is he does not get the mitigating effect14on sentencing of a guilty plea.15Mr. Paulette has not expressed any remorse16for this offence.An expression of remorse,17even after a trial, can have some weight.He18said that he hoped that the complainant would19get the treatment that she needed but I did20not hear any expression of remorse for what he21did to the complainant.22There are a number of aggravating factors23in this case.24The complainant was Mr. Paulette's first25cousin.They had a family relationship and26there was an element of trust in that27relationship.I agree with defence counselOfficial Court Reporters181that this was not a trust relationship per se2as exists in a spousal relationship or a3student/teacher relationship, but there is an4element of trust that arises in a family5situation.The complainant felt comfortable6enough to go to her cousin Mr. Paulette's7residence when his common-law spouse was away8and wanted to help him with his children.Mr.9Paulette's actions have shattered that trust10and this has had a broader impact than just on11the relationship between Mr. Paulette and the12complainant.It has caused a rift in their13family.14It is also aggravating that this offence15occurred while children were present in the16home.One of the more heartbreaking parts of17the evidence was hearing the complainant18testify that during the events one of the19children of Mr. Paulette was present and20witnessed part of what her father did to the21complainant.The complainant testified that22the daughter was crying.Just as Mr. Paulette23remembers his father abusing his mother, his24daughter will likely remember what she saw and25be negatively affected by what she witnessed.26The complainant in this case suffered27injuries which is obvious because Mr. PauletteOfficial Court Reporters191was convicted of sexual assault causing bodily2harm.But aside from that, there was3considerable violence inflicted on the4complainant.She was slapped, choked,5punched, pushed to the floor and her hair used6to mop up her own blood.Any one of these7acts of violence are objectionable but the8extreme violence inflicted upon the9complainant by Mr. Paulette is reprehensible.10I have already referred to Mr. Paulette's11criminal record but I want to speak more12specifically about the prior sexual assault on13his criminal record.14He was convicted of sexual assault on15April 26th, 2010.At that time he received a16sentence of time served which, as I mentioned,17was equivalent to 21 months in jail and a18three year probation order was imposed upon19him.He was required to comply with a number20of conditions, including not to consume or21possess alcohol.So at the time of this22offence he was still on his probation order,23he was consuming alcohol, and committed the24same type of offence for which he was on25probation.So I find that it was aggravating26that he was on probation at the time of this27offence and that he was specifically violatingOfficial Court Reporters201a term of his probation.2As I have mentioned, this is an offence3which was committed while Mr. Paulette was4under the influence of alcohol and drugs.Mr.5Paulette's counsel tells me that Mr. Paulette6wants to get help for his problems, including7his alcohol problem, and I think that8acknowledging that you have a problem is a9good first step and there are many more steps10to go in the healing process but I am hopeful11that this is a beginning.12The Crown filed a transcript of the13reasons for sentence from 2010 in their book14of authorities.In that case, Mr. Paulette15pled guilty on the day of his jury trial.The16facts in that case were that the complainant,17who was 16 years old, went to her aunt's house18because she was locked out of her residence.19Mr. Paulette was there and he was known to20her.She went into the house.She went to21the bathroom and when she emerged,22Mr. Paulette forced her into a bedroom and23onto a bed.He held her by the neck and had24sexual intercourse with her.25There are some similarities to the case26before the Court today.I note the comments27of Justice Cooper, when he stated at page 9:Official Court Reporters211Let there be no mistake.This wasa brutal and egregious act of2violence, a predatory offencewhere the accused displayed total3disregard for the personal andbodily integrity of this416-year-old girl.5In that case, there was a joint submission6of 21 months which, as I have said, was a7sentence of time served.The Court, in8passing sentence, acknowledged that the9sentence may seem inadequate but considered it10a unique case given the strong family support11and prospects for rehabilitation.I view the12sentence that you received, Mr. Paulette, in13the circumstances of that case as at the low14end of the range.Indeed, acknowledging the15principles that bind a Court when a joint16sentence is presented, I am of the view that17you received a significant break.And I am18saying this because I think that you were19given an opportunity that many offenders are20not.The Court took a chance on your21rehabilitation and heard that you were taking22programs while in jail and had strong family23support and strong prospects for24rehabilitation.So it is unfortunate that you25are here again today.26Now I have heard that your father was not27there for you, did not follow up with theOfficial Court Reporters221commitment that he made, and that too is2unfortunate.But ultimately you are here3today in the same position because of the4choices that you made.And that's where5taking responsibility for who you are and what6you have done comes into play.Despite your7past and the failures of your family, you are8still responsible for your actions.9So, Mr. Paulette, the sentence that I am10about to impose I hope sends several messages.11First, it expresses society's condemnation of12your conduct.What that means is that the13people of the Northwest Territories, the14people of Fort Smith, do not think it is okay15to violently sexually assault someone.They16are disgusted by this type of behaviour.17Secondly, it must deter other people from18contemplating doing this type of thing.So it19has to tell people that this is the type of20sentence that you will face if you choose to21act the way that Mr. Paulette did, and22hopefully this sentence will make them think23twice.24And lastly, it must specifically deter25you, and when I say that I mean you never26sexually assault another person again.27I also think it is necessary to separateOfficial Court Reporters231you from society.As it stands, you pose a2risk to women, particularly when you are under3the influence of alcohol or drugs.And4separation from society will also permit you5to take programs and attempt to deal with your6issues so hopefully you can be rehabilitated7and I do think your rehabilitation is8important.But in the circumstances, it9cannot be the primary sentencing objective but10it is still an important factor.11Mr. Paulette was originally released on12this -- he was in custody on this offence from13December 8th, 2011 to April 4th, 2012.He was14on consent remand.He was released after a15show cause and was on conditions for a period16of time but was placed back into custody again17on October 17th, 2013.He was sentenced on18November 20th, 2013 to a sentence of four19months for two breaches.At that time his20pre-trial custody to that point, which I take21being the custody that he had most recently22served, was taken into account, so the 11823days which had previously been his remand24time, was not taken into account in that25sentence.So his sentence on the four months26would have expired on January 15th, 2014.On27January 23rd, 2014, Mr. Paulette was sentencedOfficial Court Reporters241to another 30 days consecutive for another2breach.And that sentence would have expired3on February 18, 2014.4So for this offence, today, there are5three periods that I understand for which6Mr. Paulette has not received credit for his7pre-trial custody.So the period from8December 8th, 2011 to April 4th, 2012; from9January 15th to 23rd; and February 18th to10today, of this year, which comes to 126 days11of pre-trial custody.12Now, pursuant to Section 719(3.1) of the13Criminal Code, the maximum credit available14for Mr. Paulette's remand time could be up to15one and a half days for each day spent in16custody, which can be granted if the17circumstances justify it.18The issue of what circumstances justify an19increase up to one and a half days credit for20each day in custody has been the subject of21some litigation and differences across Canada.22However, it has been accepted in this Court23that the circumstances that can justify24enhanced credit do not have to be exceptional25or only occur in rare situations.They do26however have to be applicable to the specific27accused who is before the Court.Official Court Reporters251As was stated in The Queen v. Green, 20132NWTSC 20, at paragraph 78:3There is nothing automatic aboutenhanced credit.The onus is on4the person being sentenced to showon a balance of probabilities that5the circumstances do justifyenhanced credit being granted.67This can be done in a variety of ways -8through viva voce evidence or, as was done in9this way, counsel for Mr. Paulette, who is an10Officer of the Court, having spoken with11somebody who is familiar and reliable with12respect to the circumstances of the offender's13pre-trial custody.14So in this case, counsel for Mr. Paulette15spoke with Richard Keppel who is a sentence16administrator with Corrections and familiar17with Mr. Paulette's circumstances so counsel18for Mr. Paulette is seeking enhanced credit19for his remand time.His basis for doing so20is that he would have earned remission for21most of the period he would have been a22serving prisoner, if he had been a serving23prisoner, and that he was not able to take24programs for a couple of reasons; one, he was25the lowest priority as he was a remand26prisoner and not a serving prisoner, so he has27the lowest priority for programs; and thatOfficial Court Reporters261there were no programs that were offered while2he was in remand that were appropriate for his3situation, although he did attend AA which I4understand is available to all persons who are5in custody.6With respect to remission, as was noted in7The Queen v. Manilaq, 2012 NWTSC 48 (CanLII):8Where there is credibleinformation that is presented to9the Court that a prisoner onremand would have earned remission10if they had been a servingprisoner, that is a relevant11consideration in deciding whethercredit for remand time should be12calculated on an enhanced basis.13I imagine there are a variety of other14circumstances that could justify enhanced15credit being given for remand time.And it16could even be that when a person has behaved17very well on remand time, the Court may decide18not to grant credit on an enhanced basis.In19my view, the exercise of discretion in the20area has to be based on the specific21circumstances of each case and not by applying22an automatic approach.23In this case, I am told that Mr. Paulette24was involved in a couple of minor incidents25while in remand such that if he were a serving26prisoner, he would have lost approximately27five days remission.In the circumstances, IOfficial Court Reporters271am not satisfied that Mr. Paulette should earn2enhanced credit for his remand time.I am3going to adjust his pre-sentence credit4slightly in order to simplify the calculations5of Mr. Paulette's sentence.6Please stand, Mr. Paulette.7Taking into account the circumstances,8your aboriginal background and the applicable9sentencing principles, I am satisfied that an10appropriate sentence for the sexual assault11causing bodily harm is five years12incarceration.You will be given credit for13the 126 days pre-sentence custody, which I14will round up to five months for simplicity,15leaving a sentence of four years and seven16months to be served.17You may sit down.18I will recommend that you be given19consideration to take any sexual offender20treatment and substance abuse treatment21programs that are suitable as soon as it is22possible.23As well, pursuant to Section 743.21,24there will be an order prohibiting you from25contacting the complainant directly or26indirectly while you are in custody.27With respect to the ancillary orders,Official Court Reporters281there will be a firearm prohibition order2pursuant to Section 109 of the Criminal Code.3It will begin today and end ten years after4your release from prison.5Having heard the submissions of counsel6yesterday, and I heard the request today with7respect to a Section 113 exemption, I am8satisfied in the circumstances that a9Section 113 exemption should be granted so10that you can apply to the chief firearms11officer or the registrar for a license or12registration certificate subject to any13conditions that they may impose.14The sexual assault causing bodily harm is15a primary designated offence and there will be16a DNA order.17There will also be an order pursuant to18the Sexual Offender Information Registration19Act.And as you have previously been subject20to a SOIRA order for the conviction in 2010,21the duration of the order will be for life.22Mr. Paulette, I hope that you will take23the opportunity offered by this sentence to24try and address some of your problems.It25seems clear to me, and I think that you26recognize as well based on what your lawyer27said yesterday and what you said, that youOfficial Court Reporters291need help and so I hope that you will follow2up on that because at this point, it is really3up to you.The corrections system can offer4you all of the programs they want but unless5you are willing to commit and take them and6really make an effort, then that's when we7will know whether there is going to be8success.9If you want to be there for your children,10to be a better father for your children than11your father was to you, then I think you need12to do something about that and it's not too13late to change and become a positive role14model for your children.15Counsel, neither counsel made any16submissions with respect to the victim of17crime surcharge.18MR. HANSEN:I would ask that it be19waived in the circumstances.The offence20occurred before the recent amendments and it21would be a hardship given that he will be22incarcerated for some time.I understand it23is a, relatively speaking, small amount of24money but for a person of Mr. Paulette's25means, it is a larger amount than would occur26to any of us who are gainfully employed during27that time.Official Court Reporters301THE COURT:Thank you.Ms. Lakusta.2MS. LAKUSTA:No opposition to that, Your3Honour.4THE COURT:I agree that as this offence5occurred prior to the changes, which make it6mandatory, that it is still open to me to7waive the victim of crime surcharge because of8hardship and given the sentence that has been9imposed and having heard about Mr. Paulette's10circumstances, I am satisfied that it should11be waived as a result of hardship.12All right, counsel, is there anything13else?14MS. LAKUSTA:Not from the Crown.15THE COURT:I want to thank you,16counsel, for your work on this trial and your17submissions.18MR. HANSEN:Thank you.19-------------------------------------20Certified to be a true andaccurate transcript pursuant21to Rules 723 and 724 of theSupreme Court Rules,2223242526____________________________27Lois Hewitt,Court ReporterOfficial Court Reporters31"}

C.J.S.C.:T.J.M., a young person age 17, to whom the Young Offenders Act R.S.C. 1985 c.Y‑1 applies, appeared in Dartmouth Court on November 29, 1994, for offences alleged to have occurred in Dartmouth November 16 to 19, 1994. He was already in custody, was arraigned and bail was denied. He was to enter pleas on December 1, 1994. While being transported through Bedford on the afternoon of December 1, he escaped from a Sheriff and jumped a guard rail into the Sackville River. He was wearing leg shackles and tried to swim across the river. The Deputy followed him into the water and took him back into custody. On December 8, an information was laid charging him with escaping lawful custody and wilfully failing to comply with a Probation Order dated June 15, 1994.On December 15, he entered pleas on the Dartmouth offences and the trial date was set for December 19. On that day he was convicted of a number of offences and sentenced to a total of 12 months secure custody and 6 months probation with conditions. (Some sentences were consecutive and others concurrent.)On December 21 he plead guilty to the escape charge and the breach of probation charge was withdrawn. The Learned Trial Judge held he should impose a one month consecutive sentence to discourage this type of offence. He recognized T.J.M. would not receive any time off the 12 month sentence already imposed.The defence appeals from the consecutive sentence. The grounds of appeal are:(1) That the Order making the disposition consecutive to the sentence being served by the Appellant at the time, is erroneous in law; and(2) The Order exceeded the jurisdiction of a Provincial Court Judge.Because in this appeal the chronological order of the relevant events is crucial, they are set out as follows:\"November 16‑19, 1994Commission of Dartmouth offences.November 29, 1994Information laid on Dartmouth offences. In custody on Dartmouth offences. Arraignment. Bail denial. Entering of pleas adjourned to December 1, 1994.December 1, 1994Commission of Bedford offences while being transported to Dartmouth.December 8, 1994Information laid on Bedford offences.December 15, 1994Pleas entered on Dartmouth offences.

Sentenced to 12 months custody and 6 months probation with conditions.December 21, 1994In custody in Bedford to face charges. Breach offence withdrawn. Conviction and Disposition on Escape offence. Sentenced to 1 month custody, consecutive to Dartmouth dispositions.January 19, 1994Notice of Appeal of Bedford disposition filed.\" (p. 3 Appellant's factum)Does a Youth Court Judge have the authority to order a disposition concerning a Young Offender be served consecutively to dispositions the Young Offender is then under, even though at the time of the offence, the Young Offender was not under such dispositions? The answer is no.There is no general or inherent power in a Court to impose consecutive sentences. Such power must be found in a federal enactment (R. v. C. (W.J.) (1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 253 at 256 quoting from Paul v The Queen (1982), 1982 CanLII 179 (SCC), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 97 (C.C.)).Section 20 of the Young Offenders Act deals with the power to impose consecutive sentences on Young Offenders and states:\"(4.1)Where a disposition is made under this section in respect of an offence committed by a young person after the commencement of, but before the completion of, any dispositions made in respect of previous offences committed by the young person,(b)the disposition may be served consecutively to the dispositions made in respect of the previous offences,\"This has been interpreted to mean a judge acts without jurisdiction when the judge imposes a consecutive disposition on a young offender not actually under a prior disposition at the time of commission of the offence for which the young offender is being sentenced (see R. v. C.(W.J.); R. v. J.M.C. (1990), 1990 CanLII 5424 (NS CA), 96 N.S.R. (2d) 179; R. v. M.A.S. (1991), 1991 CanLII 4567 (NS CA), 102 N.S.R. (2d) 177; R. v. R.J.F. (1994), 1994 CanLII 7611 (NS CA), 132 N.S.R. (2d) 82 (C.A.; and T.M v. R. (N.S.C.A. Oct. 4, 1994 C.A.C. No. 108947 unreported). In the present case, T.J.M. was charged, but not under any disposition on December 1 when he committed the offence of escaping lawful custody. He was in custody for the Dartmouth charges but had not yet entered pleas or been sentenced. He was not sentenced for escaping lawful custodyuntil December 21.There has been an error in law and the Learned Trial Judge exceeded his jurisdiction by ordering a consecutive sentence. It happened because the significance of the sentencing order of the events in the Dartmouth and Bedford Courts was not brought to the attention of the Honourable Judge Stroud before he imposed the one month consecutive sentence.The Appeal is allowed and an order will issue directing the disposition of one month consecutive to the twelve months shall be changed to one month concurrent to time being served.Constance R.

Gillette for Her Majesty the Queen.Mr. R. Regular for Ms. Denney.DECISION OF GORMAN, P.C. J.(SENTENCE)INTRODUCTION:[1]Ms. Denney was convicted of the offences of dangerous driving and failing to stop/evading the police, contrary to sections 249(1)(a) and 249.1(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada, RSC 1985 (the Criminal Code).The Crown proceeded by way of summary conviction in relation to both counts and the matter was adjourned for the imposition of sentence.The primary issue for consideration is whether or not this is an appropriate case for the Court to grant Ms. Denney a “discharge.”[2]For the reasons that will follow herein, I have concluded that this is not an appropriate case to do so.Let me explain my reasons for this conclusion by commencing with a review of the circumstances of the two offences committed by Ms. Denney.THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT THE TRIAL[3]The evidence presented at the trial established that on February 4, 2006, Ms. Denney’s husband informed her that he was having an affair with another woman (Ms. Rice).Ms. Denney became very upset.She testified that she ran out of her house, without any footwear on, and drove toward Ms. Rice’s residence in Deer Lake.She conceded that she did so in order to “confront” Ms. Rice.[4]After a confrontation occurred at Mrs. Rice’s residence, the police were contacted.The police located Ms. Denney driving her motor vehicle on the highway.After they engaged their emergency equipment, Ms. Denney pulled her vehicle over to the side of the road.As the officers were speaking to Ms. Denney, one of them (Constable Hyde) noticed that Ms. Denney was reaching for the gear shift of her vehicle.He banged on the driver’s side window several times and yelled to Ms. Denney not to move the vehicle.[5]Ms. Denney ignored the officer and moved her vehicle back onto the highway.While doing so, she almost ran over Constable Hyde’s foot.He estimated that he was within two feet of Ms. Denney’s vehicle when she pulled it back on to the highway from its parked position.The other officer (Constable Letto) had to “jump back” as a result of the manner in which Ms. Denney pulled on to the highway.[6]After Ms. Denney pulled on to the highway, the two officers ran back to their vehicle and began to pursue her.Their emergency equipment was engaged.As the officers were pursuing Ms. Denney, they received a call from another officer indicating that there were concerns that Ms. Denney was suicidal and might purposely drive off of the road if they continued their pursuit.As a result, the officers turned off their emergency equipment and terminated the pursuit.Both officers testified that Ms. Denney did not stop.They both indicated that they had pursued Ms. Denney for a brief period of time before stopping.Constable Letto estimated their pursuit to have lasted approximately fifteen seconds.[7]Ms. Denney conceded that she was aware that the police vehicle was behind her and that it had its emergency equipment engaged.She agreed that she failed to stop.She testified at the trial that she failed to do so because she “wanted to go home.”[8]In my reasons for convicting Ms. Denney of the offence of dangerous driving, I wrote ([2007] N.J. No. 181, at paragraphs 58 and 59):I am satisfied that the Crown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Denney pulled on to the highway from where she had stopped without checking to determine if there were any vehicles coming behind her and without checking to determine where Constable Hyde was standing.I am also satisfied that she continued to pull on to the highway even though Constable Hyde was banging on her vehicle’s window.Her evidence that she thought Constable Hyde was going to hit her, is an illustration of how unreliable Ms. Denney’s evidence is.This was a fanciful description of her state of mind at the time.I am satisfied that driving from a parked position onto a two lane highway without checking to see if any other vehicle is proceeding on the highway behind you, while two police officers are standing in extremely close proximity to your vehicle and one of them is banging on your vehicle’s window to stop, constitutes a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe.A reasonable person would not have endangered the safety of two police officers that were in such a position nor pulled on to the highway in the manner that Ms. Denney did.I accept that Ms. Denney was very upset.This is what caused her to act in such a dangerous manner.Her evidence, for instance, that she drove away from the police officers because she wanted to go home, illustrates her lack of attention to her actual situation on February 4, 2006, and the potential consequences of operating her vehicle in the manner in which she did.A reasonable person in Ms. Denney’s situation on February 4, 2006, would also have been very upset.However, a reasonable person would have gotten out of his or her vehicle when requested by the police to do so and would never have operated a motor vehicle in the manner which Ms. Denney did.[9]In convicting Ms. Denney of the offence of evading the police, I concluded as follows (at paragraph 67):The evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Denney was aware, after she drove back onto the highway, that a police vehicle was pursuing her with its emergency equipment engaged.The evidence also establishes that despite this knowledge she failed to stop.Though the police vehicle was behind Ms. Denney for a maximum of fifteen seconds, Ms. Denney’s had a reasonable and practicable period of time in which to stop, but failed to do so.I am satisfied that she failed to do so because she wanted to evade being apprehended.Thus, the Crown has proven both the actus reus and mens rea elements of the offence.Ms. Denney testified that she failed to stop because she wanted to go home.This does not constitute a reasonable excuse for failing to stop.THE CRIMINAL CODE’S SENTENCING PROVISIONS[10]Section 718 of the Criminal Code states that the fundamental purpose of sentencing “is to contribute…to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society.”This is to be achieved by imposing sentences which have, among others, the following objectives:- separating offenders from society, where necessary;- denouncing unlawful conduct;- general deterrence;- rehabilitation; and- the promoting of a “sense of responsibility in offenders, andacknowledgement of the harm done to victims and the community.”[11]Section 718.2(d) states that “an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances” and section 718.2(e) states that “all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.”[12]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code states that any sentence imposed must be “proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree ofresponsibility of the offender.”[13]In this particular case, the Crown did not seek to have a period of imprisonment imposed upon Ms. Denney, and considering the circumstances of what occurred, this was an appropriate approach for Crown counsel to take.Ms. Denney’s actions appear to have arisen as a result of the specific circumstances of February 4, 2006.They can be fairly described as uncharacteristic of her and seen as an isolated reaction which is unlikely to be repeated.However, it must also be noted that her actions were very dangerous.She came very close to injuring a police officer and this must always be seen as a significant aggravating factor in sentencing.As recently pointed out by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in R. v. Marsman, 2007 NSCA 65 (CanLII), “Police officers, day in and day out, serve and protect our communities from harm.When they are attacked, in many ways, we are all victimized.”Thus, for the type of offences committed by Ms. Denney in this case, the Court must stress the sentencing principles of general deterrence and denunciation.Any sentence imposed must attempt to discourage members of the public from driving in a dangerous manner and encourage them to cooperate with the police when stopped by them and to refrain from attempting to evade the police so as to prevent the type of harm and injury which can result from police pursuits (see R. v. A.J.P.S. (2006), 35 M.V.R. (5th) 247 (B.C.P.C.) and R. v. Roberts (2004), 2005 ABCA 11 (CanLII), 192 C.C.C. (3d) 462 (Alta. C.A.)).Having said this, in R. v. Angelillo (2006), 2006 SCC 55 (CanLII), 214 C.C.C. (3d) 309, the Supreme Court of Canada indicated that “sentencing is an individualized process in which the court must take into account not only the circumstances of the offence, but also the specific circumstances of the offender.”[14]In this particular case, the Court was provided with very little information concerning Ms. Denney’s background or present circumstances.The Court was advised by counsel that she is thirty-nine years of age and is presently employed on a full time basis.Both parties agreed that she does not have a criminal record.No evidence was presented which would establish what impact, if any, the entering of a conviction would specifically have upon Ms. Denney.THE CRIMINAL CODE’S DISCHARGE PROVISION[15]The Court’s authority to grant an offender a discharge is found in section 730(1) of the Criminal Code:Where an accused, other than an organization, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence, other than an offence for which a minimum punishment is prescribed by law or an offence punishable by imprisonment for fourteen years or for life, the court before which the accused appears may, if it considers it to be in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of convicting the accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged absolutely or on the conditions prescribed in a probation order made under subsection 731(2).[16]As can be seen, this provision allows the Court to refrain from entering a conviction, despite proof that an offence has been committed, if satisfied two prerequisites exist.The Court must be satisfied that a discharge is:1.in the best interests of the offender; and2.not contrary to the public interest.[17]In R. v. Elsharawy (1997), 1997 CanLII 14708 (NL CA), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 565 (N.L.C.A.), the Court of Appeal considered these two prerequisites and stated:For the Court to exercise its discretion to grant a discharge under s. 730 of the Criminal Code, the Court must consider that that type of disposition is: (i) in the best interests of the accused: and (ii) not contrary to the public interest.The first condition presupposes that the accused is a person of good character, usually without previous conviction or discharge, that he does not require personal deterrence or rehabilitation and that a criminal conviction may have significant adverse repercussions.The second condition involves a consideration of the principle of general deterrence with attention being paid to the gravity of the offence, its incidence in the community, public attitudes towards it and public confidence in the effective enforcement of the criminal law.See R. v. Fallofield (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 450 (BCCA) and R. v. Waters (1990), 1990 CanLII 7561 (SK QB), 54 C.C.C. (3d) 40 (Sask.QB).[18]In R. v. O’Keefe, [2006] N.J. No. 290, I had the opportunity to consider Elsharawy and the principles applicable to determining when a discharge should be granted.At paragraphs 25 and 26, I suggested that a generous approach should be adopted:Beyond the statutory prerequisites set out in the section itself, there are no offences which are immune from the application of section 730(1).However, a discharge will not usually be imposed for a serious offence or upon an offender with a criminal record (see R. v. D.P., [2004] N.J. No. 38 (P.C.)).However, this is not an absolute rule.Discharges have been granted to offenders with previous convictions (see for instance, R. v. L.H.B, 2006 NLTD 87 (CanLII), [2006] N.J. No. 149 (S.C.)) and for relatively serious offences (see for instance, Burke and Morgan).In some cases, the nature of the offence will be such that the principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code would be offended by the granting of a discharge, particularly the sentencing principle of general deterrence (see R. v. Roberts (2004), 2004 SKCA 153 (CanLII), 190 C.C.C. (3d) 504 (Sask. C.A.)).Thus, in R. v. Smith, [2005] N.J. No. 102 (P.C.), Judge Porter, at paragraph 18, declined to grant the offender a discharge because he concluded that the “principles of sentencing, including denunciation, general and specific deterrence, and the protection of society would not be achieved by granting the Accused a discharge.It is not in the public interest to do so, and the request for a discharge is accordingly denied” (also see R. v. Watson (1999), 1998 CanLII 13310 (NL SCTD), 168 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 172 (N.L.C.A.), R. v. Styles (2000), 2000 CanLII 28803 (NL SCTD), 189 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 116 (N.L.S.C.), at paragraph 44, R. v. Fitzpatrick (2005), 2005 NLTD 76 (CanLII), 248 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 104 (S.C.), at paragraphs 55 to 57 and R. v. Collier, 2006 NBCA 92 (CanLII), [2006] N.B.J. No. 371 (C.A.)).Having said this, for minor offences committed by first time offenders, a generous approach to the application of section 730(1) of the Criminal Code is desirable.In those cases, a discharge will be entirely consistent with the principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code and drawing a distinction between a discharge and a suspended sentence will serve no practical or academic purpose.If a court is debating between these two sanctions in such a case, then it should feel comfortable in granting a conditional discharge.SENTENCING PRECEDENTS[19]In R. v. Penney and Bennett (2001), 2001 CanLII 5245 (NL PC), 208 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 126 (N.L.P.C.), the two accused pled guilty to a number of offences.One of the offences to which Mr. Penney entered a plea of guilty was the offence of dangerous driving.I described the circumstances of that offence as follows:At 6:50 p.m. on November 19th, 2001, an officer of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary attempted to stop a motor vehicle for speeding.When the police officer activated the emergency lights the vehicle accelerated and the officer gave chase.Eventually the vehicle struck a guard rail when attempting to navigate a turn.Mr. Bennett got out of the passenger door and ran into the woods.He would be subsequently arrested, later that evening, at the Western Memorial Regional Hospital, in Corner Brook, by correctional officers who were there guarding Mr. Penney.Mr. Penny, the driver of the vehicle, got out of the vehicle, after the accident, and jumped over the guard rail.Apparently he did not realize that the drop was approximately thirty feet.Mr. Penney had recently moved to Corner Brook from Ontario.His counsel described Mr. Penney's injuries as \"significant.\"[20]For the dangerous driving offence, I imposed a period of two months incarceration and a twelve month driving prohibition.[21]In R. v. Hardy, 2005 CanLII 7643 (NL PC), [2005] N.J. No. 92 (P.C.), the accused pled guilty to having failed to stop as directed by a police officer.The trial judgesummarized the circumstances of what occurred as follows:Monday night, March 21, 2005, at around six p.m., the Accused was seen driving a blue Chevrolet pickup truck in Marystown. The truck had tinted windows, and so Constable Bradbury activated the lights and siren of his marked police car and stopped the pickup. The Accused identified himself by means of an Alberta driver’s licence. He was issued a summary offence information for the tinted windows, and the police officer noted some other defects with the vehicle, including excessive glare from the lights and a defective parking brake.While the police officer was getting back into the police car with the documents provided for the vehicle by the Accused, the latter said \"you fucking idiot, I’m not staying here\", put the truck in gear and left the scene.The Accused did not get very far before the constable stopped him again, approximately two hundred meters away, in the vicinity of the apartment building where the Accused’s parents live.[22]The trial judge concluded that the imposition of a suspended sentence was appropriate.[23]In R. v. Fry (2005), 2005 NLTD 190 (CanLII), 252 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 59 (N.L.S.C.), the accused was convicted of the offences of impaired driving and dangerous driving.He had driven his father's pickup truck into a residence causing serious property damage to the residence and his father's vehicle.He had a previous criminal record which was alcohol-related.For the dangerous driving offence, the trial judge imposed a period of twelve months imprisonment to be served on a conditional basis.[24]In R. v. MacDonald, [2007] N.J. No. 115 (S.C.), the accused pled guilty to a number of offences, including evading the police.The trial judge described the circumstances of the offences committed by Mr. MacDonald, including the section 249.1(1) offence, as follows:During the early morning of August 15th, Mr. MacDonald was at the home of Ms. King at which time he had blocked off her vehicle. There was an incident at that stage. Subsequent to this happening, the actions involving the offences that I just described actually took place. The facts disclose that Mr. MacDonald, after calling the residence of Ansel King looking for Ms. King, actually went into the residence with a loaded firearm. He then grabbed Ms. King by the neck. He ordered Mr. King to be seated and Mr. Guinchard to sit on the floor. The firearm was pointed at them. Mr. MacDonald was not shy about displaying the fact that the gun was loaded and he did so by ejecting a shell and then reloading the firearm.He eventually left the residence after some discussion took place. Ms. King acted in a manner which attempted to diffuse the situation, suggesting they go to the airport to pick up a relative. She attempted to have him leave the firearm behind but he would not do so. The police went looking for Mr. MacDonald and Ms. King, eventually followed him, and then had to box him in with police cars in order to have him stop his vehicle.[25]The trial judge imposed a period of thirty-three months imprisonment, including three months for the section 249.1(1) offence.ANALYSIS[26]In considering whether or not to impose a discharge, I begin with the observation that Ms. Denney’s offences cannot be fairly characterized as minor ones.She purposely placed two police officers at risk of harm.In addition, though Ms. Denney has no previous convictions and the sentencing principle of specific deterrence is not required to be emphasized, no evidence was placed before the Court to establish that a criminal conviction would or might cause significant adverse repercussions for her.Though I would hesitate to conclude that the presentation of such evidence is a mandatory requirement for a discharge to be granted, it does make it difficult for the Court to conclude that a discharge is in Ms. Denney’s best interests, beyond it being in the interest of every offender.In addition, as pointed out earlier, this case requires a concentration on the sentencing principles of general deterrence and denunciation.These sentencing principles cannot be satisfied in this case by the imposition of a discharge because of the seriousness of Ms. Denney’s actions and the potential harm she subjected two police officers to.Thus, I conclude that the imposition of a discharge in this case would be contrary to the public interest and therefore I decline to impose such a sentence.What then is an appropriate sentence?[27]As indicated earlier, the imposition of a period of imprisonment is not in issue.Placing Ms. Denney on probation is not required or useful and I am not satisfied that a driving prohibition is required.I have concluded that the principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code can be satisfied in thiscase through the imposition of the following fines:1.for the dangerous driving offence, a fine of $1,000.00;2.for the offence of evading the police, a fine of $250.00; and3.for each offence, the imposition of a victim fine surcharge of $100.00.[28]Pursuant to section 734.1 of the Criminal Code, the fines imposed must be paid to the Provincial Court of Newfoundland and Labrador at a minimum rate of $300.00 per month, with the first payment being made on July 31, 2007 and the subsequent payments being made each month thereafter until paid in full.The victim fine surcharges imposed must be paid to the Provincial Court of Newfoundland and Labrador within thirty days of the date of this sentencing judgement.[1][29]Judgement accordingly.[1] The Court was not provided with any information as regards Ms. Denney’s level of income.Thus, the monthly payments have been set in the absence of the type of evidence which should be presented at a sentence hearing.However, this is not a cause for concern as Ms. Denney can apply to the Court for a variation of the section 734.1 order, if the amount set out as a monthly payment proves onerous."}

Van Dongen- and -)forthe Respondent))Appealheard:GENE MICHAEL DUMASSOLDAT)November1, 2011)(Accused) Respondent)Judgmentdelivered:)May 3, 2012MONNIN J.A.1The Crown appeals from a conditional sentence of two years less a day imposed after a guilty plea to one count of possession of goods valued in excess of $5,000 obtained by crime, in this case a truck.Background2A discussion of this particular accused’s background leading up to the sentence imposed by the Provincial Court is important to appreciate the arguments of the Crown and defence.3Although only 23 years old at the time of sentencing, to say that the accused has an extensive criminal record is an understatement.At the time of the offence, he had been on parole for a few months after serving a five-year sentence for various theft and driving offences.This conviction, to which he pleaded guilty, was his 77th motor vehicle related conviction since 2002.4On March 10, 2010, he was released on parole after serving part of a five-year sentence for motor vehicle related offences.On a previous appeal, this court had this to say about this particular accused:The sentencing judge took these mitigating factors into account.We acknowledge that this sentence is a heavy one for a youthful offender serving his first adult sentence.However, this is a unique situation.From the age of 12 to 17, this offender accumulated 81 prior convictions, 69 of which related to motor vehicles.He has had virtually every type of disposition available under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1, including five periods of supervised probation.His pre-sentence report confirms, unfortunately, that his entire identity revolves around the theft of motor vehicles, which brings him status and recognition among his fellow gang members.His attempts to evade capture have led to several dangerous police chases and the offences in question were committed when he was at large as a sentenced prisoner for related offences.His behaviour is unacceptable and dangerous.Despite the accused’s youth, the sentence imposed must still be proportionate to the gravity of the offences committed.5The facts concerning this particular appeal are that between July 4 and 5, 2010, the accused came into possession of a stolen truck.On July 8, 2010, he drove that vehicle to a local supermarket.The police came upon the stolen vehicle.When the accused exited the store, he saw the police and left the area.He was arrested approximately one week later.The matter was scheduled for court on December 20, 2010, but, as several witnesses did not attend, the trial was adjourned.Originally charged for stealing the motor vehicle and other offences, he pled guilty to the lesser count of possessing goods obtained by crime and the other charges were stayed.At the sentencing hearing on April 27, 2011, the Crown sought a sentence of two years while the accused proposed a sentence of time in custody (roughly two and one-half months) and probation.At the end of the sentencing submissions of both counsel, the sentencing judge on his own raised the possibility of a conditional sentence.He appeared to be seeking input from the accused’s counsel as to whether the accused would abide by the strict conditions of that type of sentence.He stated:And so that rather than, than doing it automatically off the top I offer to individuals the, the avoidance of going to jail or the fact of just spending whatever the set time would be and not having conditions that they have to meet from now for the next two years.He advised counsel that it’s an option that he is considering.Prophetically, he stated:.… I am concerned with, with his record, that we are looking at if it’s an automatic breach within a matter of a month or two, then he’s coming back and he’s looking at two years in jail ….6After obtaining a response from the accused’s counsel that he would prefer a conditional sentence, the sentencing judge then proceeded to impose one.7Just over a month later, the accused breached his conditional sentence by being away from his home outside the terms of his curfew.He was sighted by police and followed back to his home approximately 40 minutes beyond the time that he was supposed to have returned.He was brought back before the sentencing judge who had imposed the conditional sentence on a breach of the conditional sentence.The sentencing judge declined to terminate the conditional sentence, but instead suspended it for eight months.Standard of Review8There is no dispute as to the standard of review on this sentence appeal.Deference must be shown to the sentencing judge’s decision.Absent an error in principle or failure to consider a relevant sentencing principle, we should only intervene if the sentence is demonstrably unfit.See R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500 at para. 90; and R. v. Ruizfuentes (H.S.), 2010 MBCA 90 (CanLII) at para. 7, 258 Man.R. (2d) 220.Crown’s Position9The Crown argues that the sentencing judge reached his conclusion with respect to the imposition of a conditional sentence in error.It argues that he commenced from a starting point that he wished to impose a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment, but offered the accused the option of a conditional sentence in which case the sentence would be increased to two years less a day.In addition, he failed to perform an assessment of the risk posed by the accused if permitted to serve the sentence in the community, which is a requirement for the imposition of any conditional sentence.In its submission, the accused, with his lengthy list of criminal convictions, is not a suitable candidate for a conditional sentence.Accordingly, it argues that the sentencing judge proceeded in a fashion that amounted to an error in principle and led to a sentence that was unfit.Accused’s Position10The accused’s argument is that the sentencing judge was entitled to consider the option of a conditional sentence as opposed to a term of imprisonment of 12 months, which he had articulated.He argues that the sentencing judge’s inquiries of defence counsel were only to ascertain the accused’s willingness and ability to comply with a conditional sentence if imposed.It was not a delegation of that decision to the accused as argued by the Crown.11As to the position of the Crown that no risk assessment was undertaken, the defence points to this court’s decision in R. v. Allison (D.C.), 2005 MBCA 141 (CanLII), 201 Man.R. (2d) 109, to the effect that a sentencing judge is not presumed to ignore facts simply because they are not mentioned in the reasons.As well, in R. v. Olotu (T.A.), 2004 MBCA 146 (CanLII), 187 Man.R. (2d) 232, the court found an assessment of the risk by looking at the submissions of counsel along with the questions of the court.In this case, counsel argues that comments by the sentencing judge and his questions of defence counsel indicate that the assessment was performed by the sentencing judge, although not explicitly referred to by him in his reasons.AnalysisLaw on Conditional Sentences12In R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, the court discussed the requirements of s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code governing the imposition of conditional sentences.In that case, the court reviewed s. 742.1 and set out the four criteria that must be considered before deciding to impose a conditional sentence, namely (at para. 46):(1) the offender must be convicted of an offence that is not punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment;(2) the court must impose a term of imprisonment of less than two years;(3) the safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender serving the sentence in the community; and(4) a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.[emphasis added]13The importance of the third criterion, an assessment of the risk, was considered by this court in R. v. Eckert (J.J), 2006 MBCA 6 (CanLII), 201 Man.R. (2d) 175, where Steel J.A., speaking for the court, stated (at para. 6):Before imposing a conditional sentence, the judge must weigh the risk of the offender re-offending and the gravity of the harm that might result. He must decide that the accused poses an acceptable risk to the community which can be managed by the imposition of appropriate conditions.14I agree with the Crown’s position that there was no proper risk assessment.A proper assessment would have led to the conclusion that this individual was at great risk to reoffend if living in the community.I also agree with the Crown that this accused is not an appropriate candidate for a conditional sentence, especially when he was convicted of a crime occurring while he was on parole and which is of a similar nature to that for which he was last sentenced to five years in jail.I recognize that there is no evidence that he stole this truck or engaged in joyriding, as was the case in previous offences.Nevertheless, he was found in possession of a stolen vehicle, an offence similar to that for which he had been arrested numerous times.15Given that the sentencing judge was in error in failing to perform an appropriate risk assessment, deference is not owed to the sentence that he has imposed.I am of the view that, given the accused’s past record and the circumstances surrounding this offence, at the sentencing on April 27, 2011, a fit and proper sentence at that date would have been a sentence of 18 months of incarceration, with credit for pre-sentence custody of two and a half months, leaving a further term of incarceration of 15 and a half months.16Since the accused had served two months of his conditional sentence prior to the conditional sentence being suspended on June 22, 2011 for a period of eight months, and two months since that time, he should be given a credit of 12 months.This would leave him a further three and a half months to serve as of April 27, 2012.17This decision was not released until May 3, 2012, due to illness of counsel.As a result, the accused continued to serve his conditional sentence and should be given credit for that extra week.18For these reasons, I would grant leave to appeal the sentence and allow the appeal.J.A.I agree:J.A.I agree:J.A."}

The amount of compensation and the role of the victim in the process were. These reasons address:•the scope of restitution•whether a victim can make sentencing submissions[2]Background Facts: Darren Bullen, 21, resides in Dawson and is a member of the First Nation. He pled guilty to two break-and-enters to commercial properties, the Downtown Hotel and Klondike Kate's, and two process offences. The Downtown Hotel claimed their loss amounted to $1,090. Klondike Kate's claimed losses totalling $2,780.A co-accused involved only in the break-and-enter to Klondike Kate's, with a more substantial criminal record, was previously sentenced and required to pay $1,940 to Klondike Kate's.[3]A joint submission in this case called for a suspended sentence and 18 months probation with numerous terms. The compensation proposed was limited to $1,240, consisting of the remaining $840 to Klondike Kate's and only $400 to the Downtown Hotel. The owners of both businesses filed victim impact statements and attended the sentencing hearings.[4]The joint submission was based on several special circumstances:a)First Offence – Darren had no previous criminal record. Tragic to note, but it is very rare that a young man growing up in a rural Yukon community appears as an adult without a criminal record.b)Subsequent Conduct – After the offence, Darren pursued a constructive plan to change his deteriorating lifestyle. Of the 15 people who began a substance abuse program, he was one of the only three to successfully finish. He was the youngest person to complete a demanding commercial art course. His mother testified that significant changes were evident in his attitude and behaviour.c)References – Everyone — his instructors, counsellors, probation officer, former employers, and a victim — acknowledged his formidable talents.d)Personal Circumstances – A gifted young man with the potential for a very promising future, several recent events had undermined his capacity to cope and to remain on a \"good path\". The death of his grandmother, an important support in his life, and fathering a child with a woman who did not want to continue the relationship, dragged him into despair. He turned to alcohol and a bad crowd for solace.e)Restitution Payment – Prior to sentencing, he paid the full amount of restitution called for by the joint submission ($1,240).f)Support of Community – His mother and the probation officer, and most who have had recent direct contact with him, are supportive and believe he can abide by and benefit from probation. Sadly, First Nation support was missing. No reason was offered. This young man, with enormous potential to be a future leader, needs the active support of family and community to realize the contribution he is capable of making to his immediate and extended community.[5]These factors warrant accepting the joint submission except for the proposed amount of restitution.[6]PART I – Scope of Restitution Orders:Both Crown and defence submitted that restitution for property damage is restricted by s. 738(1)(a) to the actual value of damaged property. For example, the cost of a new window is covered, but not the cost of labour to install it. The victim asked for much more. The losses sought to be compensated by the Downtown Hotel, as set out in their claim include:\"The following is a tabulation in monetary terms of the costs incurred by our hotel relative to the theft of the locked cash box containing the complete set of keys for all of the secure doors and storage facilities of our saloon operation.·11 padlocks, with six of the 11 having to be keyed alike(11 x $15)$165.00·One cash box modified with lockable hasp (1 x $50)50.00·Two doors re-keyed with return freight to Whitehorse75.00·Two persons searching for the missing keys, cutting offthe existing locks, purchasing new locks and cuttingduplicate copies (8 hrs. @ $50/hr.)400.00·One person viewing video surveillance tape(4 hrs. @ $50/hr.)200.00·One person attending court, consulting with the RCMP,preparing victim impact statements and other mattersrelative to the incident and resulting in the loss of timefrom the regular management of the hotel (4 hrs. @ $50/hr.)200.00The total of the foregoing costs is $1090. This is a conservative figure of our physical losses and as stated in the victim impact statement submitted by my wife, there can be no reasonable figure put on the damage to our staff morale and our own emotional turmoil.Further to all of the foregoing, this incident happened early last October and we have had to be involved and waited until six months later to bring some kind of closure to this unwarranted intrusion in our business and personal lives. I do not believe that our business and personal lives have been given any of the rights and privileges relative to those accorded the perpetrator's.We are requesting, as stated in my wife's victim statement of Oct. 16/00, that the maximum possible penalty be applied to this case and that we be compensated for our financial losses in total.\"[7]Both counsel submitted that s. 738(1)(a) limits restitution to the costs of replacement parts.[8]Limited Scope of Criminal Process:Counsel did not suggest the victim cannot seek restitution, but suggested that the best means to do so lies in a civil court. To engage a victim as a witness to secure a conviction in the interest of the state and then leave the victim to their own means to pursue their injuries in another process, in another court, raises questions of fairness and practicality. In many respects, victims' interests have been unduly subrogated to state interests in the evolution of criminal courts from their beginnings in civil courts.[9]There are limits to what a criminal court can do to compensate victims of crime. Recent changes in law and policy warrant re-examining these limitations. The following changes are relevant:1.Criminal Code amendments to restitution2.Enactment of sentencing principles3.Impact of restorative justice[10]1.Criminal Code Changes – The 1995 amendments clarified that restitution can be a stand-alone remedy enforceable in civil courts. An offender who defaults onrestitution cannot be charged if restitution is not a part of probation. Whatever amount is ordered as restitution by a criminal court does not affect a subsequent civil action, except as a set-off. These amendments reduce many previous concerns arising from the use of criminal courts to compensate victims.[11]2.Enactment of Sentencing Principles – The codification of the fundamental principles of sentencing includes three objectives that directly relate to restitution.[12]Section 718:(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and to the community.[13]Paying for damages enables an offender to take responsibility in a way that can directly promote forgiveness from the victim and engender an enhanced self-esteem for the offender. Both factors significantly contribute to rehabilitating offenders.You know, at first I didn't even think about paying back anything, eh … Not the first time I've done a B\u0026E and been to jail. But when the circle came up with that idea, at first I still didn't think much of it. But after I did it — felt good about it — you know, good about doing it — and good for me. Now, with them [the victims] accepting my apology, like, who could have ever believed that I'd get forgiven by them, eh? I feel like it's a new start with them — and for myself. My family was proud I worked to pay them back — so was I, eh! (Offender after circle at Kwanlin Dun, 1993)[14]Long before the separation of the court into criminal and civil divisions, many of the wrongful acts now deemed to be crimes were redressed solely by compensation. Compensation has always been, as it is in this case, a primary concern for victims who suffer damages. In all 50 American states, the courts are mandated by statute to order offenders to reimburse victims for financial losses (M. Hook \u0026 A. Seymour, Offender Re-Entry, 5(3) Crime Victims Report 33). In the United States, restitution is widely recognized as \"one of the only ways that crime victims can hold offenders directlyresponsible for the harm they have caused\" (Hook \u0026 Seymour, supra, at 43). In compensating victims, offenders take direct responsibility for their action and openly acknowledge the harm they have caused.[15]3.Restorative Justice Principles – Parliament and the courts have acknowledged the importance of restorative and community justice initiatives (R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688). Reconciliation and healing, both central objectives of community justice, are advanced by restitution. Community justice practices revive the importance of compensation and call for developing new ways to compensate victims for the adverse impacts of crime. In R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, the court recognized restorative justice practices make important contributions in reducing our excessive reliance upon incarceration.[16]These changes combine to make restitution more readily accessible by criminal courts and a more important tool in realizing the overriding principles and objectives of sentencing. Some courts have been resourceful in stretching the reach of restitution to provide practical responses to the needs of victims. Offenders have been asked to pay the counselling costs of victims of sexual offences (R. v. C.(A.) (1993), 142 N.B.R. (2d) 217 (C.A.)) and to pay the legal and auditing costs incurred by a victim of a complex theft (R. v. Arsenault (1994), 1994 CanLII 8800 (PE SCAD), 123 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 65 (P.E.I.C.A.)). In doing so, long before the current popularity of restorative and community justice, the courts were engaged in restorative practices. Significant restitution orders that have a realistic prospect of being paid can be an integral part of an overall sentencing plan that offsets some, if not all, of the need to rely on jail.[17]Limitations of Criminal Courts in Ordering Restitution:Too much has been made of the criminal court's inability to deal with restitution. There are no significant limitations in a criminal court process to preclude most claims for restitution. At the federal level, the same judges do criminal and civil work. At the provincial level, where 95 percent or more of criminal cases are handled, claims for restitution will not exceedthe experience or training of provincial judges. Criminal court procedures with few, if any, changes can be adapted to process claims for restitution. Within the following guidelines, victims seeking restitution should not be sent to another court to process their claims.[18]1.Ability to Pay – Before imposing a large fine, the courts are bound by statute to assess the offender's ability to pay. There is no such statutory requirement in imposing a restitution order. Unlike a fine, a restitution order, if not made part of probation, is only enforceable through civil remedies. Further, it may be paid off much later, when an offender can afford to do so. Accordingly, large restitution orders can be ordered, despite the current inability of an offender to pay.[19]There is one important constraint on the amount and timing of a restitution order. If rehabilitation is part of a sentencing plan, the amount and timing of restitution must not significantly undermine an offender's will and capacity to pursue rehabilitation. However, demonstrating the ability to take responsibility for their behaviour by compensating victims can be an integral part of a rehabilitation plan for many offenders. It is a direct, concrete action that gives meaning to an apology.[20]2.Ascertainable Damages – There is good reason to send the parties off to a civil court, if complex legal arguments are required to resolve the cause or amount of damage. There is not always good reason for the criminal courts to abandon the task of ascertaining damages just because damages are not readily ascertainable. This sets far too low a benchmark for what criminal courts can and should do. If victims choose to pursue their damages in a criminal court, the criminal court ought to provide restitution, if the cause and amount of damages can be reasonably ascertained. If the damages cannot be reasonably ascertained on the information immediately available, then at least one further hearing dedicated to determining damages should be held.[21]3.Restitution Determined at Time of Sentence – Since the amount of a compensation order must be taken into consideration in assessing the overall severity of the sentence, the amount should be ascertained at the time of sentencing. This may require adjourning a sentencing hearing as the police and Crown may not have the necessary information. The victim's interests cannot be ignored because the sentencing hearing moves ahead too quickly.[1] To ensure sentencing takes place in a timely manner, victims must be notified and assisted in gathering the requisite information to substantiate a claim. Crown counsel, police and victim services all can help victims fully utilize restitution orders. As soon as possible, Crown should notify the offender about the nature and amount of restitution being sought.Restitution Granted in This Case:[22]Section 738(1):(a)in the case of damage to, or the loss or destruction of, the property of any person as a result of the commission of the offence or the arrest or attempted arrest of the offender, by paying to the person an amount not exceeding the replacement value of the property as of the date the order is imposed, less the value of any part of the property that is returned to that person as of the date it is returned, where the amount is readily ascertainable (emphasis mine).[23]Both counsel, in submitting that replacement value consists solely of the purchase price of replacing damaged goods would preclude labour and other costs related to replacing the damaged property and all other losses imposed by the crime. In responding to this submission, it is best to separate the victim's claim for damages into two categories:i)the claim for damages directly related to replacing damaged property; andii)the claim for losses not directly related to replacing damaged property.[24]I)Replacing Damaged Property:The Latin origin of \"restitution\" is \"restitutio in integrum\", which means restoring parties to their original position. In civil law, restitution for breach of a contract aspires to restore the plaintiff to the position that preceded the breach. Why should restitution orders be any different in criminal courts? Do we suppose victims will understand why a criminal court will order payment for a new window, but need to start a new action to pursue the costs of labour to install the new window?[25]\"Replace\" is defined by the Shorter Oxford Dictionary at page 1798 as \"to restore to a previous place …to put back again in a place\". \"Replacement\" means \"the act or process of replacing\". The Dictionary of Canadian Law at page 1060 defines \"replacement value\" as \"the replacement in status quo ante\". These legal and common usages support the full cost of repairing the damage, not just the cost of new parts. In this case, the keys taken by the offender required replacing all locks. Total replacement costs, including purchasing and installing new parts, amounted to $690. All of these costs are within s. 738(1).[26]ii)Losses Caused by Crime:The remaining costs, arising from time spent viewing the videotape and preparing the case for court, are not covered by s. 738(1). These costs do not involve property damage, but relate to the time the victims were called upon by the justice system to prosecute the crime through the system.[27]Witnesses are modestly compensated for their time and travel expenses. Their participation is an inherent part of their responsibility as a citizen. A case could be made for covering some victim expenses beyond the coverage normally provided to witnesses. Based on the principles of restorative justice, the offender should be the first place to seek compensation for a victim's expenses. What an offender cannot covershould be covered by the state, since the state relies upon a victim to successfully prosecute violations of state laws.[28]Conclusion – Restitution Orders:Changes to the scope of victim compensation are needed to assist in the healing journey of victims and to foster their sense of fairness in the justice system. For instance, the legislative distinction between compensation for property damage and for bodily harm does not always work. For bodily harm, but not for property damage, restitution covers loss of income. In this case, the property damage to the hotel resulted in a loss of income that is not covered. Broadening the scope of restitution provides meaningful alternatives to jail and enhances victim participation in and respect for the justice system. Criminal courts owe victims the duty of making reasonable efforts to ascertain and award restitution for the losses caused by crime. Few victims will understand or accept the proposition that what they cannot get a criminal court to do, they might get a civil court to do. It must remain the victim's choice. Within reasonable limits, victims should be able to apply to either court. Why force them to take further civil action if all or most of the damages can be ascertained in a criminal court?[29]Pursuing their damages in a civil court is not always easy. Victims must start all over again. They are entirely on their own in bringing the offender to court and in proving their damages. Victims of sexual abuse proceed without the protection of post-O'Connor legislated shields. Victims whose claims exceed the limits in small claims court face the formidable hurdles of civil action that cause even litigants with deep pockets to hesitate.[30]In many respects, what appellate courts assume victims want does not accord with what researchers find that victims want (A. Sanders, Taking Account of Victims in the Criminal Justice System: A Review of the Literature (Edinburgh: The Scottish Central Research Unit, 1999) or with my experience of what victims want. While some victims want revenge, as expressed in harsh sentences, most victims want their lossescovered. The more victims are involved in the system, in my experience, the more the focus shifts from revenge to compensation, from punishment to rehabilitation. If criminal courts had access to a more comprehensive means of addressing compensation, directly from offenders and indirectly through a victim compensation fund, for many victims compensation could be a more satisfactory part of a sentencing plan than harsh penalties. A comprehensive compensation option, in many respects, serves the interests of victims, offenders and the community.PART II – VICTIM PARTICIPATION[31]In the past decade, the victims movement has carved out an enhanced role for victim involvement in sentencing. For many, the gains are not enough. At least it is clear — the question is no longer whether victims should participate, but how they will participate.[32]The experience of the victims in this case, and in many other cases, both in the courtroom and in circles, warrants searching for ways to respond to the legitimate and compelling claims by victims for meaningful involvement in sentencing. We must find ways to do so that respect the fundamental principles of justice.[33]In this case, the victims attended all sentencing hearings. They filed victim impact statements and made oral presentations. They wanted the court to know that on a previous occasion they had given the offender a break for a similar offence. In privately working out the previous incident, they had accepted the offender's apology and believed they had developed an understanding and trust. They wanted to share their sentiments and information about the offender. They had very definite ideas about an appropriate sentence. Most of their remarks were opposed by both counsel.[34]The law is clear. A victim may address the specific harm suffered, but not express either their views about the offender or about the sentence (R. v. Gabriel(1999), 1999 CanLII 15050 (ON SC), 137 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. Sup. Ct.); R. v. Friginette (1994), 1994 CanLII 2208 (BC CA), 53 B.C.A.C. 153; R. v. Coehlo, [1999] O.J. No. 2255 (Sup. Ct.) (QL); R. v. Bremner (2000), 2000 BCCA 345 (CanLII), 138 B.C.A.C. 200). This limitation is imposed not by legislation, but by the courts. The Criminal Code, in s. 722, describes the procedures for completing a victim impact statement. Nothing in these provisions precludes or provides for any further victim involvement.[35]Victims have been allowed to express their views about the offender and about the sentence in conferences, circles and in other restorative justice sentencing processes (Gabriel, supra, at 15). Victims have also been allowed to comment about the offender and the sentence when both counsel agree (Re: Regina and Antler (1982), 1982 CanLII 386 (BC SC), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 480 (B.C.S.C.)) and, curiously, when victims are supportive of the offender (R. v. Hardy (1976), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 84 (Qué. Sup. Ct.).[2] These practices are exceptions to the clear line courts have drawn preventing victims from commenting on the offender or on an appropriate sentence. With respect, drawing the line at this point is untenable. After examining reasons for and against involvement, guidelines are proposed for more meaningful victim involvement in sentencing.[36]Factors Supporting Enhanced Involvement:In this case, the victims listened silently as the offender was treated as a first-time offender. They heard a joint sentence submission that fell far short of their belief that \"the maximum allowable sentence should be imposed\". They left in the midst of legal submissions over whether they could participate. What more they may have said in court will now be said within the community. When courts shut down their voice, it is not difficult to appreciate why many victims, even those who do participate by way of victim impact statements, are dissatisfied with the justice process (Sanders, supra, at 2). Enhanced victim involvement, if properly supported and informed, can advance not just the interests of the victim, but also of the offender, community and justice system.[37]1.Victim Interests – Not all victims want to participate. Those who do not may have had, or heard about, a bad experience as a victim, or perhaps the system did not appear to sufficiently welcome their participation. Unfortunately, in some respects, the justice system continues to primarily function on attitudes and values that stem from a time when victims were largely ignored except to the extent they were essential for a trial. The justice system is just beginning to respect the interests of victims. When they are properly respected, more victims will become involved.[38]Most do want to participate (E. Erez. \u0026 P. Tontodonato, \"The Effect of Victim Participation in Sentencing on Sentence Outcome\" (1990) 28 Criminology 451) and initially perceive themselves as a party in the process. They soon realize they are not. They hear the prosecutor, defence counsel, probation officer and court worker make submissions and interact with the judge about \"their crime\", while they are relegated to sit in the gallery as a spectator:It is my pain, not theirs. It happened to me, not to them. It is my crime to speak about, not theirs. What do they know about my feelings? (Victim, after a sentencing hearing, Carcross, 1993)[39]Victims often know more about the offender than any of the professionals entitled to participate:What they don't know about [the offender] would amaze them. All that stuff they said in there [court] was crap. They know little about what is really happening in his life. The process is a joke — a very bad joke — because it doesn't deal with the real world. I know more than they do. Most people in the community know more — know what's going on. The court hasn't a clue. They rarely get it right because they [the courts] know so little. (Victim, after sentencing hearing, Haines Junction, 1994)[40]Dispatched to a minor role, victims watch as the process fails to \"get it right\". Victims believe their pain gives them a right to speak.[41]People facing difficult, distressing experiences may seek help, but most expect to retain control over how the help sought impacts on their lives. In the very least, they want to participate in shaping outcomes. Why do we think victims of crime are any different?[42]Studies suggest a victim impact statement does very little to answer most victims' desires to participate in shaping decisions that directly affect them (Sanders, supra, at 40). Some commentators suggest that victim impact statements are only \"successful in maintaining the time-honoured tradition of excluding victims from criminal justice with a thin veneer of being a part of it\" (E. Erez, L. Roeger \u0026 F. Morgan, \"Victim Harm, Impact Statements and Victim Satisfaction with Justice\" (1997) 5 International Rev. Criminology 37 at 37). Victim impact statements serve a purpose, albeit a very narrow one. They detail specific damages and losses and provide a description of the impact of crime. Victims want more. They particularly want to influence outcomes. There is a widespread recognition that direct participation offers the \"greatest beneficial effects and the fewest detrimental effects\", not just for the victim, but for the justice system (Sanders, supra, at 41).[43]In telling their story, victims remind the court that crime is not just about breaking a law, but also about the harm done to a person:I just wanna have a say. To be recognized as important — you know, that my story can be heard. (Victim, sentencing, Whitehorse, 1994)[44]Telling their story in court can be therapeutic. Victim participation can enhance their self-esteem and assist in closure (K. Roach, Due Process and Victims' Rights: The New Law and Politics of Criminal Justice (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999) at 292). By speaking directly to the offenders, judge and community they begin to tap their anger and pain. Significant therapeutic advantages for victims flow from having a voice, and harmful effects arise from feeling silenced (R.P. Wiebe, \"The Mental Health Implications of Crime Victims Rights\" in D.B. Wexler and B.J. Winick, eds., Law in aTherapeutic Key: Development in Therapeutic Jurisprudence (Durham, N.C.: Academic Press, 1996)). Whether victims need to denounce or support an offender, the experience of being given a voice, of being heard and their interests recognized as important can, for some, be instrumental in their recovery.Most of what I expected in the circle — you know, that it would be difficult for me and that it wouldn't make much of a difference, eh — was just plain wrong. But you know, I didn't expect to speak as much as I did — didn't expect people would listen like they did, eh. And the biggest surprise — as hard as it was in the circle — was how it helped me get to a good or better place in my life, eh. (Victim, Circle Participant, Post-Circle Comments, 1993)[45]How can filing a restricted victim impact statement and sitting as a silent observer in the public gallery be expected to promote closure or rebuild self-esteem? Currently, jurisdictions limiting a victim's participation to a victim impact statement enjoy much less success in meeting the objectives of increasing victim satisfaction than those jurisdictions which offer greater participation (Sanders, supra, at 41). If we intend the justice system, in the very least, to do no more harm to victims, we need to do more for victims. While all the needs of victims cannot be met in a court, the failure of other agencies to respond provides no reason for courts not to do more.[46]Victims precluded from direct participation in shaping sentencing decisions regard the process as excessively focused on the plight of offenders. This emphasis on offenders is likely to intensify. As courts respond to the calls to minimize the use of jails and maximize community and other resources to rehabilitate offenders (Gladue, supra), the imbalance in the focus of the justice system between offenders and victims may worsen. This imbalance feeds their impression that the process is neither fair to, nor respectful of victims.[47]A sense of fairness is often more related to process than to outcome. Meaningful participation in the decision-making process induces feelings of fairness and, in turn,fosters acceptance of outcomes. When victims participate directly in restorative justice processes, victims find the process the process fair and their emotional needs more effectively met than in court (Sanders, supra, at 15). Often just being invited to participate, even if they do not, regardless of the outcome, increases victim satisfaction with the process. Victim satisfaction is often more related to the degree of their involvement than the outcome of the process (Sanders, supra, at 31). The more participatory the process, the more satisfied the victims (A. Morris, \"Giving Victims a Voice: A New Zealand Experiment\" (1993) 32 Harvard L.J. at 304). The more victims know, the more they want to know. However, it is not just more information, but more involvement in shaping sentences that improves their satisfaction with the process (A. Sanders, et al., \"Victim Impact Statements: Don't Work, Can't Work\" (2001) Crim. L.R. 477 at 452).[48]My experience is anecdotal and selective, as most of the victims I have spoken to approached me. On this limited sampling, victims who have been able to speak, either in the courtroom or in a circle, are very appreciative for the opportunity. Most important, they begin to move beyond their anger, beyond the dark space the crime has driven them into, when their voice is heard and respected. For the most part, judges do not hear the wrath, frustration and pain victims feel when shut out of the process. If we were more exposed to the impact of our processes, we might be a lot less content with how the process functions.[49]The changes driven by restorative justice have largely been shunted off to community initiatives. Courts have accepted an expanded voice for victims in community initiatives, such as circles, conferences, and diversion, but not in the courtroom (Gabriel, supra). Is it that judges cannot appropriately respond to victims but communities can? Judges can and should take the time to hear from and respond to victims. Victims deserve a full explanation from the court about how the sentence imposed incorporates their interests or why the sentence they seek cannot be. The reasons given for a sentence must address all affected interests. To do so, all interests must be heard. In neither hearing nor responding to victims, the court engenders theirdisrespect for the process and may intensify the harm caused by the crime by failing to respect their interests. As in restorative justice processes, the court can do much more in addressing the needs of victims without undermining the rights and needs of offenders.[50]2.Offender Interests – When victims participate in the process, their voice has a salutary impact on offenders in two ways. First, their voice shifts the handling of crime from a legalistic and tactical, adversarial game to the intimate and difficult human interaction that it is. Offenders need to hear and experience the human dimension of crime. The pain, anger and suffering of victims leaves little room for offenders to gloss over their criminal behaviour. For example, in break-and-enter offences, offenders tend to diminish the severity of their actions by assuming it is \"just about property … they had lots of stuff in that house. What we took didn't amount to much. Besides, insurance will cover it.\" (Young offender, private discussion, 1994) When they hear the pain of victims, whose feelings of safety in their homes has been violated, their crime takes on a significantly different meaning:I never thought about that — man, when they started crying, I could see their pain, eh. Man, that got to me. Like, really, I never thought about that, eh. You know, they're right — how can they even feel safe in their own home after what we did. (Young offender, private discussion, 1994)[51]Whatever a victim impact statement may do to \"bring home to the offender the consequences of criminal behaviour\" (Gabriel, supra, at 11), victims speaking openly to an offender brings it all home to an offender in a way that cannot be ignored. Some victims want to confront offenders. In preventing these victims from doing so, we send a clear message that we are protecting offenders from facing their victims. No wonder victims feel \"the system favours and protects offenders. They have a lawyer. We don't. They can speak to the court. We can't. Shit — we can't even speak to our offenders in court. You protect them from our anger. This justice system is an offender's justice system. That's all it is.\" (Ex-victim and victim supporter after court, Carmacks, 1993)[52]In the very least, offenders ought to face the pain of their victims. They cannot be forced to respond, but they ought to be forced to listen. It can be much more salutary for offenders to hear about the human dimension of their crime from a victim than from a judge.[53]Second, the support, understanding — even, at times, forgiveness — of victims has an enormous impact on the ability of offenders to successfully pursue their rehabilitation plan.Before, you know, other times in the court, eh — no one from my community showed up, and all I saw from victims was, like, just anger. I know — like, guessed — I guess people hated me. That was a hard thing, but I learned, I guess, eh, not to care. Now, this time it really helped to know the community supported me, and I know [the victims] — well, they kinda support me, too. Makes me feel good about myself. Like, I think I'm gonna do it this time — like, make it sober. (Offender, Kwanlin Dun, 1992)[54]In shutting down the voice of victims, their anger is intensified. Angry victims can undermine the ability of offenders to find and retain community support. Especially, but not exclusively, in small communities an offender's ability to reconnect to his/her community and to get on and stay on a healing journey can be affected by what a victim feels about the sentence and about the offender.[55]My experience supports the experience of many other judges — victims, when respected and given an appropriate means to be heard, are less inclined to reject outcomes and their participation impacts constructively, both on their healing and on the healing journey of offenders.[56]3.Community Interests – Victims' concerns, when denied expression in the court, do not just fade away. The voices shut down in court are intensified in homes, in community gatherings and in the media. By allowing and responding to victim inputs inthe courtroom, the courts enable a vital dialogue to occur. This dialogue enables the court to appreciate the victim's perspective and for victims to hear and hopefully appreciate the court's perspective. When victims participate, they are more likely to listen and to accept the court's reasons for a sentence. Victim participation enables the court, in giving reasons for a sentence, to speak not just to offenders, but to victims and the community as well. If we fail to do so, there is little chance the underlying rationale for our practices will be effectively explained in the community by anyone else.[57]4.Best Interest of Justice System – The justice system benefits in many ways from meaningful victim participation. The decision-making process is better informed. Outcomes are shaped to embrace a more comprehensive reach of interests. With a broader base of support, sentences are more likely to succeed. Overall, victim participation results in better decisions and in improving their understanding of what the justice system can and cannot achieve.[58]Many years ago, the Ontario Court of Appeal suggested \"the courts do not have to reflect public opinion … perhaps the main duty of the court is to lead public opinion\" (R. v. Sargeant (1974), 60 Cr. App. R. (Ont. C.A.) 74 at 77). To responsibly \"lead public opinion\" about sentencing, courts need to hear from and respond to victims. Courts cannot assume the Crown speaks for victims. The Crown speaks primarily for the state. The interests and perspectives of the state and victim can often be very different. Hearing from the victim is an important part in gaining community credibility for court decisions and for taking any leadership in precipitating an informed community dialogue about sentencing.[59]Some fear that an enhanced victim's voice will generate \"offender-bashing campaigns and 'get tough' criminal policies\" (C. Ruby, \"From Crime Policy to Victim Policy: Reconciling the Justice System\" (1987/88) 13 Crim. L.Q. 126). Conversely, I fear that by limiting the victim's voice we fuel their frustration and anger, and leave them with no place to go except to the streets to press for harsher penalties. Giving victims a voice, giving their pain and suffering the respect it deserves, and allowing them to participate in the dialogue about \"their crime\" provides a more direct and meaningful expression of their interests. We need to have more confidence in our system and in victims. The system can be understood and accepted by most victims if they are not shut out. Victims can appreciate and respect the principles governing the justice system if we invest the time in supporting, explaining and involving them in a meaningful way. It is not by involving them, but by shutting them out, that \"offender-bashing campaigns\" are galvanized.[60]Summary:The pressure from victims for a greater voice is both relentless and compelling. The advantages of including the victim in a more meaningful way are clear. By assessing the factors that have denied or restricted victim participation, the means for engaging victims in a more meaningful way can be explored.[61]Barriers To Increasing Victim Participation:Many judges throughout Canada have gone much further than the appellate court boundaries allow. Judges who actively invite victims to speak about a possible sentence and the totality of their experience have not encountered the difficulties anticipated by appellate courts.[62]Each step towards meaningful victim participation has not experienced inordinate difficulties. The alarms of fear set off by initial plans to introduce victim impact statements were all false alarms. If anything, victim impact statements have failed to live up to our expectations to provide a respectful and effective way to include victims. In Gabriel, supra, at 11, the court summarized what was expected of victim impact statements:•providing direct evidence of the impact of the crime•bringing home to the offender the consequences of criminal behaviour•giving the victim the satisfaction of being heard•providing the victim with asense of regaining control over his/her life•alleviating the frustration of detachment when a victim perceives he/she is ignored•ensuring in sentencing that the victim is not reduced to obscurity — an intolerable departure from respect for the personal integrity of the victim[63]Undoubtedly, victim impact statements serve some of these purposes. However, victims are not satisfied with the level of participation provided by victim impact statements (Sanders, supra). A more direct victim voice to speak not just about damages, but also about their perspective on the offender and sentence, realizes all of these purposes in a more substantial manner than a victim impact statement.[64]The challenge is not to hold the line drawn by appellate courts, but to explore how to maximize victim participation without unduly undermining the fundamental principles of the justice process and without causing the problems flagged by appellate courts. Exploring how to enhance the victim's voice begins by assessing the barriers currently used to oppose more than the stilted participation granted by victim impact statements.[65]The reasons commonly trotted out to deny victims the ability to speak about an offender and to express their view about an appropriate sentence are:•Sentencing is a two-party process involving only the state and the offender•Courts are not a social agency•Victims will be disruptive to the court process•Victim participation will produce sentencing disparities[66]Two-Party System – Courts constantly remind victims seeking greater participation that sentencing \"is not a tripartite proceeding. A convicted offender has committed a crime — an act against society as a whole. It is a public interest, not a private interest, which is to be served in sentencing.\" (Gabriel, supra, at 12). In adhering to this notion, criminal courts shunt victims off to civil courts to redress their wrongs (Gabriel, supra, at 2).[67]The notion that the criminal justice process is, for all purposes, exclusively a two-party system is a remarkable example of the arbitrary division of responsibilities that cripples government and, until wiser counsel prevailed, had stymied the growth of contemporary businesses. The more progressive corporations recognized their challenges cannot be divided and delegated to separate agencies to address (P. Senge, The Fifth Discipline:The Art and Practice of The Learning Organization (New York: Doubleday, 1994)). Those governments and businesses that continue to do so, continue to fail, regardless of how many additional resources they invest in truncated approaches. Successful corporations realize that an integrated collaborative approach that generates the capacity for a systemic analysis of the problem and wholistic responses is required (C. Argyris, Overcoming Organizational Defences, (New York: Prentice Hall, 1990)). Similarly, the challenges facing sentencing courts call for holistic responses that build on a systemic analysis of how many factors interact. Restricting the voice of victims diminishes the court's ability to integrate key factors that the victim can contribute to developing holistic sentencing plans.[68]In a restorative justice process, participation is encouraged from all facets of the community interested in or affected by the crime and the resultant sentencing plans draw from the perspectives and resources of all participants. This is precisely as it should be.[69]Any longstanding notion, such as the exclusivity of a two-party criminal process, must be regularly questioned to determine if its rationale remains relevant and if it continues to effectively advance current public interests. The longevity of any practice is not sufficient reason to retain it. There must be more. Incantations to \"time immemorial\" practices are often offered up as an emotional defence against pressing needs for change. As Hans Mohr, in his characteristically penetrating insight has warned: \"References to 'times immemorial' contain as much forgetfulness as they contain memory and are largely used for the purpose of legitimation when other grounds cannot be found or cannot be disclosed.\" (J.W. Mohr, \"Criminal Law: Is There a Legal or a Social Logic Left For Its Renewal?\" in P. Fitzgerald ed. Crime, Justice \u0026 Codification (Toronto: Carswell, 1986) at 33). We seem to have forgotten the important role victims and communities played when they shared responsibility for dealing with conflict. At one time, victims had a paramount role in working through offences against their person or property. The reasons that supported the state's assumption of responsibility several hundred years ago, if valid then, may not be today. Certainly, the almost exclusive role of the state, and relatively minor role of the victim, warrant reconsideration.[70]In the very least, exploring avenues for according victims and communities a more meaningful voice without granting full-party status can retain what is essential for court-based sentencing process and give way on what is not.[71]From the perspective of victims, the question is not whether they should be granted a special status; they already have one. The question is whether this special status can be enhanced without undermining the fundamental principles of justice and without adversely impacting on the sentencing process. The answers to both questions, based on experience in the courtroom and in restorative justice forums, is yes. Many American states (35) have relied on legislation to grant victims the ability to submit their views about an appropriate sentence (R. Elias, Victims Still, (California: Sage Publications, 1993). These legislative innovations have not caused havoc with their two-party adversarial court process. There are ways to maintain the integrity of a two-party system in sentencing and grant victims a more meaningful participation. The right to call evidence, to cross-examine, or to appeal is not required to afford victims a more significant voice in sentencing.[72]Court:\"Not a Social Agency\" – In justifying the limitation on a victim's involvement, the court in Gabriel, supra, at 12 noted that the trial court was \"not a social agency\". It is as if being regarded as a social agency demeans the purity of a legal response to what, in almost every sentencing, is principally a social problem. What is important is not the maintenance of truncated responsibilities, but an openness to what is required to \"get it right\".I don't give a damn what the law says, what you say the law says, or what some appeal judges say it is. But if you don't get it right — get it right for this offender, for this victim and for this community — the mess this crime creates will get a lot worse. (First Nation leader, Haines Junction, 1993)[73]\"Getting it right\" in very few cases calls for only legal responses. To \"get it right\", those with skills honed for courtrooms need to acknowledge their limitations and welcome collaboration with those who possess the skills and resources to ensure sentences contribute to \"getting it right\".[74]Breaking the cycle of criminal behaviour that locks many offenders into recidivism and thereby to progressively longer jail sentences requires engaging resources that social agencies can bring to sentencing (treatment, training, housing, literacy, financial and other supports). These resources are often required to extract the full potential of sentencing as a catalystic force for change. While the court is not a social agency, it can provide the opportunity for many social agencies to combine their services with those of the court to forge a plan that serves the interests of offenders, victims and communities.[75]Will Increase Sentencing Disparities – Some fear that giving victims a voice will produce harsher penalties (Antler, supra; R. v. Robinson (1983), 38 C.R. (3d) 255 (Ont. H.C.J.)). These concerns presume the vengeance and anger of victims will unduly influence judges. These presumptions portray an unflattering impression of victims and judges — a portrayal that is not borne out by experience. A study of victim opinion statements (includes victims' views of offenders and of appropriate sentences) used in sexual assault cases found little significant impact on outcomes (A. Walsh, \"Placebo Justice\" (1986) J. of Crim. L. and Criminology 126). A broadly based survey of different types of victim input concluded that the fear sentences will be distorted and made more punitive as a result of victim participation was unwarranted (For research, see Sanders, supra, at 40; Erez, supra, at 457. For contra-opinion, see H. Rubel, Victim Participation in Sentencing, (1985-86) 28 Crim. L.Q. 226; Stuart, D., Annotation (1984), 38 C.R. (3d) 256).[76]My experience with restorative justice practices here and in other jurisdictions principally indicates that victims, when given a full opportunity to participate, are not as interested in being as punitive as is commonly assumed. In circles, when offenders take full responsibility for their actions and demonstrate earnest attempts to be rehabilitated, victims are generally less interested in jail sentences and more interested in sentences that reflect, in a concrete manner, what offenders will do to take responsibility for past actions and to change future conduct. The more victims participate, the more they know about the offender, the offender's family and community, the more likely they will support a constructive sentencing plan that avoids or drastically reduces dependence upon jail.[77]Often victims call for jail sentences because they are not aware of alternatives or of the costly ineffectiveness of jail (Rubel, supra, 236). In circles, victims apprised of alternatives often support sentencing plans that avoid or minimize dependence on jail.[78]Introducing the victim's voice worries some that the neutrality of the court will be compromised (R. v. Porter (1976), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 215 (Ont. C.A.) at 220; Gabriel, supra, at 16). While many justice professionals seem to share this opinion, none of the research I found validates this assumption. Courts have not been swayed or compromised by victim participation (Sanders, supra, at 34). If anything, public perception of the court's neutrality may be more jeopardized by shutting out the victim.[79]3.Disruptive Effect of Vengeful Victims –In Gabriel, supra, at 13, the court suggests that a \"runaway model\" of victim participation would fill the court with victims, who cannot distinguish between vengeance and retribution. They will come to court screaming for offenders to be harshly punished.[80]The screams for vengeance seem much louder, more insistent from victims shut out of any meaningful participation. What is not expressed in an emotional, but appropriate way in court can be shouted in anger and frustration in the streets. In both courts and restorative justice processes, the more victims participate, the more they manifest an understanding of the difference between vengeance and retribution. It is the insult of being shut down that inflames their pain into vengeance. It is this insult that contributes to galvanizing political pressures for change around single issues.[81]The fear about a \"runaway model\" also assumes victims cannot understand or respect the court process. Again, my experience is quite different. My experience suggests that victims, if respected, act respectfully. Today, victims have access to professional victim services. This access helps victims appreciate the limitations of the court process and prepares them to effectively participate.[82]Finally, the fear of victim participation generating a \"runaway model\" assumes judges cannot handle outbursts by angry, emotionally charged victims in the courtroom. Extensive training through the National Judicial Institute, and many other fine programs about victims' issues, about dealing with strong, difficult emotions, has prepared judges to deal with the strong emotions surrounding crime.[83]In restricting the victim's view, we seem to assume sentencing can best be conducted by shutting out the emotions that permeate the process. For what purpose? So that the sanctity of the law will not be tarnished by emotions? Are we so focused on \"head talk\" that we cannot permit any \"heart talk\"? Stripped of all emotional aspects, sentencing discussions of crime in principally legal terms offends some victims.I can't believe — as lawyers battled over the law and spoke about what should or should not happen to [the offender] no one spoke of the human parts of the crime — about what it did to my business, my family, and about what it did to me. I was hurt and offended that sentencing was not much more than a bunch of legal talk. (Victim, Private discussion, 1994)[84]What makes restorative justice processes so much more successful, on many levels, than the court is the space created for hearts to talk. If we want sentencing to be a pivotal experience for change, we must engage all the dynamics surrounding sentencing. We fail to appreciate that embracing the emotional and spiritual dynamics surrounding sentencing enhances the capacity of the sentencing process to make a lasting, positive impact on the lives of all participants. Judges can handle the emotional expressions of victims. The process may take longer. Some victims may be disruptive. But allowing victims a voice, especially an emotional voice, can be a constructive learning experience for the offender, the victim and the court.[85]Summary:The reasons stacked up against increasing victim involvement fail on several fronts to hold the line currently drawn by appellate courts. First, most of the reasons (vengeful victims, sentencing disparities, disruptive interferences) are based on assumptions, not research. Currently, most of the research substantially refutes the underlying assumptions shaping restrictions on victim participation. Second, the insistence on preserving a two-party process, although an unnecessarily restrictive view, has little to do with giving victims a voice. Victims are not seeking party status, just seeking to speak their mind about the offender and the outcome. Jurisdictions which have given the victim a voice have not experienced untold destruction of the process. Third, some courts suggest the legislation in creating victim impact statements has limited victim participation. That is simply not so. It is not the legislation denying the victim a voice, but the courts.[3][86]Fourth, none of the reasons limiting victim participation address the impact on victims when their voices are ignored or shut down. Finally, there has not been a satisfactory assessment of how including the victim in sentencing could benefit the offender, the community and the justice system.[87]Enhancing Victim Involvement:How victim interests can best be addressed ought to be primarily left to those who work with victims and whose expertise provides a more informed perspective than what judges and counsel can glean from their experiences. If the justice system aspires to do no more harm, and to at least function in a manner that respects those already harmed, any change must be informed by what actually happens, not by what is assumed to happen.[88]In this case, as in many others, when a victim's voice is ignored, they feel disrespected. We not only fail to garner their support for the outcome, but we exacerbate their suffering and generate anger with the justice system. We must do better — and we can.[89]The following guidelines ought to govern any new measures courts explore to increase victim participation:•No Pressure to Participate – Victims must not be subjected to any pressure to participate. Each victim must be free of any pressure in choosing whether, how and when they might participate.•Informed Choice – Victims must be fully apprised of their options to participate.•Supported – Any participation must be supported by victim services, community justice workers or others qualified to provide the level of support each victim seeks or needs.•Respect – Their voices must be heard and responded to in a respectful manner.[90]Within these guidelines, a victim can, if they desire to do so, speak about the offender and provide their view of an appropriate sentence if a victim:•has been fully briefed. Either a prosecutor victim services worker should brief the victim about:·usual range of sentences for offenders·relevant sentencing principles·what can and cannot be given weight in sentencing•has met with prosecutor. The prosecutor should brief the victim about the underlying processes for the specific sentencing submission he/she intends to make. It is not important that prosecutors represent victims. It is important that prosecutors hear their concerns, explain the position of the prosecutor in sentencing and assist victims in understanding the limits of the process. In some jurisdictions, the prosecutors are experimenting with directly communicating with victims (Erez \u0026 Tontodonato, supra, at 458).In Yukon, the Crown aspires to spend time with victims and maximize their awareness of the process. Yukon prosecutors have created procedures to ensure the input of victims is sought with respect to major decisions and that victims are provided with clear and comprehensive information about the legal process. These procedures include:·being available before court to speak to victims·working with the victim service worker to ensure victims are aware of what is likely to happen in court·communicating the victim's position, needs and concerns to the court; and·meeting with the victim after court to explain what happened in court.(Taken from Crown protocol for DVTO Court)•is aware of overall circumstances. Preferably, victims who wish to speak should be in attendance for all of the sentencing hearing to be fully aware ofthe overall circumstances. If not in attendance, before participating a victim service worker should update the victim about what the offender has done and about any relevant evidence submitted to the court. \"If more were explained, less would appear unfair, insensitive or incomprehensible.\" (Sanders, et al., supra, at 453). Victim services are filling in more of the enormous gaps in victim understanding of the process. All professionals in the system must make an effort to explain the process and keep victims updated on all developments in the case. It is important to hear the perspective of the victim at the time of sentencing (Erez \u0026 Tontodonato, supra, at 546). Victim inputs should reflect what has happened since the crime. Victims are significantly relieved when informed that offenders have made important strides towards accepting responsibility and acting responsibly. Knowledge can change their perspective on whether to participate and on what outcomes they wish to see.I did want to participate. I did want to see him go to jail. But it did help me to get on with my life to know that he was in treatment — really in treatment, not just talking about it — and that people in the community were committed to see him through it. I got a long way to go, but knowing what he was doing, who was involved, helped me for sure. (Victim, Circle, Carmacks, 1993)[91]In some cases, many of these preconditions will be readily waived by the court as the nature of the case will not warrant such elaborate precautions.[92]Conclusion:The paramouncy of the public interest in determining an appropriate sentence need not preclude the victim's input (Contra, see Coehlo, supra; Friginette, supra.[93]We risk little by exploring ways of expanding opportunities for victim participation. We risk more than we seem to appreciate by hiding behind ancient practices to deny the legitimate needs for an enhanced victim role in sentencing.[94]Victims are much more capable than assumed by the courts of understanding the system and its limitations, of recognizing and respecting the values inherent in the sentencing process, and of making constructive contributions in an appropriate, albeit often emotional manner. Trial court judges are more capable of hearing from victims without being swayed by the emotional dynamics of victim participation and much more capable of explaining sentencing principles and practices to victims than contemporary jurisprudence acknowledges.[95]While each crime is different, and responsibilities for the underlying causes and for resolutions different, everyone needs to regard crime as an invaluable learning experience. Crime teaches all of us what is remiss within our communities and families and offers up an opportunity for learning how to work together, to share responsibility for removing the conditions that render families and communities vulnerable to crime. No one should be shut out of the process; everyone should be encouraged to participate.[96]Courts owe victims not just a chance to speak, but owe them a response. Our body of sentencing principles purports to encompass the values of our society. Complex and often conflicting, these principles must be examined and explained in each case. The explanation of a sentence in the context of these principles is owed to victims, offenders and the community. If the judge does not explain the application of these principles to the victim, who will?[97]Holmes was right: \"The life of the law is not logic, but experience.\" Within the legal community, we have fallen prey to self-supporting concepts and seem to believe that Holmes' \"experience\" embraces only the experience of law within the courtroom. We have increasingly failed to appreciate and learn from the impact of law on the larger community it is intended to serve. The logic of separating conflicts into civil and criminal courts is not understood by homeowners, whose sanctuary has been breached by burglars. Parents of young children brutally slain can neither accept nor respect why they can watch but not speak. We disrespect the victim's experience of loss when we shut down his/her voice in the sentencing process. If criminal courts shut out the voices of key participants, we cannot except to foster either public respect for, or acceptance of the justice system.[98]By stepping back from active interference with sentencing, appellate courts have encouraged trial courts to develop viable solutions to the specific challenges in each case. To generate viable solutions, courts must be open to appreciate and respond to the dynamics and needs in each case. Doing so will require pushing, bending and, at times, breaking longstanding attitudes and notions about sentencing practices, and especially about victim participation. For sentencing to generate pivotal changes in the lives of victims, offenders and the community, courts must be open to question longstanding legal practices. What ought to be continued is what continues to work — not just to advance the purity of legal interests, but to advance the much broader interests of developing a constructive, relevant, effective sentencing process that serves all affected interests. No institution that ignores voices for change survives. If we exclude victims, if we fail to directly face and respectfully explain the principles and practices that shape our processes, we will not survive as a valuable contributor in responding to the harm crime imposes.They done made themselves kinda useless by not payin' attention to what's goin' on. Shuttin' down on people or change — soon enough and sure enough shuts you down. Any damn fool gotta see that. (Willie Can, 1968)_______________________________STUART, C.J.T.C.[1] Delegating to a probation officer the task of working out the amount of restitution with the victim and offender has been condemned by Appeal Courts (R. v. Shorter and Shorter (1976), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 528 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. Hudson (1981), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 171 (Ont. C.A.)). Given the choice (especially on circuit) of postponing a sentence for several months to acquire more reliable information that will readily resolve a dispute over the amount, and ignoring a victim's request for compensation, another option must be created. If only the amount of damages is unclear, but the range of damages is roughly known, a sentence can be imposed and restitution fixed at the high end of the range, leaving the exact amount to be determined at a review.[2] Victims should not only be permitted to speak if the offender consents or if their input is supportive. This basis for victim input suggests only appeased victims can speak and that offenders have a veto over victim participation.[3] While courts have been reluctant to open the door for victims to be heard, the Legislature, in the proposed new Act to deal with young offenders, seems to embrace the idea fully. Section 18(d)(iii):Victims should be provided with information about the proceedings and given an opportunityto participate and be heard (emphasis mine)."}

Keith Ham) delivered on September 26, 2002.[2]The case was heard on a period of nine days in 2002 and is related to infractions to municipal by-laws of the former City of Westmount.[3]The Appellant was convicted of fifteen counts as “fiduciaire” of La Fiducie Atwater, owner of a building bearing civic number 3035 St-Antoine Street West.[4]The Appellant who is representing himself filed as Notes and Authorities a document called “BRIEFING: The Tragedy and Act of Evil of the City of Westmount resulted from the Characters and inadequately Competent Directors”.[5]The aforesaid document is not easy to understand and is described by the council of Respondent as follows:“That on almost every page of the said brief the Appellant has alleged new material, referred to hearsay evidence, uttered potentially libellous statements and included totally irrelevant material to the matter before this Honourable Court.”[6]The Appellant is convinced that the City of Westmount and its employees are guilty against him of religious discrimination (anti-Semitism) and harassment.[7]The Appellant was not able to make any valid demonstration of these serious accusation.[8]Nor the Appellant was he able to indicate clearly to the Court where the municipal judge made a mistake in fact or in law in his judgment.[9]The appeal on the fifteen counts is dismissed.[10]The Appellant is also appealing of the sentence pronounced by the Municipal Court.[11]The first judge decided to sentence Appellant to the minimum fine prescribed by the municipal by-laws and considered that the Appellant was a “personne morale”.[12]The proof indicates that the Appellant transferred the property of his building to his children by creating a trust in their favour. The trust was established by contract without the creation of a corporation.[13]Pursuant to section 1260 ss. of Québec Civil Code, the Appellant is the trustee of a private trust and remains an individual or “personne physique”.[14]Considering these facts, the fine prescribed by municipal by-laws is different from that what was decided by the Municipal Court.[15]The Appeal of the sentence is granted and the fine will be adjusted accordingly.[16]The Appellant also asks the Court to adjudicate on the following petition:Mr. Donovan in my previous appearance in court confessed that Westmount has another new case against me in addition to what you see now. This will illustrate to you that these vicious, malicious events are going to continue and will never stop, for which I seek protection from the court. It would be nice if the Court would address my future. For my own safety I would ask the court to consider me a refugee of the Westmount system and to allow me for future to have any permits or inspections, etc. outside the City of Westmount and to choose the great City of Montreal to enable me to enjoy the quality of life of the City of Montreal where I have and will always be able to live in peace which is not available in Westmount and to state all in the injustices for which I had suffered from[17]First, the malicious behaviour of City of Westmount was not demonstrated in front of this Court.[18]Second, the Court has no power to declare the Appellant a “refugee of the Westmount system” nor to decide on future rights of the parties.[19]FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT:[20]GRANTS in part the appeal of the sentence decided by the Westmount Municipal Court on September 26, 2002.[21]CONDEMNS the Appellant to the minimum fine for a physical person as to follow:File no2000001838...................................... $500.002000001839...................................... $250.002000001840...................................... $500.002000001841...................................... $500.002000001842...................................... $250.002000001843...................................... $500.002000001844...................................... $500.002000001849...................................... $500.002000001861...................................... $500.002000001863...................................... $500.002000001867...................................... $500.002000001871...................................... $500.002000001879...................................... $250.002000001895...................................... $500.002000001896...................................... $500.00[22]PLUS COSTS on each count in Municipal Court.[23]DISMISSES the remainder of the Appeal.[24]THE WHOLE without costs in Superior Court.ANDRÉ DENISMtre John DonovanDONOVAN \u0026 DONOVANAttorney for RespondentSALIM FATTALFor himselfDate of hearing:APRIL 1st, 2004"}

L.A.J., 2018 YKSC2Date:20180116S.C.No. 17-AP004Registry: WhitehorseBETWEENHER MAJESTY THE QUEENRESPONDENTANDL.A.J.APPELLANTBefore Mr. Justice R.S. VealeAppearances:Amy PorteousCounselfor the RespondentVincent LarochelleCounselfor the AppellantREASONS FOR JUDGMENTINTRODUCTION[1]Ms. J. pled guilty to an assault contrary to s. 266 of the Criminal Code before a judge of the Territorial Court. The Crown submitted that a suspended sentence with probation was the appropriate sentence. The defence advocated for a conditional discharge.[2]The sentencing judge convicted Ms. J. and imposed a suspended sentence, resulting in a criminal record. He focussed on Ms. J.’s admission in the Pre-Sentence Report that she smoked marijuana daily and would continue to do so. He found that it would be contrary to the public interest to give a conditional discharge to an offender who says she will continue to possess marijuana, despite the fact that it is currently illegal to do so.[3]Ms. J. appeals her conviction and the issue is whether a conditional discharge, in the circumstances of Ms. J., is contrary to the public interest.THE FACTS[4]Ms. J. is a 57-year-old citizen of the Vuntut Gwich’in First Nation, which is based in O[…]. O[…] is a small First Nation village in northern Yukon. There is no road access. There are approximately 221 residents.[5]On December 29, 2016, Ms. J. was in the O[…] grocery store with her adult daughter. Ms. J. began to swear at the complainant and, after a brief period of time, grabbed her by the coat and punched her in the face, injuring her lower lip. Ms. J. then said she would run the complainant out of town and that she should “get the fuck out of town”. The store manager intervened and the incident ended.The Victim Impact Statement[6]Although there is no lasting physical injury, the complainant has been affected by the assault, which was in a very public place in a small community.[7]She states that there are continuing impacts upon her from the supporters or members of Ms. J.’s family. There was no finding of fact in that regard but I accept that it is an impact felt by the complainant.The Pre-Sentence Report[8]The Pre-Sentence Report is the source of most of the information about Ms. J. considered in the sentencing hearing. Ms. J. has one previous discharge in 1988.[9]Ms. J. was 56 at the time of this incident and has always resided in O[…]. She was raised by her mother, who was essentially a single parent. She has had little contact with her biological father. She had a stepfather and remembers some contact with him, but he froze to death when she was a young child.[10]Ms. J. described her relationship with her mother as positive but there was drinking, abuse and spousal violence in the home from a young age. Her mother struggled with alcohol until the age of 50 when she stopped drinking. Her mother had 11 children but not all were raised by her. Ms. J. recalls spending a lot of weekends with her grandparents while her mother drank. Her mother died tragically after a fall through the ice in 2000 and losing her has been difficult. She has recently started to come to terms with the violence and abuse she experienced as a child and this has been a source of considerable stress.[11]Ms. J. is unemployed and has had some challenges maintaining employment.She is currently a single parent with two daughters.[12]Ms. J. has had an alcohol problem but reports that she has been sober for five years. Alcohol was not a factor in the incident with the complainant.[13]The probation officer reported the following information that is the issue before the Court:Ms [J.] reports to smoking marijuana on a daily basis to “calm [herself] down”. Ms [J.] advised that since seeing [her counsellor] more regularly (since February of 2017) she has gone from “smoking six (6) joints a day down to two (2) joints a day”. Ms [J.] stated that this usage is “not that much”, does not consider it to be a problem, and does not wish to stop at this time.[14]Ms. J. justified her assault by describing in some detail a past event which occurred some 10 years earlier, where she alleges that she was beaten up by a group that included the complainant. She was injured but no criminal charges resulted. This is her justification for assaulting the complainant.[15]The probation officer reported:Ms [J.] said she would not be agreeable to writing an apology letter because [the complainant] never apologized to her. In contrast to this, Ms [J.] told the writer that she was going to stand up at court and say “I’m sorry I was wrong”. The writer questioned Ms[J.] with regard to the discrepancy between what she told the writer and what she was planning on telling the court, to which Ms [J.] stated that she “would not say [she’s] sorry” but that she knows she was wrong.[16]After the Pre-Sentence Report was prepared and following further counselling, counsel for Ms. J. filed the following apology letter.I wish to apologize to the court and to the complainant for my actions and attitude that has brought me before the court. I have been attending counseling since the incident and it helps me to focus on myself. I have also been volunteering with the elders and working. I am very sorry I have come before the court and I will not do it again. I am embarrassed by being here. I hope that the complainant will accept my apology as I take full responsibility for my actions that have brought me here today.[17]The counsellor confirmed in a letter to the court:… [she] has done well in our sessions and I have no reservations concerning her honesty and or her effort during our time together. She states that our sessions have been helpful to her and we plan on continuing to meet regularly to discuss past history and the anxiety present now.…[18]Since being charged, Ms. J. has also acted as a volunteer to assist two elders in O[…].THE TRIAL JUDGMENT[19]The trial judge gave oral Reasons for Sentence in O[…]. He addressed the concern arising out of the Pre-Sentence Report that while Ms. J. accepts responsibility for her actions, she still blames the complainant for what took place 10 years ago. Nevertheless, he accepted the assertions in her letter that she knew it was wrong and that she is sorry.[20]Although it was not raised by either Crown or defence, the trial judge raised the issue of marijuana use by Ms. J. He acknowledged that it had been reduced from six joints a day to two joints a day through counselling. He gave counsel an opportunity to respond.[21]He stated the following at para. 14 of his Reasons for Sentence:[14] I raise the issue, as I am familiar with the decision that I recently issued in R. v. Graham, 2017 YKTC 29 (CanLII), in Haines Junction. In that case, Mr. Graham had entered a guilty plea to having committed an offence contrary to s. 4(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19. He had been charged with possession for the purposes of trafficking and ended up pleading to simple possession of marijuana.[22]Mr. Graham also indicated in his Pre-Sentence Report that he was a daily user of marijuana and would not stop.[23]At para. 15 of his Reasons for Sentence, the trial judge quoted from the Graham case which set out his view of the public interest component of a discharge for Mr. Graham:12 The problem that arose for me with respect to the discharge at the original sentencing date was that Mr. Graham, quite candidly and quite honestly, said that he used marijuana daily and that was not going to stop. I was confronted with the difficulty of imposing a conditional discharge with a probation order on someone who has candidly admitted he is going to be using illegal drugs every day to deal with the issues he had been dealing with . . .13 In order to use illegal drugs, one has to buy these drugs from somewhere. Since there is nowhere that can sell them legally except to a person with a medical marijuana exemption, it meant Mr. Graham had to be buying from someone who was trafficking illegally, and he himself becomes part of the trafficking transaction. That, of course, facilitates illegal trafficking on a bigger scale. The people trafficking the marijuana that he is purchasing may be doing more — I do not know — and nothing turns on that, but the bottom line is that the public interest remains clear, that the trafficking of illegal drugs in the Yukon can have a very negative impact on the larger community.14 The countervailing point is, of course, the Liberal government's indication at that time [of the original sentencing] that it was going to legalize marijuana [at some point in the future,] and the fact that they have moved forward towards doing that. And at some date in the future there is a very good likelihood, given the majority government, that marijuana use and purchase will be legal in certain prescribed amounts and under certain rules and regulations.[24]In Graham, the trial judge adjourned the sentencing for four months to permit Mr. Graham to obtain a medical marijuana exemption or “some indication” that his daily usage was not going to continue.[25]Mr. Graham appeared four months later and his counsel said he had just applied for the medical marijuana exemption. That did not satisfy the trial judge who declined to impose a conditional discharge and sentenced Mr. Graham to a fine of $300.[26]In the Reasons for Sentence of Ms. J., the trial judge stated:[21] And as I said in the Graham sentencing and discussions with counsel, it puts the RCMP in a somewhat difficult situation, because right now the law is that it is still illegal. And the RCMP, while they may use discretion in deciding whether they are or are not going to deal with marijuana possession charges at this point in time, are still under a clear legal obligation to investigate and charge where appropriate.[22] I still have that problem that a discharge for someone who says that they are going to continue on a daily basis, which will facilitate trafficking or cultivation for possession for the use of marijuana simply is contrary to the public interest. I am not saying that people who do that should necessarily be charged. That is an entirely different issue, and I am sure the RCMP prioritize what they do, but I think that it sends the wrong message.[23] As such, for the same reasons as in the Graham case, notwithstanding the distinctions, I do not think I can impose a discharge. I think it is contrary to the public interest, and that again recognizes the public interest in Ms. [J.] not having a criminal record.[24] In the balancing of them all, I am afraid I feel I must come down on this side. The remorse issue and the issue of the vigilante justice would not in themselves have precluded me from granting a discharge, but when I throw in the marijuana issue, it is a bigger issue for me. I do not find the distinction is enough that I could explain what I said in Graham and do something different here.[27]He suspended the passing of sentence and ordered eight conditions of probation, for a period of six months, the details of which are not in issue. There is no condition prohibiting the possession of non-prescription drugs or alcohol.[28]He concluded with the following:[26] I have noted the letters that have been provided that are positive in support of Ms. [J.], and her involvement in counselling. I accept her apology that she has provided to the Court and note the work that she has been doing with the Elders in her community. In my opinion, she is a contributing member of her community and will continue to be. So this incident is one I do not expect to be repeated.THE CROWN AND DEFENCE SUBMISSIONS[29]At the sentencing hearing, the Crown focussed upon the lack of credible remorse. The Crown, on being advised of the judge’s view on discharges while continuing to smoke marijuana, found it “interesting” and that it made sense, but it was the remorse issue that was her primary concern.[30]Defence counsel submitted that Ms. J. took counselling after the Pre-Sentence Report, volunteered with the Elders and learned coping mechanisms and better strategies from the counselling. He distinguished Graham as case where the offender was saying that he would continue to do what he was being sentenced for.[31]At the appeal hearing, the Crown submitted that the sentencing judge committed no error and did not fail to consider a relevant factor. She submitted that the sentence was fit for a mature, once-discharged offender who committed an act of violence. It combined both general deterrence for a brazen public assault for which she refused to accept full responsibility and candidly admitting that she would not comply with current marijuana laws. She submitted that granting the discharge would cause the public to lose confidence in the administration of justice.[32]Counsel for the appellant notes that the trial judge stated he would have granted a conditional discharge were it not for the fact that Ms. J. said she smoked marijuana on a daily basis. He argues that the result of this decision is that anyone dealing with a drug addiction cannot get a conditional discharge as they are facilitating the trafficking of drugs. He submits that the decision will discourage offenders from making a full and frank disclosure for their pre-sentence reports, which will hinder probation officers from recommending counselling to deal with drug addiction.[33]Counsel for Ms. J. also submits that there is no connection between Ms. J.’s consumption of marijuana and the offence.THE LAW OF CONDITIONAL DISCHARGES[34]Section 730(1) of the Criminal Code sets out the test to determine whether a conditional discharge is appropriate:730 (1) Where an accused, other than an organization, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence, other than an offence for which a minimum punishment is prescribed by law or an offence punishable by imprisonment for fourteen years or for life, the court before which the accused appears may, if it considers it to be in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of convicting the accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged absolutely or on the conditions prescribed in a probation order made under subsection 731(2). (my emphasis)[35]Section 730(3) states that where the offender has been discharged, the person is deemed not to have committed the offence and therefore has no criminal record.[36]There is a further section of the Criminal Code which applies to Aboriginal offenders:718.2(e) all available sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances and consistent with the harm done to victims or to the community should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders.[37]The case law on conditional discharges has been addressed in two decisions of this Court: R. v. MacKenzie, 2013 YKSC 64 (CanLII) (“MacKenzie”) and R. v. Martin, 2017 YKSC 61 (CanLII) (“Martin”). These decisions review the case law from R. v. Fallofield (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 450 (B.C.C.A.); R. v. B.J.M. (1976), 1976 ALTASCAD 6 (CanLII), 3 Alta. L.R. (2d) 341; R. v. Shortt, 2002 NWTSC 47 (CanLII) and R. v. Samson, 2015 YKCA 7 (CanLII).[38]Addressing the first part of the test, that the court considers the conditional discharge to be in the best interests of the accused, this is generally met if the accused is a person of good character, without a criminal record, so that it is not necessary to enter a conviction to deter future offences and recognizing that the entry of a conviction may have significant adverse repercussions. It is not necessary to identify specific results like the loss of employment but only that the entry of a conviction may have significant repercussions that create a genuine concern.[39]The second part of the test for a discharge, whether it would be contrary to the public interest to grant the discharge, focusses on whether there is a need for general deterrence of others in the community and the need to maintain the public’s confidence in the administration of justice. The courts consider the following:1.the gravity of the offence;2.the prevalence of the offence in the community;3.public attitudes towards the offence; and4.public confidence in the effective enforcement of the criminal law.[40]In both Shortt and MacKenzie, the trial judges imposed suspended sentences where the offences involved spousal or domestic violence, which they found requires both denunciation and deterrence.ANALYSIS[41]An appeal court may intervene to vary a sentence if the court below has committed an error in principle, failed to consider a relevant factor, overemphasized appropriate factors or imposed a sentence that is demonstrably unfit. In R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII), the Court clarified that the above principles only justify intervention where the error had an impact on the sentence imposed.[42]As stated in R. v. Ipelee, 2012 SCC 3 (CanLII), at para. 38, sentencing judges, despite the constraints of parity, must have sufficient manoeuvrability to tailor sentences to the circumstances of the particular offence and the particular offender. LeBel J. specifically addressed parity at paras. 78 and 79:78The interaction between ss. 718.2(e) and 718.2(b) - the parity principle - merits specific attention. Section 718.2(b) states that \"a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances\". Similarity, however, is sometimes an elusory concept. As Professor Brodeur describes (\"On the Sentencing of Aboriginal Offenders: A Reaction to Stenning and Roberts\" (2002), 65 Sask. L. Rev. 45, at p. 49):\"... high unemployment\" has a different meaning in the context of an Aboriginal reservation where there are simply no job opportunities and in an urban context where the White majority exclude Blacks from segments of the labour-market; \"substance abuse\" is not the same when it refers to young men smoking crack cocaine and to kids committing suicide by sniffing gasoline; \"loneliness\" is not experienced in a similar way in bush reservations and urban ghettoes.79In practice, similarity is a matter of degree. No two offenders will come before the courts with the same background and experiences, having committed the same crime in the exact same circumstances. Section 718.2(b) simply requires that any disparity between sanctions for different offenders be justified. To the extent that Gladue will lead to different sanctions for Aboriginal offenders, those sanctions will be justified based on their unique circumstances - circumstances which are rationally related to the sentencing process. Courts must ensure that a formalistic approach to parity in sentencing does not undermine the remedial purpose of s. 718.2(e). …[43]The trial judge correctly identified Ms. J.’s Aboriginal circumstances, or Gladue factors, based on the drinking, abuse and spousal violence in her home as a child, its impact on her and the tragic death of her mother. He was satisfied that her remorse for the offence was genuine and she accepted responsibility by her letter and that specific deterrence was not necessary. He concluded that the first part of the discharge test in s. 730(1) had been met and that a discharge was in her best interest.[44]However, in my view, the trial judge erred when he applied his decision in R. v. Graham to conclude that it would be contrary to the public interest to grant a conditional discharge to this offender because she disclosed that she smokes marijuana daily to calm herself down. This is particularly so given his acknowledgement that she had reduced her usage from six joints a day to two as a result of her counselling for this offence. The denial of a conditional discharge in Graham may have been appropriate for that particular offence and offender, but it is not appropriate for Ms. J.[45]This is not a case where the trial judge has failed to apply s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code and consider Ms. J.’s special circumstances. Rather, it is a case where what may have been an appropriate consideration in the Graham case has been given far too much weight in Ms. J.’s circumstances.[46]In my view the fit sentence for Ms. J. must take the following differences from the Graham case into consideration:1.Mr. Graham was charged and pled guilty to a drug offence of possession of marijuana, reduced from a charge of trafficking. He had two 8.2-gram bags of marijuana, $350 and a cellphone. Ms. J.’s offence of common assault has no connection to the illegal drug industry and the trial judge’s concern about the negative impact it may have on her community.2.Ms. J.’s disclosure of marijuana smoking was made to her counsellor and probation officer. It was not a defiant act which may be an appropriate characterization of Mr. Graham’s statement to the court that he was not going to stop smoking marijuana, the precise offence before the court. In spite of that, Mr. Graham was offered the opportunity of legalizing his marijuana use with a four-month adjournment, which he did not utilize to address the judge’s clear statement that a discharge was contrary to the public interest in a drug possession case.3.With respect to the sentencing judge’s concern about illegal drug trafficking, it is simply not appropriate to lay that legitimate community concern on Ms. J., who is not before the court on a drug charge. It may indeed present a quandary to the RCMP in O[…] pending the passage of federal legislation permitting possession of marijuana in small quantities, but that has little to do with the offence of common assault and whether Ms. J. should be conditionally discharged.[47]The sentencing judge, although alive to the different circumstances of Mr. Graham and Ms. J., failed to distinguish them. In my view, Ms. J.’s case is distinguishable as there was no illegal drug activity in her offence and her disclosure of marijuana smoking was appropriate for her counselling and pre-sentence report and not a disclosure for which she should be penalized in her sentencing. I am of the view that it is not in the public interest that the personal possession and use of marijuana should result in imposing a criminal record on a 56-year-old First Nation woman who has taken counselling, apologized, and taken responsibility for her offence[48]Finally, in my view, the “not contrary to the public interest” factor in a conditional discharges refer to whether there is a need for general deterrence and the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice. That deterrence relates to the offence of common assault and not Ms. J.’s marijuana smoking. I find that a discharge in these circumstances would not affect the public’s confidence in the administration of justice.CONCLUSION[49]I conclude that the trial judge’s decision to suspend the passing of sentence, thereby giving Ms. J. a criminal record, resulted in an unfit sentence. I therefore allow the appeal and grant a conditional discharge on the same terms as the sentencing judge imposed.___________________________VEALE J."}

person whom he believed to be an adolescent but was in fact a police officer in New Hampshire.As a result of that chat room experience he distributed pornographic child pornography and other pornographic materials to the police officer.This police officer alerted officials in the Miramichi who paid Mr. Dunphy a visit and it was determined that his computer contained large quantities of child pornography, some 196 pictures and numerous videos and things of that nature.[4]The Court has received a pre-sentence report and a sex offender assessment.The second report was prepared at the behest of Mr. Dunphy’s family and was prepared by a Kathleen McKay, who is a resident in psychology and a Greg MacDonald, who is a clinical psychologist.The pre-sentence report dated June 11th, 2003 states: “To our knowledge Alvin is appearing in criminal court as a first offender.He appears to be a good candidate for community supervision and has a secure telephone in his apartment if the Court is considering a conditional sentence order.”We have subsequently learned that Mr. Dunphy is going to be moving back and living with his parents here in the Miramichi.He was previously living in Moncton.The sex offender assessment indicates one previous conviction for a sexual offence.This occurred in October 1988 when Mr. Dunphy fondled his nephew who was then nine years of age.Mr. Dunphy was charged with a sexual interference offence and received two year probation.The sex offender assessment estimates Mr. Dunphy’s risk to re-offend in a sexual manner to be medium low.The report states at page five: “The level of risk is based on the fact that Mr. Dunphy is single, has one prior sex offense and has had a male victim.”Also at pages six and seven of the report the author states in their summary and recommendations the following and I’ll read that into the record even though it is somewhat long, at page six:“This is the case of a 40-year old male arrested for Distribution of Child Pornography over the Internet.It is his second offense having been convicted in 1989 for Interference of a Minor.Mr. Dunphy is an amicable individual who appeared open and forthcoming during the assessment process.His intellectual functioning is in the low average range.He presents as a shy and introverted individual with limited social skills.He is anxious and uncomfortable in social situations and has few friends or positive influences in his life.Mr. Dunphy’s risk to reoffend in a sexual manner is estimated to be moderate.This is based on static factors that reveal that he is single, has one prior sex offense and has had a male victim.In addition, his level of risk is also a reflection of dynamic factors that include limited positive social influences, relationship instability, general social rejection/loneliness, poor cognitive problem-solving skills, sexual preoccupation and deviate sexual interests.”They go on in their report to recommend and again I quote:“As noted, dynamic factors are amendable to treatment.Given that Mr. Dunphy’s risk to recidivate is estimated to be moderate, it is recommended that he receive individual counseling in order to lower his risk to reoffend in a sexual manner.Of particular importance, it is recommended Mr. Dunphy receive treatment in order to improve his social skills.As noted, a positive social network is a protective factor that decreases the risk of criminal behavior.Given Mr. Dunphy’s introverted nature in conjunction with his poor social skills, it is difficult for him to develop positive social influences.Thus, therapy should be directed towards improving his self-confidence, social skills and the development of skills for coping with everyday life stressors.It is also recommended that treatment be aimed at helping Mr. Dunphy resolve issues concerning his sexual orientation.As notedMr. Dunphy presents with both confusion regarding his sexual orientation and deviate sexual interests.While he currently identifies himself as a homosexual male, he also admits that he is interested in age appropriate females but that his shyness prevents him from pursuing a heterosexual relationship.While Mr. Dunphy may indeed be bi-sexual, he presents as a lonely individual with a high sex drive who responds sexually to anyone who gives him attention.Again, learning appropriate social skills in addition to exploring his sexual orientation may help Mr. Dunphy to overcome the barriers influencing his feelings of loneliness and the self-perception of being socially inept.Moreover, based on Mr. Dunphy’s disclosures, he also appears to be sexually attracted to prepubescent males.At present, it is difficult to ascertain whether or not this attraction is internalized...It is also recommended that treatment explore realistic risk management strategies.These strategies would cover issues concerning the development of a positive social network, relationships and intimacy and problem-solving skills.In addition, Mr. Dunphy is currently taking a computer course that involves internet web site design.Given the nature of Mr. Dunphy’s current offense, therapy should be directed towards the exploration of the appropriateness of this course and the resulting career potential it entails.”[5]The fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing are set out in sections 718, 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code.Denunciation of unlawful conduct, in this case, possessing and distributing child pornography, is an important purpose of any sentence for offences of this kind.I am also mindful that section 718.1 requires that sentences must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.As well 718.2 requires that I consider aggravating and mitigating factors in arriving at what I consider to be an appropriate sentence.Finally section 718.2(b) requires that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.[6]We know that Mr. Dunphy has pled guilty and has apologized in court today.His pleading guilty obviously avoids the necessity of a trial.He has cooperated with officials in the preparation of their reports and these I would submit are mitigating factors.However, some people consider that child pornography is victimless offence.I and many others do not share that view.The children who are depicted in child pornography are victims and if there was less use and distribution of child pornography it would be hoped that there would be less victims.Even defence counsel has said; “he was disgusted by the types of pornography which he observed” which came from Mr. Dunphy’s computer.I think all members of society want to somehow deter these types of offences although it is discouraging at times when we realize that tons of this information is available at a moments notice just by pushing a few keys on a computer.But it is hoped that if the appropriate sentences are given by the Courts that at least they will form some basis for deterrence.[7]I have reviewed a number of cases that have been supplied to me by counsel and the range of sentences for these types of offences is quite broad, ranging from a fine to community detention to periods of incarceration.Most sentences of community detention or incarceration are for periods less than two years, normally in the one to two year range.[8]Counsel for Mr. Dunphy has said, Mr. Dunphy has not been doing well in his apartment in Moncton and has decided to move back and be under the supervision of his parents here in Miramichi.As well, it is submitted that what Mr. Dunphy did was not for a commercial benefit.It was not a production, which he had hoped to sell.Those factors are taken into consideration.[9]Crown counsel has indicated that there were numerous photographs, 196 I believe, with videos which depicted various sexual poses and sexual activities involving adolescent children.There was also an exchange of photos on the Internet with the police officer in the United States.These are serious matters and society wants us to denounce these activities.[10]I must confess that my initial reaction in going through the pre-sentence report and looking at the risk assessment was that a period of incarceration is the appropriate sentence in the circumstances of this case.However, many of the authorities which have been recommended to me by counsel point to the need to denounce and deter on the one hand but also to try to find mechanisms for rehabilitation and perhaps avoid recidivism with respect to these types of matters.We have had testimony dealing with the types of programs which are available in the prison circumstance, both at the Westmorland Institute and at Dorchester Penitentiary and on the other hand we have available here in the Miramichi the person who has prepared the risk assessment.We have testimony that the treatments which are contemplated to be done in the community will continue for at least the full sentence and if not for a longer period of time.[11]So I am satisfied that a period of incarceration of 20 months is appropriate in the circumstances of this case. I am then required under the Code to consider whether a sentence served in the community is appropriate.In R. v. Proulx, 2001 S.C.R. 61 at page 93, Lamer, Chief Justice as he then was set out four criteria for imposition of a conditional sentence.The offender must be convicted of an offence that is not punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, and that is the case in this circumstance.The Court must impose a term of imprisonment of less than two years, which I have just done.The safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender serving the sentence in the community, and a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing as set out in sections 718 to 718.2.[12]I have weighed the issue of the safety of the community and I believe that I can arrange sufficient terms and conditions such that the community would not be endangered by the offender serving the sentence in the community.So for that reason I am going to permit the sentence to be served in the community under the following terms and conditions: section 742(3)(1) of the Criminal Code provides that the Court shall prescribe as conditions of a conditional sentence order that the offender do all of the following: a) keep the peace and be of good behaviour; b) appear before the court when required to do so by the court; c) report to a supervisor within two working days or such longer period as the court directs after the making of the conditional sentence order and thereafter when required by a supervisor in the manner directed by the supervisor; d) remain within the jurisdiction of the court unless written permission to go outside the jurisdiction is obtained from the court or the supervisor; and e) notify the court or the supervisor in advance of any change of name or address and promptly notify the court or the supervisor of any change of employment or occupation.[13]There are other conditions, which I wish to add.Mr. Dunphy is to remain in the residence of his parents, at 459 Ironman Road, Miramichi, at all times except for the purpose of employment, medical appointments including therapy appointments, religious services, and any legal obligations.Mr. Dunphy will provide the supervisor with a schedule of work hours, medical and therapy appointments and hours for religious services.Mr. Dunphy is to refrain from using Internet and either must install a device in his computer, which denies access to the Internet or the computer is not to be equipped with a modem or any other means of access to the Internet.In addition Mr. Dunphy will permit the supervisor to verify the status of his computer to ensure that these requirements are met.Mr. Dunphy will not associate or hold any communications directly or indirectly with any persons under the age of 19 years.I read into the record the therapy arrangements suggested by Ms. McKay and Mr. MacDonald in their Risk Assessment Report and I am ordering, and I understand that he is agreeable, that Mr. Dunphy receive the treatment which is outlined in that report.His failure to do so will result in incarceration for the balance of the term outlined with no release on the basis of good behaviour.As well I order that he continue in the program as directed by Mr. MacDonald or Ms. McKay.Mr. Dunphy is to make reasonable efforts to find and maintain employment.I am satisfied as well on the facts of this matter, at the request of the Crown, and the consent of the accused, I should order that Mr. Dunphy provide a DNA sample in accordance with the Criminal Code.[14]Now finally section 742.3 requires that accused be given a copy of the order and an explanation of all of the terms and conditions of sections 742.4 and 742.6.As this won’t be prepared while I am still here I am going to order that Mr. Dunphy attend before the clerk for explanation. As well his legal counsel will explain to him the terms and conditions of the order once it is prepared.[15]Upon completion of the period of house arrest Mr. Dunphy will also be on supervised probation subject to the usual terms and conditions for a period of three years.Additional conditions of probation: Mr. Dunphy will continue to refrain from Internet access.Mr. Dunphy will continue with sex offender treatment if deemed required by the supervisor.[16]Mr. Dunphy I will tell you this that I had a very difficult decision to make in this particular case.We are giving you the benefit of the doubt and we are going to hope that therapy and those types of things can resolve some of the issues that you have and that you can become a productive member of society.I tell you with all sincerity that if you step out of line one step, if you don’t follow the terms and conditions of the order, you will be incarcerated for the full length of the terms that is remaining, not one day less.Do you understand that Mr. Dunphy?George S.

Flahr,2009 YKCA 13Date: 20091016Docket: YU637Between:ReginaRespondentAndCurtis Slade FlahrAppellantBefore:The Honourable Mr. Justice DonaldThe Honourable Madam Justice HuddartThe Honourable Mr. Justice GrobermanOn appeal from: Territorial Court of Yukon, June 2, 2009 (R. v. Flahr, 2009 YKTC 56)Oral Reasons for JudgmentCounsel for the Appellant:J.Van WartCounsel for the Respondent:D.McWhinniePlace and Date of Hearing:Vancouver,British ColumbiaOctober 16, 2009Place and Date of Judgment:Vancouver,British ColumbiaOctober16, 2009[1]GROBERMAN J.A.:Mr. Flahr appeals sentences imposed on him following guilty pleas on one count of cultivation of marihuana (s. 7 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19) and one count of breach of a bail condition (s. 145(5.1) of the Criminal Code, R.S. 1985, c C-46). He was sentenced to 6 months on the cultivation charge, and 30 days concurrent on the breach. Ancillary provisions of the sentence for cultivation included a weapons prohibition under s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code and a Victim Fine Surcharge of $50. A further Victim Fine Surcharge of $50 was imposed in respect of the breach charge. Apparently, it was anticipated that Mr. Flahr would be unable to pay the surcharges; rather than waive them, however, the trial judge required that they be paid forthwith, and provided that if they were not paid, the accused would be imprisoned for 1 day concurrent to his other sentences.[2]Mr. Flahr has now served 32 days of his sentence. He seeks to have the sentence varied to a six month conditional sentence, reduced, of course, by the time already spent in custody. The Crown does not oppose such a disposition, though Crown and Defence do have some difference of opinion as to the credit that ought to be granted for time spent in custody.[3]The cultivation offence involved a grow operation in which 40 plants in varying stages of maturity and 41 clones were found. In addition, approximately 400 grams of “shake” or low-end quality marihuana were found. Some equipment associated with a grow operation was also found, including lighting and fans. Mr. Flahr stated that the marihuana was grown for his own use. He claimed that the size of the operation was due to the fact that he used the marihuana for pain control, and suffered severe pain from a leg amputation that was not resolving well. He said that he kept the plants in varying stages of maturity to ensure a constant supply of the drug. The Crown suggested that the size of the operation indicated that more than personal use was likely involved.[4]The breach of bail conditions consisted of a failure to report to a bail supervisor while the accused was on bail in respect of an assault charge. When the accused was granted bail, a bail supervisor who was in the courtroom attempted to book an appointment with him, but the accused refused. He did not subsequently report.[5]The accused had an extensive criminal record including 24 convictions: 10 for theft or attempted theft, 3 for possession of stolen property, 3 for mischief, 2 for break and enter, 2 for possession of a weapon, and one each for failing to comply with a probation order, assault causing bodily harm, dangerous driving, and driving with over 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. Significantly, all but the last-mentioned conviction (which occurred in 1997) occurred between 1986 and 1996, and related to pre-1995 crimes. In 1995, Mr. Flahr suffered serious injuries in a motor vehicle accident, resulting in the amputation of one leg below the knee. This appears to have ended his criminal lifestyle.[6]Mr. Flahr was 40 years of age at the time of the initial sentencing hearing, had employment and a good work history. His amputation was causing him severe pain; the attempt to conserve the knee joint had not worked well, and at the time he came before the court for sentencing, he was scheduled to have a second amputation operation, to shorten the stump to a point above the knee joint. His doctor indicated that Mr. Flahr was on high doses of narcotics to control the pain, to the point where he was “necessarily addicted” to them. He supplemented his narcotic use with marihuana, which he found allowed him to reduce his narcotic intake.[7]The Crown sought a total sentence of 3-4 months, plus a weapons prohibition. The accused argued that the appropriate disposition was a fine in the range of $2,000 to $2,500. In the alternative, he sought a conditional sentence of imprisonment.[8]The judge adjourned sentencing for several months, without objection, to allow Mr. Flahr to proceed with his operation and a period of recovery prior to the imposition of sentence. When sentence was imposed, Mr. Flahr had undergone the second operation, which had been a success. His counsel indicated that his pain from his leg was substantially reduced.[9]The judge’s reasons for sentence were very brief. Aside from a brief discussion of the ancillary terms, the reasons are as follows:[1]This matter was first dealt with some time ago. There were guilty pleas to charges of cultivation of marihuana and a breach of undertaking.[2]At the time the matter was originally before the Court, a custodial sentence was clearly warranted based upon the prior record of the accused and the nature of the offences, particularly the cultivation offence. It also appeared that an actual custodial sentence was, to use the vernacular, \"in the cards\", given the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Van Santvoord, [2007] B.C.J. No. 404.[3]At that particular time, Mr. Flahr was scheduled for major surgery and, in consequence, I adjourned sentence so that it could be carried out without delay or problem. That has now been done but it is now time, Mr. Flahr, to face the music on this matter.[4]I take account of your continuing, ongoing medical concerns but, in my view, a custodial sentence is still warranted.[5]With respect to the cultivation charge, I sentence you to a period of imprisonment of six months. On the failing to report charge, 30 days, to be served concurrently.[6]The surcharge is $50 on each count.[7]COUNSEL FOR THE ACCUSED:As I've indicated, he's not employed at this time. I wonder if those surcharges could be waived.[8]CROWN COUNSEL:I have no submissions.[9]THE COURT:I will direct that they be paid forthwith and he can serve the default concurrently.[10]While it is, perhaps, understandable that sentencing can become a routine process in a busy Territorial Court, I am of the view that the reasons given are inadequate given the circumstances of the accused and the submissions that were made to the court. A judge imposing sentence must always be cognizant of his or her duty to explain why a particular disposition is being made. While the reasons may sometimes be brief, some explanation is required.[11]Reasons for sentence serve a variety of purposes: they ensure that the accused understands why a particular sentence is being imposed – this is essential to make the process a fair one, and may also be important to achieving goals of specific deterrence and rehabilitation. The public is also entitled to know why a particular disposition has been ordered. Public confidence in the judicial system depends on the public being able to understand why particular sentences are imposed. Reasons for sentence also serve as guideposts for those who work within the judicial system and for the general public. The principle that similar sentences should be given for similar crimes can only function if courts are able to discern what factors make cases “similar” and “dissimilar”. General deterrence also depends on public understanding of the sentencing process.[12]In the present case, a number of factors meant that the reasons were particularly important: the difference between the submissions of the Crown and the Defence was the difference between the accused losing his liberty and simply paying a fine; the judge was minded to impose a penalty that was significantly more onerous than the Crown sought; the accused’s circumstances were unusual; there was some question as to whether the size of the operation was such that it should be treated as a low-level commercial operation or whether it should be treated as non-commercial; finally, the main offence for which sentence was being imposed is one that may result in a wide range of sentences.[13]In light of these various factors, the reasons that were given were, in my view, inadequate. They do not reflect any consideration of whether a conditional sentence was appropriate, nor do they explain what sentencing purposes were found to be most important by the trial judge. While I do not suggest that the judge failed to consider the case carefully, his reasons leave the unfortunate impression that he viewed the sentencing process as a mechanical one.[14]Failure of the sentencing judge to demonstrate that he considered the possibility of a conditional sentence of imprisonment is, in my view, an error of principle in this case. The judge appears to have treated R. v.Van Santvoord, 2007 BCCA 23 (CanLII) as the authority guiding his sentencing discretion in this case. That case, however, was not similar to the case we are dealing with in material respects. The guidance provided by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in its decision in R. v. Koenders, 2007 BCCA 378 (CanLII) would have been more apt.[15]In view of the agreement of the Crown and Defence as to the proper disposition of the appeal, I would allow the appeal on the sentence imposed on the cultivation offence. I would substitute for the 6 month sentence of imprisonment a 6 month conditional sentence, which commenced on the date of the sentencing, subject to the suspension during the bail period in accordance with s. 719 of the Criminal Code, on the following terms, which have been agreed to by the Crown and Defence:1.Keep the peace and be of good behaviour;2.Appear before the Territorial Court when required to do so by that court;3.Report to a supervisor within seven working days after the making of this order and thereafter report in a manner and when required by the supervisor;4.Remain within the jurisdiction of the Territorial Court unless written permission to go outside the jurisdiction is given by that court or by the supervisor;5.Notify the court or supervisor in advance of any change in name or address and promptly notify the Territorial Court or supervisor of any change in employment;6.Abide by a curfew within his place of residence between the hours of 4:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m. daily except with the prior written permission of the conditional sentence supervisor, except for employment or work purposes, for educational purposes, for attendance at family or cultural events, for religious purposes, for emergency medical or dental treatments, and for any other purpose that the supervisor feels is rehabilitative. Mr. Flahr must present himself at the door or answer the telephone during reasonable hours for curfew checks.7.Not consume or possess any controlled substance within the meaning of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act except as prescribed by a qualified medical practitioner;8.Abstain from the purchase, possession or consumption of alcohol or other intoxicating substances;9.Not possess any fertilizer, hydroponic equipment or other equipment particularly suited for use in growing cannabis.[16]I would maintain the firearms prohibitions imposed by the judge under s. 109(1) of the Criminal Code. In view of Mr. Flahr’s financial circumstances at the time that sentence was imposed, it was proper to exempt him from the Victim Fine Surcharge under s. 737(5) of the Criminal Code. During the period he was recovering from his operation, being fitted for a prosthesis and restoring his ability to walk, it would have been a hardship for him to pay the fine. Exempting him from it would have been proper – in my view, the judge’s imposition of a concurrent 1 day sentence for anticipated non-payment was a subterfuge. I would substitute an order under s. 737(5) of the Criminal Code exempting Mr. Flahr from the surcharge.[17]The sentence on the breach of bail condition has already been served. No argument has been directed to it on this appeal, and no purpose would be served by modifying it on this appeal. I would not, in the circumstances, accede to any modification of it, nor would I give additional credit for the time served in respect of the conditional sentence beyond acknowledging that it commenced on the date of sentencing.[18]DONALD J.A.:I am in agreement with Mr. Justice Groberman’s reasons.[19]HUDDART J.A.:I agree.[20]DONALD J.A.:The appeal is allowed on the terms indicated by Mr. Justice Groberman. Thank you, counsel.“The Honourable Mr. Justice Groberman”"}

These needn’t be repeated. I found the sentence imposed on the accused to be inappropriate. It involved the suspension of the passing of sentence and placing the defendant on probation conditions, one of which required him to make restitution to the victims of his unfair practices.[3]The request of Crown counsel to me on this POA sentence appeal was for 15 months imprisonment, a stand alone order of restitution, and a probation order for two years with a condition of reporting to a probation officer. I agreed that imprisonment was appropriate and sentenced the defendant to an aggregate of seven months. I declined to make a probation order.[4]I expressed an reluctance to make a stand alone order of restitution mainly because I was unsure of my authority to do so.I invited both Crown counsel and the defendant to make additional submissions on this point. I entertained additional oral argument and agreed to defer my decision pending receipt of some case authorities, and any additional written submissions that the parties wished to make. I have now received these from Crown counsel. The defendant who was anxious to serve the custodial portion of his sentence and is currently incarcerated, did not make any additional submissions.[5]In the supplementary written submissions of the counsel for the Crown is a brief statement that a compensation order is a creature of the Criminal Code and does not apply to provincial offences. I infer from this that Crown counsel has abandoned the request for a stand alone order of restitution. If so, I agree with his new position. There is no statutory authority under the Business Practices Act, nor under the Provincial Offences Act, to make a stand alone order of either restitution or compensation.[6]This was an obvious deficiency in a statute that deals with offences which typically involved economic loss to victims. I note that the Business Practices Act has been repealed in its entirety very recently and has been replaced by provisions in the Consumer Protection Act, which not only doubles the maximum sentence available on conviction[2] but also addresses the non-availability of both a restitution order and a compensation order.[3] Had the defendant been charged under this new statute, there would be no problem in imposing a stand alone order of restitution. But he was charged under the Business Practices Act which continues to apply to this case, even in this appeal.[4] The repeal and the new specific provision for restitution, however, highlight by contrast the non-availability of this sanction in the BPA.[7]The argument now advanced by counsel for the Crown in his primary argument is that this court should impose by way of sentence, in addition to the imprisonment already ordered, a two year probation order with its major feature being a term of restitution to all of the victims of the defendant’s unfair practices.[8]The issues are reduced to two.(1)Can a probation order with a restitution condition be imposed?(2)Should a probation order with a restitution condition be imposed?[9]The prosecutions concedes that the only sanctions available under the BPA are a fine or imprisonment or both. It is under the Provincial Offences Act, specifically section 72(1)(b), that the court can place a defendant convicted of an offence “in a proceeding commenced by information” on probation in addition to fining or sentencing the defendant to imprisonment. It is on section 72(1)(b) of the Provincial Offences Act that the Crown counsel relies for the imposition of a sentence of probation on the defendant.[10]I agree with him that probation is an available sentence in this case. It was started by information. My sentence does involve imprisonment. The defendant has been convicted. All of the pre-requisites are present and qualify the defendant for this additional sentence.[11]The more difficult determination is whether this defendant should be placed on probation and, in particular, with a probation condition of restitution to his victims. This determination involves a number of considerations.[12]Firstly, the probation order can have a maximum duration of two years[5] from the date it takes effect. In this case, any probation order I might make would take effect on the expiration of the defendant’s term of imprisonment.[6][13]Secondly, the making of a probation order is discretionary, not automatic, and the court has to have regard to the age, character and background of the defendant, and to the nature of and the circumstances surrounding the offences.[14]Thirdly, a probation order made under section 72(1)(b) POA necessarily has three statutory conditions.[7] However, it may have optional conditions as well. These optional conditions are in the discretion of the court and the authority to impose such conditions is in section 72(3) POA.[8][15]Section 72(3) POA has four sub-paragraphs, listed disjunctively, which provide some choices for conditions that can be prescribed in a probation order made under section 72(1) POA. In this case, subparagraphs (b) and (d) do not apply as conditions sought by the prosecution. While these might be available, there is no request for either. This leaves conditions of probation that might be imposed pursuant to section 72(3)(a) and/or section 72(3)(c).[16]Fourthly, this court has to bear in mind the provisions of section 75 POA which deals with breaches of conditions of probation orders made under the POA, and, in particular the penalty provisions for such breaches.[9][17]Counsel for the Crown has brought to my attention two quite recent decisions on which he relies, both unreported to date.[18]R. v. Gnish et al[10] involved the sentencing of the defendants, a husband and wife, and their credit counselling corporation, on an offence of failing to register pursuant to the Collection Agencies Act. After fining the corporation $1000, Knazen J. placed the husband and wife on probation for two years under the POA with the statutory conditions and, on the husband, he added an optional condition, namely, that he make restitution in the amount of $1200 within six months.[19]It is apparent from this decision that the restitution condition was being imposed pursuant to section 72(3)(c) POA. It is also quite clear that this particular condition of restitution was “representative” only. By this, I mean that there were multiple victims with many losses in the case, but the court chose to order restitution to one victim only rather than ordering “full restitution”. The intention expressed was:“to show … that any violation in the future … could result in full restitution being ordered”.The presiding justice was“notpersuaded that ordering restitution in the full amount will contribute to the defendant’s rehabilitation any more than the trial, the conviction and the terms imposed already has.”[20]My inference from this decision is that the court connected the restitution condition to the circumstances of the offence and the defendants and intended to convey a message to the defendants that more onerous consequences would result from any recurrence of such offences, the obvious targets being prevention of similar conduct and rehabilitation of the offenders.[21]R. v. Senchak[11] involved a charge of breach of probation under section 75 POA. The defendant had been charged with an unfair practice offence under the Business Practices Act. He was placed on probation on a consent appeal relating to that offence, with a condition of restitution. He was also fined. He failed to make the restitution. He also did not pay the fine. This decision is not particularly helpful except that it suggests that, as a term of probation imposed under section 72 POA following a conviction of an unfair practice, the court can require restitution. The conclusion to be drawn is that the presiding justice relied for his authority to do so on section 72(3)(a) POA. The restitution ordered in this case was $3000. The transcript does not document what happened on the breach of probation charge. The case was put over to another date presumably on the expectation that the defendant would, in the interim, pay his victim and pay his fine.[22]My decision, in this case, is to decline to order the defendant to make restitution to his victims. I decline to do so in a stand alone order of restitution because there exists no authority for me to do so. I decline to do so as a condition of probation for the following reasons.[23]First, and foremost, this disposition is a stretch to a length I am not prepared to go. The offence-creating statute, the Business Practices Act, contains a penalty section specifically for the offence of an unfair practice. This involves fine or imprisonment or both. It would have been very simple to include probation and restitution in the sanctions available for this offence in the BPA. Their absence is conspicuous. While probation is clearly an available sentence, it is equally clearly an additional sentence to the primary choices set out in the BPA, and one that is more generic in its application. Probation is not restricted to BPA offences; it applies to any provincial offence where the proceeding is started by information.[24]To impose probation in addition to imprisonment, there needs to be some purpose to the probation. In the unique circumstances of this case, there is little doubt in my mind that the only purpose for imposing a probation order at this time is to provide a vehicle to carry the restitution condition sought by the Crown. There is no other way to effect restitution in this case.[25]Section 72(3) POA sets out four options available as terms or conditions of a probation order. The first permits the court, in its discretion, to order“that the defendant satisfy any compensation or restitution that is required or authorized by an Act”.What this is, in my reading, is a clear and unambiguous choice that deals specifically with restitution as a condition of a probation order. However, it is not an unlimited choice: it does not give the court imposing sentence carte blanche in the restitution condition it selects. In fact, the restitution included as a condition of probation must be a restitution that is required by an Act or authorized by an Act. By “required”, I infer that restitution is a mandatory or a minimum sentence for the offence involved. By “authorized”, I infer that there is some specific statutory reference in an “Act” that makes restitution a potential sentencing disposition.[26]In this case, the BPA neither requires nor authorizes restitution. Nor does any other “Act” that applies to the offences in this case. I cannot determine what requirement or authorization in what “Act” the court relied upon in R. v. Senchak in making a probation order with a restitution condition. In fact, it is not certain if the court in that case actually did act under section 72(3)(a). It merely stated that section 72(3)(a) did apply but did not say why it did apply.[27]Accordingly, I cannot utilize paragraph (a) of section 72(3) POA to include a restitution condition in the case before me. This leaves paragraph (c) of section 72(3) POA as a possible authority to include a condition of restitution.[28]However, paragraph (c) presents some difficulties as well. The probation conditions permissible under this paragraph are not specified. This paragraph is what is sometimes called a “catch all” clause,[12] legal jargon for wide and unspecified choices of conditions of probation allowed to the court. It was under section 72(3)(c) that the restitution condition was included in the probation order in R. v. Gnish. What was not addressed in that case, and what troubles me in the present case, is the presence of section 72(3)(a) POA. I have considerable difficulty in by-passing a specific provision that gives me a choice, albeit restricted, of restitution, in favour of a non-specific provision that is so general that it has virtually no restrictions at all. Using the catch all is tantamount to doing an end run around legislation that constrains sentencing options. I have to assume that these constraints were included for some purpose. Resortingto section 72(3)(c) is part of the stretch I cannot bring myself to make in this case.[29]Secondly, and to back up a step, I am very reluctant to place this particular defendant on probation at all, much less with a restitution condition. The context of the case before me is unusual but very relevant. Chronologically, this case will soon be five years old. The first court appearance was in March 2001. The sentencing took place in January 2003, almost two years later. The defendant was placed on probation for two years until January 2005. It is now January 2006. His probation term ended over a year ago. There is no evidence that he actually breached[13] any of the probation conditions of his probation order, except the condition of restitution. Other conditions included reporting to his probation officer under whose supervision he remained for the full two years, performance of 50 hours of community service work, and writing letters of apology to all victims of his thirteen unfair practices offences.There was no representation by the prosecution that he did not complete these.[30]For what, if anything, does this two years on probation count? To ignore it is as unfair, in a lesser context, as ignoring ten years of penitentiary time spent by someone who is later exonerated by new DNA evidence. In addition to fairness considerations, there is also the problem of section 72(4) POA which creates a maximum two year duration for POA probation orders. Technically, the defendant’s probation order had expired on January 13, 2005, some six months before my decision on sentence appeal was released (July 15, 2005). While an appellate court can vary a sentence, it must do so“… within the limits prescribed by law …”[14]Placing the defendant on probation for another two years would mean he would spend four years on probation, double the maximum that is permitted as the duration of a POA probation term. I do not believe this is “within the limits prescribed by law”.[31]Thirdly, in making a probation at all, even on a sentence appeal, the court is required to consider the age, character, background of the defendant, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission.[15] The nature of the offences and the circumstances in which they were committed, in particular the age and vulnerability of the victims unquestionably favour supervision for some period of time in the form of a probation order, and if possible, with some repayment of victims’ losses.[32]However, the background of the defendant is to be included in this consideration. In this case, and on this appeal, all of the factual considerations mentioned in paragraph [28] and paragraph [37] of my prior Reasons continue to apply, namely, that the defendant has lost virtually everything, he has gone bankrupt, his life is a mess, he attempted suicide, he has suffered loss of income, reputation and health, and was reduced to living on disability benefits. To these must be added two additional and very significant facts. One is that he has spent two years on probation. The second is that he is serving a sentence of seven months of incarceration.[33]My feeling is that additional probation would be overkill in this case. Seven months of deprivation of liberty is not insignificant and serves the primary objectives of deterrence and denunciation as well as contributing to rehabilitation. What the justice system has not imposed is consequences for his offences, divine retribution appears to have.[34]Fourthly, I have to question the why behind the probation order sought by the Crown. The purpose is primarily, and at this point, only, to create a judicial obligation on the defendant to make good the losses suffered by the victims of his offences. That obligation would persist for a period of two years only, as it is necessarily tied to the maximum duration of a probation order. It might be extended for an additional year should the restitution not be made and should the defendant be charged and convicted of a breach of probation.[16][35]Is it realistic to expect restitution to be made by this defendant? I don’t think so. He will be a recipient of disability benefits when he is released from custody. He has gone bankrupt. Presumably what he managed to accumulate is all gone. He is likely not going to return to the home renovation business, at least in this community. He now has a record although one for provincial offences. There has to be a realistic expectation that probation conditions will be complied with during the term of the probation order. There is little to none here. In R. v. Gnish and R. v. Senchak, the restitution amounts were modest, $1,200 and $3,130 respectively. In this case, the losses exceeded $70,000. This defendant does not have the means, or the reasonable likelihood of acquiring the means to make any significant restitution. And he ought not be set up for an almost certain failure to comply.[36]Finally, there are reasons that are more peripheral in nature but which militate against the probation cum restitution that is being sought. On nine of the thirteen offences of which this defendant was found guilty, his co-accused was also convicted. Not only was the co-accused sentenced to imprisonment, he was also placed on probation with a condition of restitution to the victims of his nine offences of specific dollar amounts that represented approximately half of the total losses of his individual victims.[17][37]It is clear from the facts admitted by the defendant in this case, and from the findings at trial in the case of the co-accused, that these two individuals were involved in a common business through which they engaged in their unfair practices. However, the participation of each of these miscreants was not equal in the offences for which they share a conviction, and obviously not so for other offences of which they were convicted individually. While culpability for a particular offence is shared equally, the degree of culpability isn’t necessarily so. There really is no way to allocate degree of culpability between these two individuals. Moreover, there is no evidence as to who received what portion of the monies they obtained from their individual victims.[38]In the evidence in this case on which the sentence appeal is brought, it was conceded that of the thirteen victims of the defendant, eleven received some repayment via distributions to creditors by the bankruptcy trustee, approximately 14 cents on the dollar for each claim made. There is no reconciliation in the evidence of the amounts of the claims in bankruptcy of these eleven victims, whether these claim amounts are the same as the amounts read into evidence and acknowledged by the defendant in this case, and whether these claim amounts coincide with the amounts found to represent the losses of the nine victims that the co-accused had in common with the defendant in this case. There is no evidence as to which two victims did not make claims in the bankruptcy at all, and whether these two were or were not victims in common to both of these two villains. The evidence in this case also established that for some of these victims, some home renovations were done or partially done. There was unsatisfactory evidence of the amount of work done and for whom, and no evidence of the value of any work that was actually done.[39]While this court has great sympathy for the victims of the defendant, the primary function of this court is not to redress the wrongs or the losses sustained by one member of the community as a result of conduct of another. That is more the province of courts of civil jurisdiction which are much more suited to determining matters of compensation and restitution, determining quantum, and allocating liabilities. This proceeding is, in fact, one step removed from the trial court and does not even have the advantage of having heard any of the evidence; this court is dealing with an appeal against sentence.[40]For all of these reasons, I decline to place the defendant on probation, and consequently, there will be no order of restitution. The victims will have to seek redress in the civil courts where they will have access to all of the legal machinery to collect and enforce any judgment awarded. As for the defendant, his time behind bars represents a measured response that will hopefully result in no further offending.Released:January 31, 2006Signed: “Justice John Kukurin”[1] Since reported as R. v.

and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and to the community.[12]Section 718.1 provides that a sentence be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.Section 718.2 sets out other sentencing principles that a court is required to consider.Under this section a court needs to consider any aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender.In addition, a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.Position of the Crown and the Defendant[13]The Crown argues that specific deterrence is a significant factor in this case.They point to the fact that the victim was not seeking a physical confrontation.Mr. Bonnington, however, persevered, waded through the water to Mr. Gibbon’s boat, and insisted on getting up on the back of the boat to hit Mr. Gibbons.The Crown points to Mr. Bonnington’s extensive criminal record and the fact that he has been convicted of an assault in the past.The Crown seeks an order that Mr. Bonnington be incarcerated for 18 months, followed by two years’ probation.[14]Mr. Bonnington accepts that a period of incarceration is required in this case.It is submitted that while denunciation and general deterrence are relevant considerations, specific deterrence should not be a concern for the court.The defence points out that Mr. Bonnington has close ties with his family.He has been the driving force behind his business and a long period of incarceration will likely result in the closure of his business and the loss of jobs in the community.The defence submits that an intermittent sentence of 90 days would be appropriate in the circumstances of this case.With respect to probation, the defence has proposed a period of one year probation after completion of the sentence.Case Law[15]It is apparent that there are a broad range of sentences which have been imposed by the courts for convictions of aggravated assault.This reflects the wide range of circumstances covered under this section.[16]In support of their position that an intermittent sentence is appropriate, the defence relies upon three cases.In R. v. Smart, 2013 ONSC 600 (CanLII), the court dealt with an incident where the two defendants picked a fight with the complainant.One of the defendants held the complainant while the other punched him.The complainant suffered two fractures to his jaw and was left with permanent scarring.It is significant to note in that case that both of the offenders were relatively young.One was 24 at the time of the assault, and the other was 26.One of the accused had a criminal record, but with no crimes of violence.The other was a first-time offender.The attack on the complainant was found by the court to be an aberrant act which was out of character for both of the defendants.In that case, the court found the appropriate disposition for each of the offenders to be a 90-day intermittent sentence.Rehabilitation was considered an important component of the sentence, and the court was satisfied that the objective of specific deterrence did not require a longer sentence.[17]In R. v. Pulido, 2010 ONSC 3143 (CanLii) (CanLII) the court also imposed an intermittent sentence of 90 days.There had been a previous conviction about 10 years previously.In that case the defendant conceded liability for the hand injury, which proved to be the sole basis upon which he was convicted.[18]The defence also referred to the decision in R. v. Farrah, 2006 CarswellONT 6729.In that case the defendant pleaded guilty.The court also noted that the accused was a young man with a positive future.Having regard to the age and character of the accused, the nature of the offence and the circumstances, an intermittent sentence was considered appropriate.[19]The Crown relied on two authorities.In R. v. McCalla, [2000] OJ. 399, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of 15 months plus three years probation on a first-time offender.The offence arose out of an incident involving “road rage”.The appellant followed the complainant and then slashed the victim’s face with an exacto knife.Deterrence was an important component for this sentence.[20]The Crown also referred to R. v. Hassad, [2013] AJ No. 379, a decision of the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench.That case also involved a motor vehicle situation where angry words were exchanged.The accused drew a knife and slashed the complainant once across the face.The court imposed a sentence of 10 months incarceration, followed by 24 months probation.Mitigating and Aggravating Factors[21]In considering an appropriate sentence I have considered the following mitigating factors:(1)No weapon was used by the defendant in the commission of the offence.(2)Only one person was involved in the offence.The defendant did not enlist the aid of any others to participate in the assault.(3)The incident itself was relatively brief and consisted primarily of one swing towards the complainant’s face.(4)The attack in this case was not planned or premeditated.(5)The defendant had been subjected to verbal abuse prior to the incident by the complainant and by other members who were on the same boat as the complainant.(6)As noted in the pre-sentence report, the defendant was able to express victim empathy and in his own statement to the court expressed regret about the injury suffered by the complainant.[22]Some of the aggravating factors in this case are as follows:(1)The most serious aggravating factor is the nature of the injury suffered by the complainant.The loss of the vision in his eye represents a serious and permanent injury.(2)Although not recent, the defendant does have a lengthy criminal record, and on at least one previous occasion was convicted of assault.(3)The incident demonstrated a total loss of self control by the defendant.His actions in climbing onto the back of the complainant’s boat clearly demonstrated his intention to have a physical confrontation.Analysis and Decision[23]In reviewing the available case law submitted by counsel I have concluded that intermittent sentences for a conviction of aggravated assault are available only in very limited circumstances.[24]They would apply, for example, to a first offender convicted of aggravated assault who has an otherwise unblemished record.Younger offenders have also been granted intermittent sentences where there is strong evidence for successful rehabilitation.I am of the view that an intermittent sentence is not appropriate in this case.Mr. Bonnington does not fit into the characterization of a youthful offender with strong evidence of rehabilitation.His past criminal record, although he has had no convictions since 2006, does not support an intermittent sentence, which would be at the lowest end of the range.[25]At the time of the offence Mr. Bonnington was a mature adult.When he left his own boat he had the option of entering open water and leaving.Instead, he lost control of his temper and went over to the Mr. Gibbons’ boat where he intended to have, and did have, a physical confrontation.Society cannot tolerate physical aggression in the context of disagreements between people as to how someone else might be driving their boat or motor vehicle.Denunciation and general deterrence are significant factors which must be recognized for the sentence in this case.[26]Also significant is the nature of the injury suffered by Mr. Gibbons, which is a serious and permanent injury.[27]The mitigating factors noted above are, however, important.In my view, the mitigating factors take this case below the range proposed by the Crown.I am satisfied that Mr. Bonnington genuinely regrets the injury to Mr. Gibbons.My conclusion that the incident was not premeditated and that there was no weapon used are also, in my view, very significant mitigating factors.[28]I have concluded that, in the circumstances of this case, the appropriate sentence is incarceration for nine months, plus a period of two years probation.The terms of the probation are the statutory terms and, in addition:(1)report immediately to a probation officer and thereafter as required;(2)have no contact, direct or indirect, with David Gibbons; and(3)attend counselling for anger management issues as directed by the probation officer and sign any releases as requested.[29]As aggravated assault contrary to section 268 of the Criminal Code is a primary designated offence, a DNA order under section 487.051 is mandatory.In addition, a 10-year weapons ban under section 109 of the Criminal Code is also mandatory.I order that these orders be issued in accordance with those sections of the Criminal Code.Justice M. McKelveyReleased:October 11, 2013"}

Mr. [M.L.W.] said he did not have one.The officer said Mr. [M.L.W.] had blood shot eyes, and was slow and unsteady on his feet.Following a breath demand, Mr. [M.L.W.] provided breath samples of 150 and 130.III.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER[5]Mr. [M.L.W.] is forty-four years of age and was recently married to [D.W.].He currently resides in Regina with his wife and an infant child.[6]Mr. [M.L.W.] appeared with lawyer Carmen Gattinger in court in Melville on May 5, 2004.On that date, Ms. Gattinger advised the Court that Mr. [M.L.W.] had been the victim of residential school abuse as a young person.She said the incident on May 11, 2003 occurred shortly after Mr. [M.L.W.] testified at his residential school trial.The abuse alleged occurred between 1966 and 1971, while Mr. [M.L.W.] was aged six to eleven years.His residential school law suit included a claim for sexual abuse.[7]Mr. [M.L.W.] filed with the Court a letter from his lawyer Tony Merchant.Mr. Merchant confirmed his representation of Mr. [M.L.W.] in this residential school litigation.[8]Further, Mr. [M.L.W.] filed with the Court a letter from Dr. Peter Saunders of Fort Qu’Appelle.Dr. Saunders summarized Mr. [M.L.W.]’s situation as follows:[M.L.W.] has been a patient of mine since May of 2001.Over the last three years I have seen him regularly on a professional basis and have come to have some understanding of the long-term effect on his health that has resulted from the abuse that he sustained while attending residential school as a child.As a result of the post-traumatic stress disorder that [M.L.W.] suffered as a young man, he experienced periods of drug and alcohol abuse.In the mid 1990's [M.L.W.] turned his life around and at this point in his life his misuse of drugs and alcohol ceased.Unfortunately however when he started to seek legal compensation for the abuse that he suffered as a child many of the old unresolved issues resurfaced and [M.L.W.] started to abuse alcohol again.[M.L.W.]’s last abusive use of alcohol was in May 2003 at a time when he was again going through court issues related to his lawsuit against the Federal government.Since then [M.L.W.] has managed to maintain abstinence from both drugs and alcohol however he realized that he still has issues to deal with in this regard and is planning to admit himself to Pine Lodge in June and July of this year as part of a refresher course related to his past alcohol and drug abuse.[M.L.W.] has good insight into the post-traumatic stress disorder that he suffers as a result of the prior abuse.He realizes that drugs and alcohol are a fault[y] coping mechanism that he has developed to try and deal with the emotional stress he still experiences.He is making sincere efforts to get on with his life and to take responsibility for his physical and emotional well being.[9]As referred to by Dr. Saunders, inpatient alcohol treatment was arranged for Mr. [M.L.W.].A letter from Gail Guest, program secretary at Pine Lodge in Indian Head, confirmed his placementfor inpatient treatment from June 30 to July 28, 2004.It addition, Mr. [M.L.W.] has attendedAlcoholics Anonymous from time to time, and has remained sober since these offences occurred in May, 2003.[10]Mr. [M.L.W.] was employed at the New Democratic Party Call Centre in Regina from fall 2003 until the end of June 2004. He has been accepted by the Saskatchewan Indian Institute of Technology into its Information Technology course beginning August 16, 2004 and ending May 27, 2005.The pre-sentence report indicates that, upon successful completion of his first year in this course, Mr. [M.L.W.] will automatically be granted a seat for year two. During these studies, he will receive funding through the First Nations Employment Centre. Mr. [M.L.W.]’s acceptance and placement in this course was confirmed by a letter from Brenda Fiddler, Abilities Counsellor with the First Nations Employment Centre.[11]Mr. [M.L.W.] is a Treaty Status Indian, and a band member at M. First Nation.A letter from Chief Shirley Wolfe Keller stated the support of this band for Mr. [M.L.W.].Among other things Chief Wolfe Keller’s letter indicates Mr. [M.L.W.] has participated in cultural events, and will be seeking and utilizing elders for advice and moral support and counselling.[12]Mr. [M.L.W.] has a lengthy criminal record commencing in 1980.Over the next sixteen year period until 1996, he had eleven convictions for drinking and driving, which resulted in fines and periods of incarceration.Over this period, he also has other convictions including false pretenses, fraud, unlawful use of a credit card, break and enter, impersonation with intent, drive while disqualified, failing to stop at the scene of an accident and breach of probation.Since 1996, he has no further conviction for a drinking and driving offence.The last entry on his record is a driving while disqualified charge in 1999.IV.CROWN POSITION[13]The Crown submits that Mr. [M.L.W.] is a repeat offender in the area of drinking and driving.Given his past convictions for drinking and driving, the Crown submits that a period of imprisonment of less than three years but more than one year is appropriate.The prosecutor indicated that two years imprisonment “might be appropriate”.[14]In support of their position, the Crown filed the cases of R. v. Bear 1994 CanLII 4609 (SK CA), [1994] S.J. 272 (Sask. C. A.), R. v. Kakakaway, [1998] S.J. 638 (Sask. C. A.) and R v. Whitehead, (1998), 1998 CanLII 12375 (SK CA), 168 Sask. R. 314 (Sask. C. A.). These cases all reinforce the view that protection of the public through incarceration is the paramount sentencing consideration for offenders who continue to drink and drive.V.DEFENCE POSITION[15]Mr. [M.L.W.]’s position, initially advocated by Ms. Gattinger, and then continued in person by Mr. [M.L.W.], is to seek a conditional sentence of imprisonment pursuant to section 742.1 of the Criminal Code.By implication, the defence position is that Mr. [M.L.W.] would not endanger the safety of the community by serving a conditional sentence and further, that such a sentence would be consistent with the purpose and principles of sentencing. In particular the principle in section 718.2(e) is key to the defence position, requiring the court to consider “all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances ... for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.”[16]The defence notes Mr. [M.L.W.] had a substantial length of sobriety from 1997 until 2003. As a result of his residential school claim litigation, and the trauma which this created in him, he began drinking again not long before this .08 charge arose. He continues to suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, but has remained sober since committing this offence. He has considerable and ongoing professional support respecting treatment in the areas of addictions and trauma, as well as support from members of his family and his community.VI.APPLICATION OF CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES TO LAW[17]In my view, Mr. [M.L.W.]’s case can be distinguished from those submitted by the Crown.Mr. [M.L.W.] has a break in his record of seven and half years between his last conviction for a drinking and driving offence and the current offence. The offender in Bear had no such break in his record.It is difficult to tell from the case report on Kakakaway the length of any break in that offender’s record.The court in Kakakaway, however, based its finding that service of a conditional sentence in the community would likely endanger the community on the ground that Kakakaway was on probation at the time of re-offending. This suggests there was no significant break in his record. Similarly, in Whitehead, it is difficult to tell from the case report exactly how long a break this 28 year old man had since his last conviction for drinking and driving. The court, however, does say that Whitehead had twenty previous driving offences and that he had a “persistent record” of these offences. This suggests no significant break in Whitehead’s record.[18]In addition to the issue of a break in Mr. [M.L.W.]’s record, all three of the cases referred to by the Crown can be distinguished on the unique circumstances of this case. After a lengthy period of sobriety, Mr. [M.L.W.] began drinking around the time of testifying at his residential school trial. His counsellor indicates this litigation process triggered unresolved issues from the past.Section 718.2(e) requires the court to pay “particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders” in considering alternatives to jail for aboriginal offenders. In this case there is a direct link between the offence committed and his circumstance as a victim of residential school abuse. There is no suggestion of such a link in the cases cited above.[19]The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Gladue (1999), 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 385 discussed the application of Section 718.2(e) in the following terms at paragraph 81:There is no single test that a judge can apply in order to determine the sentence.The sentencing judge is required to take into account all of the surrounding circumstances regarding the offence, the offender, the victims, and the community, including the unique circumstances of the offender as an aboriginal person. Sentencing must proceed with sensitivity to and understanding of the difficulties aboriginal people have faced with both the criminal justice system and society at large.When evaluating these circumstances in light of the aims and principles of sentencing as set out in Part XXIII of the Criminal Code and in the jurisprudence, the judge must strive to arrive at a sentence which is just and appropriate in the circumstances.By means of s. 718.2(e), sentencing judges have been provided with a degree of flexibility and discretion to consider in appropriate circumstances alternative sentences to incarceration which are appropriate for the aboriginal offender and community and yet comply with the mandated principles and purpose of sentencing...[20]In my view, there could be few more compelling applications of section 718.2(e) than the situation faced by Mr. [M.L.W.].In this case, Mr. [M.L.W.], after a lengthy period of sobriety, began drinking again shortly after testifying at his residential school trial. As his counsellor Dr. Saunders summarised: “when he started to seek legal compensation for the abuse that he suffered as a child many of the old unresolved issues resurfaced and [M.L.W.] started to abuse alcohol again”.[21]In considering the application of section 718.2(e) to this case, the court must consider whether a conditional sentence of imprisonment can be considered a fit sentence for Mr. [M.L.W.], as an alternative to incarceration in a correctional facility.[22]Section 742.1 requires, first, that the sentence be one of imprisonment for less than two years.Considering the circumstances of this offence and this offender, I have concluded that a period of imprisonment of two years less a day is an appropriate sentence for Mr. [M.L.W.] in this case. In doing so I have considered the break in his record since his last conviction for drinking and driving, his exemplary behaviour since the date of this offence, and that the Crown specified a range of appropriate sentence of less than three years but more than one year.[23]Section 742.1 next requires that the court be satisfied that service of this sentence by Mr. [M.L.W.] in the community would not endanger the safety of the community. In R. v. John (2004), 182 C.C.C. (3d) (273 Sask. C. A.), the Court of Appeal granted a conditional sentence to an aboriginal offender convicted of criminal negligence causing death.In considering whether that offender posed a danger to the community within the meaning of section 742.1, Vancise J.A. commented:[51] The issue is whether the individual offender poses a risk to society while serving the sentence in the community.In Proulx, Chief Justice Lamer held that there were two factors to be taken into account to decide whether this precondition has been satisfied: (1) the risk of the offender reoffending; and (2) the gravity of the damage that could issue in the event of a reoffending.The factors to consider in deciding whether the offender poses a risk to serving the sentence in the community are: whether the offender is likely to abide by the order; the nature of the offence; the circumstances of the offence; the degree of participation by the offender; the profile of the offender including lifestyle, occupation, and criminal record; conduct following the offence; and the danger the offender represents to the community affected by the offence.[24]I have concluded that service of this sentence by Mr. [M.L.W.] in the community would not endanger the community. In reaching this conclusion, I have considered that Mr. [M.L.W.] had no convictions for drinking and driving between 1996 and 2003, that this offence occurred shortly after his residential school litigation trial, and that his return to drinking was caused, in large part, by the trauma associated with revisiting the issues surrounding his residential school claim. Mr. [M.L.W.] now has significant support from his aboriginal community as well as professional support for his continued treatment and healing in dealing with the trauma from his past. He has remained sober since the offence and has actively pursued treatment and employment.He has been active in doing community work including working for the Regina Food Bank. He has enrolled in an education program commencing in August, for which he will receive funding that will help support his wife and his infant child.[25]Section 742.1 lastly requires the court to consider whether a conditional sentence of imprisonment is consistent with the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in Sections 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code.In particular, regarding whether the principles of denunciation and deterrence can be accomplished through a conditional sentence, Vancise J.A. in John, commented:“[55] The primary question here is whether the principles of denunciation and deterrence can be satisfied by the imposition of a community-based sentence.In my opinion, the principles of deterrence and denunciation can be satisfied by the imposition of strict conditions in a conditional sentence of imprisonment.The principle of denunciation, which the communication of society’s condemnation of the offender’s conduct can be achieved without a custodial sentence.....Incarceration will usually provide more denunciation than a conditional sentence of imprisonment, but a conditional sentence which deprives or restricts an offender’s liberty can effectively satisfy those principles.The Supreme Court of Canada made it clear in Proulx that severe restrictions on the offender’s liberty are to be the norm and not the exception.[26]In Mr. [M.L.W.]’s case, I have concluded that the conditional sentence of imprisonment I will impose is consistent with the purpose and principles of sentencing as set out in the Criminal Code. As per the comments of Vancise J.A. above, I am satisfied that this conditional sentence will restrict Mr. [M.L.W.]’s liberty to a significant extent, and will provide both deterrence and denunciation. I am also satisfied that a conditional sentence, as opposed to a jail sentence, is consistent with the principle of sentencing set out in section 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code.[27]As a result, on the charge under section 253(b), I sentence Mr. [M.L.W.] to a conditional sentence of imprisonment of two years less a day. In addition to the statutory conditions contained in section 742.3(1), he shall abide by the following conditions:[28]You shall comply with the following Electronic Monitoring conditions for a period of SIX (6) MONTHS from today’s date:a)You shall report immediately, in person to the Probation Officer/Supervisor or designate, at Regina Probation Services, 2nd Floor, 1942 Hamilton Street, Regina, Saskatchewan and once per week thereafter at times specified by the Probation Officer/Supervisor.b)You shall participate in the Electronic Monitoring Program and will abide by the rules and regulations of that program.c)You must reside at [address] until you have written permission from the Probation Officer/Supervisor or designate to reside elsewhere.d)You shall be confined to your residence from today’s date until March 22, 2005 and must receive written permission from the Probation Officer/Supervisor or designate to be absent from your residence.e)You must personally present yourself to any Peace Officer monitoring the provisions of this Order.f)You shall not purchase, possess or consume alcohol, and you shall provide a suitable sample of breath when demanded to so by a Peace Officer who has reason to believe you have alcohol in your body.g)You must maintain your present employment, if any, and must notify the Probation Officer/Supervisor immediately of any change in the status of your employment.h)You must not enter any licensed premises where the primary purpose is the consumption or sale of alcohol unless you have written permission from the Probation Officer/Supervisor for employment purposes.2.Thereafter you shall report to a Probation Officer/Supervisor at such times and places as directed.3.You shall abide by the lawful instructions of the Probation Officer/Supervisor or his/her designate, especially in regard to specific programming which may include:Substance abuse programming - You shall participate actively as directed by the Probation Officer/Supervisor in detoxification, assessment, education, counselling and/or treatment in an approved program for substance abuse, including attendance at a residential treatment facility, and you shall not give cause for dismissal from such program.4.Following the six month period of electronic monitoring, you shall abide by a curfew, and be in yourresidence between 10p.m. and 7 a.m. each day unless given written permission by your Probation Officer/Supervisor to be absent, or in the case of a medical emergency.5.You shall perform 150 hours of community service work within ten months to the satisfaction of your Probation Officer/Supervisor.[29]Given Mr. [M.L.W.]’s limited income, I waive the victim fine surcharge, as I believe it would be an undue hardship for his family.Regarding the charge under s. 89(1) of the Highway Traffic Act, I fine Mr. [M.L.W.] the sum of $540 including surcharge, and give him two months to pay.R.G.

The guilty pleas were entered on March 20, 1985, and the matter was then adjourned by the Provincial Court Judge to April 2, 1985, for sentencing.[2]On April 1, 1985, the declaration in force in Saskatchewan setting the upper age limit for \"young person\" at 16, ceased, by virtue of s. 2(3) of the Young Offenders Act, to have any effect.[3]Thus the accused at the time of commission of the offence and his guilty pleas was an adult at Saskatchewan law, unless the provisions of the Young Offenders Act could be interpreted to expressly or impliedly give him the status of a young person on the date of sentencing.[4]We are all of the view that the provisions of the Act, and in particular s. 79, do not deal expressly with this particular transitional situation.[5]The only way in which it might be possible to give the status of a young person to the accused in this situation would be to give retroactive effect to certain provisions of the Young Offenders Act and also to ignore and give no effect to certain words in the Act.[6]It was argued that we should give retrospective effect to the relevant sections on the basis that they are procedural. This is impossible to do since the provisions in question deal with the status of the person and the liberty of the subject. Few provisions in the law are more substantive.[7]Similarly arguments based on the Interpretation Act and s. 11(i) of the Charter depend on retrospective treatment of the status of the person under the Young Offenders Act.[8]Accordingly, the learned Provincial Court Judge erred in treating this matter under the Young Persons Act.

Murphy, for the respondent.[1]Barry, J.: This is an appeal from the sentence imposed upon the appellant in Provincial Court at Gander on December 8, 1986, by His Honor Judge Owen Kennedy where the appellant had been charged with having operated a motor vehicle on a highway while his blood-alcohol level exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s. 239(1) (a) of the Criminal Code of Canada (the Code).[2]At trial, after receiving the appellant's guilty plea, the trial judge asked Crown counsel for a summary of the evidence whereupon the following statement of the facts of the case was offered by the Crown:“On the 5th of December, 1986 at approximately quarter to eight in the evening at Gander, Newfoundland, while on patrol on Airport Boulevard a vehicle operated by the defendant, Mr. Carlson, was noted straddling two lanes on Airport Boulevard, between Memorial Drive and Fitzmaurice Road. The vehicle was checked and there were three male occupants. The driver was Mr. Carlson. He was subsequently given the A.L.E.R.T. demand and registered a 'fail'. A breathalyzer demand and rights to counsel were given and at the time he was returned to Gander detachment. Two tests were taken; the first at 8:13 and the second at 8:31, both 140 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.”He then asked the appellant if he had anything to say whereupon the appellant replied:“Yes sir. This incident happened on Friday night and I haven't had a chance to have a lawyer present, but I do have a character witness who is my supervisor who was present at that time.”The appellant called a witness, one Bob Birbine, who testified as follows:“I'm up here on temporary duty with Mr. Carlson doing ice reconnaissance and I've known Mr. Carlson for approximately ten years and I can attest to his being a decent citizen. He has never been involved in any traffic violation and he's a law abiding citizen; he has a wife and kid … two kids, sorry, and I got nothing to say but everything is good and this is the first time this happened to him and I'm asking the leniency of the court and I do realize the seriousness of this situation and possibly I should have been driving that truck. He did ask me to drive it but I didn't actually. I can attest to him being an upstanding citizen.”[3]The appellant was then asked if he had anything further to say to which he replied in the negative. The trial judge then imposed sentence upon the appellant as set out in the following excerpt from his judgment:“Okay, sir, in relation to the offence I'm imposing a fine of $500.00. The fine is payable within a period of sixty days. As well sir, it's mandatory that I make an order to prohibit you from driving pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Code. In relation to the circumstances adduced before me, I'm making an order pursuant to s. 242 of the Criminal Code to prohibit you from driving for a period of one year.”[4]The appellant has appealed the sentence upon the following grounds:1. That the sentence was inordinately high having regard to the nature of the offence, the circumstances of its commission and the antecedents of the appellant.2. The trial judge did not adequately consider the principles of sentencing, particularly that of the rehabilitation of the appellant, placing too much emphasis upon general deterrence.[5]The incident happened on the evening of December 5, 1986 and the trial was held the following Monday. When asked if he had anything to say following the delivery of the above summary by the Crown, the appellant said he had not had an opportunity to have a lawyer present because the offence had happened only on the previous Friday. The limited time he had within which to contact a solicitor was evident since it is well known in this area that law offices are closed on Saturdays and Sundays. It is true he could have asked for a postponement, but he was not advised of his right to do so. His comment indicates that he would like to have had the services of a lawyer to advise him as to his legal position or to speak for him in court. His plea of guilty, however, was categorical and unqualified and is not in contention upon this appeal. In the circumstances, the trial judge could do no more than to enter a conviction against him.[6]However, the penalty aspect of the offence is a very important matter for the appellant as for any accused person. He is entitled to a sentence hearing, to be represented at it by a legal counsel, to call witnesses and to testify himself respecting the sentence to be imposed upon him. It appears that the short time given him to prepare for his trial prevented him from making a more effective representation respecting the sentence to be imposed.[7]In cases such as this considerations of protection of the public, deterrence to others and to the appellant are the prime factors which must be taken into account by a trial judge in determining an appropriate penalty upon conviction of an accused person. A secondary factor, but also of great importance, is that of reformation of the accused.[8]The Canadian Sentencing Commission in its report entitled, Sentencing Reform, A Canadian Approach (published February 1987) stated at page 154 that amongst other principles of sentencing to be considered by a judge in imposing sentence, two are taken to be foremost:“a) The paramount principle governing the determination of a sentence is that the sentence be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree or responsibility of the offender for the offence.“b) Second, the emphasis being on the accountability of the offender rather than punishment, a sentence should be the least onerous sanction appropriate in the circumstances and the maximum penalty prescribed for an offence should be imposed only in the most serious cases.”[9]These principles must be applied within the limits of penalties for particular offences set by the Criminal Code and they are very relevant here because this is a first offence and because evidence of good character has been adduced by the appellant.[10]In this case it is to be noted that the appellant was driving his vehicle, straddling two lanes of the highway when seen by the police officer who apprehended him and that his blood-alcohol proportion was almost twice the permissible level. The fact that he was driving over parts of two adjoining traffic lanes does not necessarily mean that this was a result of his insobriety, as many sober persons do this. However, it may well be that this was the cause of his errant driving on this occasion.[11]Here, the appellant’s moderately high blood-alcohol proportion was the only factor which militated for a higher than minimum penalty. There were no aggravating factors and no evidence of danger to persons or damage to property caused by the appellant's manner of driving. Although where alcohol is involved, it must be borne in mind that there is always potential danger to persons or property on the scene or to be later encountered; nevertheless, penalties should be imposed in the light of all of the circumstances. These circumstances must include an appraisal of the accused himself as well as an assessment of his behaviour at the time of the actual occurrence of the offence and of the incident giving rise to the charge. Severe penalties have been prescribed by Parliament for persons who commit this offence and it is encumbent upon the trial judge to select one which will be appropriate in the circumstances of the particular case. The penalty of prohibition from driving a motor vehicle which must be imposed should be measured in the scale of gravity of the offence for a period between the minimum of three months and the maximum of three years.[12]In determining the position of the appellant's offence in this scale the trial judge should have had regard, inter alia, to sentences imposed by courts in other areas of the province, not only as guiding precedents, but also to maintain some degree of consistency in punishments meted out for similar offences. In this case, counsel for the appellant contended that the penalty imposed was much higher than that given for such offences in provincial courts in other centers in the province and he cited a number of recent unreported cases in support of that allegation where substantially lower periods of suspension of driver's license were imposed in similar cases.[13]The trial judge clearly attached great weight to the primary aspects of the sentence to be imposed, but it appears that he gave little or no consideration to its secondary aspects or to the relative gravity of the offence. The following are particular factors which the trial judge should have considered when imposing sentence:1. This was his first offence.2. His superintendent spoke highly of him as a person of good character.3. The appellant exhibited a sense of responsibility in attempting to persuade or to prevail upon his superintendent who was with him at the time to drive the vehicle, and only proceeded to drive himself when the latter refused.4. No danger to safety to others or of property was shown to exist at the time of the offence.5 There were no aggravating factors.6. The appellant was not represented at the trial and indicated that he had not had an opportunity to have legal counsel represent him because of the short time intervening between commission of the offence and the trial. Although not a ground of appeal herein, his indication to the court that he would have counsel present if there had been time to engage one should have been considered by the trial judge. No doubt had he been represented other factors in his favour may have been brought forward to the attention of the court.[14]There is no indication that the trial judge considered any of these factors when determining a suitable punishment for the appellant. It would appear that the sentence herein, i.e., suspension of license for 12 months is substantially higher than that usually imposed upon persons convicted of this offence in other Provincial Courts in this province where there were no aggravating or special circumstances which would justify a heavy penalty. For the foregoing reasons, I find that the trial judge erred in imposing such a severe sentence upon the appellant when there were no grounds evident in the facts before him to support it.[15]Accordingly, I allow this appeal and I order that the period of suspension of driver's license imposed upon the appellant be varied to six months. In other respects I confirm the decision of the learned trial judge.Appeal allowed."}

ThompsonCounsel for the Provincial CrownW. BuchnerCounsel for the Federal CrownF. AmbrogioCounsel for K. M.G. RaynerCounsel for J. S.REASONS FOR SENTENCESCHNALL, J. (Orally):I have two young persons before me, who have been charged as youths under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.K. M., at the time of these offences, was about a month short of his 18th birthday; J. S. was about five months short of his 18th birthday.These two young men, under the conditions and provisions of the law, were almost adults.Their youth, therefore, and their age are not mitigating factors as such, as we might have expected with someone who is 12 or 13 and commits these types of offences.They are months away — very short months away from being of an age where the law and the community would have considered them as adults, responsible for their actions.Their youth, however, and being under the age of 18, clearly places them within the provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, where certain things apply to youth that do not apply to adults and vice-versa.S. and M. have both been charged with damage to property in excess of $5,000, that is Section 430(4).The Crown elected to proceed summarily on that count.They have both been charged under Section 182(b); that is an indictable offence, carrying a maximum of five years in jail, if they had been charged as adults. S. also has a simple possession of a narcotic charge and I will have to deal with that as well.The damage to property and the Section 182 charge, indignity, relate to a cemetery in the City of London.These two young men created an overwhelming amount of damage in terms of physical property, specifically 86 headstones or monuments being damaged, many of them beyond any possibility of repair; many of them belonging to individuals of the community who no longer have relatives available to contribute to the repair of that damage.Eleven of those monuments add up to $33,000, which is a formidable expense, which has not yet been incurred by the governors of the cemetery.In addition, there is damage to windows of a chapel and a broken bench.All of that damage adds up to $48,005.That is just part of the damage that has occurred as a result of the actions of these two young men.That is the tangible, observable, assessable damage.There is no dollar value that can be placed on the psychological and emotional damage that has happened to the family and relatives of those who are buried in that cemetery, to the community at large, and to the directors or governors of the cemetery itself, who are mandated to care for these monuments.The Crown submits that there has been a community outcry, and certainly an understandable outrage because of what has happened to the property in this cemetery.The court must be seen to have, and does have, the role of reflecting the repugnance and the denunciation of the community of which these two young men are a part.Unlike the community at large, being the general community, who are the citizens and occupants and residents of this city, and the specific community, who are the family and relatives of loved ones who are interred in that cemetery, who have been very directly and significantly affected, the court has to remain dispassionate and objective, and as such, this court has to be guided by very specific sentencing provisions that are set out in the Youth Criminal Justice Act.The court can certainly acknowledge, and does acknowledge the emotional distress and pain and outrage of those who have been affected, but must always remain objective in its assessment of a number of factors, including the particular circumstances of the individuals who stand before the court, their antecedents as the Crown refers to them, their current circumstances, the pre-sentence reports which have been prepared, the involvement of family, for example, and also the circumstances of the offences.There is a range of options that is available to the court.The court cannot step outside of that range of options, based solely on the horrific nature of this type of criminal offence and the resultant profound impact on members of the general community and the specific community, to which I have referred.The Crown has correctly drawn the court’s attention to certain provisions in the Youth Criminal Justice Act, to determine what those options are.In every case, the court has to consider the specific offender or offenders and the specific offences, and there is always a spectrum along which a given sentence will fall.Is this the worst offence and the worst offender, or is it something less than that?This offence comes very close to being the worst offence of this nature.It is probably the worst offence that the directors and managers of the cemetery can envision, short of, perhaps, the kind of circumstance that the Crown referred to, which is the sacrilegious or satanic spray painting, desecration type of offence, but this one is almost there, given the nature of the damage, the overwhelming amount of damage.I’m going to deal first with Mr M., and I do intend to treat the two young men differently; they have different circumstances, they come to this court in different positions.Their involvement in the offences is identical, but their respective positions as they come to the court, place them in somewhat different categories.I will deal with Mr M. and then I will deal with Mr S..I have indicated certainly, the context in which the court has to see all of these matters, and before I proceed, it is appropriate to give each one of these young men an opportunity to address the court, and as I said, I am going to start with Mr M..Is there anything that you want to say?You do not have to if you do not wish to, but you may, if you like.K. M.:I’d like to say that I’m embarrassed and ashamed of what I did, and I’m very, very sorry for all the pain and suffering I put people through.THE COURT:Thank you, you can sit down.Mr S., is there anything that you want to say?J. S.:I’d like to say sorry to my parents, to the community.I’m very ashamed of what I’ve done and I’m sorry.THE COURT:Thank you.The provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, specifically Section 39, set out that a court may not impose a custodial disposition unless the matter fits within certain exceptions.The Crown has noted those exceptions, I have reviewed them again.I have reviewed Section 39 and the relevant integrated section, the Section 38, which sets out specifically the purpose and principles of sentencing and specifically, sub-paragraph (3) of that section.I’m not going to read it, the Crown has referred to the specific aspects of it.What is significant and why I refer to those sections now for Mr M. is that overall, his background, the absence of a record, except for the one incident in 2001, and the nature of this offence, on the face of it, would not place him into the category where the court would impose a custodial sentence, except for paragraph (d) under Section 39(1), and that is:In exceptional cases where the young person has committed an indictable offence, the aggravating circumstances of the offence are such that the imposition of a non-custodial sentence would be inconsistent with the purpose and principles set out in Section 38.And in Section 38, I agree with the Crown’s submissions that the court has to look at subsection (3), paragraphs (a) through (f) and in particular:The degree of participation by theyoung person...the harm done tovictims and whether it was intentionalor reasonably foreseeable...and any other aggravating and mitigating circumstances related to the young person or the offence that are relevant to the purpose and principles set out in this section.Section 38(1) sets out the purpose, and I will just very briefly refer to it, so that these young men and their parents will recognize what the court is talking about.The purpose of sentencing is to hold a young person accountable through the imposition of just sanctions that have meaningful consequences forthe young person, and that promote his or her rehabilitation and reintegration into society, contributing to the long term protection of the public.Section 38(2) sets out the principles, in subparagraphs (a) through (e) and I will paraphrase them:The sentence must not result in a punishment that is greater than the punishment that would be appropriate for an adult in the same circumstances; must be similar to the sentences imposed in the region on similar young persons found guilty of the same offence, committed in similar circumstances; must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the person for that offence.All available sanctions other that custody that are reasonable, and that is an important part, in the circumstances should be considered.The sentence must be the least restrictive that is capable of setting out and accomplishing these purposes and most likely to rehabilitate the young person and reintegrate him, and promote a sense of responsibility and an acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and the community.And then we have subsection (3), to which the Crown referred.K. M. fits into the exceptional circumstances case.I impose six months in open custody, which will be four months in custody and two months in community supervision, and probation to follow.In terms of these two young men and their responsibility and participation, each one participated one hundred percent, fully, in the commission of these offences; no one else did.Alcohol and substance abuse and the consumptionof alcohol and substances by one or both of these individuals that night, is absolutely not a mitigating factor, neither for Mr M. nor for Mr S., and I will return to Mr S. in a moment.Mr M. certainly has the support of his father, but he comes before the court not as a first time offender.He has had the benefit of probation in the past, he has had the benefit of community service in the past; neither of those has stopped him from involving himself in this offence.Further rehabilitation and reintegration is certainly available for him in the custodial setting and in probation which will follow, and that certainly is true for both boys.Following six months of custody, being four plus two, Mr M. will be subject to a term of probation for a period of 18 months, which takes me to the maximum sentence that the court can impose for this type of offence on a young person, which is two years....THE COURT ADDRESSES COURT CLERKMr M. does not seem to have the same types of difficulties that Mr S. does.I have read the pre-sentence report relating to Mr M..I note the one item of record, to which I have already referred.I am very cognizant of his father’s concern for him, his father’s support, and the fact that there has been some difficulties in the family unit in the past, that are referred to in the pre-sentence report; I do not need to put them into the record.Mr M., that is, K. M., has plans to continue with his education.His education record is marred by the number of suspensions, by things like persistent opposition to authority, use of profane language, conduct injurious to the moral tone of the school, and so on.He appears to be doing better and indeed, after changing schools has maintained a solid “B” average in his elementary schools.When he enrolled in secondary school he did not do as well, but the change in schools gives him marks in the “B” to “C” range.He has potential, excellent effort and I acknowledge all of that.The needs for his rehabilitation are not as profound as those of Mr S. and the length of sentence is intended to reflect that.The terms of your probation order, Mr M., for a period of 18 months concurrent on all charges:that you keep the peace and be of good behaviour; report to this court when required to do so by the court.You are to report to a probation officer within two business days after you are released from custody, reporting thereafter as directed and remain under the supervision of a probation officer.You are to notify your probation officer of any change in your residence, address or telephone number, any change in the place of your employment, education or training.You are to attend school or an education program approved of by your probation officer, every day unless you are sick, attending all scheduled classes punctually, use your best efforts at the schoolwork or the program, and obey the routine and discipline of the school or program.If you are not pursuing your education, you will make reasonable efforts to find and maintain employment. You will have a curfew, if it is set for you in writing by your probation officer.You are not to associate nor communicate, directly or indirectly, with anybody named in writing by your probation officer, in addition to J. S..You are not to attend upon the property known as the Mount Pleasant Cemetery in London, unless in the company of a parent, or with written prior approval of your probation officer.You are to reside at the home of your father and obey the routine and discipline of that residence.You are not to possess nor consume alcohol, nor any non-prescribed narcotic, restricted or controlled drug that is not medically prescribed for you.You are to undertake any assessment, actively participate in and successfully complete any counselling or therapy that your probation officer directs, in particular with respect to alcohol and substance abuse.You will not discontinue such program without the written approval of your probation officer.Counselling or therapy shall not include detention for treatment.It is a struggle to ascertain the appropriate disposition with respect to restitution or compensation — financial compensation.If Mr M. were two months older at the time than he was, I would have been able to make a stand alone restitution order, which acts as a judgment and could be collected just like any other judgment in a civil court.I do not have that option available.I have to recognize as well, that in spite of being just two months short of being an adult, Mr M. is at the time of this offence, a young person with limited abilities to pay financial compensation, and that has to be recognized.It would be unduly harsh, althoughnot unreasonable if one looks at the total amount of damage, it would be unduly harsh for the court to impose even $15,000 divided by two.These two young men do not have full time jobs.It appears to me that it may well be overwhelming and therefore counter-productive for the court to order the sum of $7,500 to be paid.Mr M. will pay $4,000 prior to the end of his probation term; not paying it constitutes a breach.If I had ordered $7,500 I would not have said the last part; in other words, $7,500 in my view, would be too much and it would be punitive to consider non-payment of that as a breach.Four thousand dollars is a reduced amount, and in my view, is doable.Failure to pay will be a breach, which will result in a charge of breach of probation, which will then probably extend the probation or result in custody, and I address my comments to Mr S. as well.Four thousand dollars will be paid as follows — counsel you can just monitor these numbers and make sure I have not misspoken myself.He is going to spend time in custody, Mr Ambrogio, so I need to take that into account.I was contemplating half in the first year, half in the second, but he needs more than that for the first half.So, my order is $2,000 to be paid by March 31st, 2006 and the balance by the end of probation in December of 2007, but I need to probably look at that again and make sure that we are in the right place for that.His probation will end on December 2nd, 2006; I think that fits.MR AMBROGIO:I think that’s correct, Your Honour.MR THOMPSON:I think that’s right.THE COURT:Thank you, Mr Ambrogio.Mr Thompson, have I addressed all the components of the sentencing that the Crown was inviting me to consider?MR THOMPSON:Unless I missed it Your Honour, I also invited you to consider the community service.THE COURT:Yes, you did.I was contemplating — and I can invite fine tuning from all counsel, I was contemplating an order that would recognize the balance of the $7,500 for each of them, and although it would certainly be more than the minimum wage, and probably more than many young adults earn, I would order 100 hours of community service work, and if they were to be paid the excessive amount of $35 per hour, they would be working off the balance of the $3,500 for the benefit of this community.I would be concerned that anything over 100 hours may appear excessive, given the fact that they are each serving custodial sentences.Mr M., you will perform 100 hours of community service work.Can you deal with 10 hours per month as a minimum?K. M.:Yes.THE COURT:The other reason why I did not want to consider more, was because both young men will need to be getting jobs so that they can pay restitution, and contemplating finishing their schooling, as well.Ten hours is the minimum per month, to start within 30 days after you are released from custody.Anything else, Mr Thompson, for Mr M.?MR THOMPSON:No, Your Honour.MR AMBROGIO:Your Honour, I wonder if I could just interrupt for a moment?THE COURT:Please.MR AMBROGIO:I was paged to another court about 45 minutes ago, I wonder if I could just be excused at this point.I have reviewed your sentence withMr M. and he understands — I’m confident he understands.If I could be excused at this point?THE COURT:Yes, thank you.Thank you for your assistance, Mr Ambrogio.Mr S. comes to this court in a somewhat different position; he has more serious aggravating factors.My comment previously, that being drunk or high cannot be considered a mitigating factor in these circumstances, is particularly applicable to Mr S..Mr S. does not have what one would consider a positive pre-sentence report.I read the Family Court Clinic Assessment that was provided to me with respect to Mr S.; it was prepared in February of 2003, and I have read the pre-sentence report that I ordered as an update to that report.Very little of what was recommended by the Family Court Clinic in February of 2003, has been accomplished by Mr S..Mr S. is almost an adult and is responsible for making a lot of his own decisions.I have to say that the court can only be exceedingly impressed with the amount of support and concern that Mr S.’ parents have demonstrated.I have a great deal of empathy for parents who strive as hard as these two parents have done for a child or children, and come up against what appears to be the brick wall of resistance on the part of their son.I appreciate that Mrs S. would very much like for J. to be involved in a rehabilitative program to deal with substance abuse.But it is not Mrs S. who would go to Camp Dare or Portage, it is J., and I have no sense of confidence that, until he walked into this courtroom today, that J. S. was truly amenable, receptive and would be cooperative to that program.I have seen nothing from Mr S., in any of the evidence before me, that he has taken any steps since this offence occurred at the beginning of September and now three months later, to demonstrate his desire to truly rehabilitate himself.On the contrary, what we have are numerous references in the pre-sentence report, as to what recommendations have been made for him, what options have been offered, what resources have been made available and to which he has been encouraged to respond, and he has not done so.The pre-sentence report, on pages three and four, lists those resources, and on the one hand, the report says that J. attended sessions at the B.E.T. Program for example, punctually and he was described as a good participant.He attended five sessions and after that, of course, the program was cancelled.That is not his fault, but when that program became available again, he was contacted and did not respond.He has not rejoined that group; his rehabilitation came to a standstill, and by the offences he has caused, in fact, he regressed.Similarly, he has problems with substance abuse and when he was directed to participate — or invited to participate at the Addiction Services of Thames Valley he never followed through.There is nothing before me to indicate that in the last three months he has contacted them; to the contrary, he has not done any of those things.David Bogert is a counsellor who has received telephone calls from J.’s mother, expressing her concern and her desire that J. re-involve himself in counselling, and again, his mother is doing the work, J. is not.J. acknowledges that he has a substance abuse problem; I have seen nothing in the report that reflects that in the last three months he has done anything about that.His desire to be involved in counselling and in therapeutic treatment of any kind, that he now expresses through his counsel today, have the resonance of the courtroom door rehabilitation, which is at its highest as you walk through the courtroom door.I do not have the confidence that J. would be amenable to the kind of program that Portage offers; however, I do not discount that as a possibility.Portage requires commitment by an individual and it also requires a lengthy open custody disposition, at a minimum of six months.Camp DARE is also an option.I canvassed with J.’s counsel as to whether those options have been canvassed fully.In the three months since September, there would have been ample time to contact Portage and have this young man interviewed to see if he would be considered a suitable candidate; we do not have that.I appreciate the comment that J. thinks he is going to jail, and he is.I appreciate that J. thinks that he is not doing well and so he appears to have become hopeless and depressed, but he has done little to address his issues and gain the help that is readily available for him.And, therefore, I say, and I agree and accept the Crown’s submissions, that the court ought not to take into account as a mitigating factor, the level of alcohol consumption and drug consumption that was evident and admitted to, on the night of these offences.J. has a record which places him in a considerably different category from that of his co-accused, and specifically as an aggravating factor, the fact that he was on probation at the time.I read out those sections of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, that require the court to consider similar sentences for similar offences, in similar circumstances.The case to which the Crown referred me, reflected a sentence for a young person who had no record, receiving a nine month open custody disposition.I appreciate that that case had some other overtones to it, to which the Crown pointed, and which I accept as distinguishing; on the other hand, that individual had no record.J. S., I am imposing nine months in custody, being six months in open custody and three months under community supervision, to be followed by 15 months probation, which puts you at the maximum of a youth sentence.The terms of your probation order......THE COURT ADDRESSES COURT CLERK...are that you keep the peace and be of good behaviour; that you report to this court when required to do so.You will report to a probation officer within two business days after you are released from custody, thereafter as directed, and remain under the supervision of a probation officer.You are to notify your probation officer of any change in your residence address or telephone number, place of where you go to school or pursue your education, or if you get a job.You are to attend an education program approved of by your probation officer, attending it or school every day unless you are sick; going to all your scheduled classes punctually; use your best efforts at the school or the program; obey the routine and discipline of the school or program.If you are not pursuing your education, you are to make reasonable efforts to maintain suitable employment.You will have a curfew if one is set for you in writing by your probation officer.You are not to associate nor communicate, directly or indirectly, with any person named in writing by your probation officer, in addition to K. M..You are not to attend the property known as Mount Pleasant Cemetery, London, unless in the company of a parent, or with written approval prior from your probation officer.You are to reside where directed by your probation officer, who is a delegate of the provincial director, and obey the routine and discipline of that residence.Your probation officer can tell you where you live; that may be at the home of your parents, or it may be somewhere else, and you have to abide by the house rules.You will not possess nor consume alcohol or any non-prescribed narcotic, restricted or controlled drug that is not medically prescribed for you.You are to undertake any assessment, actively participate in, and successfully complete any counselling or therapy that your probation officer directs, in particular with respect to alcohol and substance abuse.You are not to discontinue counselling or therapy without the written approval of your probation officer.You will do 100 hours of community service work, a minimum of 10 hours per month. Can you handle that?You are nodding, is that a yes?J. S.:Yes.THE COURT:To start within 30 days. You will pay the sum of $4,000 to Mount Pleasant Cemetery.ForMr M. and Mr S., that money is to be paid through the clerk of the court.Two thousand dollars is to be paid by June 30th of 2006, balance by end of probation.THE COURT:Mr Thompson, is there anything else that I have not referred to, that the Crown had invited me to consider?MR THOMPSON:No, Your Honour...THE COURT:I need to deal with the...MR THOMPSON:...other than the...THE COURT:...federal matter.MR THOMPSON:...federal matter.THE COURT:Six months probation, concurrent on the drug charge.Have we dealt with all the charges for both these young men?MR THOMPSON:Yes, Your Honour.I take it in terms of those dispositions, they’re concurrent on each of the two?THE COURT:Yes, I did say that with M....MR THOMPSON:Yes.THE COURT:...but I did not say it with S., and yes, that is quite correct, thank you.THE COURT:All right.Constable, these boys are in your custody.They will be signing probation orders, a copy to go to each set of parents please, after they are signed....

BurtonCounsel for the CrownG. JosephCounsel for CJ Harvey BishopTHURSDAY, APRIL 26, 2007CLARKE, J.:ORALLY[1]In the case of R. v. Sharpe, 2001 SCC 2 (CanLII), 2001, 1 SCR 45, the Supreme Court of Canada at page 75 said this:“The primary goal of child pornography laws isto prevent harm to children.”At pages 96 to 99, the court said:“Child pornography inflicts harm on children in several ways.Children are clearly abused in its production.It can be used to groom or seduce victims and it may reduce pedophiles inhibitions respecting abuse of children.Because the market for child pornography is fueled by the demand of those who wish to possess it, criminalizing it may reduce that demand.”[2]S. 163.1 of the Canadian Criminal Code, also reflects Canada’s obligation under Article 34 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse and in particular, to prevent the exploitive use of children in pornographic performances and materials.The Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified by Canada on December 13th, 1991.[3]Courts have found denunciation and deterrence to be the primary sentencing objectives for this offence and sentences of incarceration are often imposed.For example, in R. v. Stroempl (1995) 1995 CanLII 2283 (ON CA), 85 O.A.C. 225, a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal; and in R. v Huyke, (15 May 1998) Alberta 712320; and in R. v. Ritchie [1997] O.J. No. 5664; and in R. v. Lisk [1998] O.J. No. 1456 (Ont. C.A), and other cases.[4]In addition to its international treaty obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, supra, Canada also ratified the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child prostitution and Child pornography as enunciated in United Nations document A/54/263 in the year 2000, which came in to force on January 18th, 2002.This protocol underscores the rationale for the 1993 legislation by requiring each state party to the production, distribution and dissemination of child pornography punishable by appropriate penalties that take the grave nature of the offence into account.[5]In R. v. Hewlett 2002 ABCA 179 (CanLII), 2002, 167 CCC 425, Fraser, C.J.A. observed at paragraph 22:“To be sure, the production of child pornography is child abuse, plain and simple and no attempts to rationalize or minimize this crime will ever change that.As L’Heureux-Dube, Gonthier and Bastarache JJ. stated in R. v. Sharpe, at page 132, the very existence of child pornography as it is defined by s. 163.1(1) of the Criminal Code, is inherently harmful to children and to society.This harm exists independently of dissemination or any risk of dissemination and flows directly from the existence of the pornographic representations which on their own violate the dignity and equality rights of children.”And at pages 147 and 148 it was said:“Child pornography also undermines children’s right to life, liberty and security of the person as guaranteed by s. 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.Their psychological and physical security is placed at risk by their use in pornographic representations.Those children who are used in the production of child pornography are physically abused in its production.Moreover, child pornography threatens the physical and psychological security of all children since it can be encountered by any child.”[6]It should be observed that children are initially victimized with the production of the images.However, their victimization endures in perpetuity with the distribution on the internet.As these children age, they come to understand that they will always be victims.Their images can be disseminated worldwide in perpetuity.Anyone can repeatedly view their violation.Their personal dignity is forever destroyed.[7]Given technological advances, child pornography is capable of easy, inexpensive and discrete production.It can be produced and stored secretly in the privacy of a home.It is difficult to ferret out and trace.It is complex, expensive and time-consuming to prosecute.[8]The images are perpetually devastating and the exposure worldwide.This is precisely why denunciation and general deterrence should be the predominant sentencing factors.There should be a clear and unequivocal understanding on the part of producers, collectors and traders in these pornographic images that if you are caught you will go to jail for a significant period of time.No other punishment will adequately express the moral culpability for participation in this crime.No other punishment has a hope of deterring those sexually addicted deviants who deliberately prey upon these young and vulnerable victims.[9]The Court has a duty to impose punitive sentences that reflect both society’s values and its duty to protect children from sexual exploitation.The message that children are not appropriate sexual partners must be clear.In fact, this message has been sent by actual jail terms in many cases.R. v. Steadman 2001 ABQB 1004 (CanLII), [2001] A.J. No. 1563, R. v. Rideout [1998] A.J. No. 199, R. v. Weir [1998] A.J. No. 155, R. v. Yaworski [2000] O.J. (Ont. C.A.) No. 2613 and others.[10]Incarceration is the most direct and effective way to punish and prevent these most repulsive of predators from further victimizing innocent children.Although one might wonder if this apparently worldwide erosion of moral dignity can be contained and dissuaded by force of incarceration alone in those few jurisdictions actually willing to legislate and adjudicate to protect children, one can only hope that Canada and its government, of which the judiciary is the third branch, will act as a role model for the rest of the world and have some small but positive future deterrent impact.[11]The nature of the pictures hoarded by Mr. Bishop are so gut-wrenchingly disturbing and so depressingly haunting that they cause this observer to pause to wonder just how the moral compass of humanity has gone so far awry.Until one actually views and appreciates the depravity of the images, one cannot adequately understand the impact they might have on both the victims and the consumers.The actual extent of the violations can be described as nothing but being horrific.[12]In the case of R. v. Petcharich 2001 O.J. No. 3940, Hill, J. at paragraph 18 said:“The possessor of child pornography cannot deny contribution to the child abuse of those youths depicted in the pictorial images possessed.Molestation of a child’s innocence and the warping of the morals and values of youth is despicable and deserving of a denunciatory punishment.Others must be deterred from participating in this crime.”And further at paragraph 22 he said:“In addition to the primacy of denunciation and general deterrence in fashioning a just disposition attention, must be paid to the restorative objective of treatment of the offender for the future protection of the public.[13]Again, in R. v. E.O., 2003 CanLII 2017 (ON CA), 2003 O.J. No. 563, Cronk, J.A. said at paragraph 7:“Possession of child pornography is a crime of enormous gravity both for the affected victims and for society as a whole.For that reason, the courts have repeatedly recognized that the most important sentencing principles in cases involving child pornography are general deterrence and denunciation.Further, the offence of possession of child pornography requires the imposition of sentences which denounce the morally reprehensible nature of the crime, deters others from the commission of the offence and reflects the gravity of the offence.[14]In dealing with child pornography, the 2007 edition of the Canadian Criminal Code in s. 163.1 provides, subsection (2):“Every person who makes, prints, publishes or possesses for the purposes of publication any child pornography is guilty of(a) an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of one year; or(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding eighteen months and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of ninety days.”Subsection (3):“Every person who transmits, makes available, distributes, sells, advertises, imports, exports or possesses for the purposes of transmission, making available, distribution, sale, advertising or exportation any child pornography is guilty of(a)an indictable offence and liable toimprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of one year; or(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding eighteen months and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of ninety days.”Thus, a term of imprisonment is now mandatory for offences of this nature.[15]In R. v. Lea 2004 O.J. No. 6040 (Ont. C.A.);and in R. v. Yaworski 2000 CanLII 4400 (ON CA), 2000 O.J. No. 2613; and in R. v. Neilly 2006 April 21st, (Ont. C.A.), terms of incarceration were imposed.There are many more like cases which I have reviewed and considered but, in my judgment, it is not necessary to refer to them as most of them refer to the appropriate principles to be applied in cases similar to the case at bar.[16]Mr. Bishop is indeed an extremely fortunate young man in that firstly the crown proceeded by way of summary conviction with respect to each count rather than by proceeding by indictment.Proceeding by indictment would mean that a far more severe sentence would likely be imposed.The second aspect of his good fortune is that the above sections of the current Criminal Code were not in effect at the time he committed these offences.These offences were committed in 2004.It was not until November, 2005 when the Criminal Code was amended to provide the legislation relating to child pornography as I have quoted it above.[17]In 2004 the legislation regarding child pornography as I have clearly indicated did not make it mandatory that there be incarceration or imprisonment.In 2004 the Criminal Code provisions regarding child pornography were as follows:“S. 161.1(3) Every person who transmits, makes available, distributes, sells, imports, exports or possesses for the purpose of transmission, making available, distribution, sale or exportation of any child pornography is guilty of(a) an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years; or(b)an offence punishable on summaryconviction.Subsection (4) Every person who possesses anychild pornography is guilty of(a) an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years; or(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.”[18]In R. v. Lisk 1998 O.J. No. 1456 (Ont. C.A.) the offender pleaded guilty to charges of possession and distribution of child pornography.The trial judge, having considered the conditional sentence provisions of the Criminal Code, determined that denunciation and deterrence could not adequately be addressed with a jail sentence served in the community.Mr. Lisk was sentenced to three months in jail.That sentence was affirmed by the Ontario Court of Appeal.[19]The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Proulx (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 provided guidance to trial courts when considering conditional sentences.The court identified four criteria that a sentencing court must consider before deciding to impose a conditional sentence.1.The offence is one that is not punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment;2.The court must impose a term of imprisonment of less than two years;3.The safety of the community would not be endangered by serving the sentence in the community; and4.A conditional sentence would be consistent with the sentencing principles set out in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code.The Court further affirmed that there was no presumption for or against a conditional sentence for particular offences.In considering whether the sentencing principles of denunciation and deterrence could be reflected in a conditional sentence, former Chief Justice Lamer in speaking for the Supreme Court, stated at page 492:“A conditional sentence can still provide a significant amount of denunciation.This is particularly so when onerous conditions are imposed and the duration of the conditional sentence is extended beyond the duration of the jail sentence that would ordinarily have been imposed in the circumstances.”And again at page 493 he said:“Moreover, a conditional sentence can provide a significant deterrence if sufficiently punitive conditions are imposed and the public is made aware of the severity of these sentences.There is also the possibility of deterrence through the use of community service orders.Nevertheless, there may be circumstances in which the need for deterrence will warrant incarceration.This will depend in part on whether the offence is one in which the effects of incarceration are likely to have a real deterrent effect as well as on the circumstances of the community in which the offences were committed.”[20]In R. v. Cohen, 2001 CanLII 3862 (ON CA), [2001] O.J. No. 1606, the Ontario Court of Appeal substituted a conditional sentence of fourteen months for a fourteen month jail term imposed at trial on charges of possession and distribution of child pornography.The court distinguished Lisk on the facts.Lisk involved an offender who distributed material in exchange for more child pornography.In Cohen, however, the offender responded to invitations by undercover police.Moreover, the Court of Appeal found that the sentencing judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Proulx, a decision that affirmed that conditional sentences were capable of achieving the sentencing objectives of denunciation and deterrence.[21]In R. v. Schan 2002 CanLII 41613 (ON CA), [2002] O.J. No. 600, (O.C.A.) dealt with an appeal from a jail sentence imposed for the offence of possession of child pornography. The offender had downloaded images from the internet for his own use.He did not distribute them.The offender was cooperative and had taken steps to deal with the problems that gave rise to the charge.The Court of Appeal varied the sentence to 18 months imprisonment to be served in the community, stressing that the specific circumstances of this offence and this offender made the imposition of a conditional sentence appropriate.[22]The Ontario Court of Appeal again addressed sentencing in child pornography cases in R. v. Weber, 2003 CanLII 28579 (ON CA), [2003] O.J. No. 3306.The offender was convicted of three charges of distribution of child pornography and one charge of possession of child pornography.He was given a fourteen month conditional sentence.The Ontario Court of Appeal affirmed the sentence and the trial judge’s reliance on the earlier Court of Appeal decision in Cohen which circumstances were substantially similar and a fourteen month conditional sentence was imposed.The court reiterated that these types of offences required sentences that denounce the conduct and deter others and that conditional sentences could, with strict conditions, serve these sentencing objectives.[23]In R. v. Yong Jun Kim, 2004 CanLII 32118 (ON CA), [2004] O.J. No. 119, a decision again of the Ontario Court of Appeal, the offender was sentenced to a nine month conditional sentence on charges of possession and distribution of child pornography.The offender distributed pornographic material in exchange for more pornographic material.He had 12,000 images on his server and sent out over 2800 images.The offender was a youthful first offender.The court distinguished this case from the Cohen and Weber cases where conditional sentences were imposed.The court also referred to its decision in Lisk where the offender distributed pornographic material in exchange for more pornographic material and where the offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.In Kim, the court stated that a conditional sentence was inappropriate and that a substantial reformatory sentence was called for.However, as the offender had served most of his conditional sentence and had just recently arranged psychiatric counseling, the court did not interfere with the sentence.[24]In my review of these cases the following principles emerge from the case law:1.Possession and distribution of child pornography are very serious offences and can be linked to the harm occasioned by the sexual abuse and exploitation of children;2.These types of offences require a sentence that clearly denunciates the conduct and deters others;3.Jail sentences are necessary to adequately address the sentencing objectives of denunciation and deterrence;4.A conditional sentence with strict conditions can adequately serve the objectives of general deterrence and denunciation and is appropriate for certain offenders;5.The sentencing court must be guided by these principles but each case must be determined bearing in mind the particular circumstances of the offence and the offender.[25]Mr. Bishop has pleaded guilty to these offences and has expressed remorse for his conduct.He cooperated fully with the authorities when the search warrant was executed.He does not have a criminal record.Mr. Bishop has accepted responsibility for his conduct and it is my understanding he is committed to participating in counseling and treatment.To that end, he has attended counseling sessions with Dr. Stewart, a psychiatrist.He has participated in an assessment with Dr. Langevin and is, I understand, prepared to participate in the Northwestern Ontario Sexual Behaviour Program.[26]There are a number of aggravating factors however, which I must consider.The number of child pornography and child nudity images seized from Mr. Bishop’s computer was significant.As indicated earlier, the availability of these images on the internet perpetuates the savagery of child abuse and child exploitation and the dissemination of child pornography worldwide evidenced by the accessing of Mr. Bishop’s file server and the images on it by Detective Inspector Zito in the United States.[27]The purpose and principles of sentencing are set out in, as indicated earlier, in s. 718 of the Criminal Code.That section reads as follows:“ The fundamental purpose of sentencing isto contribute along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:a)to denounce unlawful conduct;b)to deter the offender and others from committing offences;c)to separate offenders from society where necessary;d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; andf)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.”S. 718.1 of the Code requires that the sentence imposed be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.S. 718.2 of the Code requires the court to consider the following:“1.Any aggravating and mitigating circumstances relating to the offender;2.Sentences should be similar to those imposed in similar circumstances;3.Where consecutive sentences are imposed the total should not be unduly long or harsh; and4.Offenders should not be deprived of their liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances.”[28]Counsel do not agree as to what is an appropriate sentence in this case.Accepting their positions the question remains whether this is an appropriate case for the jail sentence to be served in the community.[29]S. 742.1 of the Criminal Code reads as follows:“Where a person is convicted of an offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment and the courta)imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years; andb)is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2, the court may for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions of a conditional sentence order made under s. 742.3.”As indicated earlier, in 2004 when these offences were committed, the Criminal Code did not provide for a minimum term of imprisonment.[30]S. 163.1 of the Criminal Code is a comprehensive scheme designed to attack child pornography at every step – production, publication, importation, distribution, sale and possession.It is a legislative response that reflects the values of our society, values that abhor the violence that this material visits on children.[31]The principles that emerge from the case law with respect to sentences for these types of offences clearly place denunciation and deterrence as primary objectives when considering a fit sentence.[32]The Ontario Court of Appeal decisions in Cohen, Schan and Weber all confirmed or substituted conditional jail sentences for child pornography offences.The same court in Lisk imposed a jail sentence and in Kim, while not substituting a jail sentence for the conditional sentence imposed at trial, stating clearly that a conditional sentence was not appropriate in that case.[33]Where then does Mr. Bishop’s case fall within this spectrum?[34]Sentencing should not be a stiff or formulaic exercise.Rather it should be principled, responding to community circumstances and flexible enough to permit the exercise of discretion.While ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code and the case law clearly articulate the applicable sentencing principles, they must be read and considered in light of the particular circumstances of each case and each offender.[35]According to the reports ordered by the court and particularly the report of Dr. Langevin, Ph. D., forensic psychologist, Mr. Bishop is not a pedophile but he is homosexual.In reaching this conclusion, Dr. Langevin examined Mr. Biship over a two day period and conducted some twenty or more different tests including a phallometric test of erotic preference.With respect to this test, Dr. Langevin reported that many men tend to try to manipulate the testing by doing various things but that Mr. Bishop did not.Dr. Langevin reported:“CJ did not attempt to manipulate the phallometric test in any of the foregoing fashions.He denied suffering from impotence or any medical condition which might affect his ability to have an erection.He was highly anxious and depressed but he was responsive nonetheless.Valid information was obtained.He was embarrassed initially when pictures of adult males were shown and he tried to check his reactions, but he did this less as the session progressed.The pedophilia index, a measure of relative attraction to children versus adults was within normal limits.Results indicate androphilia, a sexual attraction to adult males.”In the report Mr. Biship advised Dr. Langevin that he was not sexually attracted to children but lived vicariously through them in his fantasies.He told Dr. Langevin that all of his fantasies were of being like the children in the pictures whom he believed at the time were loved and appreciated and he wanted to have bodies like them and be appreciated like them.Dr. Langevin reported that since he has been in therapy he recognizes that he is naïve and that he now realizes that they were not loved nor appreciated.Dr. Langevin further reported that Mr. Bishop did not know the difference between sex and love but that he does now and that he regrets his use of the images.Under the heading of Summary and Recommendations Dr. Langevin states:“Mr. Bishop presented as clinically depressed and his emotional state is fragile.In spite of current medication for depression, his symptoms are evident and suicide risk should be monitored by a psychiatrist.He presented a pro-social, non-violent and non-criminal history, but he is the product of a dysfunctional family in which his father was aggressive and demeaning.He was also harassed and teased at school to the extent he sought help from the school counselor but he did not find this helpful.It seems that CJ has incorporated much of the abuse from father and peers into his self image, which has contributed to his passiveness, depression and self-punishing attitude.He does not abuse alcohol or drugs.It seems that neither alcohol nor drugs played a role in the offences before the court.He is a man of superior intelligence and gross neuropsychological functioning appears normal, but he is emotionally confused, albeit therapy appears to have helped him adjust and should be continued.Mr. Bishop presents as an androphile, that is, he reported and showed in phallometric testing, a sexual preference for adult males.In current research with my colleagues, child pornography falls into two categories, consumers and producers.Men who use child pornography tend not to act out with children.Some may be pedophiles, who sexually prefer children over adults, and they may be inhibited individuals using the pictures as surrogates for actual partners.Some of these men are unable to relate sexually to preferred adult partners for emotional reasons and they may show signs of significant mental illness.It is most often the men who photograph children who tend to be aggressive and have an intensive criminal history.Mr. Bishop falls in the first category of child pornography consumers, that is, he has no history of sexually acting out in pedophilic ways.Actuarial measures indicate that he is a low risk for future offences.His major risk is for suicide and he should continue in therapy to address this problem and his social adjustment to the gay community.Mr. Bishop’s adjustment to prison would be a difficult one and incarceration likely would lead to the type of abuse to which he has been subjected in the past and it would likely increase his depressive symptoms and risk for suicide.Mr. Bishop is a pleasant albeit frightened young man who has the intellectual and emotional capacity to benefit from therapy aimed in particular at dealing with his sexual identity issues and coming to terms with the abuses he has suffered in his family and as a person trying to deal with his homosexuality.His intellectual functioning indicates he is capable of completing graduate school and being productive in society and he should be encouraged to complete his studies.”[36]While I accept the report of Dr. Langevin, I am somewhat skeptical about it in that I do not know if Dr. Langevin was made aware of the seventh image Mr. Bishop sent to Detective Inspector Zito in which Mr. Bishop uses his screen name of “Siege”, which image was sent to Joe.jpj the screen name of Detective Inspector Zito.That image depicts a nude boy apparently pre-pubescent lying face down on a bed but on his knees, thus raising his anus with his legs spread apart.A nude second male appears to be having anal sex with the nude boy.Nor am I aware of whether or not Dr. Langevin was made aware of the contents of the instant images which Mr. Bishop had with Detective Inspector Zito.However, as indicated, I am nonetheless prepared to accept the Report as is.[37]The pre-sentence report is extremely favourable insofar as Mr. Bishop is concerned.While basically isolated from his abusive father by his own choice, Mr. Bishop has exhibited all of the factors and characteristics of a loving and responsible young adult towards his sister, his mother and his grandparents.The report is very clear that Mr. Bishop’s father was, from a very early age, critical, demeaning and abusive of his son.Despite this, Mr. Bishop has earned the respect and friendship of many who worked with him at Bell Canada during the summers when he was not in school and notwithstanding these offences his friends have not abandoned him.He has been assessed to be at low risk for re-offending.[38]As indicated several times earlier, in 2004 these offences did not provide for a minimum term of imprisonment and I am satisfied having read the various reports and taking into account the steps Mr. Bishop has taken since his conviction, towards rehabilitation, that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing as set out in s. 718 to s. 718.2 that conditional sentences in this case would be appropriate.Mr. Bishop in my judgment probably is a more than tolerable risk not to re-offend if sentenced to conditional terms of imprisonment.Efforts towards rehabilitation would be entirely retarded by incarceration.During the period since his conviction, Mr. Bishop has demonstrated his ability not only not to re-offend but also to address his underlying problems.[39]I have as part of my judicial education, personally attended at a number of provincial and federal prisons.For example, I have visited Kingston Penitentiary, Joyceville, Collins Bay, Maplehurst, Frontenac and others.Having been there and having seen first hand the inside of these penitentiaries I am of the firm view that Mr. Bishop would not be a candidate for survival in such an institution.[40]1.With respect to count 1, namely being in possession of child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code there will be a term of imprisonment of three months to be served in the community upon conditions which I shall mention in a moment.2.With respect to count 2, namely again being in possession of child pornography, to wit: computerized graphic images contrary to s. 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code, there will be a term of imprisonment of six months to be served consecutively and to be served in the community upon conditions which I shall mention in a moment.3.With respect to count 3, namely transmitting child pornography contrary to s. 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code, there will be a term of imprisonment of six months to be served consecutively in the community upon terms which I shall mention in a moment, to be followed by three years probation.4.The terms and conditions of each of the conditional sentence orders are as follows:(1)Mr. Bishop is to report to a supervisor forthwith and thereafter as directed;(2)He is to abide by a curfew and not be away from his place of residence between the hours of 11:00 o’clock in the evening and 6:00 o’clock the next following morning except for medical, dental, educational, religious observance purposes and in any other circumstance only with the written permission of his supervisor;(3)Mr. Bishop will be permitted to be out of his place of residence every Saturday between the hours of 1:00 o’clock in the afternoon and 4:00 o’clock in the afternoon for the purposes of conducting personal errands only;(4)If directed to do so by his supervisor, Mr. Bishop is to participate in the Northwestern Ontario Sexual Behaviours Program and not to voluntarily quit such program until discharged by the authorities;(5)If directed to do so by his supervisor, Mr.Bishop is to participate in such other counseling programs as might be designated by his supervisor and not to voluntarily quit any such program until discharged by the authorities;(6)It is a condition that Mr. Bishop consent to a search of his computer at any time upon the request of a police officer;(7)It is a condition that Mr. Bishop present himself at the door of his residence when called upon to do so by the appropriate officials monitoring his house arrest and curfew conditions;(8)It is a condition that Mr. Bishop abstain from communicating, contacting or associating directly or indirectly with persons under the age of 16 years unless accompanied by another adult;(9)It is a condition that Mr. Bishop is not to access adult or child pornography websites and he is not to possess adult or child pornography in any form whatsoever;(10)Mr. Bishop is to refrain from possessing or using any computer, the internet or e-mail except as required for educational or employment purposes;(11)It is also a condition that when accessing the internet for educational or employment purposes only, Mr. Bishop shall do so only with the assistance of a key-stroke recording adapter for the purpose of monitoring his internet activity;(12)It is also a condition that Mr. Bishop cooperate fully with the police or any other authority as to the type of key-stroke logging to be installed either by hardware or software means;5.As indicated earlier, Mr. Bishop will further be subject to a probationary term of three years on the mandatory statutory conditions and the following special conditions:(1)The probation order is to run concurrently with each of the conditional sentence orders;(2)The terms and conditions of the probation order are the same as those as contained in the conditional sentence orders with the exception that the curfew and house arrest provisions are deleted from the probation order;(3)Mr. Bishop is to keep the peace and be of good behaviour;(4)He is to report to a probation officer forthwith upon the completion of the sentences imposed by the conditional sentence orders;(5)Pursuant to s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code, a warrant is to issue to seize a bodily substance from Mr. Bishop, namely blood, for the purposes of forensic DNA analysis;6.There will also be orders pursuant to s. 161of the Criminal Code as follows:(1)Mr. Bishop is prohibited from attending any public park or public swimming area where persons under the age of 14 are present or can reasonably be expected to be present or a daycare center, school ground, playground, or community center;(2)It is also ordered that Mr. Bishop is prohibited from seeking, obtaining or continuing any employment whether or not the employment is remunerated, or becoming a volunteer in a capacity that involves being in a position of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 14 years;(3)It is also ordered that these orders are to remain in full force and effect for a period of 10 years;7.There will also be an order of forfeiture pursuant to s. 164.2(1) of the Criminal Code of the child pornography seized by the police.8.There will also be an order pursuant to s. 490.012 of the Criminal Code requiring Mr. Bishop to comply with the Sexual Offender Registration Act for a period of 10 years and in compliance with this order, he is to report to the Thunder Bay Police Services at 1200Balmoral Street, Thunder Bay, Ontario within ten days.Any questions counsel?MS. BURTON:Yes, Your Honour.Just with respect to the forfeiture, in addition to the actual images themselves that were seized I’d be asking for a forfeiture of the computer equipment that was seized, if we could just specify that.And secondly I believe, I probably misheard you but was the probation order, the three year probation order to run consecutive, consecutive to the conditional sentence orders but concurrent to each other?THE COURT:Yes.MS. BURTON:Okay, thank you.I’m afraid I also need to ask for clarification of the curfew condition…THE COURT:Just a moment please.MS. BURTON:I’m sorry.THE COURT:Yes.9.It is also an order that those computer components seized by the police from Mr. Bishop’s computer be forfeited to the crown.MS. BURTON:Thank you.And I’m just seeking clarification of the curfew condition Your Honour.I’ve written down that it’s 11:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. with the various exceptions.But then on Saturday he’s only allowed out and about between the hours of 1:00 o’clock and 4:00 o’clock?THE COURT:That is right.MS. BURTON:Okay.Thank you.THE COURT:For the sole purpose of attending to personal errands.Any questions counsel?Mr. Joseph?MR. JOSEPH:Your Honour, I’m given to understand that he works on Saturdays as well too.Is that something that I guess he’ll have to clear with probation?THE COURT:I have made my order.MR. JOSEPH:Thank you.He is employed.I’m not in a position to be able to ask you to waive the victim fine surcharge.THE COURT:Pardon?MR. JOSEPH:He is employed so I’m not in a position to be able to ask you to waive the victim fine surcharge in the matter.THE COURT:Thank you.MS. BURTON:That’s our list.THE COURT:Yes, I would appreciate if I could see you in chambers counsel just for a few moments.***************COURT CLOSED***************"}

Hasan: Sentencing, 8th Edition (LexisNexis 2012)Reasons for judgment:MITCHELL J.A.:[1]On May 20th, 2014, after entering guilty pleas Joseph Laurie Doucette was sentenced to seven years in prison on a charge contrary to s.5(1) (trafficking in cocaine) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and seven years concurrent on a charge contrary to s.5(2) (possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.In addition, the sentencing judge imposed a forfeiture order of offence related property, including his car, pursuant to s.16 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, a DNA order pursuant to s.487.051 of the Criminal Code and a weapons prohibition order pursuant to s.109 of the Criminal Code.[2]Doucette appeals only the custodial portion of his sentence.He argues that the sentencing judge failed to give credit in mitigation for his early guilty plea and further failed to properly consider the gap principle as, in the appellant’s view, there was a 14 year and two-month gap between offences.He acknowledges that his sentence of seven years is not outside the appropriate range but submits that it should have been reduced to four and a half to five years because of the early guilty plea and the gap principle.[3]The Crown argues that the sentencing judge’s reasons outline a pathway and shows that she reached her conclusion after properly assessing all the appropriate principles, factors and issues.A sentence of seven years, the Crown suggests takes into consideration all the mitigating factors and is a fit sentence which ought not to be disturbed.FACTS[4]In the fall of 2013 Charlottetown police initiated an investigation code named “Project Clean Sweep.”They targeted several separate groups and individuals over a four-month period.They utilized the services of an agent to make various purchases.Count 1: Between November 12, 2013 and January 28, 2014[5]On November 12, 2013, the agent met Doucette, whom he knew, and purchased 16.2 grams of cocaine for $1,100.Later that same day Doucette attended the agent’s residence and set up a meeting at which Doucette provided the agent with 29.2 grams of cocaine on condition that the agent pay him $1,800. the following day.When the agent made the payment, Doucette asked the agent if he wanted another ounce.The agent agreed.Doucette then set up a further meeting that day and “fronted” the agent with 30.3 grams of cocaine.The agent paid him $1,800. for that cocaine a few days later.[6]On January 28, 2014, the agent purchased a further 29.7 grams of cocaine from Doucette at a price which was to have been determined later.Count 2: January 30, 2014[7]On January 30th Doucette was arrested and a search warrant was executed at his residence.There the police seized 84 grams of cocaine, 56 oxycodone pills, five cellular phones, two digital scales, an expandable baton and $535.75 cash.The Plea[8]Doucette was taken to jail January 30th where he remained until his first court appearance on February 7th.Notwithstanding that the Crown had yet to make full disclosure, Doucette elected to be tried by a Provincial Court judge and entered guilty pleas to both counts on that day.The Crown agreed to release Doucette pending the preparation of a pre-sentence report, and the matter was set over for sentencing.The Offender[9]Doucette was 58 years old at the time of the offence.He has a long criminal record containing approximately 27 offences dating back to 1972.His related record is as follows:DATETHE OFFENCETHE PENALTYOctober 1983s.4(1) Narcotic ControlAct (“NCA”)Five and a half months custodyMay 1992s.3(1) NCA$750. fineJanuary 1994s.4(1) NCA12 months custodyFebruary 1994s.4(1) NCAOne year custodyMay 1995s.48(1) Food and DrugsAct (“FDA”)Two years custodyMay 1995s.50.2(2) FDATwo years concurrentMay 1995s.465 Criminal Codeand s.48(1) FDATwo years concurrentMay 1995s.48(1) FDA18 months consecutiveMay 1995s.465 Criminal Codeand s.48(1) FDA18 months consecutiveOctober 2000s.5(2) Control Drugs andSubstances Act (“CDSA”)30 monthsOctober 2000s.4(1) CDSA2 months concurrentJune 2001s.5(1) CDSA4 years, 8 months with creditfor the equivalent of 28 months pre-sentence custody (equivalent to a 7-yearsentence)September 2003s.8(1) CDSATime served[10]Doucette has three children: two boys born in 1995 and 1998, and a daughter with his current partner born 2013.According to the pre-sentence report, Doucette’s financially unstable and deprived upbringing was a possible reason for his lifestyle decisions.The pre-sentence report prepared for his 2001 conviction and the current pre-sentence report both indicate that he sold drugs because he was struggling financially.His used car and car detailing business was slow and trafficking cocaine provided much needed cash.STANDARD OF REVIEW[11]The law is very clear that the standard of review appellate courts must apply in sentencing appeals is based on deference.(R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227; R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500; R. v. Proulx, [2000] S.C.C. 5; R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206; and R. v. Nunn, 2014 PECA 21 (CanLII).)[12]In R. v. McLean, 2014 PECA 10 (CanLII), this court put the standard of review quite succinctly at para.10:[10]Section 687(1) of the Criminal Code directs that on an appeal against sentence, an appellant court is to consider the fitness of the sentence. The Supreme Court of Canada has directed that in conducting this review, the applicable standard is based on deference. That approach is taken due to practical reasons, including the contextual nature of the sentencing process, the individualized nature of sentencing, and the advantageous position of the trial judge (R. v. Bolger, 2013 PECA 9 (CanLII), at para.14). An appellate court can intervene where the sentencing judge makes an error in principle, which includes failing to take into account a relevant factor. As well, an appellate court can intervene whether or not an error in principle has been committed where the sentence imposed is clearly excessive or inadequate, demonstrably unfit, or a substantial and marked departure from other sentences imposed for like offences by like offenders (R. v. Skerry, 2006 PESCAD 5 (CanLII), at para.16, applying R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, and R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500). The appellate review for failure to consider a relevant factor is based on the standard of reasonableness, which does not permit an appellate court to interfere with a sentence simply because a court of appeal would have weighed the factors differently (R. v. Nasogaluk, 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII), at para.46).GAP PRINCIPLE[13]I am of the view that even if the sentencing judge failed to adequately consider the gap principle, it is an error of no import.The gap principle is really the converse of the practice of treating more harshly an offence committed shortly after release from custody.A prior record is an aggravating factor.The more recent and related the prior record, the more aggravating it is.A period where the accused lives crime free may be taken into account not so much as a mitigating factor, but as ameliorating the negative effects of the prior record.Clayton Ruby in his book “Sentencing” quotes at p.391 from Cross as follows:Assuming that it is not merely the outcome of lucky non detection the trouble free period shows in these cases that the offender is not a professional criminal and, therefore, the public needs less protection from him.[14]The gap principle is not codified in the Code nor is it set in stone.In this case, there are several factors that mitigate against credit for the gap.The most glaring of which is the fact that Doucette’s 2001 conviction and sentence was related to trafficking in cannabis, considered by some to be a soft drug, while the present offence relates to the more serious, more harmful drug, cocaine.It therefore represents not so much a repeat but a step up in the drug world.[15]This cannot be seen as a momentary slip.It is a clear return to criminal activity (R. v. Murray, 2009 BCCA 426 (CanLII)).Count one involved four significant transactions over a period of two and a half months.Doucette’s motivation, according to the pre-sentence report, was the same in 2001 as it is today; that is, he wanted money to support his lifestyle, however modest.When times get tough, he turns to what he knows best and that is trafficking in drugs.[16]The sentencing judge did not buy into defence counsel’s plea that Doucette was selling only to the agent as a sort of high end accommodation trafficker.In my view, the sentencing judge was right in not accepting that explanation.Firstly, there was no evidence to that effect; it was merely part of counsel’s summations.Secondly, the items seized in relation to count two seem to put the lie to that claim.Doucette had five cell phones, two digital scales, and 56 oxycodone pills in addition to his cocaine.This paraphernalia hardly seems necessary if one is accommodating one purchaser only.[17]While Doucette does have a significant gap, it is not, as defence counsel suggests, 14 years and two months.One can only get to that amount of time by including time in custody between his arrest in 1999 and his release from custody in 2003.He can hardly claim credit for living crime free while in prison.[18]It is true that minor offences do not necessarily disentitle one to the benefit of the gap principle.However, I do note parenthetically that Doucette was convicted of one count contrary to s.253 (impaired driving) of the Criminal Code in April 2009 (90 days in prison) and one count contrary to s.259(4) (driving while disqualified) in March 2010 (60 days in prison).The latter charge indicates a cavalier attitude towards court orders.[19]All in all looking at Doucette’s related drug record, his motivation, his move to more serious and dangerous drug, it is reasonable to conclude that Doucette is a career drug trafficker and indeed he is a criminal from which the public needs protection.In my opinion, the sentencing judge made no error in dealing with thegap principle.GUILTY PLEA/PRE-TRIAL CUSTODY[20]There is truth in the old adage that one who pleads not guilty seeks justice while one who pleads guilty seeks mercy.Absent good reason, a guilty plea must be taken into account in mitigation of sentence (R. v. Macki, 2001 BCSC 427 (CanLII), at para.55).There are two schools of thought as to why a guilty plea is a mitigating factor.The first is that a guilty plea is an expression of remorse and an acceptance of responsibility.The more pragmatic rationale is that it saves the justice system the time and expense of a trial.These two rationales were articulated by MacDonald J. in R. v. Bruce (1982), 35 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 530 (PEICA), at para.14:A second mitigating factor referred to by the trial judge was that she had pleaded guilty thereby saving a lengthy trial and this could also be taken as a sign of her remorse. Numerous courts have held that a guilty plea should be taken into consideration on a sentencing: R. v. Johnston and Tremayne, [1970] 4 C.C.C. 64 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Carriere (1952), 14 C.R. 391 (Que. C.A.). It has also been stated that a guilty plea should be given less weight where there is such a preponderance of evidence against the accused that the only reasonable choice or option left open is a plea of guilty. R. v. Spiller, [1969] 4 C.C.C. 211 (B.C.C.A.). In the present case the respondent had signed a statement in which she had admitted her guilt and it could be said that her only choice was to plead guilty. However, if the rationale for a policy of decreasing sentence where a guilty plea had been entered, is based on the consideration of the time saved by not having a trial, I am unable to accept the proposition that there should be less weight given to a guilty plea from a person who has been inescapably caught. I would agree with the trial judge that the guilty plea by the respondent should be a mitigating circumstance. ...[21]In my view either or both rationales may be used to justify a reduction in sentence.The amount of credit engendered by a guilty plea however depends on the circumstances of the case.Some courts have held that a guilty plea can justify a discount of up to 25 to 33% (R. v. Weiler, 1991 CanLII 2747 (PE SCTD), 1991 CanLII 2747 (PESCTD)).That does not mean, however, that a guilty plea merits such a discount in every case (R. v. Lyons, [1991] P.E.I.J. No. 10 (PEICA)).There may well be cases where there is good reason to grant no reduction for a guilty plea.For example, a guilty plea entered at trial after the Crown has called some or all of its case is a recognition of the inevitable and not an expression of remorse nor does it save any appreciable time and expense.Such a guilty plea would merit little or no reduction in sentence.[22]Where a reduction in sentence is warranted, it is not simply a matter of a mathematical calculation.There are many factors to consider including, but not limited to, as the strength of the Crown’s case, the nature of the case, the timing of the guilty plea, whether the guilty plea saves a vulnerable victim from testifying, and the circumstances of the offender including his criminal record to mention a few.[23]It is also an error in principle for a sentencing judge to fail to give credit for pre-trial custody without good reason (R. v. Summers, [2014] 1 SCR 26 (SCC); R. v. Rezaie (1996), 1996 CanLII 1241 (ON CA), 112 CCC (3d) 97 (Ont.C.A.)).[24]In sentencing Doucette, the sentencing judge stated as follows:I considered the guilty pleas that you have entered in respect of these matters at an early opportunity.The acceptance of responsibility and the saving as a result, and as noted, certainly in respect of these matters that is a significant saving.I also consider the fact that you were in custody for a week.That following your guilty pleas, that the Crown and defence agreed to your release such that you have been in the community since February 7th able to make arrangements for your family in anticipation of the sentence that would be imposed.We are now on the 20th of May.Certainly without the Crown consent given your prior record, it’s not obvious that you would have been released from custody, Sir.So, you’ve, you certainly had that benefit.So that does in some way, has to be considered as well.It certainly was a quid pro quo with respect to the guilty plea and the saving, as well as a benefit to you of being able to be out and about for a significant period of time prior to the imposition of sentence.[25]In my view, the foregoing reveals two errors of principle.The first is in relation to pretrial custody.A sentencing judge is required to state on the record and on the warrant of committal the amount of time spent in custody, the term of imprisonment that would have been imposed before any credit was granted, the amount of time credited if any, and the sentence imposed (s.719(3.3)).Although the sentencing judge indicated that she was taking into consideration time spent in pre-trial custody, she does not appear to have granted him any credit for that time unless she thought the appropriate sentence was seven years and two weeks.Not likely.I concede that over the course of seven years one week in pre-trial custody may not seem like much.However, the liberty of the subject is a most precious right.In the normal course, Doucette ought to have been credited with a day and a half for each day in custody (R. v. Summers, supra).As he was in custody from January 30th to February 7th, a total of nine days counting both January 30th and February 7th, he ought to have been granted credit for two weeks.He received no such credit.[26]Secondly, while stating that she took into account his early guilty plea, the sentencing judge discounted it by the fact that he was released pending sentencing.The Crown on appeal suggests that based on the caselaw filed with the sentencing judge she actually concluded that a sentence of nine to ten years was appropriate but she reduced it to seven years (i.e. 25 to 33%) to give credit for the early guilty plea.However, given the sentencing judge’s own comment that release pending sentence “certainly was a quid pro quo in respect to the guilty plea and a saving” and in the absence of anything on the record to support the suggestion that a longer sentence was seen as a benchmark, I cannot but conclude she gave little or no credit to the appellant for his early and timely guilty plea.There is no evidence before the sentencing court that the Crown’s consent was in any way a quid pro quo for a guilty plea.There are any number of reasons why the Crown may have consented including that the Crown may have been of the belief that a court would have released the accused pending sentence.In any event, the time spent on release between guilty plea and sentencing is, in the circumstances of this case, irrelevant.Sentence[27]Given these errors in principle the court is free to impose the sentence which it deems fit in the circumstances (R. v. McLean, supra, and R. v. Partridge, 2005 NSCA 159 (CanLII)).[28]In this case the Crown was seeking a sentence of seven years.The defence agrees that seven years would be the appropriate sentence but that should have been reduced by virtue of the guilty plea.In my view, the sentencing judge took into account the proper factors and principles of sentencing with the emphasis on deterrence and denunciation.She properly considered his previous criminal record, the fact that his motivation was financial and not the result of any addiction, as well as a scourge that drugs, such as cocaine, represent in this small province.The sentence of seven years before taking into account the mitigating factor of a guilty plea was reasonable.As to the weight that ought to have been given the guilty plea in mitigation, it is important to note that Doucette entered his guilty plea at theearliest possible time.His guilty plea was entered on his first court appearance and before he had full disclosure.The appellant gave up his right to trial and gave up his right to challenge the evidence of the agent.In so doing, he saved an enormous amount of time and money in terms of police and court resources in bringing this matter to trial.Nonetheless, his offence is very serious and his involvement in the drug underworld has been life long.[29]Therefore, I would reduce the sentence imposed on the appellant from seven years to six years.I would also credit the appellant with two weeks for time served in pretrial custody having the effect of reducing his total sentence to five years eleven and a half months.I would affirm all other aspects of the sentence._____________________________________Justice John K.

Twaddle and Kroft JJ.A.BETWEEN:HER MAJESTY THE QUEENRespondent- and -SHARON JANE PASHE(Accused) AppellantJ.J. Gindin for the AppellantR. A. Saull for the RespondentAppeal heard: December 15, 1994Judgment delivered: February 14, 1995HUBAND J.A.The accused was the foster mother of a 21-month-old child. She had cared for the child for about three months, in a household along with her husband and her own three children.On January 13, 1990 the accused brought the foster child to the hospital at Portage la Prairie by taxi, arriving at 3:50 p.m. She claimed the child had fallen off a dresser and was thus rendered unconscious.[Page 2]The child was transferred to a hospital in Winnipeg, but died the following day.Examination of the child revealed physical findings which were inconsistent with the accused's initial explanation. The child had a number of bruises on various parts of the anatomy, and in particular around the head, all consistent with having been struck. The cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage.When confronted with this situation the accused acknowledged that she had indeed struck the child on the afternoon in question, and that the child was rendered unconscious. The accused said that she then picked up and shook the child in an effort to revive it. When that failed she rushed to hospital. No one else was at home at the time.The Crown accepted that explanation. The cause of death is consistent with severe and excessive shaking of the child. There is no admission that the accused is responsible for striking the child on any previous occasion.The accused entered a plea of guilty to a charge of criminal negligence causing death, with a joint recommendation that the incarcetory term of the sentence should be 12 months' imprisonment.The accused is 30 years of age. She and her husband have raised their own three children with no problems which have become[Page 3]apparent to a wider community. There has been no involvement with child care agencies. She has a record of four relatively minor offences, none of which involve physical violence. There is no doubt that she was remorseful for what occurred. When the gravity of what she had done became apparent to her, she acted swiftly in seeking aid for the child. She pleaded guilty to a charge which might not have been easily established without her cooperation.The learned sentencing judge refused to accept the joint recommendation of counsel. He explained that he could not bring himself \"to accept that a 12-month period of incarceration is a fit sentence proportionate to the offence and the offender in question, even with full regard to all the mitigating factors and the plea of guilty.\"He imposed a sentence of two years less a day to be followed by three years supervised probation, the probation being subject to certain conditions.It was acknowledged that the joint recommendation resulted from a plea bargaining between counsel, described by the sentencing judge as experienced and competent. A less serious charge was substituted for the original charge, and agreement was reached on the sentence to be recommended upon a plea of guilty being entered. Plea bargaining has become a routine part of the process of handling criminal cases. The bargaining process is undermined if the resulting compromise recommendation is too readily rejected by the sentencing judge.[Page 4]The sentencing judge is not bound to accept a recommendation, but it should not be rejected unless there is good cause for doing so. In R. v. Divito (unreported, January 3, 1990) this Court stated that while a sentencing judge has an overriding discretion to reject a joint recommendation \"there must be good reason to do so, particularly, as in this case, where the joint recommendation is made by experienced counsel.\" (See also R. v. Kiesman (1991), 75 Man.R. (2d) 314 (C.A.), and R. v. Walton (unreported, September 23, 1994, Man. C.A.) to the same general effect.)The question then becomes whether the learned sentencing judge had good cause to reject the joint recommendation. The sentencing judge thought that the jail term of one year was simply unfit, even as a result of a plea bargain, and that would indeed be appropriate grounds for rejecting a joint recommendation. In my view, however, the recommended jail term was within the appropriate range of sentences for criminal negligence causing death, given the surrounding circumstances. While shorter than it might have been, it was not unfit.There is a wide range of sentencing for the offence of criminal negligence causing death. That charge is often brought in motor vehicle cases where the death of some person arises, and in cases such as the present one where the death of an infant results from negligence in the provision of care. Clayton C. Ruby, Sentencing (4th ed. 1994), suggests that the \"established range now appears to be from several months to eight years' imprisonment\" depending on the circumstances. That conclusion is[Page 5]borne out in the review of decisions across Canada contained in 1 Nadin­Davis and Sproule (ed.), Canadian Sentencing Digest [1989-1991]. There are several cases involving incarceration for a year or less, and one where an infant was killed due to \"shaken infant syndrome\" where sentence was suspended. (R. v. Millar, October 4, 1990, Charron J., Ont.Gen.Div.)In my view, it was reasonable for counsel to bring the joint recommendation before the Court since the proposed sentence was in the appropriate range, albeit towards the lower end. The learned sentencing judge therefore did not have good cause to reject the proposed one-year sentence. He erred in principle in concluding that one year was unfit and in substituting a longer period of incarceration.I would allow the appeal, set aside the two-year sentence, and impose a sentence of one year. The probation order will remain.[S] J.A.I Agree:[S] J.A.TWADDLE IA,This is a sentence appeal in which the accused's only real ground of complaint is the sentencing judge's rejection of the plea-bargained recommendation as to sentence made by both counsel. At issue are the circumstances in which a sentencing judge is entitled to depart from such a recommendation.Although I personally disapprove of plea-bargaining, where it involves a recommended sentence, I recogni7p it as a practice so ingrained in the Manitoba justice system that any attempt on my part to discourage it[Page 2]would fare no better than King Canute's attempt to stem the tide. That being so, I accept the proposition that a plea-bargained recommendation should not be, in the words of my brother Huband, \"too readily rejected by the sentencing judge.\"In R. v. Simoneau (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 307 (Man. C.A.), a majority of this Court held that, in the case of a joint recommendation as to sentence where a plea bargain was not involved, the sentencing judge retained an overriding discretion to reject the recommendation. I think that is also so where a plea bargain is involved, but with this difference: a plea-bargained recommendation should only be departed from for good reason. This rule, consistently applied by this Court, maintains a proper balance between respect for the plea bargain and the sentencing court's role in the administration of justice.A sentencing judge is not obliged to impose a sentence which he or she thinks unfit merely because it is recommended as part of a plea bargain. The judge may impose instead the sentence which he or she thinks fit. In doing so, however, the judge should give reasons for thinking the recommended sentence to be unfit so that the accused knows why the bargain counsel made is not acceptable to the court. This will most often obviate the need for an appeal or, at least, be of assistance to this Court in deciding any appeal that might be brought.[Page 3]The difficulty in this case is that, in departing from the recommended sentence, the sentencing judge failed to articulate his reasons for thinking the recommended sentence unfit. He merely said that he could not bring himself to accept it as a fit one. This may be reason enough where the unfitness is clear, but insufficient to satisfy this Court in a marginal case.In my own opinion, this was not a marginal case: the recommended sentence was totally unfit. Let me give my reasons.The acknowledged circumstances of the death were these: The accused struck the child once or twice, rendering him unconscious. She then picked up the child and, hoping to revive it, shook the child strenuously. Death resulted from the shaking.If the only culpable act of the accused had her criminally negligent shaking of the child, I would have accepted the one year sentence as a fit one. Whilst the violent shaking of a young child is both an inappropriate and reckless way to treat such a child, even in the hope of reviving him, it is nonetheless an understandable reaction to an event of unknown cause. What increases the culpability of this accused, in my opinion, is that the child became unconscious as a result of being struck by her. If that had not been so, the criminally negligent shaking of the child would not have occurred. Striking a child with sufficient force to cause unconsciousness is of itself, at the minimum, an act of very great[Page 4]negligence indeed. Combined with the subsequent shaking, the conduct was of a character which, given the consequence, renders a one-year term totally unfit.In the result, I would dismiss the accused's appeal against sentence.[S] J.A.[ScanLII Collection]"}

Tweney for the applicant/appellantAlan D. Gold for the respondentHEARD:March 14, 2003RELEASED ORALLY:March 14, 2003On appeal from a sentence imposed by Justice Lauren E. Marshall of the Ontario Court of Justice dated September 9, 2002.E N D O R S E M E N T[1]The respondent pleaded guilty to fraud over $5,000 and received a conditional sentence of two years less a day.The Crown appeals this sentence and asks that the conditional sentence be set aside and that an appropriate custodial term be imposed.[2]The respondent was employed as the chief chiropodist for the University Health Network, which is an association of three Toronto area hospitals.Between 1996 and 2000, he submitted hundreds of false invoices to his employer, thereby defrauding the hospital system of approximately $900,000.In some cases the invoices were inflated, in others they were for non-existent work, and in other cases they were for personal expenses.Each invoice was approved by the respondent and submitted to the University Health Network for payment.In many cases the respondent acted in concert with third parties.[1]In March 2000, acting on an anonymous tip, the University Health Network conducted an internal audit of the chiropody unit.As a result of this audit, the respondent’s criminal activities were discovered and the police were contacted.The respondent was charged with fraud in February of 2001.A year later, he gave a detailed statement to the police admitting his involvement in the fraud.[2]We accept the Crown’s submissions that (1) the trial judge over-emphasized the significance of the respondent’s guilty plea; and (2) that a conditional sentence is demonstrably unfit in this case for three reasons: (i) it is outside the range of sentence recently approved by this court (we refer to R. v. Bogart (2002), 2002 CanLII 41073 (ON CA), 167 C.C.C. (3d) 390 (Ont. C.A.) (leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada denied March 20, 2003) and the decisions reviewed in it); (ii) it fails to satisfy the principle of general deterrence; and (iii) it is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the respondent’s degree of responsibility.[3]In Bogart, the facts of which are, in many important respects, strikingly similar to those of this case, Laskin J.A. on behalf of the court affirmed the principle that cases of large scale fraud by persons in a position of trust have generally resulted in substantial sentences of imprisonment. At pages 399-400 he said:Both before and after Parliament’s introduction of conditional sentences, cases of large-scale fraud by persons in a position of trust have typically resulted in substantial jail sentences.In his recent judgment in R. v. Dobis (2002), 2002 CanLII 32815 (ON CA), 58 O.R. (3d) 536, 163 C.C.C. (3d) 259 (C.A.), my colleague MacPherson J.A. has thoroughly reviewed these cases.His review shows that ordinarily these frauds merit a penitentiary sentence in the range of three to five years.Even where mitigating considerations have reduced the sentence to the reformatory range, a jail term, not a sentence served in the community, has usually been imposed.Health care professionals who defraud provincial health care plans have also normally received a jail sentence.As this court said in R. v. McCrystal (1992), 55 O.A.C. 167 at 169, where a doctor defrauded OHIP of nearly $85,000 by submitting false claims for fees, “[i]t is well-established that, in the absence of special circumstances, a custodial term should be imposed for an offence of this nature.”Special circumstances that might justify a conditional sentence for OHIP fraud include circumstances where the amount of the fraud is relatively small, the doctor has made full restitution before sentencing or the doctor can point to exceptional personal circumstances such as ill health or advanced age.None of these special circumstances exists here.[4]Neither do special circumstances exist in the case before us.[5]The sentence imposed in this case fails to satisfy the fundamental principles of sentencing particularly in light of factors relating to the seriousness of the offence and the respondent’s moral blameworthiness:Seriousness of the Offence[6]Fraud over $5,000 is a serious offence attracting a maximum penalty of ten years in prison.The quantum of the fraud in this case, was, as indicated, around $900,000.The fraud was systematic and well planned, taking place over four years and involving several participants.Were it not for the anonymous tip received by the University Health Network, it might never have been discovered.As a result of the fraud, the University Health Network suffered substantial losses most of which were unrecovered (the civil settlement with the respondent resulted in the recovery of only $150,000, a small portion of the loss).The respondent also returned computer equipment for which he had arranged for the University Health Network to be invoiced and which he had used at his home for his personal use.Further, the general public was deprived of resources that could have been put toward important medical services.The Respondent’s Moral Blameworthiness[7]This was an extremely serious breach of trust.The respondent was entrusted with the administration of the chiropody department at Toronto’s largest hospital, a trust he repeatedly violated over an extended period of time.The respondent was motivated by greed.He used his share of the proceeds of his crime to purchase expensive merchandise and services, including a week long trip to Whistler, British Columbia for himself and his family.The respondent cooperated with the police and hospital officials only after an audit revealed his fraudulent activities.Although the respondent has made some restitution, the majority of the public funds he misappropriated have not yet been recovered.The respondent enlisted the help of his teenage son and two of his son’s friends to commit some of the fraudulent acts.This was not only a breach of trust with respect to his employer, but a grave breach of his responsibility as a parent.[8]In the result, the appeal is allowed, the sentence is set aside and in its place, we impose a sentence of eighteen months imprisonment.A warrant may issue to be exercised in the discretion of the Crown.“R.R.

RiordonHELD AT:Newcastle, New BrunswickDATE OF HEARING:April 6 1994COUNSEL AT HEARING:George Martin, Esq. for Her Majesty the QueenHazen Calabrese, Esq. for the AccusedSENTENCINGRIORDON, J. (Orally):In the present matter Mr. Shawn Stewart has entered pleas of guilty to two counts of trafficking in cannabis resin contrary to Section 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act thereby committing an offence pursuant to Section 4(3) of that Act.The background is quite straight forward. With respect to count 1 on July 27th at approximately 9:30 p.m. he sold one ounce of hashish for $350 to a police agent, Mr. Larry Howard. With respect to count two the[Page 2]again sold one ounce of hashish for the same price to Mr. Larry Howard, the police agent, on August 6, 1993. This was part of an overall joint forces operation of police in this area with respect to the drug problem.The representations of counsel indicate that there were discussions with respect to larger amounts of drugs. Mr. Stewart has no prior record in the drug trade. He is 27 years of age and has plead guilty to the charges brought against him. In so far as I am informed he has a good, or at least he has a work record, having worked in the past. A letter of recommendation from his former employer has been introduced into evidence and he was highly regarded in that employment last year with T. Gilliss Sandblasting \u0026 Painting Ltd. and the president of that company has indicated his intention to rehire Mr. Stewart in the coming year depending of course upon work requirements.Counsel agree that Mr. Stewart's involvement in these matters is at the low end of the scale and counsel have requested the Court to be lenient and have made a joint submission with respect to sentence. These are serious matters the Act provides for a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The Courts have stated that a primary consideration in sentence is a matter of deterrence. A message must be given to the accused and to the general public that this activity is not to be repeated. In the case of The Queen v. Madore 1987, 75 N.B.R. (2nd) 230, the Court stated that other factors must also be considered. At page 232 Mr. Justice Hoyt stated:[Page 3]\"In R. v. Cormier (1977) 16 N.B.R. (2d) 710; 21 A.P.R. 710, Hughes, C.J.N.B., pointed out that general deterrence was not, however, the only factor to be considered when soft drugs are involved. At page 712 he said:'Where, however, the offence involves trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking of the so called soft drugs such as marijuana and hashish the courts must consider in addition to the deterrent aspects of the sentence other matters such as the extent to which the accused is involved in the illicit trade, his character, background, criminal record if any, mode of life and the likelihood of his rehabilitation.'In my view the former Chief Justice was not suggesting that these additional considerations have equal importance to general deterrence when sentencing for trafficking in soft drugs. He was merely reminding us that those factors must also be taken into consideration.\"I of course must be cognizant of the seriousness of these offences, that parliament has provided for a penalty of up to life imprisonment as a maximum penalty, the importance of deterrence is emphasized in all of the cases involving illicit drugs. I must also however consider the age of the accused, his work record, the fact that he has no prior criminal record in this area involving drugs, the possibility of rehabilitation and I think I must consider his plea of guilty and the remorse that he has confirmed himself here in court today. Of course it is essential that a custodial term be imposed as part of any[Page 4]sentence and although I consider the recommendation of counsel to be on the low end of the range for sentences involving trafficking in this drug, the submissions of counsel must be taken into consideration in that I believe they are probably more knowledgeable of the background and the circumstances with respect to this particular case than I am. As each case must be taken into consideration and the individual circumstances of each case are relevant, I have come to the conclusion that in these circumstances in light of the submissions of counsel, the plea of guilty and the other circumstances surrounding the involvement of Mr. Stewart that I will accept the submissions of counsel and impose a sentence of detention for 2 and 1/2 months on each count. The sentences to be served consecutively. I will direct that the accused be imprisoned for 2 and 1/2 months on each count. Each sentence is to be served consecutively. In addition I will direct that he be on probation for a period of 2 years. During that period of probation he will keep the peace, be of good behaviour and report to the Probation Officer as required. That concludes the matter. We can now adjourn.[S]Thomas W.

Hepp, 2014 ONCA 555DATE: 20140721DOCKET: C54169Hoy A.C.J.O., Gillese and Lauwers JJ.A.BETWEENHer Majesty the QueenRespondentandGregory HeppAppellantBrian H. Greenspan and Seth Weinstein, for the appellantEric Siebenmorgen and Nathan Kruger, for the respondentHeard: July 15, 2014On appeal from the sentence imposed on July 22, 2011, by Justice R.D. Gordon of the Superior Court of Justice.By the Court:[1]The appellant, a 17-year-old at the time of the offences, received a life sentence with eligibility for parole after seven years, for his role in the brutal murder of a 15-year-old girl who wanted to be his girlfriend.[2]He appeals against the imposition of an adult sentence.BACKGROUND IN BRIEF[3]The victim accompanied the appellant and his older companion, Kris Lavallee, to a campsite in a remote forest location outside of Sudbury.After killing her, the appellant and Lavallee burned her body, dismembered the remains and buried them in an effort to destroy the evidence.[4]The victim was missing for over a month before her remains were discovered.Due to the condition of the remains, it was difficult to establish a medical cause or the instrumentality of death.[5]The Crown theory at trial was that the appellant and Lavallee acted in concert in killing the victim and burning and dismembering her corpse.The appellant testified that Lavallee was solely responsible for the offences and that he took no part in them.[6]After deliberating for approximately ten hours over two days, the jury convicted the appellant of second degree murder and offering an indignity to a dead body.The Crown then brought an application pursuant to s. 64(1) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1 (the “YCJA”) to have the appellant sentenced as an adult.[7]Despite a positive pre-sentence report and psychiatric assessment which found that the appellant was a low to moderate risk of violence in the future, the trial judge sentenced him as an adult.In doing so, he gave full, thoughtful reasons.[8]At p. 2 of those reasons, the trial judge reminded himself that in R. v. D.B., 2008 SCC 25 (CanLII), [2008] 2 S.C.R. 3, the Supreme Court said that there is a separate legal and sentencing regime for young people because they have heightened vulnerability, less maturity, and a reduced capacity for moral judgment, which together entitles them to a presumption of diminished moral blameworthiness or culpability.As a result, the Crown and not the young person has the burden of showing that the presumption of diminished moral culpability has been rebutted and the young person is no longer entitled to its protection.[9]He then carefully considered the factors in s. 72 of the YCJA to determine whether the presumption had been rebutted.He concluded that it had and explained why a youth sentence would not be of sufficient length to hold the appellant accountable for his actions.At p. 17 of the reasons he stated:The seriousness of this offence along with the circumstances surrounding it are of concern including, in particular, [the appellant’s] involvement in the murder, his involvement in the desecration of [the victim’s] remains, and most tellingly, in the detached and indifferent manner in which he continued with his life thereafter.[10]Further, he noted, unlike a youth sentence, an adult sentence would come with lifetime supervision following parole, which would ensure that the appellant’s treatment needs “receive long term management well beyond his time in custody” (p. 17).THE FRESH EVIDENCE[11]The appellant introduced fresh evidence on the appeal in the form of institutional records.The fresh evidence shows that the appellant has continued to make progress in his rehabilitation while serving his sentence, including the completion of a number of correspondence courses.It also includes an updated risk assessment by Dr. Evans which confirms that, as at the time of sentencing, the appellant poses a low to moderate risk of violence in the future.The fresh evidence also shows that since the appellant has been moved from a youth facility to an adult provisional facility, he has not received treatment for his mental health issues.It further indicates that the appellant, who was born in Germany and lived there until he was a young teenager, may wish to ultimately return to Germany.[12]The Crown filed responding fresh evidence which indicates that the appellant is currently housed in a prison wing in which he is not completely segregated from other inmates.The evidence also shows that the appellant has repeatedly requested to remain housed in his current area.But for those requests, there is no impediment to his being housed within the general inmate population.Furthermore, the appellant’s requests to remain in his current area have impacted on his ability to access programming available to inmates within the regular prison population.THE ISSUES[13]The appellant raises two grounds of appeal.He submits that the trial judge:1.mischaracterized the implied factual findings in the jury’s verdict; and2.erred in imposing an adult sentence.ANALYSISDid the trial judge mischaracterize the implied factual findings in the jury verdict?[14]The trial judge held that the implied factual finding from the jury’s verdict for second degree murder was that the appellant had stabbed the victim.The appellant contends that this was speculative reasoning on the part of the trial judge as it was not a necessary implication of the jury’s verdict.He points to the fact that the jury had been told that there were two possible routes to conviction in this case – that the appellant had stabbed the victim or that he was a party to the assault that led to her death.[15]On the facts of this case, we do not accept this submission.The judge was fully alive to his responsibilities in terms of fact finding.At p. 12 of his reasons, he correctly recites the legal principles governing the fact-finding duties of a trial judge embarking upon a sentencing hearing following a jury’s verdict.He noted that because he did not have the benefit of expressed findings of fact, he had to determine the facts that reasonably flowed from the jury findings.He refers to R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96, stating that he was bound by the expressed and implied factual implications of the jury’s verdict and where the factual implications are ambiguous, he had to make his own independent determination of the relevant facts.[16]In light of the jury instruction in this case, a finding of guilt required the jury to conclude that the appellant had participated in the assault on the victim from which her death ensued, and that his participation was of such a degree that it was a “substantial and integral cause of the death”.The jury was also instructed that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant and Lavallee had acted in concert, they did not have to determine who, as between the two, struck the fatal blow[17]In the agreed statement of facts filed on this appeal, there is an admission by Lavallee, to a fellow musician, that he and the appellant had killed the victim.According to Lavallee, he had started to choke her and the appellant then reached over and stabbed her once.Dr. Fairgrieve gave evidence that ribs six and seven on the right side of the victim’s body had an indentation and sharp force trauma caused by a metal implement.The insert and orientation of the wound was such that it was from the front of the body to the back.He also identified that thoracic vertebra number four exhibited sharp force trauma caused by a bladed instrument.[18]As a practical matter, in light of the evidence, the only way in which the jury could have found that the appellant participated in the assault to such a degree that it was a substantial and integral cause of the death is if he inflicted at least one stab wound on the victim.Did the trial judge err in imposing an adult sentence?[19]The appellant argues that despite the seriousness of the offence, an adult sentence was not necessary to achieve the objectives of the YCJA.He contends that his progress by the time of sentencing – as well as his progress since then – demonstrates his motivation to change and his capacity for rehabilitation.He maintains that imposition of the maximum youth sentence, in addition to pre-trial custody of over two years, was sufficient to hold the appellant accountable.[20]We see no basis on which to interfere with the trial judge’s imposition of an adult sentence.[21]The trial judge’s reasons show a full and balanced assessment of all of the factors set out in s. 72(1) of the YCJA.He identified and considered the practical consequences of imposing an adult sentence, rather than a youth sentence.Further, he acknowledged the remarkable progress that the appellant had made since the offences and the remorse that he had demonstrated.In assessing the appellant’s moral culpability, the trial judge expressly took into consideration Dr. Evans’ evidence regarding the appellant’s history of substance abuse and his diagnosed mood order.The trial judge addressed the evidence regarding the appellant’s mental condition and identified treatment needs.In this regard, it is to be noted that the trial judge ordered that the appellant be placed in a youth facility until his 21st birthday and then be transferred to an adult provincial facility until the completion of his sentence.[22]However, as explained above, the trial judge ultimately concluded that a youth sentence would not be of sufficient length to hold the appellant accountable for his actions.[23]The fresh evidence, in the main, is confirmative of the evidence before the trial judge.It does not alter the balancing which the trial judge undertook in determining that an adult sentence was necessary.As for the fresh evidence indicating that the appellant may wish to ultimately return to Germany, we accept the Crown’s submission that pursuant to the International Transfer of Offenders Act, S.C. 2004, c. 21 and the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, 21 March 1983, Can. T.S. 1985 No. 9 (entered into force 13 May 1985), a mechanism exists for the appellant to seek to have Canada and Germany agree to transfer him to Germany to serve the remainder of his sentence.DISPOSITION[24]Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.Released: July 21, 2014 (“A.H.”)“Alexandra Hoy A.C.J.O.”“E.E.

(orally)Paul Croteauappeals a sentence imposed on him by the Provincial Court on June 28, 2000.He was charged with one count of stealing property of Canadian Tire Corp. of a value exceeding $5,000.00 contrary to s. 334(a) of the Criminal Code and one count of breaking and entering a restaurant and committing the indictable offence of theft contrary to s. 348(1)(b).The learned Provincial Court judge imposed a total sentence of three months, two years probation and $1,383.18 restitution.Mr. Croteau appeals on the basis that a sentence of imprisonment to be served in the community should have been imposed because such a sentence, in this case, would meet the deterrence and denunciatory requirements of sentencing.We agree with this submission.While the offences were serious, we believe that a nine month sentence of imprisonment to be served in the community, coupled with a probation order and restitution order, would impose a sufficient burden on this accused and is more in keeping with the principle of restraint articulated in R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61and the companion cases released at the same time as Proulx.A conditional sentence will address both the punitive and rehabilitative objectives necessary in this case.Mr. Croteau presents as a low risk according to the Offender Risk Management Assessment Tool.Violence or the actual or threatened use of a weapon formed no part of this offence.Mr. Croteauhas no previous record, and is only 19 years of age.He has been successfully maintaining himself away from home so as to permit the taking of technical classes since the age of fourteen.He has his parents' full support.His plan of rehabilitation, which includes further schooling and employment, makes it unlikely that he will re-offend.But for the seriousness of the offences which show some planning, deliberation and premeditation, the actions in this case may very well have called for a suspended sentence.However, the lengthy term of the conditional sentence order is, in our view, proportionate to the degree of the offender's culpability.The appeal is allowed.The sentence is set aside and a sentence of nine months to be served in the community with the usual conditions is imposed.Mr. Croteau is also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $1,383.18.The two year probation order will remain in place so as to permit Mr. Croteau this amount of time to pay restitution."}

VealeAppearances:Eric MarcouxCounsel for the CrownDonald Stephen TutinAppearing on his own behalfREASONS FOR JUDGMENT[1]VEALE J. (Oral):Just for the record in this matter, Mr. Tutin was a doorman at a local bar and he had a serious altercation with a fellow named Calvin Lindstrom.They know each other well, as I understand it.Mr. Tutin lost control, essentially, and struck Mr. Lindstrom, punched him twice with his fist, and flipped him over and dropped him on his head, causing Mr. Lindstrom to become unconscious and suffering from a concussion.Mr. Lindstrom also required seven stitches to close a laceration about an inch and a half long on his scalp.Apparently, these events were captured on a surveillance video.[2]At sentencing, to be fair, Mr. Tutin entered a guilty plea, which has to be taken into consideration in these matters, and his counsel recommended to the Court, or submitted to the Court, that there should be a 12‑month conditional sentence to be served in the community in his home.[3]The Crown was seeking either a jail term for that amount or a conditional sentence of 16 months, as I understand it.[4]The trial judge apparently takes the position, rather frequently, that if he is unable to send an Aboriginal person to jail or feels that he is unable to, then he will not order a conditional sentence but prefers to use the method of a suspended sentence with a probation order.[5]The Crown appealed that sentence, rightly so I think, based on the precedents in this jurisdiction and specifically in R. v. Johnson, 2011 YKTC 70 (CanLII), a decision of Justice Gower sitting as a Territorial Court Judge.[6]However, the Crown also feels that it would be appropriate in this circumstance, where Mr. Tutin has already served four months of the probation under the suspended sentence, to essentially agree to a 12‑month conditional sentence, giving him credit for the four months that he has spent in his suspended sentence on the terms and conditions that were just read out and to which I am satisfied that Mr. Tutin fully understands and agrees to.[7]I am going to make an order that the appeal -- I guess I am going to make it as though we went through the appeal in the sense that it will be a decision on the appeal that there be a conditional sentence of 12 months with a four-month credit for the time that Mr. Tutin has already served under a suspended sentence.The conditional sentence will be on the terms that have been read out by the Crown and will be typed up and read out to Mr. Tutin for a signature.I am satisfied that he understands those conditions.The first four months will be under house arrest, which means he does not leave his premises unless he meets the conditions set out in the conditional sentence; and the second four months will be done under a curfew from 10 P.M. to 6 A.M.[8]I am satisfied that that is an appropriate sentence in the circumstance.[9]Mr. Tutin, I hope, in all of this, you have learned a good life lesson and will curb your temper in those situations and probably avoid being a doorman and dealing with people you know, although I appreciate that is a difficult thing to do in this town because you end up knowing everybody at one time or another.[10]Thank you for agreeing to it.The Clerk will draw it up for you and you have to sign it before you leave.I wish you good luck.[11]Thank you, Mr. Marcoux.[12]MR. MARCOUX:Thank you, Your Honour.Could you, on the record, make the DNA order and the victim surcharges?[13]THE COURT:Yes, there will also be a DNA order and a victim surcharge of $100.[14]Time to pay?[DISCUSSION OFF RECORD][15]THE COURT:We will give you time to pay to September 30.[16]Thank you very much._____________________________VEALE J."}

The Crown, for reasons not disclosed to the court, accepted a plea to careless storage of a firearm, which was the least serious charge that Mr. Caranci faced, and effectively abandoned the other two more serious charges.[2]The background facts in this matter are set out in my decisions at 2012 ONSC 734 (CanLII), and 2012 ONSC 3470 (CanLII).After those decisions dismissing the motions by Mr. Caranci for relief, he re-elected the mode of trial and pleaded guilty to careless storage of a firearm.[3]The facts read in by the Crown and accepted by the defence are the following:On November 7, 2009 members of the YRP Drugs and Vice unit executed a search warrant on the residence of Mr. Caranci located at 7 Queensbury Cres., Vaughan.A search warrant was also executed on the place of business owned and operated by Mr. Caranci, namely the Spa at Tiffany’s located at 435 Bowes Road, Vaughan.The warrants were the result of an investigation into Caranci’s suspected operation of a bawdy house at the Tiffany’s Spa.During surveillance conducted in the weeks prior to November 7th, officers observed Caranci transfer items from the Spa to his vehicle, a Bentley, and drive to his residence.This occurred on two occasions. On both occasions Caranci entered the garage in his vehicle, and the garage door closed behind him.On November 5th officers from the surveillance unit observed Mr. Caranci drive a Bentley, with license plate BHFP 683, from the area of his residence to the Spa and he entered the business on foot.After some time Mr. Caranci exited the Spa and drove the vehicle back to his residence.Mr. Caranci parked the vehicle in the garage of the residence.When officers executed the warrant at the residence on November 7th, they searched the Bentley, license plate BHFP 683, which was parked in the garage.Det. Troung located a .380 calibre hand gun, loaded with 5 rounds of ammunition, in the driver’s side door panel.The firearm was tested and analysed by a firearms expert from YRP and determined to be a prohibited firearm.[4]There are additional facts canvassed by counsel. The story was that the gun was left in the car by a friend. Mr. Caranci knew the gun was in the car because his friend called him and told him. The Crown was not able to prove that Mr. Caranci owned the gun, but noted that it was still possession, albeit fleeting, since he knew the gun was there Even so, the Crown chose not to proceed on the possession charges.The Positions of the Parties[5]Under section 86 of the Code, the maximum sentence for a first conviction of careless storage of a firearm is imprisonment for “a term not exceeding two years.”The Crown is seeking a custodial sentence of 8 months.[6]The defence submits that the Crown’s proposed sentence would be disproportionate and that, taking all of the relevant factors into account under section 718 of the Criminal Code and the cases, a suspended sentence accompanied by probation for two years and 200 hours of community service would be most appropriate.In the alternative, the defence suggests that a conditional sentence between 9 and 12 months would be appropriate.In the further alternative, if the court considers that some jail time should be imposed on Mr. Caranci, then the sentence should be 90 days or less.The defence consents to the Crown’s ancillary requests under section 110 of the Criminal Code for a weapons prohibition for 10 years, and under section 491 of the Criminal Code for a forfeiture of the recovered firearm.Analysis[7]In this section I consider: first, the sentencing principles as they apply to the offence; second, the cases; and third, the prospect of a conditional sentence.The Relevant Sentencing Principles[8]Section 718 of the Criminal Code sets out, among others, the following objectives of sentencing:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;…(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;… and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.[9]Section 718.1 provides that: “A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.”Section 718.2 obliges a court to consider whether “a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant, aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender.” It also provides that:“a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.” The Crown’s Cases[10]The Crown relies on the decision of R.A. Clark J. in R. v. Dass, [2008] O.J. No. 1161, at paras. 29-31 to emphasize the seriousness of weapons offences in the Greater Toronto Area:29Turning to the firearms offences, they, too, are considered quite rightly to be very serious.30In R v. Jarsch, 2007 BCCA 189 (CanLII), [2007] B.C.J. No. 738, (B.C.C.A.), Smith J.A. stated at para. 5 ff.:\"Before sentencing the appellant, the trial judge observed that the minimum sentence for possessing a loaded prohibited firearm is one year and the maximum is 10 years, and that the maximum sentence for occupying a motor vehicle with an unauthorized firearm is also 10 years. She noted that before amendments to the Criminal Code in 1998, there was no minimum sentence for the first offence I have just mentioned and the maximum for the second was five years. Thus, she stated, Parliament intended by its amendments that these offences be treated more seriously than they had been previously.Further, she observed that the paramount sentencing objectives for these offences are public safety, general and specific deterrence, and denunciation, and that rehabilitation, while important, is a secondary concern. She noted as well that the essence of these offences is the potential for violence and physical harm and that the degree of readiness of the offender for violent action can be an aggravating factor.\"31Likewise, in R v. Danvers, 2005 CanLII 30044 (ON CA), [2005] O.J. No. 3532, (C.A.), Armstrong J.A., at paras. 77 ff. stated:\"In conclusion, I fully endorse the following comments made by the trial judge in sentencing the appellant:Death by firearms in public places in Toronto plague this city and must be deterred, denounced and stopped. Only the imposition of exemplary sentences will serve to deter criminals from arming themselves with handguns. In particular, the use of handguns in public places cries out for lengthy increased periods of parole ineligibility. Society must be protected from criminals armed with deadly handguns.'There is no question that our courts have to address the principles of denunciation and deterrence for gun related crimes in the strongest possible terms. The possession and use of illegal handguns in the Greater Toronto Area is a cause for major concern in the community and must be addressed.\"[11]In R. v. Fletcher, [2008] O.J. No. 697 (Spies J.) the accused was convicted of a number of weapons charges, including possession of a loaded restricted firearm, a loaded prohibited firearm, possession of two firearms knowing that they were obtained by the commission of an offence in Canada, and two counts of careless storage.At para. 39, Spies J. said:39I turn then to what is an appropriate sentence in this case. Clearly denunciation and deterrence, both general and specific, given these are firearms convictions, are paramount considerations in this case. Firearms, particularly loaded firearms that are immediately ready to be fired, can have only one purpose and that is to commit criminal acts and take the life of someone or at least cause one or more persons very serious injury. Unfortunately it has become an all too regular occurrence in these courts for judges to express society's abhorrence of guns in our community and many judges in dealing with the sentencing of those convicted of firearms offences have commented on the serious public safety issues associated with the possession of firearms, particularly in the City of Toronto.[12]Spies J. imposed a sentence of imprisonment for a term of two years in relation to the counts for careless storage to run concurrently with a number of five year sentences relating to possession.[13]In R. v. Ford, [2010] B.C.J. No. 842 (B.C.C.A.), the Court imposed an eight month sentence for unsafe storage of a firearm concurrent with a number of drug offences.[14]The Crown also relies on R. v. P.M., 2012 ONCA 162 (CanLII), [2012] O.J. No. 1148.The court imposed a six-month concurrent sentence for weapons offences which dealt with three long guns that were not stored safely or registered and a box of ammunition. This was, however, a Crown appeal from a global sentence of six years’ imprisonment imposed on guilty pleas to sexual assault, incest, sexual interference, making child pornography, possessing child pornography, and careless storage of a firearm.The Defence Cases[15]The defence relies heavily on the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Stevens (2011), 2011 ONCA 504 (CanLII), 106 O.R. (3d) 241, [2011] O.J. No. 3164, where Armstrong J.A. said at para. 62:Counsel for the Crown appropriately argues that \"[g]enerally speaking, firearms related offences are serious\". While this court has often clearly stated that gun crime is very serious, it is usually in reference to gun violence. Gun safety is clearly very important, but the offences of careless storage of firearms and ammunition are far less serious than violent crimes involving guns. The less serious character of these offences is reflected in the appellant's sentence, which was a suspended sentence and twelve months probation.[16]The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, set aside the conviction, and entered verdicts of not guilty because of the presence of illegally obtained evidence; these words of Armstrong J.A., while obiter, signal the importance of distinguishing between lesser and more serious gun-related offences.[17]Mr. Robbins for the defence referred to a number of cases involving discharges but advised Mr. Caranci was not seeking. He also referred to a number of cases in which relatively modest fines were imposed, but did not suggest that a fine would be appropriate.[18]Mr. Robbins spent some time on cases involving suspended sentences. In my view, the seriousness of this offence does not merit a suspended sentence.Such a sentence would not accomplish any of the relevant sentencing goals; it would not amount to a denunciation of a gun crime, and it would not serve to deter this offender or other possible offenders from committing offences.In my view, even considering the bail conditions that Mr. Caranci had to work through, the overall sentence would not assist in rehabilitating him or promoting a sense of responsibility in him.A suspended sentence would not be proportionate to the gravity of the offence.[19]Finally, Mr. Robbins went over a number of cases in which conditional sentences were imposed.The Prospect of a Conditional Sentence[20]Section 742.1 of the Code permits a court to order that an offender serve a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years in the community, subject to strict conditions, which is known as a conditional sentence, where certain statutory prerequisites are met.Those, as identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at paragraph 46 are:(1)The offender must be convicted of an offence that is not punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment;(2)The court must impose a term of imprisonment of less than two years;(3)The safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender serving the sentence in the community; and(4)A conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.[21]Mr. Caranci does not have a criminal record. Although I would not describe him as youthful, his rehabilitation prospects are reasonable. Accordingly, I am particularly mindful of the words of Rosenberg J.A. in R. v. Priest (1996), 1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA), 30 O.R. (3d) 538, 110 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 295, para 20 (C.A.), that “[t]he duty to explore other dispositions for a first offender before imposing a custodial sentence is not an empty formalism which can be avoided merely by invoking the objective of general deterrence.” See also R. v. Stein (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 376, [1974] O.J. No. 93 at 377, para 4 (C.A.).In Priest, the court held that the primary objectives of sentencing a first offender are individual deterrence and rehabilitation and are best achieved by either a suspended sentence and probation or a very short term of imprisonment.I also am mindful of the provisions of sections 718.2(d) and (e) to the effect that an offender should not be deprived of his liberty where a less restrictive sanction may be appropriate and that all other available sanctions other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances, should be considered.[22]Before imposing a conditional sentence, a judge must determine that there is no minimum term of imprisonment for the offence of which the offender has been found guilty, and must reject both a probationary sentence and a custodial term as inappropriate:see Proulx, at paragraph 77.Further, the judge must be satisfied that having the offender serve the sentence in the community would not endanger its safety:see Proulx, at paragraph 69.If the judge finds that there is a real risk of re-offence, incarceration should be imposed.The Conditional Sentence Cases[23]Mr. Robbins cited R. v. Anderson, [2009] O.J. No. 5828 (O.C.J.). The conditional sentence in that case was for twenty-two months followed by three years of probation.Maisonneuve J. found the aggravating factors to be the type of drugs that were found, the quantity of drugs, the weapon, the bullets, and the combination of both the weapons and the drugs.The Court imposed an eighteen month sentence to be served in the community.[24]In R. v. Bogdan, [2007] M.J. No. 156 (P.C.J.), the Court held at para. 20:20The second criterion is that the court must be satisfied that serving this sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community. Despite the circumstances of the offences in this case involving weapons and ammunition, and the offender's re-involvement while on judicial interim release, I am nonetheless satisfied that allowing him to serve his sentence of imprisonment in the community would not compromise its safety. I come to this conclusion for three reasons. First, while acknowledging the inherent dangers of the weapons and ammunition in this case, it is important that none of the weapons were brandished, discharged, or used in any intimidating fashion. Second, the offender has no prior criminal record. Finally, he has complied with very strict terms of judicial interim release for a period in excess of one year.In relation to careless storage, possession of a prohibited weapon, breach of recognizance, among a number of offences, the Court imposed a global twelve month sentence of imprisonment to be served in the community.[25]In R. v. Canepa, 2011 ONSC 1406 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 924 (S.C.J.), the Court found at para. 10 that aggravating circumstances included the fact that the gun was loaded and that it was found in conjunction with a small quantity of drugs.Nordheimer J. said at paras. 17-18:17I have concluded on balance that a conditional sentence is appropriate in this case. Andrew is a young man who made a mistake, admittedly a serious mistake. However, there is no evidence that he poses any danger to the community that would preclude him from being a candidate to serve his sentence in the community. I also consider that a conditional sentence can achieve the objectives of denunciation and deterrence and at the same time provide an opportunity for the rehabilitation of Andrew as well as promoting in him a proper sense of the responsibility that he has to our community, particularly in respect of his future conduct. Incarcerating Andrew would not advance these other important sentencing objectives.18In reaching my conclusion I have also taken into account that Andrew was on strict terms of his release pending trial. He has thus demonstrated his willingness and ability to comply with court imposed restrictions on his conduct. I have also taken into account the impact of those strict terms of release in determining the length of the conditional sentence that I consider to be appropriate.[26]In R. v. Kerr, 2001 CanLII 21142 (ON CA), [2001] O. J. No. 5085 (C.A.), the Court converted an eighteen month custodial sentence into eighteen months conditional.The conviction was for three counts of trafficking in heroin and one count of improperly storing a firearm.The appellant was approximately 27 years old at the time of the sentencing.[27]Finally, in R. v. Waller, [2005] O. J. No. 3610 (O.C.J.), the Court imposed a two year conditional sentence for careless use of a firearm.The gun was used by the spouse of the convicted person to commit suicide.Applying the Sentencing Principles to this Case[28]As noted above, Mr. Caranci was charged with careless storage of a firearm, contrary to section 86(3) of the Criminal Code; possession of a firearm while not being the holder of a licence permitting such possession, contrary to section 91(2) of the Code; and possession of a loaded firearm, contrary to section 95(2) of the Code.[29]Superior Court judges are fully alive to the seriousness of firearms charges, particularly in the Greater Toronto Area, which includes this Region. That said, the Crown, for reasons not disclosed to the court, accepted a plea to careless storage of a firearm, the least serious charge that Mr. Caranci faced, and effectively abandoned the other two more serious charges. I make two observations. First, the Crown’s sentencing theory seems to be that the Court can sentence Mr. Caranci as though he had been convicted of the possession charges even though the Crown specifically gave up on those charges and accepted a guilty plea to a lesser offence. In my view to do so would be contrary to the Court of Appeal’s decision in R. v. Stevens, since careless storage offences are less serious.[30]Second, it is important to be careful in utilizing cases such as those tendered by the Crown in which the firearms conviction was coupled with other often more serious offences. I am reluctantto winkle out the specific sentences related to the gun charges and to assume that they would have been imposed even if there had not been convictions on the more serious charges. These cases are not comparable to this case.The Crown has not pointed to a comparable case in which the Court imposed an eight month custodial sentence; in keeping with section 718.2 of the Code, I must advert to comparable cases.[31]The defence submits that the cases support a conditional sentence. To repeat, before imposing a conditional sentence, a judge must determine that certain prerequisites have been met, as identified by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Proulx.[32]I am satisfied that the prerequisites are met in this case: Mr. Caranci has been convicted of an offence that is not punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment; the court must impose a term of imprisonment of less than two years; and, in my view the safety of the community would not be endangered by Mr. Caranci serving the sentence in the community. I am also satisfied that a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing.[33]Mr. Caranci’s personal circumstances are relevant.He was born on November 19, 1973, and was 36 at the time of the offence.He is now 39 years of age.He has been married for five years and his wife is now pregnant with their first child.He has significant family support as was evident before me.Mr. Caranci operates a landscaping and snow removal business and also does construction contracting.He has twelve full-time employees.He picks up other employees as certain circumstances require.Mr. Robbins filed a number of reference letters from business associates of Mr. Caranci from what appear to be substantial enterprises.[34]The mitigating factors in this case are that Mr. Caranci has pleaded guilty and has thereby accepted responsibility for his conduct.He made a personal statement expressing his remorse that I find to be sincere.Mr. Caranci has no prior criminal record. He is gainfully employed.Mr. Caranci complied with the bail conditions without incident.[35]An aggravating factor in this case is that the gun was loaded and ready to fire.On the other hand, the gun was in a locked car and in a locked garage that had a security system in place, and was relatively secure.[36]The court emphasized in Proulx, that sentencing is an individualized process.There is no such thing as a uniform sentence for a particular crime.In determining a fit sentence, a judge must consider the specific circumstances of the particular offender and his or her offence or offences.[37]There is no presumption against conditional sentences for certain types of offences:see Proulx, at paragraph 81.Although there may be circumstances in which the need for denunciation or deterrence is so pressing that incarceration is warranted, a conditional sentence can provide significant denunciation and deterrence, particularly if sufficiently punitive conditions are imposed. A conditional sentence has both punitive and rehabilitative objectives.[38]Mr. Caranci spent five days in custody.He experienced the negative effects of the charge, including lost contracts, some financial difficulties, and stresses within his marriage. I am obliged to take into account, in some way, the time that the accused spent on bail under house arrest:R. v. Downes, 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA), [2006] O.J. No. 555, at para. 41. The bail conditions were relatively strict at the beginning in November 2009 amounting to house arrest, which affected the applicant’s ability to earn an income.These conditions were varied after two months on January 8, 2010, to allow him to work.The work hours were varied on May 14, 2010, to allow him to work from 6:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. This confinement went on for about 16 months. The house arrest conditions were finally deleted on March 30, 2011.I have considered the impact of the brief incarceration and the bail conditions on Mr. Caranci in fixing the sentence I impose today.Mr. Caranci will you please stand up?[39]On the charge of careless storage of a firearm, I sentence you to nine months to be served in the community on the following conditions:(i)You are to keep the peace and to be of good behaviour;(ii)You are to appear before the court as and when required;(iii)You are to report to a supervisor within two working days of today and thereafter when required by and in the manner directed by the supervisor;(iv)You are to remain in the Province of Ontario unless written permission to leave the province is obtained from your supervisor or approval is given by the Court;(v)You are to notify your supervisor or the Court in advance of any change of name or address and promptly notify your supervisor or the Court of any change of employment or occupation;(vi)You are to reside at your family home or at an address approved by your supervisor, and for the first six months of your sentence you are to observe a curfew to be in your residence at all times except for the following purposes: attending work and travelling directly to and from job sites relating to employment with your construction and landscaping companies between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 9:30 p.m.; attending at a hospital, doctor’s or dental office, and travelling to and from same; andattending religious services in daylight hours and travelling directly to and from same; and attending to legal obligations related to this conditional sentence order.(vii)You are to perform 200 hours of community service work as specified by your supervisor at a rate not less than 15 hours per month to be completed to the supervisor’s satisfaction within 9 months.(viii)You are to abstain absolutely from the possession and/or consumption of any drugs or other substances prohibited by law;(ix)You are not to possess any weapons as defined in the Criminal Code;(x)You are not to apply for nor possess a Firearms Acquisition Certificate or any other form gun licence.[40]In the interest of public safety I issue an order under section 110 of the Criminal Code prohibiting you from possessing weapons for a period of ten years.I also order forfeiture of the firearm and the ammunition seized to the Attorney General of Ontario for disposition as directed by him.[41]Mr. Caranci, you should understand that if you breach any of the terms of your conditional sentence, you will be brought back before the Court, with the very good likelihood that you will be required to spend some or all of the balance of your sentence in custody._____________________________P.D.

Clunas (1992), 1992 CanLII 127 (SCC), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 115 (SCC).Having regard for the reasons for judgment in that case, and the circumstances of the present case, we are all of the view the convictions must stand.To begin with, the accused was represented by experienced and able trial counsel, who in effect consented to the impugned procedure. While counsel did not expressly consent, he is to be taken as having implicitly done so, judging from the record as a whole.Not only that, no prejudice befell the accused as a result of the procedure that was employed.[3]The second issue is whether the two convictions for possession for the purpose of trafficking are unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence.This issue is governed in principle by R. v. Yebes, 1987 CanLII 17 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168 and R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381.In light of the evidence as a whole, we are unable to say that a jury, properly instructed and acting judicially, could not reasonably have arrived at the two guilty verdicts.The trial judge, we might add, addressed the case with care and made careful findings of fact as demonstrated by his having acquitted the accused on some counts and convicted him on others.[4]That brings us to the third issue: whether the conviction for participating in the activities of a criminal organization for the purpose alleged in the information is unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence. Again, this is largely driven in principle by R. v. Yebes and R. v. Biniaris.The trial judge came to his conclusion on the basis of inference drawn from the whole of the evidence and his findings of primary fact.In our judgment, there was sufficient in this to support the inference and hence the conviction.[5]Accordingly, we have decided to dismiss the appeal against conviction.[6]That leaves the sentences, the first of which fall to be reviewed on the standards set forth in such cases as R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500.In all of the circumstances, including the personal circumstances of the appellant, a sentence of two years on each count, to be served concurrently, is not demonstrably unfit on our view the matter.Nor does the fact the appellant served considerable time on remand, having been charged with these and other offences, serve to alter our view. The appellant has a substantial criminal record, one that suggests specific deterrence was among the primary objectives of the sentence.So was denunciation, given the nature of the offences and the conduct of the appellant.[7]As for the consecutive sentence of three years imposed in relation to theappellant’s participation in a criminal organization, we are again of the view this is not a demonstrably unfit sentence.It had to be made consecutive, and a three year term is within the range, given the circumstances and the nature of the offence.Nor do we see any error in the trial judge having decided to direct that the appellant not be eligible for parole before serving half the sentence. We are of the view this was justifiable on the basis of R. v. Zinck, 2003 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2003] 1 S.C.R. 41.[8]The appellant’s lengthy record and long-standing criminal lifestyle are increasingly catching up to him.In part, that is what these sentences reflect, aimed as they primarily are at specific deterrence and denunciation.His present offences are serious ones, and they are tied to a serious problem in some parts of Regina: trafficking in drugs by individuals and organizations bent on profiting from the weaknesses of others, and wilfully blind to the destructive social consequences.[9]On the whole, then, the appeal is dismissed."}

The attack took place in the victim's home at a time when her two children were asleep. The sexual assault was followed by unnecessary violence. The appellant inflicted a cut to the victim's throat with a knife and he stabbed her in the chest.[2] We admitted fresh evidence which disclosed that the appellant had little remorse for the offence. The appellant who was nineteen years of age at the time of the offence is an aboriginal Canadian. He argues that the trial judge erred in failing to give due consideration to s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code. We disagree. The trial judge specifically considered the section and noted that in R. v. Gladue (1999), 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.) at para. 79, the Supreme Court pointed out:Generally the more violent and serious the offence, the more likely it is as a practical reality that the terms of imprisonment for aboriginals and non-aboriginals would be close to each other or the same, even taking into account the different concepts of sentencing.[3] There is nothing in this record that would lead us to impose a sentence for this serious offence that is less than what is a fit sentence for a non-aboriginal offender. In our view, the sentence of 9 years (in addition to 11 months pre-trial custody) was entirely fit. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.\"Dennis O'Connor A.C.J.O.\" \"M.A. Catzman J.A.\" \"M.J.

Nov. 10, 1978) pled guilty on August 31, 1994 to four counts of auto theft (s. 334(a) of the Code), one charge of possession over(s. 355(a) of the Code)and one count of escape lawful custody (s. 145(a) of the Code).One auto offence occurred on June 1, two occurred on June 2, and the fourth on June 3.A fifth offence occurred on August 14, 1994 while he was unlawfully at large.[S.B.]'s record began on March 19, 1992 with a s. 430(4) mischief charge which was dismissed into the diversion program.His next offence resulted in a guilty plea on April 28, 1992 to a s. 334(b) theft charge for which he received eight months probation.On May 7, 1992 he pled guilty to a s. 266 assault and received 15 months probation.Then on May 17, 1993, he pled guilty to a s. 355(b) possession of stolen goods charge and a s. 26 YOA breach receiving in total eighteen months probation.On March 4, 1994, [S.B.] pled guilty to one count of auto theft (s. 344(a) of the Code), five infractions of s. 26 of the YOA and three counts of failing to comply (s. 145(3) of the Code) for which he received nine months open custody.On May 1, he escaped from the Kenosee Youth camp where he had been placed for his nine months open custody disposition and committed the first four auto thefts mentioned above.He was apprehended June 4, 1994.For that escape, he received eight weeks' secure custody ending July 28, 1994.He was again transferred to open custody to continue serving his nine months disposition.He escaped again on July 30 resulting in the s. 145(a) offence presently before the Court and committed the fifth auto offence.What all this means is that [S.B.] committed all the offences which are presently before this Court while he was unlawfully at large and should have been serving a disposition that had already been imposed.It also means that when [S.B.] was in Youth Court on August 31, 1994 for the five auto thefts and the breach of undertaking, it was his seventh time before the youth court to receive a disposition.With respect to the auto offences before the Court, [S.B.] and others gained entry to the cars by breaking a window and gained access to the ignition by smashing the steering column.In one case, they slashed seats. In other cases, the cars' contents were stolen.Three of the cars were involved in accidents.Damages varied in amounts from $2,000 where a window and the steering column were damaged to $4,300 for one car that was involved in an accident.As to his home life, [S.B.]'s parents have been separated for some time.He is the second of three children.The eldest son has also been involved in the YOA system.[S.B.]'s problems began in the summer of 1992.He had trouble at school.He was described as disruptive and confrontational.He has not been in school since May, 1993.The predisposition report said \"[S.B.] has been unable to follow through with the conditions or expectations of custody facilities or court orders\".It was his worker's opinion that [S.B.] should serve a moderate period of secure custody over and above what was currently remaining from his open custody disposition.At the sentencing hearing, [S.B.]'s attitude in relation to these offences was that he was \"technically guilty\" because he was present when some or all of the cars were stolen and he drove them.([S.B.]'s counsel said he had not smashed windows or broken steering columns but had been the driver.)[S.B.] still does not understand how his presence with the other youths supported what they were doing and shows little remorse.On August 31, 1994, [S.B.] was sentenced for the offences that are before this Court to six months secure custody consecutive to the nine months open custody.By the terms of the YOA, the secure custody will be served before he serves the balance of his open custody disposition.At the hearing of the appeal we asked for an update on all the youths concerned in this case.We have now received that update.[S.B.]'s report is not good. He is working at only a grade six level and lacks motivation and concentration.It is said he shows little commitment to working on problem areas.2. [C.J.][C.J.] (b.d. April 20, 1977) pled guilty on May 30, 1994 to seven counts of auto theft, three counts of possession of autos knowing they were stolen and one count of breaching an undertaking.The offences were committed over two periods.The first series of offences was committed on four nights in late November and December. (On one night two cars were stolen.)He was arrested in February and released on his own undertaking when he committed the two remaining offences.An aggravating feature of all the offences was the malicious damage done to the vehicles including slashing seats and driving one car into a wire fence.Damages of this type totaled $31,500.00.When the offences were committed, [C.J.] was living at home and in grade nine.His parents knew he was having difficulty adjusting to high school, but knew nothing of the trouble their son was in until apprehended the first time.He had no criminal record.The predisposition report did not recommend custody, but recommendedprobation on terms.After spending three days on remand, [C.J.] was sentenced to 18 months probation and 100 hours community service work.Since being sentenced on May 30, 1994, there appears to have been an almost complete conversion.When he is not at school, another family member is with [C.J.] providing schooling instruction and recreational activities.His parents report [C.J.] is ashamed of his behaviour and genuinely remorseful.He completed his community service in record time.He has continued to have some difficulty with school but has perfect attendance and is improving reading and writing skills with which he struggles.His youth worker advised the Court that [C.J.]' parents \"offer their son a high level of support.... and have dealt with [C.J.]' behaviour in an appropriate and consistent manner\".With commendable candour, [C.J.]'s counsel advised the Court that [C.J.] was suspended from school for being involved in a pushing match but was immediately readmitted.His youth worker did not treat this incident as significant.3. [T.D.][T.D.] (b.d July 19, 1979) pled guilty to 17 auto thefts, two attempted auto thefts and one failure to comply with the terms of an undertaking.Prior to these offences, he had no record.The timing of the offences went like this.[T.D.] was enroled in Grade 8 for the 1993-94 school year.He was disruptive in school, but not abusive and attended regularly.He lived with his mother and stepfather. (His natural father passed away when he was seven years old.) He was having trouble at home stemming from anger felt towards his stepfather and was often away, contrary to his parents' wishes, nights and weekends.He committed the first auto theft on January 2, 1994. The second was committed on April 5.On April 6 he and three other youths attempted to steal one vehicle and were successful in stealing four others, one after the other. The group was ultimately apprehended when the police found them asleep in the fourth stolen vehicle.[T.D.] was granted judicial interim release and then proceeded to steal or attempt to steal cars during the nights of April 30, May 1 (two cars), May 2, May 13, May 14 (two cars), May 15 (two cars), May 18, May 21, and May 22.[T.D.] was the sole person charged with the offences committed on the nights of April 5, May 13, 14, 18 and 22.The other offences involved one, two or three other young offenders with J.M. being the constant.The damages to the 17 vehicles was approximately $30,000 in total.Articles missing from the various vehicles were valued at $5,000. When [T.D.] was ultimately apprehended, he co-operated with the police.Custody was not recommended in the predisposition report, but the youth court judge decided a custodial disposition was in order because of increases in such crimes and sentenced him, on June 24, 1994, to eight months open custody and 12 months probation.At this point he had been on remand for three weeks.On July 21, 1994, he escaped open custody and was sentenced to 21 days' secure custody.Since then and until recently [T.D.] has been a model student and presented few problems to his open custody facility.In September, he received the student of the month award.However, since this appeal was heard, [T.D.] was implicated, as a major player, in an attempted escape from open custody and placed in secure custody.His youth worker advised the court \"given [T.D.]'s recent actions, it is difficult to determine the impact of his present disposition or whether [T.D.] totally comprehends the severity of his offences\".4. [R.M.][R.M.] (b.d. Aug. 9, 1979) pled guilty to six counts of auto theft.The first four offences occurred during the night of April 6, 1994 when [R.M.] was with [T.D.] and three other youths.It appears this was the first occasion [R.M.] had consumed alcoholic beverages.He was found passed out with the other youths in one of the stolen vehicles.(This event is described above in relation to [T.D.])The total damage to the four vehicles was $8,000.00.[R.M.] pled guilty and was awaiting sentencing when he committed the remaining two offences.On May 22, [R.M.] and [T.D.] stole a car in Regina, drove to Watrous and rolled the car.Twelve hundred dollars' worth of damages was caused to the vehicle.On May 24, 1994 [R.M.] and [T.D.] again stole a car, this time from Saskatoon and drove to Calgary. The car was recovered near Calgary.No estimate of damages was provided.Prior to these offences, [R.M.] was not experiencing difficulties at home or at school.He was in Grade 10 in a modified education program at the time the offences were committed.His mother was shocked at these offences as there had been no prior warning.Both [R.M.] and his mother indicated he had no prior experience with alcohol or drugs.He did not have a criminal record.The predisposition report did not recommend a custodial disposition.After spending two weeks on remand, [R.M.] received a disposition of 18 months probation and 100 hours community service work.The disposition was imposed July 27, 1994.Within three weeks of receiving his disposition, [R.M.] was charged with additional offences arising out of another drinking spree which occurred the night before his birthday.His attendance at school has been poor this fall.It is his youth worker's opinion that [R.M.] has made very little positive progress since the disposition in July.II. General Principles of LawSection 687(1) of the Criminal Code (made applicable by s. 27(1) of the Young Offenders Act) describes this Court's role:687.(1)Where an appeal is taken against sentence, the court of appeal shall, unless the sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against, and may on such evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to receive,(a)vary the sentence within the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the accused was convicted; or(b)dismiss the appeal.Thus our task is to consider whether the sentences (called \"dispositions\" under the YOA) are \"fit\".Over the years the courts in this and the other provinces have developed principles and guidelines to assist in determining whether a disposition is fit.R. v. Morrissette (1971), 1970 CanLII 642 (SK CA), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 307 (Sask. C.A.) is often cited for its review of the factors to be considered in sentencing: (i) punishment; (ii) deterrence;(iii) protection of the public; and (iv) the reformation and rehabilitation of the offender.Morrissette, in addition to imposing a sentence for an adult offender, also set a sentence for a 17-year-old and 18-year-old.Culliton J.A. said (at p. 311) in relation to young offenders \"the principal element for consideration, consonant with the maintenance of public confidence in the effective enforcement of the criminal law, should be the offender's reformation and rehabilitation\".The Young Offenders Act became law in Canada on April 2, 1984 and replaced the Juvenile Delinquents Act which had been the vehicle for dealing with youth crime since 1908.The YOA effected a number of changes including raising the upper age limit for persons covered by the Act to 18, but its most fundamental change is the attitude towards punishing offenders.The YOA makes the justice system for young offenders more like that for adults.It is a more open system.Consideration must be given to the age of the young offender, but it is becoming clear that dispositions for young offenders will be as long as they were under the JDA, and in some instances longer, if the balancing of principles and factors, applicable to a particular case, dictate that result.The YOA requires a court when it fashions a disposition to balance the principles set out in s. 3 of the YOA.The parts material to this case are:3.(1)It is hereby recognized and declared that(a)while young persons should not in all instances be held accountable in the same manner or suffer the same consequences for their behaviour as adults, young persons who commit offences should nonetheless bear responsibility for their contraventions;(b)society must, although it has the responsibility to take reasonable measures to prevent criminal conduct by young persons, be afforded the necessary protection from illegal behaviour;(c) young persons who commit offences require supervision, discipline and control, but, because of their state of dependency and level of development and maturity, they also have special needs and require guidance and assistance;...(f) in the application of this Act, the rights and freedoms of young persons include a right to the least possible interference with freedom that is consistent with the protection of society, having regard to the needs of young persons and the interests of their families;...(h) parents have responsibility for the care and supervision of their children, and, for that reason, young persons should be removed from parental supervision either partly or entirely only when measures that provide for continuing parental supervision are inappropriate.These provisions are to be given the force normally attributed to substantive provisions:see R. v. T.(V), 1992 CanLII 88 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 749 at 765 and R. v. M.(J.J.), 1993 CanLII 91 (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 421 at 428.This latter case, which Mr. Justice Cory wrote for the Supreme Court of Canada, is of paramount importance in the case before this Court in explaining and elucidating the provisions of the YOA.He confirmed that one goal of the YOA is to protect society from the violent and criminal acts committed by the young as much as from those committed by adults, but that this must be balanced against the fact that young people are not fully formed in their emotions or reasoning processes and that the possibility of rehabilitation is great.He said (at pp. 428 \u0026 429):...The references to responsibility contained in s. 3(1)(a) and to the protection of society in paras. (b), (d) and (f) suggest that a traditional criminal law approach should be taken into account in the sentencing of young offenders. Yet we must approach dispositions imposed on young offenders differently because the needs and requirements of the young are distinct from those of adults.For instance, the declaration in s. 3(1)(a) and (c) notes that young offenders cannot be held accountable in the same way as adult criminals because of their dependency on others and their obvious lack of maturity.There are other elements in the declaration which suggest that there should be a departure from the strict criminal justice model in imposing penalties on young offenders.Section 3(1)(d) for example, suggests that in some circumstances, no judicial measure should be taken against the child.Paragraph (f) confirms the offender's right to the least possible interference with his or her liberty.As well, s. 3(1)(h) establishes that young people coming within the provisions of the Act are wherever possible, to remain under parental supervision._He expressed his concern that whatever disposition is chosen must be with the view to ensuring young offenders do not become long term adult offenders (see p. 429).Section 3(1)(h) of the YOA provides that \"parents have responsibility for the care and supervision of their children, and, for that reason, young persons should be removed from parental supervision either partly or entirely only when measures that provide for continuing parental supervision are inappropriate\".Cory J. in R. v. M.(J.J.) said this in relation to a young offender's home situation (see p. 432):...the home situation is a factor that should always be taken into account in fashioning the appropriate disposition.It is relevant in complying with the Act's requirement that an assessment must be made of the special needs and requirements for guidance of the young offender.Intolerable conditions in the home indicate both a special need for care and the absence of any guidance within the home.The situation in the home of young offender should neither be ignored nor made the predominant factor in sentencing. Nonetheless, it is a factor that can properly be taken into account in fashioning the disposition.He completed this thought later (at p. 433):The aim must be both to protect society and at the same time to provide the young offender with the necessary guidance and assistance that he or she may not be getting at home.Those goals are not necessarily mutually exclusive.In the long run, society is best protected by the reformation and rehabilitation of a young offender.The other section of the YOA relevant to this case is s. 24(1):24. (1)The youth court shall not commit a young person to custody under paragraph 20(1)(k) unless the court considers a committal to custody to be necessary for the protection of society having regard to the seriousness of the offence and the circumstances in which it was committed and having regard to the needs and circumstances of the young person.In deciding whether society can be protected one weighs the seriousness and the circumstances of the offence with the nature of the offender as a measure of determining the likelihood of the offender re-offending.R. v. J.R.S. (an unreported judgment of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, dated May 1,1994) applies this principle.In this case a 17-year-old with a record had pled guilty to one count of breaking and entering, two counts of possession of stolen property and two counts of theft and received a disposition of 45 days' open custody and one year probation.After reviewing the youth's difficult home situation, McEachern, C.J.B.C., speaking for the Court, set aside the disposition and impose done of time served.He said:The policy of the Young Offenders Act is wherever possible to treat these matters in the community and without a custodial sentence.If there was a primary consideration that should have appeared in the reasons for judgment of the trial judge it is this question of rehabilitation which is really the most important consideration with most young offenders.In doing so McEachern, C.J.B.C. doubted whether a custodial disposition had been required.A Youth Court judge must consider and balance many factors to arrive at a disposition which will have the best chance of achieving the goals already stated, i.e., rehabilitation of the offender and protection of the public from these and other like minded offenders.A balancing is required because some factors call for a custodial sentence and some dictate a community disposition.All this must take place in the context of s. 3 which directs the Court to consider, among other things: (i) youths must take responsibility for their wrongful acts; (ii) parents have responsibility for supervising their children; and (iii) society must take responsibility but has the right to be protected.Finding how best to supervise, discipline, guide, assist and control while at the same time protecting society is no easy task.In doing all this, clearly the Youth Court and this Court have the power to impose lengthy custodial dispositions, but we must do so in a measured way responding to the dictates of the YOA and our own experience in dealing with offenders.We must consider the guiding principles and the different factors applicable to each offence and each offender trying all the while to choose a disposition which will have the most success in ensuring a young offender will not re-offend.A custodial disposition, no matter how long, is no guarantee the youth will not re-offend when released, and may, if not appropriate for a particular offender, have the exact opposite effect.Furthermore, if the Courts unthinkingly imposed significant custodial sentences on young offenders, the facilities would be so overburdened as to be of little use for those truly needing that method of correction.One is also mindful that dispositions are rough tools in the fight against youth crime.What are the relevant factors to be balanced in this case?The factors calling for a custodial sentence are the sheer wanton destruction of these acts, their frequency, the \"craze\" aspect of the offences and, in [S.B.]'s case, the extent of his record.In addition, in each case, some offences were committed while the youth was out of custody on his own undertaking.The factors to be considered on the other side are the very young age of two offenders, the absence of a record for three of them and that one helped the police with their inquiries.In addition, they all pled guilty.One has done better than others since being dealt with in youth court.It is appropriate to consider these factors at greater length to determine what role each should play in assessing the fitness of these dispositions.A.Presence or Absence of a RecordA well accepted principle dictates that, if at all possible, imprisonment is to be avoided for first offenders.Culliton J.A. said this in Morrissette and it has been said many times before and since.The reason for this is that the person has not yet had the opportunity to be confronted with the full force of the law.In R. v. Biron (1991), 1991 CanLII 3911 (QC CA), 65 C.C.C. (3d) 221 (Que. C.A.), the charge was one of auto theft.The accused, a successful businessman who was financially well-off, arranged for someone to steal a luxury car for his personal use.The accused put the Crown to the expense of a jury trial, but, nonetheless, the Court said the appropriate sentence was a large fine and a one-year probation order. Kaufman J.A. said (at p.223):It is now, I think, accepted as a general principle of sentencing that before imposing a custodial sentence on a first offender, a sentencing court should carefully explore the other dispositions available.A custodial sentence should only be imposed in cases where the circumstances are such or the gravity of the offence is such that no other sentence is appropriate: R. v. Stein (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 376 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Bates (1977), 32 C.C.C.(2d) 493 (Ont. C.A.).(See also: R. v. Stein (1974) 15 C.C.C. (2d) 376 (Ont. C.A.) at 377.)This principle is equally applicable to young offenders.In R. v. Beacon and Modney (1976), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 56 (Alta. S.C.A.D.) at 59 Sinclair J.A. said:Custodial sentences are generally avoided in the case of young first offenders.A Court's first impression is to ask whether a suspended sentence, with probation, would not be a suitable sentence for the offender, and for the offence...This was said in relation to the law as it existed prior to the YOA, but it is still good law with the one qualification that suspended sentences are not available to young offenders under the YOA.All the young offenders before this Court pled guilty to a series of charges:(i) [S.B.] - 6;(ii) [C.J.] -9; (iii) [T.D.] - 20; (iv) [R.M.] - 6.Does the same leniency normally given to young offenders and first offenders apply?Offences committed as part of a spree are not viewed in the same light as offences committed over time with each offence planned and deliberate.It is also true that the Court, subject to the totality principle, is entitled to consider the aggravating feature of multiple charges.B.Guilty PleaIn R. v. Layte (1984), 38 C.R. (3d) 204 (Ont. Co. Ct.) at 206 Salhany Co.Ct. J. succinctly stated why a guilty plea can be an important motivating factor:It is a fundamental concept of our system of justice that a person accused of a crime is entitled to demand that the Crown prove his guilt by a fair and impartial trial.There is nothing that the court should ever do to whittle down or undercut that fundamental principle.At the same time, it would be unrealistic not to recognize that if everyone demanded a full and complete trial our system of justice would come to an abrupt halt.It is for that reason that those who are guilty, and wish to so plead, should be given special consideration when they appear before the court. There are many reasons for this.One is that the state is saved a considerable expense.Another is that witnesses are spared the inconvenience and the expense and occasionally the trauma of a trial.Another is that a plea of guilty is an indication and demonstration of the accused's remorse.Other courts have taken issue with the reasons for giving credit for a guilty plea and providing circumstances where a guilty plea should not be seen as a significant mitigating factor (i.e., where evidence of guilt is overwhelming), but all appear to accept that a guilty plea can in the appropriate case significantly reduce public expense and credit should be given for it (see:Ruby on Sentencing (4th ed.) at 178 to 181; R. v. de Haan, [1967] 3 All E.R. 618 at 619; R. v. Saulnier (1988), 1987 CanLII 2414 (BC CA), 21 B.C.L.R. (2d) 232 (B.C. C.A.) at 237; R. v. T.(R.) (1992), 1992 CanLII 2834 (ON CA), 17 C.R. (4th) 247 (Ont. C.A.) at 262 where it is stated \"the appellant is entitled to considerable credit for pleading guilty at the first opportunity\").In this case, it is obvious that the cost to run trials for each offence would have been significant and credit must be given for the guilty pleas.C.Co-operating with PoliceThis, too, is a factor to be considered.Insofar as an accused is prepared to implicate himself further and solve outstanding crimes there is both a saving to the public purse and one more indicium the person is prepared to leave crime behind.In R. v. Kirby, Stewart and Cadwell (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 544 (Ont. Co. Ct.),Graburn Co. Ct. J. reviewed British and Canadian authorities which gave significant reductions in sentence to those accused of crime who implicated others.In Kirby, the accused, who pled guilty to house breaking, had acted as an informant which resulted in the laying of 14 serious criminal charges.He had a prior record and, but for his co- operation with the authorities, the circumstances of the case were acknowledged by the Court as normally requiring a custodial sentence.He received a suspended sentence and probation.(See also:R. v. Laroche (1983), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 268 (Que. C.A.)at 270.)In Saulnier, mentioned above, Seaton J.A. said co-operation with the police and giving evidence for the Crown also may be seen as mitigating factors (see p. 237).D.Rehabilitative Steps taken Since SentencingPost-sentence behaviour is a relevant factor to be taken into account when a Court of Appeal reviews the fitness of a sentence.A sentence otherwise fit may in certain circumstances be reduced if the Court is satisfied the steps taken represent a genuine turning-away from what brought the accused to Court in the first place.In R. v. Matthon (unreported, June 30, 1988) this Court had to consider the fitness of a four-year sentence imposed on a first offender for armed robbery.In reducing the sentence to three years the Court commented the offender had taken serious strides toward his rehabilitation.Then, in R. v. Ulrich (1990), 1989 CanLII 4729 (SK CA), 75 Sask. R. 26 this Court considered the fitness of a 10 month sentence imposed on a first offender for operating a vehicle while his ability to drive was impaired by alcohol and causing bodily harm.The Court said (at p. 30) it was entitled to take into account events after conviction (which indicated the offender was rehabilitated) and reduced the sentence to 90 days plus a one-year probation order (see p. 30).It is also relevant in considering whether a sentence, not appropriate at the time of sentencing, has become so after sentencing by the actions of the offender. Conversely, poor behaviour since an accused has offended is relevant on an accused's appeal from sentence, but a sentence fit when imposed cannot be increased by the offender's subsequent behaviour.This behaviour must be taken into account by the sentencing judge if the accused has re-offended.(It also must be recognized there are some crimes for which the rehabilitative aspect of sentencing is diminished, e.g., repeat crimes for trafficking the so- called hard drugs or importing (see:Saulnier, supra at p. 236; and R. v. Laverty (unreported judgment of B.C.C.A., dated Dec. 18, 1991).In such cases, it is of less significance to consider what the offender has been doing since sentencing, but this principle is of course not applicable here.)E.Increasing Incidence of Auto TheftWhen [C.J.] was sentenced on May 30, 1994, he was the first of this group to be sentenced.No evidence was led as to increasing numbers of car thefts.But when [T.D.] and [R.M.] were sentenced on June 24, 1994 and July 27, 1994, respectively, Crown counsel spoke of the nature of these crimes as group activities, and, in the case of [R.M.], provided statistics:(i)from January 1 to June 30, 1993, there were 55 car thefts involving young offenders; and (ii) for the same period in 1994 this figure had climbed to 133.No similar statistics were provided when [S.B.] was sentenced on August 31, 1994 but it was the same Youth Court judge, prosecutor and defence counsel as for [R.M.]When the case was argued before us, Crown counsel provided statistics prepared by the Regina Police Service which showed between March, 1993 and September, 1993 there were 65 young offenders charged with auto theft and for the same period in 1994 there were 190.He also said with commendable candour the incidence of youth auto theft had fallen off substantially in October.Case law permits a court to take into account the prevalence of a particular offence.This issue is closely linked to Crown counsel's concern that these offences were committed largely in groups making it more likely a severe disposition would deter others.As Cory J. said in R. v. M.(J.J.):If the activity of the group is criminal then the disposition imposed on an individual member of the group should be such that it will deter other members of the group.For example, the sentence imposed on one member of a \"swarming group\" should serve to deter others in the gang.Having said that, I would underline that general deterrence should not, through undue emphasis, have the same importance in fashioning the disposition for a youthful offender as it would in the case of an adult.One youthful offender should not be obliged to accept the responsibility for all the young offenders of his or her generation. (See p. 435.)Deterrence of others, thus, is to play a role, but we are reminded that the role must not be unduly emphasized.As Arnup J.A. said in R. v. Sears (1978), 2 C.R. (3d) S-27 (Ont. C.A.) at p. S-28:...it is appropriate to consider whether in that particular community, at that particular time, there appears to be an unusual amount of that type of crime, which therefore calls for a sentence which will reflect a degree of deterrence to others.At the same time, that situation can never be more than one of the factors which is to be taken into account, the paramount question of course always being:what should this offender receive for this offence, committed in the circumstances under which it was committed?This principle can be even more strongly stated with respect to young offenders.R. v. C.(J.M.) (1994), 90 C.C.C.(3d) 385 (Man. C.A.) deals with young offender car theft.Twaddle J.A., speaking for the Court, described the increase in auto theft and vandalism in Winnipeg over the preceding year. In response to the Crown's invitation to impose sentences that would deter others, the Youth Court judge had imposed a disposition of 15 months secure custody for possession of a stolen car and for dangerous driving.Two other offences had resulted in dispositions of time served and probation. The young offender was 15-years-old and a first offender who had pled guilty.Twaddle J.A. considered to what extent he should be influenced by the prevalence of the offence in fashioning a disposition for a young offender. After confirming that, in appropriate cases, for adult offenders, local prevalence of the offence might well justify imposition of a greater sentence than the offender might otherwise merit, he concluded it would be inappropriate for this principle to be given much weight in sentencing young offenders.He referred to R. v. M.(J.J.) and then said imposition of a custodial disposition on the young offender for the possession of auto charge would hold him responsible for others in his generation which would not be appropriate.He set aside the 15-month secure custody disposition for the possession of auto charge and substituted a probation order.For the dangerous driving offence, he recommended a sentence from between four and six months open custody.(The dangerous driving offence had not been proceeded with by way of indictment and was therefore not before the Court, hence the recommendation.)The incidence of young offender auto theft increased significantly last summer in Regina, but to say there was a \"gang\" at work appears incorrect.In none of the sentencing hearings or on this appeal has Crown Counsel said there is an organized gang.There is an increase in the crime, but no proof of a gang as those words were used by Cory J. in R. v. M.(J.J.) at p. 435.Thus, it is simply the prevalence of the offence which may be given more or less weight depending on the age and the involvement of the offender.III. Application of the Sentencing Principles to each YouthA. [S.B.]Based on the above, six months secure custody is not a fit sentence for [S.B.]The aggravating features previously mentioned with respect to this offender are: (i) he escaped custody not once but twice to commit these offences;(ii) he has a record of offences which shows a community disposition has not worked with him; and(iii) he does not truly accept his role in these offences.Whether he did the acts of destruction to the cars or not, he was present when significant damage, over and above the offence of stealing, took place.In his favour he pled guilty and he was not 1 when these offences were committed.Taking these factors into account, and mindful of s. 24(1), we set aside his disposition and impose a disposition of one year secure custody consecutive to the nine month open custody disposition he had been serving prior to the commission of these offences.(The secure custody will of course be served first.)In increasing this disposition we note that the YOA provides a review procedure which will permit this youth to have an impact on the length of custody if he chooses to do so.We urge the authorities to work with his family and make every effort to rehabilitate this youth.B.[C.J.]When [C.J.] received his disposition of 18 months probation and 100 hours community service the factors requiring a custodial disposition were the increased number of offences and the even greater damage done to the vehicles than that effected by [S.B.] and his friends. He was also somewhat older than [S.B.].However unlike [S.B.]he had no record.His family also appeared able to control him.Nonetheless given the multiple nature of these offences, the extent of the damage and that some of it was committed while he was awaiting his disposition, it would have been appropriate for the Youth Court Judge to have imposed a short period of custody.Thus, the disposition of 18 months probation with community service was not fit when it was imposed.But since [C.J.] received his disposition, his family have significantly intervened in his life.Section 3(1)(h) of the YOA calls for parents to take control of their children.It would be inappropriate to impose a custodial disposition as a means of deterring others when the parents have taken the responsibility and control that they have in [C.J.]'s case.Thus, in this case, although the disposition was not fit when it was imposed,tt would not be appropriate to interfere with it now.C.[T.D.]The factors dictating a custodial disposition in this case were again the sheer numbers of offences, the damage to property and that some of the offences were committed while he was awaiting his disposition.His parents appeared to have lost the ability to control him.But to increase his disposition of eight months open custody is not warranted.He was quite young (not yet 15 when the majority of the offences were committed) and a first offender, and he pled guilty.He also assisted the police with their inquiries.The multiple nature of the offences and their prevalence in Regina is sufficiently acknowledged by the eight month open custody disposition imposed on this young first offender.His involvement with the escape from the open custody facility which occurred subsequent to when he received his sentence cannot be used to increase the disposition, but it is of course open to the Youth Court to take this into account if he is receives a disposition in relation to that escape.D.[R.M.]This is the youngest of the four youths (approximately 14 and a half years old when the offences were committed). These were his first offences and he was very much a follower in these enterprises with [T.D.] being the leader in at least the second set of the offences.Unlike [T.D.]who committed 19 offences over 12 or more days, [R.M.] was involved in offences during two nights.He also pled guilty.The reduced number of offences, his age and his minimal role in the offences make a disposition of 18 months probation and 100 hours community service work fit when imposed.What he has done since the commission of these offences cannot be used to increase an otherwise fit disposition.This is clearly an example of a case where there is an obvious need to enforce strictly probationary terms and not to wait for further offences beyond a breachof probation to bring an offender back before the Courts. Again the Youth Court can take his recent behaviour into account if his actions since his disposition result in the prosecution of the additional charges.DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 6th day of December A.D. 1994.I concur_____________________________BAYDA C.J.S.I concur____________________________LANE J.A.____________________________JACKSON J.A."}

C-46; Sex Offender Information Registration Act, S.C. 2004, c. 10REASONS FOR JUDGMENTStack, J.:INTRODUCTION[1]“Today, I wonder who I would have been, how different my life would be, if this hadn’t happened.”So concludes the Victim Impact Statement of a young woman – one of three victims of the crimes that bring us here today for the sentencing of R.M.Let us see now what sentence should be imposed for these crimes.[2]Following a trial, the Offender was found guilty of 10 offences against three of his half-siblings: against Mike - one count of sexual assault, two counts of sexual touching, two counts of invitation to sexual touching and two counts of uttering threats; against Todd - one count of sexual assault; and against Jane - one count of sexual assault and one count of sexual touching.[1] Jane is now 25 years old; the twins, Mike and Todd, are 19.They grew up in a small community in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador.[3]What sentence should the Offender receive after taking into account the sentencing principles established in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (the Criminal Code)?[4]Denunciation and deterrence are the primary principles in sentencing for sexual assault, especially for the sexual assault of children.I must also consider the aggravating factors that affect sentencing, including that the Offender is the victims’ step-brother, the nature and repetition of the criminal acts, the Offender’s lack of insight into his criminal behaviour and the assessment that he is a high risk to reoffend.The Offender’s willingness to participate in programs for sex offenders is a mitigating factor.Principles of sentencing[5]The principles for imposing sentence are set out in sections 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code and are well known.For sexual assaults, the Court of Appeal has provided further sentencing guidance in R. v. Atkins (1988), 1988 CanLII 201 (NL CA), 69 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 99, 4 W.C.B. (2d) 348 (Nfld. C.A.), by listing several factors to be considered.I will address them each in turn.The extent of the assaults and other offences[6]The extent and the number of the assaults are aggravating factors, as is the fact that the Offender abused the children serially.That is, as one of his half-siblings became mature enough to rebuff his criminal activity, the Offender simply moved on to the next one.Mike[7]The sexual touching of Mike by the Offender began when Mike was seven years old or younger and ended when he was 15 or 16.The Offender touched Mike’s penis and got Mike to touch his.The Offender had Mike perform oral sex on him and vice versa.Most invasively, the Offender had anal intercourse with Mike.[8]Oral sex happened so many times that Mike could not put a number on it. The number of instances of anal intercourse was not clear.Although Mike testified that it occurred more than 10 times, but less than 20, the Court was satisfied that it occurred at least twice.[9]The Offender was also convicted on two counts of uttering threats against Mike.Mike testified that the Offender threatened to kill him if he told anyone about the abuse.Mike said that the Offender threatened him in this manner more than once and that he felt threatened and intimidated as a result.[10]The other incident of the Offender uttering threats against Mike is alleged to have occurred on or about May 10, 2012.The Offender told Todd on the telephone that he would break Mike’s legs and stomp on his face.The Offender then turned up in the community where the boys lived looking for Mike.Todd[11]The sexual contact between the Offender and Todd incurred after Todd turned 16.Todd began working for the Offender and, as with Mike before him, it was deemed more convenient for him to live with the Offender and his mother than to commute from the community where they lived.[12]Todd does not recall the first incident of sexual contact with the Offender because there were so many.It began with the Offender using his hand to touch Todd’s “privates”.It proceeded to the Offender performing oral sex on Todd.Eventually, Todd began to reciprocate.Oral sex between the two of them occurred almost every night. Todd feared that he would remain at the Offender’s place forever as the Offender’s “slave”.Jane[13]Jane could have been as young as four years old when the sexual abuse by the Offender began.She testified that it continued until she was 12 or 13 years old, when she was in Grade seven or Grade eight.These later assaults occurred in 2002 or 2003, after the Offender turned 18 but before Jane turned 14.They are the incidents in respect of which the Offender was found guilty by this Court.[14]One night when Jane was in Grade seven or Grade eight, the Offender came into her room.She woke up with his hand down her pants and his finger in her vagina.During the same time period, if Jane was alone in the house with the Offender he would show her his penis.He would also touch her breasts on the pretext of giving a hug.Degree of violence or force used[15]The Crown and counsel for the Offender agree that any sexual assault is inherently violent and compromises the personal integrity of the victim. Each of these offences was therefore violent, especially the digital penetration of Jane’s vagina.None, however, was more violent than the anal intercourse inflicted upon Mike.[16]The Offender told Jane that she would get in trouble if she told anyone about the abuse – in particular that her father would hate her.He “pretty much said that he would kill me”, she testified.[17]Todd testified that he was very much afraid of the Offender who is a much larger man than he.The Offender would get very angry.He would yell.Although he was seldom physical he would be very “hyper”.His eyes would be empty and his pupils would dilate – like he was looking through someone.Todd also testified as to two incidents where the Offender was violent towards him, although not in connection with a specific sexual assault.[18]The degree of violence is an aggravating factor, although not the most aggravating.The impact of the crime upon the victims, the family of the victims and the Offender[19]Jane provided a short but pointed Victim Impact Statement that details the negative effects of the years of abuse she suffered at the hands of the Offender.These include: guilt; low self-esteem; suicidal ideations; mood swings; being mistrustful (especially of men); being anti-social; and eating unhealthily.She suffers from flashbacks and nightmares.She has no happy childhood memories to share with her own young child.At trial we learned that twice she has attempted suicide.[20]No Victim Impact Statement was provided by Mike or Todd, despite them being offered the opportunity.I make no negative inference in this regard and am aware that a sexual assault must always be a traumatic experience for the victim.Although a Victim Impact Statement is a helpful tool in the sentencing process, there are many reasons why a victim would choose not to provide one.The victim’s choice is respected by the court.[21]For the purposes of sentencing, having observed and listened to these two young men when they testified at trial, I can infer that the abuse that they suffered has had a profoundly negative effect upon their lives.Todd described at trial his fear that he would become the Offender’s slave.Mike has, in the words of counsel for the Crown, “had his life ruined”; he abuses alcohol and drugs, he has very little education and he is not working.She described him as “severely damaged” and from my assessment of him as a witness during the trial I sadly concur.[22]Pursuant to s. 718.2(a)(ii.1) of the Criminal Code, I must take into account that the Offender abused persons under the age of 18.The degree of trust involved[23]The Offender is the victims’ half-brother.Although the victims were not directly under the care of the Offender, to be sexually assaulted by one’s older half-brother is a terrible breach of familial trust.This is especially true here because at the time of some of the offences Mike and Todd had gone to live and work with the Offender.This is a serious aggravating factor and leads to the requirement of a sentence that will sufficiently denounce these abhorrent crimes and deter, not just this offender, but others of his ilk.It is true that the Offender’s mother also lived in the house and it is she who could be seen as the responsible adult; yet it was the Offender who employed the boys.Inherent in them working for him and living with him is some assumption that he would act in their best interests rather than abusing them terribly.Public abhorrence of the type of crime involved[24]Two of the victims were young children when the assaults began; the other was just 16.The public would be rightfully shocked and dismayed by the Offender committing such despicable crimes against his innocent and vulnerable half-siblings.His crimes must be denounced in a manner that makes it clear that such reprehensible conduct will not be tolerated in our society.The Offender’s plea and attitude to what has been done[25]The Offender pleaded not guilty to the charges, as is his right.That this matter went to trial is not an aggravating factor; every accused has the constitutional right to be tried on the charges against him.The Offender’s attitude towards the convictions is telling, however.Despite the verdict of the Court, he does not acknowledge his most serious crimes.[26]At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing the Offender apologized to his victims and to his family.One hopes that his apology was sincere.I note, though, that he appears to be more concerned about the fact that he is estranged from that side of his family and that he wants to get his life back on track than about the terrible consequences that his crimes have caused for his victims.This, therefore, is a neutral factor.The biological and psychiatric factors that led to the commission of the offences[27]Although no expert evidence was led as to the effect of biological or psychiatric factors that may have influenced the Offender’s decision to abuse his half-siblings so despicably, a Pre-sentence Report was provided.A Pre-sentence Report, although a useful tool in sentencing, is not subjected to the same levels of proof as is evidence at a trial.It is helpful because of the author’s assessment of an offender and his likelihood of re-offending.The assertions it makes, however, are usually based largely upon what an offender and people close to him have told the author.Those assertions have not been subject to cross examination and may be self-serving.Consequently, although carrying some weight, Pre-sentence Reports must be approached with caution.[28]The Offender has been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder.He has a history of drug use.He attained a Grade 9 education through the assistance of special education; he is semi-literate.The Offender reports being sexually abused on 15 occasions at the age of six by a male neighbour; the matter was not brought to trial and remains on his mind.Counsel for the Offender, while noting these factors, acknowledged that they do not play into the commission of the offences themselves.Rather, they provide background information as to who the Offender is.The need for specific and general deterrence[29]Deterrence, both general and specific, is a key sentencing criterion in cases of sexual assault, especially sexual assaults involving children and other close familial relations.Because they are unable to protect themselves, society must protect young people from adults who prey upon their vulnerability.This is done, in part, by making the sentence imposed one that will deter the Offender and those of similar predilections from preying on innocent victims.[30]Here the emphasis must be on both specific and general deterrence.The Pre-sentence Report indicates that the Offender is a high risk to re-offend, including sexually.I discuss this in more detail in the next section.The prospect of successful rehabilitation[31]As stated above, the Pre-sentence Report concludes that the Offender is considered a high risk to commit further sex-related crimes according to the Static-99 assessment tool.At the sentencing hearing, Susan Melendy-Stark, a classification officer at Her Majesty’s Penitentiary (HMP), testified that the Offender was found to be a moderate risk to reoffend based upon the STABLE evaluation.She explained that the latter is a more subjective assessment.It is used to determine treatment approaches while an offender is in custody.Static-99 is used for post-custody purposes, such as supervision in the community and probation.[32]In addition to his assessment under the Static-99 instrument as a high risk to sexually reoffend, the Pre-sentence Report states that the Offender is assessed to be a high risk to become involved in further criminal activities pursuant to the Level of Service/Case Management Inventory.[33]According to Ms. Melendy-Stark, the Offender has been a well-behaved inmate while at HMP with no disciplinary issues noted.He has been given the opportunity to work almost full-time in the storeroom and has been selected as a unit inmate representative on the Inmate Committee.[34]I note, however, that the Offender has demonstrated the ability to successfully interact with other people while at the same time offending.By way of illustration, in 2001 the Offender was found not criminally responsible in respect of a number of violent criminal offenses.At a Newfoundland and Labrador Review Board hearing on February 9, 2012, he received a positive report from both his psychiatrist and case manager.[35]Although for a different purpose, the Review Board in its written decision dated March 2, 2012 noted positive things about the Offender, including his “abstaining from substances, avoiding unhealthy relationships” and “using positive strategies to tolerate angry emotions”.Ultimately, the Review Board concluded, “The Board is satisfied that [R.M.] is not now a risk to the safety of the public and should therefore be discharge [sic] absolutely”.The years 2001 to 2012 span the period when the Offender was sexually assaulting his half-siblings.The decision was delivered at the very time that Todd was working and living with the Offender, being sexually abused and living in fear of becoming his slave.[36]It seems, therefore, that the Offender may be able to present positively to persons in positions of authority while not altering his underlying criminal attitudes and behaviours.Although more evidence would be needed to confirm my concerns, for the purposes of sentencing I am not confident that getting along well at HMP necessarily means that there is little risk of the Offender committing similar or other sexual crimes in the future.[37]The Offender does have the ability to lead a successful life outside of prison. This is notwithstanding his mental health challenges and lack of literacy skills. This is evidenced by his ability to start and successfully build a small vehicle detailing enterprise.The abilities he employed in this regard will serve him well once he is released.[38]It is hoped that the Offender will receive treatment that will address the causes of his criminally aberrant behaviour.He has indicated a willingness to do so.His rehabilitation is both in his best interest and in the best interest of society.I conclude, however, that although the risk of recidivism may be ameliorated through appropriate programs in an institutional setting, I am not convinced that rehabilitation should displace deterrence and denunciation as the principle sentencing objectives in these circumstances.The antecedents and age of the Offender[39]This factor has been largely addressed above where I outline the biological or psychiatric circumstances of the Offender.The Pre-Sentence Report indicates that the Offender is 31 years old, has a Grade 9 education and lives with his mother.He has maintained his own vehicle detailing business in the past.He has been diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder and is under psychiatric care.The time spent in custody prior to trial[40]Other than for five days when he was arrested, the Offender has not been held in custody as a result of the offenses for which he is being sentenced today.He is currently serving a two-year youth sentence at HMP.Because five days is so minimal when compared to the custodial sentence that the Offender is facing, I have not taken into account the time that he spent in pre-trial custody relating to these offenses.When I address the issue of totality below, however, I will take into account the time that the Offender has spent in custody arising out of his conviction in Youth Court.Criminal record[41]Although this factor may well be addressed when considering the antecedents of the Offender, I prefer to consider it separately.[42]The Offender has been convicted of a number of sex crimes that he committed while a young offender and that I understand relate to Jane and one or more other of her siblings.I have nothing before me to suggest that the Youth Court sentence relates to abuses of Mike as well.[2]In 2011 the Offender was convicted of impersonating a police officer.In 2008 he was convicted of mischief in relation to property.In addition, from 2000 to 2003, he was convicted of a number of non-violent crimes as well as for uttering threats.These convictions are in addition to the ones for uttering threats, assault and failure to comply with a court order in respect of which he was found not criminally responsible in October of 2001.Sentences imposed by other courts in Newfoundland and Labrador and elsewhere in Canada[43]The Crown and the Defence each cited several cases in support of their respective sentencing proposals.Additionally, I have considered other cases, identified below, that were not referred to me by counsel.Crown cases[44]R. v. W.W.M. (2006), 2006 CanLII 3262 (ON CA), 206 O.A.C. 342, 205 C.C.C. (3d) 410 - a sentence of four years for two counts of incest was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal.The abuse in that case did not last as long as in this case.While sexual assault and incest are different offences, there are similarities, especially in relation to the sexual assaults upon Mike.[45]R. v. F.(G.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 6611 (NL SCTD), 143 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 181, [1996] N.J. No. 220 (Nfld. S.C. (T.D.)) - a sentence of seven years and six months was imposed for sexual offences involving five young children.The sexual activity in question involved intercourse, masturbation, oral sex and simulated intercourse.There was not a high degree of trust involved and there were threats of violence.[46]R. v. J.J.W., [2002] O.T.C. 594, 55 W.C.B. (2d) 46 (Sup. Ct.) - a sentence of five years was imposed for sexual offences against three children.The sexual activity involved incest and gross indecency (the facts of which are not disclosed).As in the present case, the offences started when the accused was a youth.Unlike the present case, there were guilty pleas to some offences.Like here, the accused had had treatment for mental health issues, but had not attempted to deal with sexual abuse or offending in counselling.The offender was also ordered to remain away from public places where children could reasonably expect to be found.[47]R v. Smith, 2013 NLTD(G) 43 - a sentence of nine years and 347 days was ordered for a variety of sexual offences committed against 13 boys over a twenty- year period.Like the present case, the offences involved a broad spectrum of sexual activity including anal intercourse.Defence cases[48]R. v. M.C., 2011 NLTD(G) 121 – the offender was sentenced to 10 months for sexually touching a 13 year old girl and having her perform fellatio on him and to 30 days’ imprisonment to be served concurrently for kissing her, followed by probation for two years.For having voluntary sexual intercourse with a girl close to the age of consent, the offender was given a consecutive sentence of 18 months, again to be followed by two years’ probation.[49]R. v Hammond, 2011 NLTD(G) 8 – the 26 year old offender with no criminal record pleaded guilty to a single instance of voluntary sexual intercourse with a 14 year old.The offender was a low risk to reoffend.He was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment followed by six months’ probation.[50]R. v. Kendell, 2012 NLTD(G) 52 – the 33 year old offender pleaded guilty to engaging in a relationship with a 14 year old which included intercourse.He was sentenced to 21 months’ imprisonment followed by probation for one year.[51]R. v. Tapper, 2010 NLTD 42 (CanLII) – following a trial, the offender, who had a lengthy criminal record, was found guilty of having voluntary oral sex performed on him by a 13 year old.He was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment to be served consecutively with any sentence he was then serving.Other cases[52]Other cases, not cited by either party, are relevant to the discussion including R. v. Branton, 2013 NLCA 61 (CanLII) where a sentence of 23 months less a day was imposed for masturbation, oral sex and attempted anal intercourse upon a boy.That case also stressed the importance of the principles of denunciation and deterrence in cases of the abuse of persons under the age of 18 years.[53]In Q. v. J.C.H., 2009 NLTD 177 (CanLII), the offender was sentenced to five years for sexual abuse of the son of his common-law spouse from when he was five years old until he was eight.The acts included fondling the child’s penis and anal intercourse.[54]In R. v. R.A.R., 2000 SCC 8 (CanLII), a custodial sentence of one year was imposed upon an employer for one incident of digitally penetrating an employee’s vagina.In R. v. Barrett, 2011 NLCA 5 (CanLII), a one year sentence for a single instance of digital penetration was found to be appropriate.[55]The parties did not address fit sentences for the convictions for uttering threats against Mike.In R. v. Freake, 2012 NLCA 10 (CanLII), Welsh and Rowe JJA addressed the range of sentence for uttering threats and whether such a sentence should be served consecutively or concurrently.Where the Crown proceeds by way of indictment, as in this case, the maximum sentence is five years’ imprisonment.ANALYSISFit sentences[56]The Offender was convicted of 10 offenses, namely Count Nos.: 1 (sexual interference upon Mike);2 (sexual interference upon Mike); 3 (invitation to sexual touching in respect of Mike);4 (invitation to sexual touching in respect of Mike); 5 (sexual assault upon Mike); 6 (uttering threats against Mike); 7 (uttering threats against Mike); 8 (sexual assault upon Todd); 9 (sexual interference upon Jane); and 11 (sexual assault upon Jane).Based upon application of the Kienapple principle, however, the convictions relating to Count Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9 were conditionally stayed.He is therefore to be sentenced in respect of Count Nos. 1, 6, 7, 8, and 11, taking into account the sentencing principles set out in the Criminal Code, the aggravating and mitigating factors and the sentences reflected in the case law.[57]The Crown seeks seven years for all of the offenses and did not provide a breakdown for each offense. Counsel for the Offender suggests a total sentence of four years arrived at based upon a range of sentence from five and a half years to nine years.[58]The most serious offences are those against Mike which were pervasive and invasive.That they started when Mike was so young and continued for so long are seriously aggravating factors.Mike’s was a childhood stolen for the sexual gratification of his half-brother.Denunciation and deterrence require a lengthy period of imprisonment, especially because the Offender is categorized as a high risk to reoffend.Defence counsel argues that an appropriate sentence would fall in the range of three to five years.I have determined that a fit sentence for Count No. 1, the sexual interference in respect of Mike, is five years’ imprisonment.[59]The first conviction for uttering threats was a general threat that the Offender would kill Mike if Mike disclosed the abuse.It was part of the terror reigned over Mike by the Offender.But there are no facts before the Court that demonstrate that the Offender actually intended to carry through on this threat.The sentence in respect of Count No. 6, therefore, is one month of imprisonment to be served concurrently with the sentence for Count No. 1.[60]The first conviction for uttering threats needs to be distinguished from the second which is aggravated in nature.This is because not only did the Offender tell Todd that he would harm Mike, but he drove to the community looking for him.Mike could only presume that it was to carry out the threat.Certainly Mike acted as if that were the case by first hiding and then leaving the community.For Count No. 7, I impose a sentence of six months to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed in respect of Count No. 1.[61]As for the offense against Todd, the Offender’s counsel suggests a sentence of between two to three years.These were serious infringements on Todd’s sexual integrity.Although Todd was not a young child, he was vulnerable to his larger and older half-brother.The Offender used his offer of employment and a place to live to groom Todd for these assaults.For Count No. 8, a fit sentence is two years’ imprisonment to be served consecutively to the sentence imposed for Count No. 1.[62]For the offense against Jane, the Offender’s counsel suggests a sentence of six months to one year.The assault involved digital penetration of her vagina.It was therefore invasive and attracts a serious period of incarceration.A fit sentence for Count No. 11 is imprisonment for one year to be served concurrently to the sentence being served by the Offender arising out of his convictions in Youth Court and concurrent to the sentence imposed in respect of Count No. 1.[63]Let me explain why the sentence relating to Jane is to be served concurrently.The sentences for the offenses against each of Mike and Todd should run consecutive to one another, and consecutive to the sentence that the Offender is serving arising out of his conviction in Youth Court.As far as I am aware, these are different victims and their abuse cannot be said to arise out of the same “criminal adventure”, to use the unfortunate phrase developed in the case law (R. v. Hutchings, 2012 NLCA 2 (CanLII)).The offense against Jane, however, can be seen as a continuation of the Offender’s criminal behavior towards her for which he was sentenced in Youth Court and should therefore be served concurrently with that sentence.To ensure that it is truly served concurrently with what was a two-year sentence in Youth Court, it should also be served concurrently to the sentence imposed for Count No. 1.This is not to minimize the severity of the matters before me, their effect upon Jane, or to suggest that the Offender should not be punished for them.This merely acknowledges the sentencing principle that a sequence of events involving the same victim, while resulting in separate convictions, normally also results in those sentencesbeingserved concurrently (R. v. A.T.S., 2004 NLCA 1 (CanLII)).TOTALITY[64]The total of the sentences imposed of five years, one month, six months, two years and one year equals eight years and seven months.Because I have determined that certain of the sentences are to be served concurrently, the result is a period of incarceration of seven years.This is what the Crown suggests is a fit total sentence and also it falls within the range of five and a half to nine years suggested by counsel for the Offender (although well outside the four years to which he suggests the sentence be “rejigged” after the application of the totality principle).As mentioned, neither counsel provided sentence recommendations for the convictions on the uttering threats counts.[65]That the Offender is already serving a sentence for another offence is a factor to be considered in applying totality (R. v. S.P.M, 2005 NLCA 36 (CanLII)), at para 7).This has already been done by making the sentence for the offense against Jane concurrent with the other sentences imposed where it would normally attract a consecutive sentence.But it also must be considered in the overall context of totality.[66]The total sentence of seven years would, if served consecutively with the Youth Court sentence, amount to a total of nine years of incarceration for the Offender’s sexual abuse of his half-siblings.Is the combined sentence unduly long or harsh in that it is not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the Offender?[67]In Hutchings, at para 84, Green CJNL set forth the following list of guidelines to be applied to achieve an appropriate and fit total sentence:•When sentencing for multiple offences, the sentencing judge should commence by identifying a proper sentence for each offence, applying proper sentencing principles.•The judge should then consider whether any of the individual sentences should be made consecutive or concurrent on the ground that they constitute a single criminal adventure, without consideration of the totality principle at this stage.•Whenever, following the determinations in the first two steps, the imposition of two or more sentences, to be served consecutively, is indicated, the application of the totality principle is potentially engaged. The sentencing judge must therefore turn his or her mind to its application.•The approach is to take one last look at the combined sentence to determine whether it is unduly long or harsh, in the sense that it is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.•In determining whether the combined sentence is unduly long or harsh and not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender, the sentencing court should, to the extent of their relevance in the particular circumstances of the case, take into account, and balance, the following factors:othe length of the combined sentence in relation to the normal level of sentence for the most serious of the individual offences involved;othe number and gravity of the offences involved;othe offender’s criminal record;othe impact of the combined sentence on the offender’sprospects for rehabilitation, in the sense that it may be harsh or crushing;osuch other factors as may be appropriate to consider to ensure that the combined sentence is proportionate to the gravity of the offences and the offender’s degree of responsibility.•Where the sentencing judge concludes, in light of the application of those factors identified in the previous step that are deemed to be relevant, that the combined sentence is unduly long or harsh and not proportionate to the gravity of the offences and the offender’s degree of responsibility, the judge should proceed to determine the extent to which the combined sentence should be reduced to achieve a proper totality.If, on the other hand, the judge concludes that the combined sentence is not unduly long or harsh, the sentence must stand.•Where the sentencing court determines that it is appropriate to reduce the combined sentence to achieve a proper totality, it should first attempt to adjust one or more of the sentences by making it or them concurrent with other sentences, but if that does not achieve the proper result, the court may in addition, or instead, reduce the length of an individual sentence below what it would otherwise have been.•In imposing individual sentences adjusted for totality, the judge should be careful to identify:othe sentences that are regarded as appropriate for each individual offence applying proper sentencing principles, without considerations of totality;othe degree to which sentences have been made concurrent on the basis that they constitute a single criminal adventure; andothe methodology employed to achieve the proper totality that is indicated, identifying which individual sentences are, for this purpose, to be made concurrent or to be otherwise reduced.•Finally, the sentencing judge should indicate whether one or more of the resulting sentences should be further reduced to reflect any credit for pre-trial custody and if so, by how much.[68]Here, the total sentence imposed, if served in addition to the current two-year Youth Court sentence, would be unduly long or harsh in that it would be disproportionate to the gravity of the offences and the Offender’s degree of responsibility.I arrive at this conclusion after considering:1)the sentence when taking into account the number of offenses and number of victims - numerous and grave offences against three vulnerable victims;2)the Offender’s record- lengthy, although to the extent that it does not arise out of the sexual abuse of his half-siblings, it is mostly dated and non-violent;3)the impact of the sentence on the Offender’s prospects for rehabilitation - although I have emphasized other sentencing factors more than rehabilitation, the Offender is a young man and will one day be released; the sentence imposed must provide him with a reasonable prospect of a fresh start; and4)other factors, including the Offender’s willingness during his incarceration to participate in programs designed for sex offenders.[69]These offences were reprehensible and took place over many years; the Offender bears a great degree of responsibility.Yet, the combined sentence would be nine years when the sentence for his most serious crimes for which he is now being sentenced has been determined to be five years.The Offender is a young man who will have a long life ahead of him when he is released and so a balance must be achieved.The sentence imposed must not signal that there is no hope for him.Nine years in prison is a long time; offenders convicted of manslaughter have been given shorter sentences.[70]After considering the foregoing, a fit and proper sentence is six years to be served consecutively to the sentence being served arising out of his most recent convictions in Youth Court (other than the sentence for the offence against Jane, which will be served concurrently for the reasons identified above).This will result in a combined sentence of eight years which is still a substantial sentence and adequately reflects the gravity of the offences and the degree of responsibility of the Offender.Eight years’ incarceration arising out of the convictions in the two courts is nevertheless neitherunduly long nor harsh; this is because the Youth Court sentence involved sexual abuse by the Offender against another half-sibling who was not the subject of the matters presently before me and in respect of which one would normally expect a consecutive sentence.[71]The two consecutive sentences that I have imposed are five years and two years, respectively.The latter cannot be made concurrent with the former to arrive at the six year sentence that I have determined is appropriate.Therefore, to arrive at a just sentence adjusted for totality, I reduce the sentence for Count No. 1 to four years’ incarceration.[72]I have previously determined not to grant the Offender any credit for his five days of pre-trial custody.[73]Crown counsel has asked that I make an order pursuant to s. 161(a) of the Criminal Code that for 20 years the Offender remain away from many public places where children could be expected to be found.As horrific as they are, the Offender’s crimes were confined to his family.A ban such as that suggested by the Crown would prevent the Offender from attending at events and facilities that he might legitimately attend.In my view, it is more important that the Offender be precluded from obtaining the opportunity to forge relationships with children that could lead to further abuses.Consequently, pursuant to s. 161(1)(b) and (c) and s. 161(2), it is ordered that the Offender, for a period of 10 years from when he is released from imprisonment in respect of Count No. 1:1)not seek, obtain or continue any employment, whether or not such employment is remunerated, or becoming a volunteer in a capacity, that involves being in a position of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 16 years; and2)not have any contact, including communicating by any means, with a person who is under the age of 16 years, unless the Offender does so under the supervision of an adult with no criminal record.[74]The Offender is subject to an order in Form 5.03 and must provide samples of bodily substances that are reasonably required for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis pursuant to s. 487.051(1) of the Criminal Code.[75]The Offender is subject to a 10 year Firearms Prohibition Order pursuant to s. 109(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.[76]The Offender is subject to an order in Form 52 pursuant to s. 490.012(1) of the Criminal Code in respect of the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, S.C. 2004, c. 10 for 20 years.DISPOSITION[77]The Offender is sentenced as follows:1)Count No. 1 – four years’ incarceration to be served consecutive to the sentence being served arising out of the Offender’s convictions in Youth Court;2)Count No. 6 – one month incarceration to be served concurrent to the sentence for Count No. 1;3)Count No. 7 – six months’ incarceration to be served concurrent to the sentence for Count No. 1;4)Count No. 8 – two years’ incarceration to be served consecutive to the sentence for Count No. 1;5)Count No. 11 – one year incarceration to be served concurrent to the sentence being served arising out of the Offender’s convictions in Youth Court and concurrent to the sentence for Count No. 1; and6)Together with the ancillary orders referred to above._____________________________ROBERT STACKJustice[1] Mike, Todd and Jane are not the victims’ real names.Their names have been changed to comply with the publication ban imposed by the Court.[2] Todd was not abused until he was sixteen years old, long after the Offender’s eighteenth birthday."}

The probation order was for twelve months, and included other conditions, including a prohibition from use, possession, or consumption of alcohol, and also a condition to refrain from contact or communication with Ms. Anstey.On November 17, 2004, I sentenced the Accused to a total of sixty days in jail for three breaches of court order , two being breaches of probation, and the other being a breach of undertaking.On March 3, 2005, I sentenced the Accused to a total of ninety days in jail for two breaches of probation. Because I was told that the Accused was then arranging counseling for substance abuse, which counseling was proposed to take place locally, the sentence of ninety days was allowed to be served on an intermittent basis, with the Accused going into custody at the Marystown police station on Friday nights, and being released on Sunday evenings.That was a little more than two weeks ago. This morning, the Accused pleaded guilty to a charge of breach of probation arising from last Monday night. Briefly, the police were called to go to Ms. Anstey’s residence, where they found the Accused. The Accused was holding a bottle of beer. When confronted by the police, the Accused ran out the back door of the apartment, and ran away. The subsequent foot chase was unsuccessful, but the Accused subsequently was arrested after reporting to the local police station to serve another weekend on the above mentioned intermittent sentence.Here it is to be noted that the Accused had served the weekend prior to these events in cells, was released Sunday evening, and was seen holding the bottle of beer Monday night, approximately twenty-five hours following his release from custody, and less than two weeks after being sentenced for an earlier breach of the same probation order.We heard evidence from Ms. Anstey this morning: as far as she is concerned, there is no reason to prohibit the Accused from going to her place, and, in fact, the two are in a romantic relationship. This, apparently, notwithstanding his conviction last summer for having been unlawfully in her dwelling place.The Crown points to a pattern, and says that the only way to break this pattern is to incarcerate the Accused for the new offence, and to convert the intermittent sentence to a period of straight time. The pattern as described by the Crown includes a history of the Accused getting drunk at Ms. Anstey’s place, the police being called, the Accused going to jail for breach of court order, and then, once released, repeating this type behavior all over again. At least superficially, there appears to be some merit to describing this behavior as a pattern.Counsel for the Accused concedes that the intermittent sentence, which was ordered to accommodate the Accused’s plan to seek and attend counseling for his substance abuse, has not achieved the intended result.However, says Counsel for the Accused, other than the drinking and the association with Ms. Anstey, both of which are prohibited by the probation order, no new or other substantive offence was committed by the Accused.When asked whether he had anything to say, the Accused said no.General deterrence appears to have eluded the Court, as breach of court order continues to be a persistent and significant part of our docket. My earlier decisions ofR. v. Kelly (2004), 2004 CanLII 18861 (NL PC), 233 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 108, R. v. Newport, [2004] N.J. No. 37, and R. v. J.R.B., [2004] N.J. No. 39 all refer to the problem seen in the local bailiwick in relation to disregard for court orders.In terms of the Accused specifically, he has a lengthy criminal record, including nine prior convictions for breach of probation, and five prior convictions for breach of undertaking or recognizance. This offence is his fifteenth conviction for breaching an order of the Court.Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code states that any sentence imposed must be \"proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\"Counsel for the Accused correctly reminded me of the principle of totality as a factor in tempering the total sentence. Because I am going to accede to the request to convert the remaining part of the existing intermittent sentence to straight time, pursuant to section 732(2) of the Code, the sentence for the new breach, which will be consecutive to the existing sentence, will be shorter than it might otherwise have been.Accordingly, the Accused is sentenced to four months in jail for the offence of breach of probation on March 14, 2005, which is to be served consecutive to the sentence presently outstanding. The balance of the outstanding sentence is to be served as straight time.The Accused will continue to be bound by the probation order: it will be up to the Accused to make application to vary any condition in the order once he is released from custody.Finally, the Accused is impecunious, and in receipt of social services benefits: it is therefore appropriate to waive the victim fine surcharge.Order accordingly.Dated at Grand Bank, NL, this 21st day of March, 2005.Porter, PCJCounselCrown N.SmithAccused M.Evans"}

(2d) 36 D.L.R. (4th) 294ONTARIOHIGH COURT OF JUSTICEEWASCHUK J.10TH JANUARY 1984.Constitutional law -- Charter of Rights -- Cruel and unusual treatment or punishment -- Whether Criminal Code provision providing for sentence of indeterminate detention where accused found to be dangerous offender constitutes cruel and unusual treatment or punishment -- Cr. Code, s. 688 -- Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, s. 12.Constitutional law -- Charter of Rights -- Fundamental justice -- Provisions of Criminal Code respecting dangerous offenders requiring court to consider expert evidence as to accused's future dangerousness -- Whether admission of such evidence violates guarantee to fundamental justice -- Whether dangerous offender provisions of Criminal Code unconstitutional -- Cr.

Code, ss. 688, 689 -- Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, s. 9.The provisions of the Criminal Code which provide that where an accused is found to be a dangerous offender the court may impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period do not violate the guarantees in ss. 7, 9 or 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. While it is an aspect of natural justice or procedural due process that evidence to be admissible must have some probative value, the fact that, on the application to have an accused declared a dangerous offender, evidence may be adduced from experts which is at times highly speculative as to future dangerousness does not violate s. 7 of the Charter. The scheme of the legislation is to provide in s. 695.1 of the Criminal Code that the accused's detention is to be reviewed after three years by the National Parole Board and thereafter every two years. The initial three years' detention before parole review is justified on the basis that the accused must be punished for the predicate offence as well as being detained because of the potential for dangerousness. At the three-year point, however, the Parole Board must consider new evidence as well as the evidence of the initial dangerous offender application in its determination whether the offender remains dangerous and should be detained. In that sense, the evidence respecting future dangerousness required to find a person a dangerous offender adduced at the initial application has probative value. Moreover, this review is properly carried out by the National Parole Board which has expertise in the area of parole. The procedures established are demonstrably justifiable procedures generally acceptable in a free and democratic society. It is not necessary that the review be carried out by a judge. Further, the indeterminacy aspect of dangerous offender legislation does not constitute cruel and unusual treatment in violation of s. 12 of the Charter. The imposition of the sentence of indeterminate detention according to the procedures set out in the Criminal Code is acceptable to a large segment of the Canadian population, and can be applied on a national basis in accordance with ascertained or ascertainable standards. The provisions have a social purpose, namely, the protection of society from dangerous offenders. The imposition of the sentence of indeterminate detention also accords with public standards of decency and propriety. In considering whether legislation accords with public standards of decency and propriety, the court should consider the average or normal dangerous offender application rather than the worst case against the Crown. Should such a case come before the court then the preferable practice would not be to invalidate otherwise valid legislation but rather to hold it inoperative in the particular case. Finally, such legislation is not degrading in the sense that it is cruel and unusual. The punishment is not grossly disproportionate to the crime and the offender's potential to harm others. It was highly persuasive that the Supreme Court of Canada has previously found that the predecessor legislation was not cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of the Canadian Bill of Rights. Finally, the dangerous offender provisions do not violate the guarantee against arbitrary detention or imprisonment in s. 9 of the Charter. In particular, the fact that the provisions give the court a residual discretion not to impose the sentence of indeterminate detention notwithstanding all the statutory criteria have been met does not lead to a violation of s. 9. The availability of this discretion does not give a court licence to be unprincipled and capricious. Rather, it recognizes that all dangerous offenders are not alike and where there is a probability of cure preventive detention may not be required.APPLICATION for a declaration that Part XXI of the Criminal Code relating to dangerous offenders is unconstitutional.

Evernden, for Attorney-General of Canada.EWASCHUK J.:-- The applicant, Miss Moore, having been dulyconvicted of a serious personal injury offence for which shemay be sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years or more andhaving been given proper notice that the Crown intends to applyto a court that she be found to be a dangerous offender, hereinapplies that Part XXI of the Criminal Code entitled \"DangerousOffenders\" be declared ultra vires as infringing variousprovisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.This motion has been argued on the basis that the court isnot entitled to consider the factual background to thisapplication. The following issues have been raised on behalf ofthe applicant as to why the dangerous offenders provisions ofthe Criminal Code infringe the Charter.(a) Indeterminacy of preventive detentionWhere a court concludes that the Crown has established beyonda reasonable doubt all the statutory requirements that theoffender is a dangerous offender, the court may, pursuant to s.688 of the Criminal Code, sentence the offender to anindeterminate period in a penitentiary. In effect, suchsentence is equivalent to a life sentence imposed, e.g., forbreak and entry of a dwelling-house pursuant to s. 306. Sincethe offender must, by definition, be convicted of a \"seriouspersonal injury offence\", the sentence is partly punitive butis mainly imposed for the protection of the public. In otherwords, the imprisoned offender is rendered incapacitated fromcommitting future crimes: see R. v. Higginbotham, [1961] 3 AllE.R. 616 at p. 619 (C.A.), re the purpose of preventivedetention.The applicant contends that detention is justified only by afinding of dangerousness. In the present case, it is allegedthat Miss Moore is a dangerous \"violent\" offender as opposed toa dangerous \"sexual\" offender. By reason of the statutorycriteria, the offender must at this time be considereddangerous. The applicant, however, contends that \"continuingdetention can only be justified by continuing dangerousness\"which cannot be validly predicted at the time of the initialfinding that the person is a dangerous offender.In my opinion this submission fails to consider the effect ofs. 695.1 of the Criminal Code. Admittedly the present opinionthat the offender is dangerous has limited future value but s.695.1 requires that the National Parole Board review theoffender's case three years from the day on which that personwas taken into custody and not later than every two yearsthereafter. This review requirement is obviously much earlierthan the 25-year requirement for someone convicted of firstdegree murder. On review of the history and presentcircumstances and condition of the dangerous offender, theParole Board pursuant to s. 10(1) of the Parole Act, R.S.C.1970, c. P-2, may then grant parole where it considers that (1)the inmate has derived the maximum benefit from imprisonment,(2) the reform and rehabilitation of the inmate will beaided by the grant of parole, and (3) the release of the inmateon parole would not constitute an undue risk to society.Where the dangerous offender has spent adequate time tosatisfy the predicate or underlying offence which triggered theapplication, it is obvious the predominate factor to beconsidered in releasing a dangerous offender on parole is thatperson's dangerousness, i.e., whether that person's release\"would not constitute an undue risk to society\". Thatdetermination cannot be made at this time but must be made on acase-by-case basis when the person is eligible for release andis, in fact, reviewed. If at that time the Board errsjurisdictionally, prerogative remedy will be the appropriaterecourse: see Re Mitchell and The Queen (1983), 1983 CanLII 1856 (ON SC), 42 O.R. (2d)481, 6 C.C.C. (3d) 193, 150 D.L.R. (3d) 449 (Ont. H.C.J.).I do not consider that such review must be conducted by ajudge. Instead it seems to me that the National Parole Boardhas a specialized expertise in the area of parole and althoughtheir procedure and method of review are not perfect, neitherare curial reviews. Moreover, the Charter does not demandperfection but only demonstrably justifiable proceduresgenerally acceptable in a free and democratic society. Reviewof prison inmates, including offenders held on preventivedetention, by a parole service is such an acceptable practice:see Rummel v. Estelle, Director, Texas Department ofCorrections (1980), 445 U.S. 263 (S.C.).(b) Discretion in imposition of sentenceSection 688 of the Criminal Code provides that after findingthat a person is a dangerous offender the court \"may thereuponimpose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for anindeterminate period\" (emphasis mine). Thus, s. 688 providesthe court with a discretion not to impose preventive detentioneven where all requirements have been satisfied.The above discretion has been considered in R. v. Carleton(1981), 1981 ABCA 220 (CanLII), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 1, 23 C.R. (3d) 129, [1981] 6 W.W.R.148 (Alta. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. granted April 5,1982, C.C.C. loc. cit., 36 A.R. 270n, 42 N.R. 269n. In thatpre-Charter case, it seems that the majority of the court heldthat s. 688 validly gives a court hearing a dangerous offenderapplication a residual discretion not to impose anindeterminate sentence where there exists a probability of theoffender's cure in the not-too-distant future. In my view, thatinterpretation is a valid gloss on and provides an appropriatejudicial criterion to s. 688.What is more, the applicant cannot validly complain of adiscretion that may enure to her benefit even though the courtmay be otherwise satisfied that she is a dangerous offender.(c) Violation of fundamental justiceThe applicant contends that s. 688(a) infringes s. 7 of theCharter on the basis that evidence as to future threat tosociety or dangerousness is so inherently speculative that itviolates the aspect of fundamental justice that evidence to beadmissible must have some probative (i.e., relevant or logical)value. It is undoubted that this constitutes a part of thebundle of procedural rights commonly known as \"natural justice\"or procedural fairness (also known as procedural due process):see R. v. Deputy Industrial Injuries Com'r, Ex p. Moore, [1965]1 Q.B. 456 at pp. 488-9.I accept the submission that the evidence of a psychiatrist,psychologist or criminologist is at times highly speculativeand in certain instances a lay person is in as good a positionto make a prediction as to future dangerousness. In the finalsay, the court, however, must be so satisfied and not theexpert witnesses. That is not to say that experts may notassist the court, especially as to whether the offendercurrently suffers from a psychological disorder, e.g.,psychopathy, which may be relevant to the likelihood of futuredangerous conduct.While conceding that the expert evidence may have someimmediate probative value, the applicant maintained that it haslimited future value and that past conduct may be a betterforecaster than expert evidence. Assuming that the aboveconcession is correct, it seems to me that s. 695.1 meets theapplicant's complaint. The initial three years' detentionbefore parole review is justified on the basis that theapplicant must be punished for the predicate offence as well asdetained because of the potential for dangerousness. At thethree-year point, however, the Parole Board must consider newevidence, e.g., fresh psychiatric assessments, as well as theevidence at the initial dangerous offender application, in itsdetermination whether the offender remains dangerous, i.e.,whether the inmate's release would not constitute an undue riskto society.In the above sense, I find that the evidence respectingfuture dangerousness required to find a person a dangerousoffender has probative value. Of course, the predictiveaccuracy of the requisite evidence does diminish in probativevalue with time. As time progresses, new evidence will probablybe required on a case-by-case basis by the Parole Board tojustify further detention of the offender.(d) Cruel and unusual punishmentThe applicant maintains that the indeterminacy aspect of adangerous offender finding constitutes cruel and unusualpunishment and thereby violates s. 12 of the Charter.I accept the applicant's submission that the phrase \"crueland unusual treatment or punishment\" should be interpreted as\"interacting expressions colouring each other ... to beconsidered together as a compendious expression of a norm''which must be given meaning in the context of contemporaryCanadian society: see Miller and Cockriell v. The Queen, 1976 CanLII 12 (SCC), [1977]2 S.C.R. 680 at p. 690, 31 C.C.C. (2d) 177 at p. 184, 70 D.L.R.(3d) 324 at p. 332 (S.C.C.), per Laskin C.J.C.In an attempt to analyse the above compendious norm, theapplicant offered the following criteria adopted from anarticle by W. S. Tarnopolsky (as he then was), \"Just Deserts orCruel and Unusual Treatment or Punishment? Where do we Look forGuidance?\" (1978), 10 Ottawa Law Rev. 1. First, is itacceptable to a large segment of the population? In response, Iam of the opinion that a large segment of the Canadian public,fully informed of the dangerous offenders provisions, wouldfavour this process. This is so, especially given the strictevidential requirements which must be satisfied before a personcan be found a dangerous offender.Secondly, can it be applied on a national basis in accordancewith ascertained or ascertainable standards? The specificity ofthe statutory requirements itself answers the above test.Thirdly, does it have some social purpose? The obvious answeris: the protection of society from dangerous offenders.Fourthly, does it accord with public standards of decency andpropriety or does it shock the general conscience so as to beintolerable in fundamental fairness? In response, it isdifficult to comprehend how the dangerous offender provisionsof the Criminal Code would shock the general conscience so asto be intolerable in fundamental fairness given all therequirements and safeguards written into the process. Not onlyis the dangerous offender eligible for parole long before alife offender, but he or she has greater rights of appeal.In deciding that the carefully crafted dangerous offenderprovisions accord with public standards of decency andpropriety, I gauge those provisions not on the \"worst casescenario\" to the Crown, but on what I consider to be an\"average\" or \"normal\" dangerous offender, and where all thestatutory conditions have been met. In assessing Charterapplications, it is generally socially unrealistic to consideronly the possible worst case where such case is not before thecourt. Indeed, it is only too easy for the creative legalimagination to concoct bizarre examples that never come tocourt. Where the worst case comes before the court, then thepreferable practice is not to invalidate otherwise validlegislation but to hold it inoperative in the particular case:see Re Mitchell and The Queen, supra, R. v. Noble (1983), 1983 CanLII 1727 (ON SC), 42O.R. (2d) 285, 6 C.C.C. (3d) 17, 150 D.L.R. (3d) 103, and byanalogy, R. v. Shelley, 1981 CanLII 201 (SCC), [1981] 2 S.C.R. 196, 59 C.C.C. (2d)292, 123 D.L.R. (3d) 748 (S.C.C.), a Bill of Rights judgment.This also is the general American approach in dealing withconstitutional challenges.Finally, the fifth test is whether the detention is degradingto human dignity. Obviously, all imprisonment is degrading tosome degree to human dignity. But it must also be cruel andunusual. Where an offender has been convicted of a seriouspersonal injury offence and otherwise comes within thestatutory conditions, it cannot be said that this form ofpreventive detention with possibility for parole constitutescruel and unusual punishment. In other words, the punishment isnot grossly disproportionate to the crime and the offender'spotential to harm others.In arriving at the above conclusion, I find support in thefollowing cases which have held that the present dangerousoffender provisions do not constitute cruel and unusualpunishment: see R. v. Simon (No. 3) (1982), 1982 CanLII 2979 (NWT SC), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 557,141 D.L.R. (3d) 380, [1982] 5 W.W.R. 728 (N.W.T.S.C.), and R.v. Morrison (July 7, 1983, Ont. Co. Ct., as yet unreported[summarized 10 W.C.B. 171]). I am also mindful that theUnited States Supreme Court in Rummel v. Estelle, supra, hasheld that a mandatory life sentence pursuant to a recidiviststatute (analogous to our former habitual criminal provisions)did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment where parolewas provided.In considering the compendious meaning of \"cruel and unusual\"I consider that no reference need be made to s. 1 of theCharter. Where the particular Charter provision contains itsown modifier, e.g., unreasonable, arbitrary or cruel andunusual, the provision is self-defined as to what constitutes areasonable limitation. For that reason, the onus is on theapplicant to establish the infringement, although the Crown mayin the particular case tactically have to justify thelimitation.Furthermore, in holding that the dangerous offenderprovisions do not constitute cruel and unusual treatment orpunishment, I am mindful that the Supreme Court of Canada in Exparte Matticks (1973), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 213n, [1973] S.C.R. visub nom. Pearson v. Lecorre, has held that the preventivedetention provisions for habitual criminals, far more Draconicthan the dangerous offenders provisions, did not violate theCanadian Bill of Rights, R.S.C. 1970, App. III. In consideringthe relevance of Matticks, supra, to the present application, Iprefer the approach of Esson J.A. in R. v. Whyte (December 20,1983 (B.C.C.A.), as yet unreported [summarized 11 W.C.B. 214]),that Supreme Court of Canada rulings on Bill of Rightsprovisions be considered persuasive if not binding on lowercourts interpreting similar provisions in the Charter. This isto be contrasted with the approach of Wetmore Co. Ct. J. in R.v. Smith (September 9, 1983 (B.C.Co.Ct.), as yet unreported[since reported 35 C.R. (3d) 256]), where he decided thatthe Charter, being a constitutional document, permits a freshlook at all Charter provisions, even those with Bill of Rightsanalogues which have been previously interpreted by the SupremeCourt of Canada.(e) Arbitrary detention of imprisonmentThe applicant submits that a dangerous offender findingconstitutes arbitrary detention or imprisonment within themeaning of s. 9 of the Charter since the relevant provisionslack appropriate legislative criteria or standards.In effect, this argument is simply a restatement of theearlier attack against the discretion afforded a court not tofind a person a dangerous offender even where all the statutoryconditions have been fulfilled. I adopt my earlier reasoningand reiterate that the legislative criteria for finding aperson a dangerous offender is perhaps the most detailed anddemanding in the Criminal Code. Furthermore, the residualdiscretion not to make the finding adds to rather thanderogates from that statutory criterion. Moreover, theavailability of this discretion does not give a court licenceto be unprincipled and capricious. Instead it recognizes thatnot all dangerous offenders are alike (see R. v. Gustavson(1982), 1982 CanLII 529 (BC SC), 1 C.C.C. (3d) 470 (B.C.S.C.)), and where there is aprobability of cure, preventive detention may not be required(see R. v. Carleton, supra). Therefore, I do not find thatthe dangerous offender provisions constitute arbitrarydetention or imprisonment.ConclusionFor the above reasons, Part XXI of the Criminal Code,\"Dangerous Offenders\" does not violate the Canadian Charterof Rights and Freedoms. Accordingly, the application isdismissed.Application dismissed."}

AND SECTION 110(1) OF THE Y.C.J.A.R E A S O N SF O RS E N T E N C EDEVLIN, J (ORALLY):This is the decision on sentence on the matter of D.P..On February 19th, 2008, D.P. pled guilty to three counts: one count of theft under $5,000.00, one count of possession of child pornography, one count of accessing child pornography.D.P. is before the Court today to be sentenced under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.The crown is proposing a 60 day secure custody sentence, followed by probation.The defense is proposing a non-custodial probationary sentence.The issue is what sentence is most appropriate.The facts regarding the theft charge are as follows.On May 7th, 2007, I think it was 2007, and I’m sorry, counsel?MR. GREENWAY:2007.THE COURT:Thank you.MR. GREENWAY:Thank you.THE COURT:D. selected two items from the Zellers store at the Oshawa Centre and concealed them.He then tried to leave without paying and was caught.The facts regarding the pornography charge are as follows.Between January 1st, 2006 and February 27th, 2007 both D.’s school and his mother noticed a significant change in his behaviour.D. became aggressive and assaultive.He repeatedly showed up at school stoned.On one occasion he brought marijuana to school.On another occasion he brought a cartoon to school which was entitled, “How the Vice Principal died.”During this time D.’s mother called the police because D. was caught accessing child pornography sites on the family computer.This computer was forensically examined by the police who found 184 images of child pornography.One image of child pornography was also found on D.’s sister’s computer.I turn now to the legal analysis.The purpose of sentencing under the Youth Criminal Justice Act is to hold a young person accountable through the imposition of just sanctions that have meaningful consequences.In determining the appropriate sentence the Court is required to consider all sanctions, other then custody, that are reasonable in the circumstances and ensure that the sentence is the least restrictive one capable of achieving the purposes of sentencing, under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, is the one that is most likely to rehabilitate the young person and integrate him into society, and is one that promotes a sense of responsibility in the young person and an acknowledgment of the harm done to the victim and the community.In addition, the Court is required to take into account the degree of participation of the young person in the commission of the offence, the harm done to the victim and whether it was intentional or reasonably foreseeable, any reparation made by the young person to the victim or the community, the previous findings of guilt of the young person and any other relevant, aggravating and mitigating circumstances related to the young person or the offence.I will now address the factors relating to the offence in this case and the offender, as well as the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.D.P. has pled guilty to a theft under charge and to possessing and accessing child pornography.The theft under charge is minor, particularly in comparison to D.’s other charges.As stated by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. EO, (2003), 2003 CanLII 2017 (ON CA), O.J. No. 563, “Possession of Child Pornography is a crime of enormous gravity both for the affected victims and for society as a whole.”In the case before me, the pornography involved 184 images of young children in sexual poses and/or engaging in sexual activity.A sample of 15 images was provided to the Court for review.Overall the sample images were graphic and disturbing.All of the children in the sample were female.Most were very young, approximately four to eight years old.One or two of the images appeared to be of very young girls, approximately two or three years old.One image was of an older girl, approximately 12 or 13 with a shaved pubic area.Almost all of the images were faceless with only the child’s torso, genital area and upper leg area showing.One image showed a young girl lying down on a bed on her back.She was naked.On her body, written in red paint or lipstick, were the words “Hurt me” and “Slut”.One image showed two girls engaging in cunnilingus.Some images showed penile penetration of the girls.Other images showed an adult penis placed at the opening of the child’s vagina.In the few photos that showed a child’s face, the children appear to be upset, scared, unhappy and uncomfortable.The child whose body had red writing on it looked scared and frozen as if she was devoid of all emotion.D.P. is a first time offender.He was 16 at the time he committed the offences, and is now 17 years old.He is currently doing well at the Durham Alternative Secondary School where he has attended since March/April 2007.Until recently he was also maintaining full time employment at Oshawa This Week.According to the pre-sentence report he is at times polite and very helpful and at other times angry and aggressive.His mother describes him as a dedicated and loyal worker who enjoys helping others.According to the section 34 assessment, D. suffers from chronic and severe emotional and inter-personal difficulties.The aggravating circumstances are as follows.The pornography charges involve 184 images of child pornography.D. has been assessed as a moderate risk to re-offend.D. has long-standing and unresolved emotional and inter-personal issues.The mitigating circumstances are as follows.D.P. has pled guilty.He is a first time offender.He is in school and has been working full time.The first issue is whether a custodial sentence is available under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.The crown submits that custody is an option pursuant to section 39(1)(d) of the Act.I note that this is the only section that could possibly apply to this case.The defense submits that custody is not an option.I agree with the defense.Section 39(1)(d) states, “A Youth Justice Court shall not commit a young person to custody unless in exceptional cases where the young person has committed an indictable offence, and the aggravating circumstances of the offence are such that the imposition of a non-custodial sentence would be inconsistent with the purpose and principles set out in section 38.”This section was reviewed by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. W, (2006), 2006 CanLII 1761 (ON CA), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 183.The Court held that section 39(1)(d) can only be invoked because of the circumstances of the offence, not the circumstances of the offender or the offender’s history.The Court also stated that exceptional cases are limited to the clearest of cases where a custodial disposition is obviously the only disposition that can be justified.In the case before me there are no circumstances of the offence that render it exceptional, nor was the crown able to articulate any basis for concluding that a custodial sentence is the only justifiable disposition.I therefore conclude that custody is not an available option in this case.I note that even if a custodial disposition were an available option I would not impose it in this case because such a sentence would be inconsistent with the recommendations of the section 34 assessment.The next issue is what sentence is appropriate.I have considered the facts of this case in the context of the sentencing principles set out in the Youth Criminal Justice Act.I conclude that the appropriate sentence is two years probation based on the following reasons.This is the maximum probationary sentence allowed under the Youth Criminal Justice Act.Such a sentence will provide D. with strict community supervision.The maximum probationary sentence will also ensure that D. receives the intensive therapy and counseling recommended by both the pre-sentence report and the section 34 assessment.DNA order declined."}

L’appel est accueilli et les peines d’emprisonnementavec sursis sont remplacées par une peine carcérale de 15 mois calculéeà partir du 21 novembre 2011, date à laquelle la peine initiale aété infligée, pour l’infraction décrite au par. 5(2) de la Loiréglementant certaines drogues et autres substances, et par des peinesconcurrentes d’un mois pour les autres infractions. Les ordonnances deprobation et les ordonnances accessoires demeurent inchangées.The judgment of the Court was delivered byQUIGG, J.A.I.Introduction[1]The Attorney General seeks leave to appeal concurrent conditional sentences imposed by a Provincial Court judge after Bernard Joseph Martin pled guilty to two separate indictable charges, one of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking (s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19) and the other for possession of a prohibited weapon (s. 91 of the Criminal Code).Mr. Martin pled not guilty to two additional indictable charges of possession for the purposes of trafficking (cannabis and cannabis resin), but, pursuant to s. 606(4) of the Criminal Code,pled guilty to the lesser included offences of possession of a controlled substance (s. 4(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act), which pleas were accepted. The sentencing judge imposed a conditional sentence of 22 months for the offence under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, concurrent terms of 12 months for those under s. 4(1) of the Act, and a concurrent term of 6 months for the offence under the Criminal Code.[2]For the reasons that follow, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, and vary the custodial portion of the sentences to a term of 15 months imprisonment for the s. 5(2) offence, and, because it will have no affect on the total, one month concurrent for the s. 4(1) offences and the Criminal Code offence.The probation orders and the various ancillary orders made in the Provincial Court remain unaffected.As stated in R. v. R.T.S., 2006 NBCA 65 (CanLII), 301 N.B.R. (2d) 338, at paras. 30 and 31, the custodial portion of the sentences takes effect from the date of the original sentence and the time served under the original conditional custodial sentence must be deducted from the balance of the sentence to be served in prison.II.Background[3]On March 11, 2010, members of the Fredericton Police Force Drug Crimes Unit set up surveillance in close proximity to Mr. Martin’s residence. As a result of an ongoing investigation, the Unit determined it had grounds to arrest Mr. Martin for various drug offences. At 1:05 a.m., a Detective advised other officers that Mr. Martin was in his truck on Main Street in Fredericton. Mr. Martin was subsequently stopped and was asked for his driver’s license, registration and insurance, all of which were provided. He was arrested, and a search of his truck revealed the following items were in his possession:➢various small Ziploc bags of hash (cannabis resin) totalling 4.12 grams (approximate street value of $61.80);➢7.01 grams of marihuana (approximate street value of $91.70);➢13 individual Ziploc baggies of cocaine totalling 5.75 grams,(approximate street value of $575);➢a cell phone;➢a pair of silver coloured brass knuckles; and➢$585 in Canadian bills.[4]Mr. Martin acknowledged the drugs were his and stated he had been “rounding them up” to give out to people who would be attending his brother’s birthday party the following week. He admitted he used marihuana, and that he had sold marihuana in the past, and explained that a friend made the brass knuckles for him. Mr. Martin was eventually charged and, as indicated above, pled guilty.A pre-sentence report was ordered.III.Sentencing[5]A sentencing hearing was held on November 21, 2011, at which counsel for Mr. Martin sought a conditional sentence while Crown counsel requested a sentence of 12-18 months imprisonment to be followed by probation.Crown counsel also sought various ancillary orders. The sentencing judge considered the pre-sentence report to be favourable and particularly noted that Mr. Martin was paying child support for three children and that he had worked hard to reduce various debts, including payment of approximately $13,000 of $15,000 in child support arrears. On the other hand, the judge found a previous conviction in 2003 to be an aggravating factor.[6]The judge imposed the following sentences:a)With respect to Count #1, 22 months imprisonment to be served concurrently to any other sentence and in the community pursuant to section 742.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada, a probation order for a period of 12 months and a victim fine surcharge of $100;b)With respect to Count #2, 12 months imprisonment to be served concurrently to any other sentence and in the community pursuant to section 742.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada, a probation order for a period of 12 months and a victim fine surcharge of $100;c)With respect to Count #3, 12 months imprisonment to be served concurrently to any other sentence and in the community pursuant to section 742.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada, a probation order for a period of 12 months and a victim fine surcharge of $100;d)With respect to Count #4, 6 months imprisonment to be served concurrently to any other sentence and in the community pursuant to section 742.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada, a probation order for a period of 12 months, a prohibition from possessing firearms for a period of 10 years pursuant to section 110 of the Criminal Code of Canada, a weapons forfeiture order pursuant to section 485 of the Criminal Code of Canada and a victim fine surcharge of $50.[App. Sub., pp. 4-5]IV.Issues raised on appeal[7]The Attorney General seeks leave to appeal on the grounds that the sentencing judge erred in law and in principle by:(1)Imposing a sentence that is manifestly inadequate and unreasonable having regard to all of the circumstances.(2)Failing to adequately consider the principles of sentencing as delineated in the Criminal Code.V.Standard of Review[8]In R. v. R.K.J. (1998), 1998 CanLII 12252 (NB CA), 207 N.B.R. (2d) 24, [1998] N.B.J. No. 483 (C.A.) (QL), Drapeau J.A. (as he then was) sets out the analytical framework that should be applied to the determination of applications for leave to appeal sentence:It is the undoubted duty of this Court to review the fitness of any sentence imposed. That it must do so bearing in mind the privileged position occupied by the trial judge is settled law. All agree that the sentencing process is hardly an exact science. It is a subjective process which features a large measure of discretion. The intrinsically discretionary nature of the sentence decision explains, at least in part, the Supreme Court's insistence on a deferential approach to all sentence reviews. See R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, and R. v. MacDonnell, 1997 CanLII 369 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 305.Nevertheless, deference has its limits, and this Court is duty bound to vary a sentence in appropriate circumstances. Indeed, if the sentencing court commits an error of law or an error in principle, or if the sentence imposed is clearly unreasonable, there is no longer room for deference and this court is required to impose the sentence which it considers fit. See R. v. F.S.A. (1996), 1996 CanLII 10270 (NB CA), 182 N.B.R. (2d) 20; 463 A.P.R. 20 (C.A.), and R. v. Melanson (E.R.) (1998), 1998 CanLII 12185 (NB CA), 199 N.B.R. (2d) 338; 510 A.P.R. 338 (C.A.).In this context, an error in law most commonly occurs as a result of a misapprehension of the evidence or a misapplication of judicial precedents. As for an error in principle, it typically involves one or more of the following: the application of wrong sentencing principles, a failure to consider relevant factors or the taking into account of irrelevant considerations. As well, there will be cases where the failure to give proper weight to each relevant circumstance will amount to an error in principle. (Our court will necessarily be slow to find an error of this nature for, if it was otherwise, professions of deference would soon ring hollow.) Finally, a sentence will be clearly unreasonable where it is either inordinately long or inordinately short. It will reach this level only if it is a substantial and marked departure from the sentence customarily imposed for similarly situated offenders committing similar crimes. [paras. 11-13]This standard of review has since been applied in numerous cases, the most recent being R. v. Frost, 2012 NBCA 94 (CanLII), which is being released concurrently with this decision.VI.Analysis[9]The appropriateness of a conditional sentence for a drug trafficking offence is dealt with in Frost. In brief, the principles of denunciation and general deterrence must take precedence in cases of trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking, and, absent exceptional circumstances, this Court has consistently emphasized these principles, in such cases, by imposing jail sentences.[10]In my view, this case does not reveal any “exceptional circumstances”.An accused’s child support obligation has been determined not to be an exceptional circumstance (see R. v. Bowlin, 2010 NBQB 59 (CanLII), 354 N.B.R. (2d) 144, aff’d 2010 NBCA 90 (CanLII), 366 N.B.R. (2d) 292, leave to appeal refused [2011] S.C.C.A. No. 95 (QL)).To the extent the sentencing judge considered this to be a mitigating factor, he erred.[11]For the reasons given in Frost, the conditional sentences imposed in this case are unreasonable in that they do not take into account the governing sentencing principles for cases of possession for the purposes of trafficking.In addition, this case reveals a need for specific deterrence considering that Mr. Martin has a previous conviction for an offence of possession for the purpose of trafficking and has previously served time in jail.[12]Considering the above, and considering the nature of the drug involved in the charge under s. 5(2), I am of the view that a fit sentence for that offence would have been 15 months in jail. I would therefore vary the sentence imposed for that offence to a term of 15 months imprisonment. As for the other offences, they may, absent the possession for the purpose of trafficking, have commanded much more lenient sentences.In the circumstances, because nothing will flow from these sentences, I would vary these to concurrent terms of one month in jail.I would not vary the probation and other orders.VII.Disposition[13]For these reasons, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and vary the conditional sentence to a terms of 15 months imprisonment in a provincial jail commencing November 21, 2011, the date the sentence was originally imposed. I would vary the other sentences to concurrent terms of one month in jail.I would note the effect of R.T.S. with respect to the calculation of the balance of any time Mr. Martin has left to serve. Finally, the probation orders and all other ancillary orders imposed by the sentencing judge are unaffected._______________________________KATHLEEN A.

Russell sitting at Fredericton, New Brunswick on the 5th day of September, A.D. 2002.APPEARANCES:Manu C. Patel, Q.C., for the Crown.Robert Carew, Esq., for the Accused.Copyright 2002Department of JusticeProvince of New BrunswickJUDGE’S COMMENTS ON SENTENCINGTHE COURT:Mr. Kuriya do you have anything to say before I sentence you?MR. KURIYA:Well, Your Honour, I’m very, very sorry for all the (inaudible).THE COURT:Thank you.You have been convicted, Mr. Kuriya, by me of one count of fraud under Section 380(1)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.You defrauded Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, ACOA, of some $840,699 in the manner set out in my judgment of July 5th, 2002.It is not necessary to completely review the facts because, unlike the situation in a jury trial, I have already done so in my judgment.It is sufficient to say that I found you masterminded a continuing scheme to defraud ACOA of a substantial sum.To achieve that, you told ACOA, via fake invoices and cheques, that you had purchased new or substantially new machinery for a Bathurst, New Brunswick manufacturing plant.In fact you bought used machinery or transferred machinery from your other operations.This scheme obviously involved considerable planning on your part over a protracted period of time as well as deceit on several fronts from the aforementioned cheques and invoices to the use of adummy financial agency.You harmed many people, particularly those who depended on the Plant’s success for their livelihood.In sentencing, I am required to take Section 718 of the Criminal Code into account.That section says:The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and the community.718.1 says:A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.I recognize, as well, that 718.2 says:(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; …I have had the benefit of receiving a Pre-Sentence Report, which I have read, and material supplied by both counsel.I am grateful for the manner in which the prosecution and defence presented their cases both at trial and here today.You have been throughout, Mr. Kuriya, ably represented.The material, in general, shows that you were highly regarded in the business community, in your local community, and by other professionals.You understandably or undoubtedly, rather, have had a stellar career in the textile industry.In part, however, it was this ability to gain people’s trust and your experience that enabled you to obtain the loan from ACOA.In using that word “trust” I am not implying or suggesting that you were in a position of trust as referred to in the Criminal Code.Your reputation and ability created an atmosphere conducive to accessing significant amounts of money.Your lawyer has suggested that I give you a conditional sentence.In R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] S.C.J. No. 6 the Supreme Court of Canada said that “The purpose of interpretation of Section 742.1(a) creates a two stage test.First, it must be determined that a penitentiary term is inappropriate; then it has to be considered if it is appropriate for the offender to serve his sentence in the community.”I do not consider a penitentiary term to be inappropriate.In Ruby on Sentencing, (4th Edition) page 619 the author says:The offenders sentenced for fraud and related offences under the Criminal Code are a very diverse group of people and may be first offenders or practised criminals from a variety of economic backgrounds.Offences in this area frequently involve fairly sophisticated degrees of pre-planning and for this reason exemplary sentences are seen to have some potential for deterrence in those cases where the offender is motivated by dispassionate greed.And I conclude on the evidence that that was the case here.The high rate of “white collar” crimes committed by persons of prior excellent reputation tends to blunt the otherwise mitigating effect of good background and many first offenders have received equally high sentences for sophisticated frauds.Here, it is evident the planning to defraud was in existence many months before you received cheques totaling almost a million dollars.Quite apart from the fact you defrauded what amounts to the Canadian taxpayer, you caused or contributed to the dashing of the employment hopes of many people in the Bathurst area.It is not necessary for me to detail the aggravating and mitigating factors which have been detailed this morning by Mr. Carew, and while I do not agree with all of them, he has substantially outlined them.In R. v. Basque, 1999 CanLII 9448 (NB CA), 211 N.B.R. (2d) 273 @ 292, which admittedly predated Proulx, Mr. Justice Drapeau said in dealing with conditional sentence:Section 742.1 of the Code embodies the conviction of the Parliament of Canada that a conditional sentence is a punishment that, in certain circumstances, could serve the best interests of society, and it has conferred significant discretion to the courts in imposing such sentences.This discretion should be exercised advisedly, ever mindful of the truism stated in R. v. Shropshire (M.) … that “there is a very significant difference between living behind bars and functioning within society while on a conditional release.”As a general rule, a conditional sentence is such a lenient punishment that imposing such a sentence for serious offences, both objectively and subjectively, cannot but undermine public trust in the administration of justice.More importantly, sooner or later, this sentencing provision will fall victim to its own misuse.In this regard, the remarks below, by the majority in Brady, … seem insightful to me and highlight another of the ill effects of indiscriminate use of this type of sentencing:And he quotes:“One of the basic purposes of sentencing is preserving respect for the law:s. 718.So we must avoid any approach undermining that respect.Inculcating respect for the law is highly apposite in Canada today.It is no less important today than when the Code was last re-enacted in 1953-54.Canada is a democracy, so the public will demand quick changes if this new sentencing regime does not work.The public will be even more upset if the regime is applied in an undiscriminating manner, or in situations where it is counterproductive.The resulting outcry would not help convicted persons, still less their rehabilitation.”In my view if I were to do anything but order incarceration, given the planning, the deviousness and the amount of money involved, respect for the law would be diminished.Here there is a need to denounce your conduct and to provide general deterrence.See R. v. Chow [2001], Alberta Judgments No. 998; R. v. Ryan, 217 N.B.R. (2d) 287; and R. v. Gray, 1995 CanLII 18 (ON CA), 76 O.A.C. 387.Given the dictates of Section 718 of the Criminal Code and the subsequent sections, the circumstances surrounding the crime, which I have already mentioned, I sentence you to serve a period of two years in a federal prison.There will be a recommendation that this be served in an institution in Eastern Ontario. In addition, you will be subject to a Restitution Order pursuant to Section 738 of the Criminal Code in the amount of $840,699 to Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.Pursuant to Section 741 this amount shall be paid to ACOA forthwith, failing which that organization may file the order as a judgment in any civil court in Canada.Notice of this order will be given to ACOA by the Clerk of this Court.That is my sentence.Is there anything else Mr. Patel?Mr. Carew?MR. CAREW:No.Could I ask that the materials be made exhibits on sentencing?THE COURT:Yes, I am going to do that.So the Pre-Sentence Report will be made an exhibit on sentencing, as well as Mr. Carew’s letter and the separate exhibits.I use his letter because he outlines his argument there.And the document attached to his letter, which will be one exhibit.Mr. Patel’s documents which were in a substantially looser form ―MR. PATEL:I’m sorry I didn’t bind them together.THE COURT:― will become another exhibit.Okay, so the three exhibits on sentencing.And that’s what you meant Mr. Carew?MR. CAREW:Yes.Thank you.(Exhibit No. 1 – Pre-Sentence Report)(Exhibit No. 2 – Letter and attached documents from Mr. Carew)Exhibit No. 3 – Documents from Mr. Patel on Sentencing)(Court adjourned @ 11:40 a.m.)"}

R.M.S.Date: 1990-02-13Docket: 1989 No. G.F. 106Between:Her Majesty the QueenandR.M.S.Woolridge, J.Counsel:Dan Peyton, for the Crown;Alan Carter, for R.M.S.[1]Woolridge, J. [orally]: Following trial the accused has been found guilty by a judge without a jury of two counts of incest and one count of gross indecency concerning his daughter, P., now age 17.[2]P. was born to the accused and his ex-wife in 1972, the eldest of four children. The family moved around a good deal and it was in Lloydminster, Alberta, that the accused commenced his sexual advances on his daughter who was then only seven years old. She can still vividly recall being called out of bed by her father and being taught how to masturbate him. Soon she was taught to perform oral sex on the accused and was called on frequently to do so.[3]At the age of 10 or 11, P. moved back to Buchans, Newfoundland, with her family. By this time, in addition to the foregoing sexual acts, P. was introduced to anal sex and sexual intercourse by her father. All of these sexual attacks by the accused continued until he was put in jail when P. was age 15. His incarceration terminated his sexual attacks on his daughter for a two-year period. However, during Christmas of 1988 the accused was given the benefit of a five-day release from jail. During his release he had sexual intercourse with P. Shortly thereafter P. made an attempt on her life and eventually these current charges were laid.[4]In all, P. was systematically and regularly sexually abused by the accused over a nine-year period. One reason for the length of the abuse was that two years ago P. ‘s younger sister, presently age 15, revealed that since the age of 11 she had also been sexually abused by the accused. The accused was charged with incest and pleaded guilty and was sentenced to one year in jail for this offence, but the younger sister was rejected by some of her family for reporting her father, as well as reporting her paternal grandfather, who was also charged with sexually abusing her. These charges were stayed due to the ill health of the grandfather. P. was unwilling to suffer the same rejection and so remained silent for as long as she did.[5]The sexual abuse directed at this helpless child has had a profound effect upon her. Her own mother describes her in testimony as an unhappy little girl with whom she fought a lot and whom she found hard to handle. She threw tantrums and lied a lot, unlike other children, and required frequent corporal punishment. She had frequent nightmares.[6]In hindsight, having gained an insight into child sexual abuse from her daughter’s counsellors and her own readings on abuse, the mother now feels that the abuse had much to do with the unusual behaviour exhibited by P. as she grew up.[7]Following the last attack of abuse by the accused during Christmas of 1988 at Buchans, P. became very depressed over the fact that at age 17, and after a two-year abuse-free period, she still remained the victim of unwanted sexual attention by her father. She attempted suicide with a drug overdose and spent two weeks in the psychiatric ward of the hospital in Grand Falls. She was then transferred to Emmanuel House at St. John’s, an institution that deals, among other things, with the counselling of victims of child sexual abuse in a safe therapeutic setting.[8]In an excellent, but depressing, victim impact study, social worker, Dianne Power Jeans reveals her opinion of the irreparable harm done to P. as a result of the sexual abuse by the accused over the nine-year period, and I quote from page eight of her report:“The impact of child sexual abuse on its victims has been shown to be devastating. The effects that the incestuous relationship has had on P. are profound.“We have seen may of P.’s symptoms and the impacts of incest, guilt, low esteem, depression, withdrawal, anger, fear, inability to trust, lack of self-confidence, drug abuse, P.’s feeling of personal powerlessness, and the abandonment of P. by her family.“The future for P. does not look bright. She lacks the esteem and confidence needed for self-motivation. She does not have any support from her family, friends, or community. Her inability to trust will be an obstacle to her therapeutic’ relationship, as well as personal relationships. The emotional impacts have the potential to be all-consuming.“P. is a very high risk for suicide. She has attempted in the past. She thinks about killing herself as ‘the only way’ to end the’ pain. P. is all alone, with no one she feels safe with to turn to. This possibility should not be underestimated.“Revealing a major trauma, such as incest, and venting feelings is just the beginning of the therapeutic process. P. is struggling with unresolved conflicts.“P. must externalize all the emotions she has kept bottled up. She must then place the responsibility for the incest with her father, where it belongs.“P. must learn that although significant damage has been done to her dignity and sense of self-worth, she does not have to be psychologically crippled for the rest of her life. She must be encouraged to invest the same energy she has been putting into self-destructive behaviour into self-fulfilling behaviour. This encouragement should not only come from her counsellor and friends, but from her family as well.“P. will likely spend many years in individual and group therapy trying to overcome the impact of the incest. She will, however, feel the effects for the rest of her life.”[9]I accept this report as reasonable and consistent with the evidence given both by P. before me, and her mother.[10]A presentence report is also helpful. In the opinion of adult probation officer Jeanette Maher, the accused, age 38, is a repeat offender who has been convicted of conspiracy to traffic and trafficking in narcotics in 1985, and eventually sentenced to six years imprisonment. In April of 1988, he was convicted of sexual assault against his daughter, S., the younger sister of P., and sentenced to a further one year. His release date is June 25, 1992.[11]His wife has now left him. He is a former drug abuser who rationalizes his criminal behaviour and has little awareness of the scope of the damage inflicted on his daughter by his sexual abuse and who shows little if any remorse for what he has done, making only a passing reference to it in his address to the court on sentence.[12]He has entered a program to address his obvious sexual deviance only after being denied day parole. His motives are questionable at best and it must be remembered that his last episode of sexual abuse of P. occurred while he was on an ill-advised Christmas release.[13]In my opinion the evidence is clear that the accused is without remorse for these repulsive sexual attacks on P., not to mention his other daughter S.[14]This finding is all the more offensive when we realize that throughout all of this behaviour the accused was acting in a position of trust as a parent.[15]The accused denies to Mrs. Maher any drug abuse problem, and regardless of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, including a guilty plea in the case of daughter S., exhibits no remorse for what he has done to his daughters. It is not surprising that Mrs. Maher concludes he is less than sincere and is not a suitable candidate for probation, even to the extent of continuing to offend while incarcerated.[16]In the face of such a history any considerations of reform of the offender must give way to considerations and protection of the public and general and specific deterrence of the accused.[17]Many cases have been cited to the court on the subject of sentence, and will appear in the Appendix to this judgment. The maximum sentence for this offence is 14 years. Normally one would not impose such a sentence without evidence of aggravating factors to justify such a conclusion. In this case the aggravating factors are as follows:1. The unenviable prior criminal record of the accused.2. The breach of position of trust as a parent.3. The accused is a repeat offender with respect to sexual assault on his daughter S.4. The last episode of incest occurred while the accused was in jail, but allowed out on a temporary Christmas absence, showing utter contempt for the well-being of his daughter, and of the law in general.5. The lack of remorse in the accused.6. Finally, the devastating impact on the victim, P. Her childhood has been destroyed, and her future is at best doubtful. The depth of her distress is best reflected in her suicide attempt and her uncertain future.[18]Under these circumstances the Crown seeks a sentence of eight to ten years. The defence admits the severity of the offences, but suggests this sentence is too severe, and that four to five years is adequate.[19]In my view this is a very serious offence, and the Crown is correct that a long period of incarceration is the only appropriate sentence that can be imposed because of the attitude of the accused. His continued denial of the offence, his lack of remorse, his behaviour while in jail, all mitigate against lenient sentence, and also show that probation is not a viable alternative. All that can be done under these circumstances, if the accused cannot, or will not show evidence of reform, is to instead make the best efforts one can to protect the public and deter the accused from any repetition of such revolting behaviour.[20]On the two incest charges the accused is sentenced to a total period of imprisonment of five years. On the gross indecency charge the accused is sentenced to a period of imprisonment of two years. A total of seven years in all. Both sentences to be served consecutively and consecutively to any term currently being served.[21]The ban on publication will remain in effect in order to protect the name of the victim in this case.AppendixList Of Authorities1.

Humphrey for the appellant)Appellant)))Heard:August 25, 2006On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice Donald J. Halikowski of the Ontario Court of Justice, dated October 17, 2005SHARPE J.A.:[1]The appellant pleaded guilty to criminal negligence causing death and was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment, two years probation, and a five-year driving prohibition.Before this court, she seeks leave to appeal the custodial portion of her sentence.She submits that the sentencing judge erred by failing to give adequate consideration to a conditional sentence and asks this court to allow the appeal and substitute a conditional sentence.Circumstances of the Offence[2]The deceased, Derek Cameron, aged fifteen, was a close friend of the appellant’s brother and a friend of the appellant.During the afternoon of March 23, 2005, the appellant made arrangements to pick up Derek Cameron in her four-door Dodge Neon and then to get cigarettes.Calem Clark was a passenger in the appellant’s vehicle.Derek was wearing roller blades.After picking up Derek and the cigarettes, the appellant returned to the residential street where Derek lived.The posted speed limit was 40 kilometres per hour.Derek got out of the car and asked the appellant to tow him down the street.Derek went to the driver’s side of the vehicle while it was slowly moving and interlocked arms with the appellant grabbing the pillar by the driver’s window with his left hand.The appellant drove down the street at approximately 50 kilometres per hour towing Derek at the side of her car.Derek eventually let go and continued down the road while the appellant made a U-turn.On the return trip on the same street but in the opposite direction, Derek grabbed the pillar with both hands because the appellant had bruised her arm during the first encounter.The appellant accelerated, rolled down the window and yelled out the speed she was reaching, eventually 80 kilometres per hour.Derek, apparently enjoying the thrill of the ride, yelled to the passenger: “Calem, look.”Derek then fell and was run over by the vehicle.He was taken immediately to the hospital where he was pronounced dead as a result of severe blunt force trauma to his head.[3]Derek’s tragic death has had a devastating impact upon his family and friends.He was bright, cheerful, and positive with a wide circle of friends and activities.The victim impact statements filed by his parents and the evidence they offered at the sentencing hearing provide moving and poignant testimony of the irreparable loss they have suffered.Circumstances of the Offender[4]The appellant was twenty years old at the time of the offence with an unblemished record.She and her family had been close friends with Derek and his family.A pre-sentence report provided a positive review of the appellant’s family background and developmental history.The appellant has a younger brother and had a happy and stable childhood, although there may have been some tension in her relationship with her father because of the long hours he worked.The appellant’s mother indicated that the appellant had a tendency to make poor judgment calls with her friends and that she would do anything to please her friends.The report from the appellant’s psychologist suggested that these past transgressions were within the range of normal adolescent behaviour and that any lack of judgment would improve with age and experience.The appellant had no other history of behavioural problems and took school and work seriously.She graduated from secondary school in 2004.At the time of sentencing she was enrolled in a two-year Human Services Counsellor program at Durham College.Since graduating from high school, she had consistently maintained employment.At the time of sentencing she was working part time as a customer service associate at Home Sense where she had received three awards for outstanding service.[5]In his reasons for sentence, the sentencing judge described the appellant in the following terms:Tonya Kutsukake by all accounts is a typical young Canadian female.Her pre-sentence report reveals her upbringing to have been stable.Her parents are hardworking individuals who have always tried their best to raise their two children while maintaining as comfortable a lifestyle as they could possibly do for them.…The accused is young, intelligent and presents a good future.She is presently in college and works part-time at a local retail store, the manager of which has assessed her performance as good to outstanding and speaks highly of her integrity and congeniality.Letters confirm her good character.Put succinctly there is simply no articulable reason why Tonya Kutsukake should find herself before this court facing this kind of charge and yet here she is.Her actions have devastated the lives of the Cameron family as shown in the victim impact statements of Derek Cameron’s mother and father.[6]The appellant took responsibility for her actions and pleaded guilty.Her psychologist’s report indicated that, as a result of Derek’s death, the appellant had shown signs of acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder and that she was experiencing strong feelings of guilt.The appellant expressed her remorse at the sentencing hearing.Moreover, the psychologist’s report, the pre-sentence report, and the arresting officer all indicated that the appellant was genuinely remorseful for her actions.The sentencing judge found that the effects of the appellant’s actions “have been brought home to her by various means” and that “[s]he has accepted responsibility for what she has done and this act was a singular act of recklessness – instantly regretted.”Reasons for Sentence[7]At the sentencing hearing, the appellant’s counsel submitted that a conditional sentence of imprisonment of two years less a day was appropriate.Crown counsel submitted that the court should consider a sentence of eighteen months imprisonment, followed by two years probation, and a five to seven year driving prohibition.[8]The sentencing judge gave relatively detailed reasons for the sentence he imposed.He found that the appellant “clearly knew the danger to which she was exposing this young man and for reasons that are only known to her, she recklessly chose not to maintain that level of danger but to increase it by travelling even faster on the second run.”On the other hand, the sentencing judge was satisfied that the accused “is not dishonest and she is not physically aggressive” and that “[s]he poses no danger to society in her day-to-day dealings”.The sentencing judge further concluded that the appellant “does not now and will not within the next two years pose a danger to the community.”[9]He found that the nature of the offence, the absence of alcohol, and the “young age of the accused” all militated against a penitentiary term.The sentencing judge determined, however, that the actions of the accused “must be sharply denounced to deter other like-minded people from following the same tragic route.”He added:The sentence must also acknowledge, in no uncertain terms, the effects that such a crime has on the victims.For not only has Derek Cameron lost his life, but his family, friends and society generally have been altered and redirected in such a fashion as to cause great emotional trauma and a sense of waste for opportunities that now have been lost.[10]The sentencing judge gave only the following reason for concluding that a conditional sentence was not appropriate: “this court finds that a conditional sentence will not satisfy the requirements for denunciation, deterrence and the recognition of the effects of this crime on the victims.”[11]While the appellant eventually was released on bail pending appeal, as of the date of the hearing, she had served forty-one days in custody.Analysis[12]It is well established that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge is to be accorded deference on appeal and that this court will not interfere unless the sentence is demonstrably unfit or the sentencing judge’s reasons reveal an error of law or an error in principle.[13]With respect, I have concluded that in the tragic circumstances of this case, the sentencing judge erred in principle: (1) by failing to consider seriously whether or not a conditional sentence could satisfy the needs of denunciation and general deterrence; and (2) by failing to give any weight to the established principle that when sentencing a youthful first offender the primary objective should be rehabilitation and specific deterrence.[14]I will deal first with the appropriateness of a conditional sentence to satisfy the needs of denunciation and general deterrence.On the findings of the sentencing judge, the statutory prerequisites for a conditional sentence are met in this case: (i) there is no minimum term of imprisonment, (ii) the appropriate sentence is of two years less a day or less, and (iii) the safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender serving her sentence in the community.[15]In the leading case of R. v. Proulx (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.), the Supreme Court of Canada directed that where the statutory criteria have been considered, “serious” consideration must be given to determine whether a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing.The Supreme Court of Canada held, at para. 114, that even in the presence of aggravating factors which might indicate the need for denunciation and deterrence, “a conditional sentence may provide sufficient denunciation and deterrence, even in cases in which restorative objectives are of diminished importance”.Writing for the court, Lamer C.J.C. added at para. 100:A conditional sentence can achieve both punitive and restorative objectives.To the extent that both punitive and restorative objectives can be achieved in a given case, a conditional sentence is likely a better sanction than incarceration.Where the need for punishment is particularly pressing, and there is little opportunity to achieve any restorative objectives, incarceration will likely be the more attractive sanction.However, even where restorative objectives cannot be readily satisfied, a conditional sentence will be preferable to incarceration in cases where a conditional sentence can achieve the objectives of denunciation and deterrence as effectively as incarceration.This follows from the principle of restraint in s. 718.2(d) and (e), which militates in favour of alternatives to incarceration where appropriate in the circumstances.[16]Lamer C.J.C. also stated, in para. 115, that “it would be a mistake to rule out the possibility of a conditional sentence ab initio simply because aggravating features are present.I repeat that each case must be considered individually.”The Supreme Court of Canada specifically stated, at para. 41, that a conditional sentence is capable of achieving the objectives of denunciation and deterrence, “particularly in circumstances where the offender is forced to take responsibility for his or her actions and make reparations to both the victim and the community, all the while living in the community under tight controls.”[17]The sentencing judge declared that denunciation and deterrence ruled out a conditional sentence but he failed to explain why.In my view, the sentencing judge made the very error identified by the Supreme Court, at para. 115, namely, he “rule[d] out the possibility of a conditional sentence ab initio simply because aggravating factors are present.”[18]I turn to the second point, namely the principle established by this court in R. v. Stein (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 376 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Priest (1996), 1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.), that the primary objectives in sentencing a youthful first offender are individual deterrence and rehabilitation.A sentence imposed on a youthful first offender should constitute the minimum necessary sanction that is adequate, community-based dispositions must be considered, and more serious forms of punishment imposed only where necessary.These principles have since been codified in ss. 718(c), 718.2(d) and 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code.While the sentencing judge took into account the appellant’s age in deciding that a lengthy penitentiary sentence was not called for, his reasons indicate that he did not give any weight to her age and unblemished record when considering whether to impose a conditional sentence.[19]In view of these errors, it is open to this court to impose what we deem to be an appropriate sentence.In s. 718 of the Criminal Code, Parliament directs us to consider the following objectives when imposing sentence:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.As already mentioned, the principle adopted in s. 718.2(d) is also applicable here: “an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances”.[20]In my view, the only purpose to be served by requiring the appellant to serve her sentence in an institution would be denunciation of the unlawful conduct.That factor does not, in the circumstances of this case, outweigh the other factors that point to a conditional sentence.Moreover, I am of the view that denunciation of the unlawful conduct can be achieved without the appellant returning to jail.She has seen the inside of a prison and has served forty-one days in custody.I am persuaded that an additional sentence to be served in the community under the conditions described below will serve as sufficient denunciation of her conduct, consistent with the principles established in Proulx, supra.[21]I am satisfied that a custodial sentence is not required for specific deterrence.The appellant has certainly learned her lesson and does not pose a risk of re-offending.[22]Turning to general deterrence, there is no doubt that the lethal risks posed by excessive speed and thrill seeking on the part of young drivers make this an important consideration in this case. We must do what we can to bring this message home.The appellant suggests that an appropriate term of a conditional sentence would be a requirement that she speak at schools and to young people about the dangers of thrill-seeking conduct of the kind in which she engaged and the devastation it can bring.In my view, that would have a much more powerful deterrent effect on other young people than having the appellant serve a further period of incarceration.[23]The appellant does not pose a risk of re-offending and it is not necessary, therefore, to separate her from society.Her rehabilitation would plainly be better served by a conditional sentence.With respect to reparation, no sentence we can impose could ever make up for the devastating loss of Derek Cameron.The promotion of a sense of responsibility would, in my view, be served by a sentence that requires the young person who caused his death to acknowledge publicly her wrongdoing through a form of community service that will warn others of the devastating consequences of participating in reckless thrill-seeking behaviour.[24]Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal against the sentence of twelve months imprisonment.In its place I would substitute a conditional sentence of eighteen months, taking into account the fact that the appellant has already served forty-one days in custody.The first nine months of the conditional sentence are to be served in the form of house arrest, the appellant being permitted to leave her house only as may be required for employment, school, medical or legal appointments, and religious observance, and between the hours of 9 a.m. and 12 noon on Saturdays to attend to personal shopping and other needs.The remaining nine months are to be served under the compulsory statutory conditions prescribed by s. 742.3(1).In addition, I would require the appellant to perform 240 hours of community service as directed by her probation officer and direct that, to the extent possible, a significant portion of that community service be in the form of speaking at schools or other like institutions about the dangers of her conduct.I would not interfere with the two years probation or with the five year driving prohibition.“Robert J.

[orally]: The Crown appeals from a sentence of eighteen months imposed on the respondent for armed robbery. The respondent who has a lengthy criminal record - including a previous conviction for armed robbery for which he received a sentence of two years less one day - has been unresponsive to the consideration and leniency extended to him on previous occasions. There is now no point in reminding him of his duty to society. We must do what we can to prevent him from harming others.[2]The predominant principles to be invoked in this case are deterrence (both specific and general) and protection of society. While the learned trial judge considered all the relevant principles of sentencing, we are all of the opinion that he placed insufficient emphasis on deterrence and the protection of society.[3]After taking into account the period of seven months on remand, we conclude that a fit sentence, in the circumstances of this case, would be a term of three years imprisonment in a Federal Penitentiary.[4]We allow the Crown appeal and increase the respondent’s sentence to a term of three years imprisonment in a Federal penitentiary.Appeal allowed."}

No. 2407Between:Her Majesty the QueenandJ.M.Hickman, C.J.T.D.Counsel:Rachel A. Huntsman, for the Crown;John Duggan, for the accused.[1]Hickman, C.J.T.D.: The accused, J.M., has pleaded guilty to three counts of indecent assault committed against three persons when they were in their pre or early teens. As a result of his guilty plea, J.M. stands convicted of one count of two separate acts of indecent assault against his sister-in-law, T.N., one count of indecent assault against his nephew, E.M., and one count of indecent assault against his brother-in-law, J.N.[2]The indecent assaults against E.M. by his uncle, the accused, J.M., commenced when E.M. was approximately 10 years of age. At that time E.M., his mother, M. (a sister of the accused) and E.M.’s siblings were living with the accused’s parents in St. John’s. They subsequently lived, for some months, in Portugal Cove, Newfoundland. The victim’s father was working in the Far East at the time, and for that reason E.M.’s mother moved to Newfoundland from the United States with her children to reside with her relatives during her husband’s absence. M. and her children lived with her parents in St. John’s for approximately two years and the accused also lived with them. The assaults against E.M. were perpetuated by the accused during the period they were all living in the same house in St. John’s.[3]E.M. was approximately 10 years of age when he, together with his mother and siblings, arrived in Newfoundland around 1966 and moved in with his grandparents and his uncle, J.M., in a house situate Carew Street, St. John’s. The indecent assaults committed by the accused against E.M. occurred approximately once or twice a week for approximately one year and each incident lasted for about 15 minutes. E.M. when testifying at the preliminary inquiry described the assaults as follows:-“He- I don’t know exactly how it got started but he would take me up to the third floor and he would, you know, he would take my clothes off, he would take his clothes off and basically for the most part he would have me lay down flat on my stomach and he would, you know, rub his penis in my butt until he ejaculated. Sometimes he would make me ejaculate him. I only remember it one time that he put his mouth on mine, only one time.”[4]On one occasion the accused performed fellatio upon E.M. On four or five occasions the accused had E.M. masturbate him.[5]The accused admonished E.M. not to tell anyone of these instances and suggested to E.M. that no one would believe him if he did make such disclosures. Eventually, E.M. told his mother who confronted her brother with these allegations. The accused denied any wrongdoing. E.M.’s mother was most distressed and upset over the allegations made by her son and because of his concern over his mother’s distress, E.M. later told her that nothing had really happened. It was not until E.M. reported the indecent assaults to his mother and she confronted her brother that the accused ceased his criminal acts against his nephew.[6]T.N., who now resides in Vancouver, British Columbia, was indecently assaulted by the accused, her brother-in-law, on two occasions. The first assault occurred when T.N. was between seven and nine years of age and took place at Curling Place, St. John’s, Newfoundland. At that time T.N. was visiting her sister and the accused, J.M., for a short holiday. T.N. was lying on the living room floor watching television. The accused came into the living room and as T.N. testified at the preliminary inquiry:-“He lay on my left side and reached with his left hand and started rubbing his fingers on my private area and I told him big girls like that maybe, you know, I don’t. Like, I couldn’t understand what he was doing it for. And he said, asked me if I was sure about that and I said, “Yes”. It was a very short incident, very short segment of time. And the door, someone was at the door and it was my sister, E. coming home, so he stopped, got up.”[7]The accused did not remove his clothes during this incident. He hand remained on top of T.N.’s nightdress causing it to “bunch up” between her legs. The incident lasted about two minutes and the accused stopped when T.N.’s sister E.N. returned to the home.[8]The second assault against T.N. was committed by the accused when she was 12 years of age and occurred at [name of place omitted], Newfoundland. The accused, who had been living in Alberta at the time, had returned to Newfoundland for a visit. T.N. testified at the preliminary inquiry that the following occurred:-“A.I was in the back yard. I was feeding the chickens some green grass stalks and he came up in the back yard and asked me to scratch his back, which I didn’t think anything big. You know, I scratch my brother’s back all the time, and stuff, too. And I said, ‘Sure;. And I scratched his back and made, you know, small conversation about chickens, and stuff. And then someone called out that it was sup-pertime, so we all, you know, we went down for supper. There was six or seven of us there. We ate. My parents went to Bingo that night, as they most, they often did. My brother L., and L. were out.A.So after everybody had left I went up to use the washroom and when I came out of the washroom my brother, L.’s room, where J.M. was, was to the right of the door and he asked me to scratch his back. So I thought, sure. He went in and lay down on the bed sort of, you know, on his stomach but up on one arm. And I scratched his back and he said that was sort of good and then he grabbed me and he pulled my arms up till I slip up alongside of him and was wedged and then he rolled over on top of me.Q.Okay. So were you on your back at that point, when he rolled over on top of you?A.Yes I was.Q.Alright. Go ahead.A.I was aware of, you know, the sun was starting to fade into the horizon because the way shadows were on the wall there was dust floating around in there. I guess I was starting to go a little numb. I was upset. And he started to kiss me and it tasted like cigarettes and booze, beer - I don’t know what the hell he had been drinking.Q.Kiss you where?A.On the lips. And I started to cry and (indiscernible) stop him and he pulled up my shirt and started to suck at my nipples. I was still crying and he sort of asked me what’s wrong, and his tone sounded a little angry, and I was scared. So I said, ‘My dog died a couple of weeks ago so I’m a little upset’, figuring that might, I don’t know, make him stop, because I was upset - but he didn’t. He told me he could make me feel better and he sort of sat me up but kept one arm sort of on his hand just to - It wasn’t like a really tight grip, but it was firm enough. And he unzipped his pants and pulled out his penis. He was erect and he said, ‘Suck it’. I said, ‘No’. And he kept pushing my head towards it and I kept crying and said, ‘No’. And he, -I looked at him and he was smiling like. I felt totally useless.Q.What do you mean, he was smiling like what?A.Smiling like a -- sick. So this when [sic] on for awhile. I resisted. I closed my eyes sometimes, because I didn’t want to look at it.Q.What went on for awhile?A.This pushing.Q.Yeah. Trying to make you, -A.Yeah - get a little closer.THE COURT: The record will note that the witness gestured by pushing the back of her own head with her hand.A.And after that I, we heard - I heard the door slam downstairs and you could hear voices and I knew, you know, the tones, it was my brothers. And he started pushing me away and I went through the door and he told me that, you know, ‘It’s your fault. It’s our little secret. I won’t tell if you won’t.’A.My two brothers came in and he sort of pushed me away.Q.He pushed you away. What do you mean?A.Yeah, sort of this -- You know, not like a had [sic] push or anything but just sort of like let me go, because I was always trying to sort of get away. And he told me at the door that it was, you know, my fault; it was our secret; you don’t tell, I won’t tell, no one will have to know - like it was my fault.Q.Yeah. So what did you do then?A.I went downstairs and I was crying, still crying. And J. and G., you know, being like brothers - What’s wrong with you? And I said - Jake just died a couple of weeks ago. That was the dog. And I told them that so I wouldn’t have to tell.”[9]It is significant, that once again, the accused admonished his young sister-in-law to keep the incidents a secret and attempted to place the blame for his criminal act upon T.N.[10]The third complainant, J.N., grew up in [name of place omitted], Newfoundland. He is the brother-in-law of the accused. On one occasion when J.N. was between the age of 11 and 12, he visited St. John’s and was staying at Valleyview Apartments with his older sister E.N. and the accused (her spouse at the time). J.N. slept in the apartment on a pullout daybed. He awoke during the night to find the accused on top of him and the accused was masturbating J.N. His hands were beneath J.N.’s underwear. J.N. told the accused to get off him which he did. Following the incident, the accused told J.N. not to tell his sister. J.N. disclosed the assault a few years later to both his sister E.N. and his parents but his parents advised him to say nothing about it. J.N. was upset over this incident. He does not know how long the accused was on top of him before he awoke but he estimates that he was on top of him for a couple of minutes after he awakened.[11]The accused testified at the sentence hearing. He is 55 years of age. The accused is permanently resident in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories where he has resided for the past eight years. The accused is employed as a salesman with Johnson’s Building Supplies Limited, Yellowknife with whom he has worked since September 1990. His employer has confirmed by letter dated December 10, 1997 and admitted in evidence by consent that J.M. is an excellent employee who “gets along well with staff members and customers. Should the occasion arise, we will hold his position for four months”. The accused and his wife live in rented accommodation in a building owned by his employer. His gross annual salary is $45,000.00.[12]The accused married E.N. in 1968 and there were two children of the marriage who are now 29 and 27 years of age. J.M. and E.N. separated in 1979 and were subsequently divorced. The accused has not maintained any significant contact with the two children of that marriage. Approximately 17 years ago, the accused married his present wife, E., who had been divorced and at that time had three children from a previous marriage, namely two boys, one four years of age and the other 11 and a daughter who was nine years old at that time. In a written statement dated December 29, 1997, and admitted in evidence by consent, E. wrote that the accused assumed the role of father to her three children and was and still is a very caring husband.and caring father to her three children. The three stepchildren, now in their twenties, no longer live at home with the accused and his wife. E. is employed as an attendant at an addiction treatment centre in Yellowknife and her net income is $800.00 every two weeks.[13]The accused testified that he began consuming alcohol at age 10 and has been an alcoholic since he was 12 years of age. He quit school at age 14. J.M. has been a member of Alcoholic Anonymous for the past 18 years and while he has participated on a continuing basis in the programs of that organization, he did suffer some relapses from time to time. He has been alcohol free for the last three years. The accused does not suggest that his problems with alcohol, at the time he committed the crimes of which he stands convicted, constitute a valid excuse for his conduct but suggests same may constitute an explanation for his deviant behaviour.[14]I am satisfied from the evidence of the accused and the several reports of professionals and others in Yellowknife, filed by consent, that J.M. is making a valiant attempt to rehabilitate himself and to continue his recovery from alcoholism. The accused, at one period in his life, had a problem with gambling and again he is dealing with that addiction through appropriate treatment. The accused has completed treatment at the Hay River Treatment Centre in the Northwest Territories and is continuing treatment for his. addictions with the Northern Addictions Centre. Doctor R.W. Wheeler, a psychriatist, with the Northern Addictions Services, wrote as follows concerning J.M.:-“29/12/97To Whom it May ConcernRe: J.M.I’ve known J.M. for several years professionally. He has made a sustained and consistent effort to bring his addictions under control. He attends self help recovery groups and a clinical aftercare group. He has been of good character and has an honest desire to make amends for his past behaviours. He will continue to do these recovery activities after his trial.R.W. Wheeler M.D. (Signed)”[15]Gerald J. Brown of Northern Addiction Services, Yellowknife, by letter dated December 8, 1997, summarized the treatment and progress made by the accused as fol-lows:-“I have been seeing J.M. for the past three years as his counsellor and spiritual director. Over that period of time J.M. is attending A.A. meetings and is till dealing with compulsive behaviours; ie., gambling, alcohol.“J.M. is quiet upset and very angry with himself for his past actions. He wished that at this time in his life that he could make amends for his past. My sense is that J.M. is contrite and would like to continue treatment for his addictions, ie. Alcohol, gambling, and even though he is not aware that past behaviour with inappropriate sexual encounters could be considered sexual addiction is willing to participate in a treatment program. Homewood in Guelph, Ontario have just such a program. J.M. is in very good standing with the City of Yellowknife, and with the Parish of St. Patrick’s Church. Both he and his wife attend church regulary.“Mr. Duggen if you should have any other questions concerning J.M. please do not hesitate to call.Respectfully,Gerald J. Brown (Signed)Mr. Gerald J. Brown”[16]J.M. stated that he is prepared to participate in a treatment program offered by Homewood situate Guelph, Ontario which program is referred to in the report of Northern Addictions Services.[17]The Alcoholics Anonymous organization in Yellowknife confirmed that the accused is a frequent attender at meetings and that he has “now embarked on a new life of sobriety and responsibility”. In addition to participating in the advance program of that organization, the accused is involved almost every evening and on weekends in helping others who are participating in the AA program.[18]T.N. has filed an impact statement which is very compelling and satisfies me that the effect of the accused’s criminal acts toward her have been very traumatic and permanently debilitating. She commenced her statement as follows:-“To write this statement about how I have been affected, by what happened to as a child, is to say the least: difficult. Reliving the feelings of shame, fear, mistrust, anger and thoughts of suicide all seem like a bad dream.“As a child, I felt loved, secure and protected. Everything was magical as only they can be for a child. I was doing quite well in school and had many friends, who I thought highly of. All in all, a normal life.”[19]In her impact statement, T.N. says that as a result of the assaults committed upon her by the accused, she has lost her self-worth, her attitude toward men has been seriously affected and she developed an unsatisfactory relationship with her late parents which continues to trouble her. Her education was adversely affected and she did not complete high school. In describing the effect, T.N. stated:-“I started smoking marijuana shortly after the second incident. I was 12.1 did not get high the first few times, but then one night I did. The euphoria created by the drug would calm and numb me. I stopped studying anything related to school. My grades went from A’s to C’s, D’s to F’s. I knew that my good grades made my parents able to brag to their friends, so I thought what would that do for me. And the answer was nothing. I no longer wanted to be a success. So, I smoked marijuana for 20 years.”[20]T.N. summarized the effects of the impact of her being assaulted by the accused as follows: -“Everything culminated for me in the summer of my 31st year. After living this way for close to twenty horrible years of subsistence, I was tired of it. A friend of mine, D., who was molested by her stepfather as a child, gave me a pamphlet. I phoned and made an appointment at this counselling center. You go in for a pre-interview. Then you have to wait for eight weeks before you get started. I had already planned my suicide you see, so if I did not like what happened in the pre-interview session, I was going to take my life the next day.”[21]She concludes her statement as follows“The regrets I have about all this, that I will indeed carry to my grave are: I did not have much time to reconnect with my parents in a loving manner. I did not tell them over the years how I loved them, even though I was desperate to. They were elderly and sick. I managed to tell them both as they lay dying. My father was unable to communicate because of his advanced Parkinson’s Disease. He was twisting the sheets in his hands as I was leaving. That picture always makes me cry. He died October 17, 1996. My mother and I would talk every week on Sundays, making up for lost time. She joined my father on August 1, 1997 - 30 days before the preliminary hearing.“As for financially, who knows potentially what I could have done with my life. I could become a doctor, a star on a Broadway stage, a missionary doing wonderful deeds of humanitarianism, or just a loving wife or mother. Presently, I am about to embark on going to school. I hope to have a viable talent that will allow me to make up for lost time and feel fulfilled. As for children, even though my husband would love to be a father, I will not bring one into the world. I am scared of what is out there. I fear they would grow up like I did and I would not wish that for my worst enemy.”[22]Impact statements were not filed by or on behalf of the other victims. However, failure to file an impact statement by a victim of sexual assault, is not a mitigating factor. In R. v. C.B.B. (1994), 1994 CanLII 9763 (NL CA), 114 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 178; 356 A.P.R. 178, in the sentencing process, the Newfoundland Court of Appeal said at p. 180:-“Another point which must be made is that while direct evidence of victim impact may constitute an aggravating factor in sentencing an offender, the absence of such evidence is never a mitigating factor. I am unsure however whether the trial judge considered it so here.”[23]I have no difficulty in concluding that the impact of the accused’s criminal acts towards his nephew, E.M., which occurred on a frequent basis over a period of approximately one year when the victim was 10 years of age must have had a traumatic effect upon him which was undoubtedly aggravated by the understandable distress caused to his mother when she was appraised of the deviant behaviour of her brother.[24]Counsel for the Crown submitted that sentences totalling three years is appropriate to the culpability of the accused as they relate to the sexual assaults. Counsel for the accused, on the other hand, suggested that the total sentence should be in the range between 12 to 18 months. If it was determined that a sentence of less than two years is appropriate, counsel for the accused would then ask that such sentence be conditional. For reasons to follow I am of the view that the facts of this case do not warrant a conditional sentence.[25]This case involves sexual assaults against three young persons. The nature of the assaults and the extent of same varies from one victim to the other. The assaults committed move from the lower end of the scale in the case of the assault against J.N. to the higher end of the scale in the case of E.M.[26]It is appropriate to deal with the assaults against each victim separately and to impose appropriate sentences on each count bearing in mind the totality principle and ensuring that while the sentence for each offence should be appropriate that a proper totality should be achieved.[27]Count No. 2 reads:-“THAT J.M. between the 26th day of February, A.D., 1971, and the 26th day of February, A.D., 1977, at or near [name of place omitted] and St. John’s in the Province of Newfoundland, did indecently assault T.N., a female person, contrary to sections 141 and 149 of the Criminal Code.”[28]At the time the first offence particularized in Count No. 2 was committed, the victim was between seven and nine years of age. While the assault was of short duration and minimum force was used, the act of the accused was intrusive and clearly traumatic from the victim’s point of view.[29]In perpetrating the second sexual assault particularized in Count No. 2, when the same victim, T.N., was 12 years of age, the accused used an unacceptable amount of force and the nature of his assault against the victim was most reprehensible. There was a clear attempt by the accused to force T.N. to participate in deviant sexual acts and such acts places that assault toward the higher end of the scale. It is clear from the testimony of T.N. that her brother-in-law, the accused, tried to take advantage of her youthful innocence by suggesting to her that the activity he was attempting to engage in would make her feel better and then when halting his criminal acts because of the arrival of other persons, he tried to throw the blame upon his unsuspecting victim.[30]The impact statement filed by T.N. describes very graphically the suffering she has endured since she was subjected to these acts of criminality by her brother-in-law which has had a very deleterious effect upon her existence and has prevented her from living a normal life.[31]Count No. 3 reads:-“THAT J.M. between the 01st of January, A.D., 1971, and the 08th day of July, A.D., 1973, at or near St. John’s, in the Province ofNewfoundland, being a male person, did indecently assault J.N., a male person, contrary to section 156 of the Criminal Code.”[32]The amount of physical force used by the accused in performing his indecent assault upon J.N. was minimal. The lack of force does not necessarily take away the seriousness of the intrusive act of sexual assault but rather force when used should be regarded as an aggravating factor rather than treating a lack of same as a mitigating element. It must be kept in mind that in cases of sexual assault against young persons that even if there is absence of physical force the psychological force inflicted upon the innocent victim must of necessity be a very compelling factor in determining an appropriate sentence. The fact that J.N. was of a very tender age when victimized by the accused leads to the irresistible conclusion that such experience must have left an unsavory but lasting impression upon him.[33]Count No. 5 reads:-“THAT J.M. between the 26th day of May, A.D., 1965, and the 26th day of May, A.D., 1967, at or near St. John’s, in the Province ofNewfoundland, being a male person, did indecently assasult E.M., a male person, contrary to section 148 of the Criminal Code.”[34]The acts committed against E.M. when he was between the age of 10 and 11 were on a continuing basis and over a period of one year. While there is no evidence of excessive force being used, the fact that acts of simulated anal intercourse occurred once or twice a week over a period of one year, that on one occasion the accused performed fellatio upon E.M. and on four or five occasions had E.M. masturbate him places these assaults in a very serious category.[35]In reviewing the totality of the criminal activity of the accused as they relate to the three victims, I conclude that a position of family trust existed in relation to all three victims and that the accused took advantage of such position of trust to force himself upon his unsuspecting victims. It ill behooves one who has destroyed the innocence of young children to ask this Court to place undue emphasis upon the lack of force used in the commission of such nefarious crimes.[36]In arriving at appropriate sentences in this case, it is my view that the principle of general deterrence must play a very significant role. The predominent consideration when imposing a sentence upon a person found guility of sexually assaulting young persons is that it must be made clear to the offender and to the public that courts will not tolerate such offensive activity and will continue to send a message that society abhors such acts and that young victims of same will receive the protection of the court insofar as such protection can be afforded under the principle of general deterrence. The Court of Appeal of Newfoundland in R. v. J.N.O. (1993), 1993 CanLII 7746 (NL CA), 103 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 256; 326 A.P.R. 256, articulated the principle of general deterrent in cases of sexual assault against children at p. 259 as follows:-“The idea that the principal purpose of the criminal process, including imposition of sentence, is the protection of society -- protection of the public -- is doubtlessly correct, but it is a notion that is not too helpful until circumscribed and explained in the light of a particular case. It soon becomes clear that sentences in child sexual abuse cases are directed towards the protection of children, often females, ordinarily too innocent and vulnerable to protect themselves. In R. v. W.B.J.; R. v. M.P. (1992), 1992 CanLII 2761 (AB CA), 127 A.R. 65; 20 W.A.C. 65, 73 C.C.C. (3d) 530, the Alberta Court of Appeal discussed in some detail sentence principles and appropriate sentences in child sexual abuse cases. In its conclusions commencing at p. 549 the court stated in part:‘Sentencing of an accused person (it will usually be a man, so we will speak of a man) for major sexual assault on a child will be based mainly on the principles of general deterrence (the hope that the sentence will deter other persons from engaging in such acts) and denunciation (the sentence expresses the community’s condemnation of such conduct and society’s need to reinforce the simple principle that it will not tolerate abuse of power and breach of trust by a person vis-à-vis a child). On a lesser scale the sentence to be imposed will express the court’s hope that the sentence will teach the accused himself not to engage in similar unusual acts again, a hope that will often be slender because sexual abuse of children may be the outward expression of an accused’s severe emotional difficulties. Finally, the court may by its sentence provide an opportunity to rehabilitate the accused, but this possibility will often not be regarded as significant, nor will it be of paramount concern in view of the inadequacy of institutional therapy and the negative impact upon the accused of his being segregated from the general prison population for his own protection, resulting in his undergoing a daily institutional regime with little or no access to exercise or to vocational and educational programs’.”[37]In arriving at the sentences which I consider appropriate in this case, I take into account the efforts the accused has made to rehabilitate himself and I am satisfied that he will continue such worthwhile endeavours. In that regard it is the interest of society that custodial persons put in place a program designed to ensure that the accused does not deviate from his desirable goal of successful rehabilitation. The accused has satisfied me that he is remorseful for his criminal acts against the three victims. The accused’s behaviour since the commission of the crimes indicates that he is not likely to reoffend. The first offence was committed by the accused approximately 31 years ago and the last occurred 21 years ago. The accused does not have a criminal record and his plea of guilty spared his victims the trauma of having to testify once again at trial.[38]For the reasons given, the following sentences are imposed(1) In respect of Count No. 2 - imprisonment for a period of six months;(2) In respect of Count No. 3 - imprisonment for a period of one month to be served consecutive to the term of imprisonment imposed on Count No. 2; and(3) In respect of Count No. 5 - imprisonment for a period of two years to be served consecutive to the terms of imprisonment imposed on Counts No. 2 and 3.[39]In the aggregate the accused will serve a total of 31 months imprisonment for his crimes against the three complainants.[40]It is my view that the custodial authorities should make arrangements to transfer the accused from Her Majesty’s Penitentiary in St. John’s or any custodial facility in which the accused is incarcerated to a custodial facility in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, as a matter of urgency. I am also of the view that custodial authorities at all levels, including the National Parole Board,should take into account the rehabilitation programs in which the accused is presently engaged in Yellowknife and ensure that necessary arrangements, within the law, are made to have the accused continue to fully participate in such programs. It is my view, as well, that should the appropriate correctional authorities conclude it is in the best interests of the accused and necessary for his continuing rehabilitation that he attend Homewood Institution in Guelph, Ontario, that with the consent of the accused, arrangements be made at the appropriate time, as determined by the correctional authorities, to have the accused attend at such institution. I direct that a copy of my decision and a transcript of the accused’s evidence be sent to the appropriate correctional authorities. Accused sentenced."}

Campbell:Ruling on Bail Revocation MotionOverview[1]The jury recently returned its verdict in this case, finding the accused, Winston Ellis, guilty on all three counts of the indictment against him.More particularly, the jury found the accused guilty of the following: (1) the possession of a .25 calibre semi-automatic firearm, without being the holder of a licence under which he may lawfully possess it, contrary to s. 91(1) of the Criminal Code; (2) being the occupant of a motor vehicle in which he knew that there was a firearm, and for which no occupant of the vehicle was the holder of a permit under which he may lawfully possess the firearm in the vehicle, contrary to s. 94(1) of the Criminal Code; and (3) the possession a loaded prohibited firearm while not the holder of an authorization, licence or registration certificate under which he may lawfully possess the firearm, contrary to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code.[2]All of these offences flowed from the events that took place in Toronto in the early morning hours of May 24, 2010.Essentially, after drawing the attention of the police to his vehicle by racing with another vehicle, the accused tried to evade investigation and arrest by quickly driving through a residential neighbourhood and then abandoning his vehicle in a stranger’s driveway.Eventually, after the accused was arrested, his vehicle was searched and the police found a .25 calibre semi-automatic firearm inside the vehicle.The firearm was fully loaded with the six bullet magazine in the handle and another bullet in the firing chamber.[3]The firearm uncovered by the police was stored neatly inside a hollow space beneath the faux wood panel that surrounded the manual gear shift lever between the front seats.The firearm had clearly been stored in this hidden location by the accused, who was the only driver of the vehicle.No one unfamiliar with the fittings of the vehicle could realistically have been aware of this compartment.While hidden in this unusual location, the firearm was stored in such a way that made it easily and quickly accessible to the accused from the driver’s seat of the vehicle.[4]Prior to the guilty verdicts by the jury, the accused had been at large on a judicial interim release order for some time and had been abiding by the terms of that order.The Crown now seeks the revocation of that order, arguing that the accused should be detained in custody pending the imposition of sentence.According to s. 523(1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, chap. C-46, the current recognizance concerning the accused continues in force, subject to its terms, until the imposition of sentence, unless, at the time the accused is determined to be guilty, the court “orders that the accused be taken into custody pending such sentence.”Immediately after the jury’s verdict, the Crown sought to “show cause” why an order should be made detaining the accused in custody until he is sentenced, and a short hearing was thereafter conducted.The Statutory Grounds for Detention[5]In order to determine this question, I am obliged to consider whether the Crown has met its legal burden of showing cause that the accused should be detained according to the governing statutory criteria outlined in s. 515(10) of the Code.This section provides:For the purposes of this section, the detention of an accused in custody is justified only on one or more of the following grounds:(a)where the detention is necessary to ensure his or her attendance in court in order to be dealt with according to law;(b)where the detention is necessary for the protection or safety of the public, including any victim of or witness to the offence, or any person under the age of 18 years, having regard to all the circumstances including any substantial likelihood that the accused will, if released from custody, commit a criminal offence or interfere with the administration of justice; and(c)if the detention is necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of justice, having regard to all the circumstances, including;(i)the apparent strength of the prosecution’s case,(ii)the gravity of the offence,(iii)the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence, including whether a firearm was used, and(iv)the fact that the accused is liable, on conviction, for a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment or, in the case of an offence that involves, or whose subject-matter is, a firearm, a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of three years or more.The Positions of the Parties[6]The Crown contends that all three grounds in s. 515(10) justify the immediate detention of the accused.In this regard, the Crown relies upon the details of the criminal record possessed by the accused, the gravity of the firearms offences committed by the accused, the reality that these are not the first firearms offences committed by the accused, the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment to which the accused is now subject, and the fact that the accused still has other outstanding charges and arrest warrants.[7]Mr. Adler, on behalf of the accused, argues that the detention of Mr. Ellis is not justified on any of these grounds and that, accordingly, his current judicial interim release order should continue in effect.Defence counsel contends that while the accused no longer enjoys the presumption of innocence in connection with these offences, his conviction for these firearms offences should not result in his automatic detention pending sentence.Mr. Adler contends that his client has demonstrated his ability to attend court whenever required, has significant family roots in the community, poses no present danger to the public, and should remain at large until the imposition of sentence.The Background of the Accused/Offender[8]The accused is now 32 years of age.He lives in Toronto with his wife and three children.There is no evidence as to the nature, if any, of his employment.[9]The accused has a criminal record.More specifically, over a decade ago, in November of 2002, Mr. Ellis was convicted of the following crimes: (1) possession of a loaded prohibited firearm; (2) possession of a firearm knowing it’s serial number had been defaced; (3) possession of a weapon (a firearm) for a purpose dangerous to the public peace; (4) possession of cocaine; and (5) failing to attend court.After serving approximately seven-and-a-half months in pretrial custody, the accused was sentenced to a global term of five months imprisonment and a three year term of probation for these offences.An order was also made prohibiting him from the possession of any firearm, cross-bow, restricted weapon, ammunition and explosive substance for life.[10]The accused also has unexecuted, outstanding warrants for his arrest, from the Windsor area, in relation to drug offences allegedly committed in March of 2004, and for allegedly failing to attend court in March of 2005.[11]The Crown also led some evidence on the show cause hearing that suggested that the accused might have had previous gang affiliations and had been stopped and investigated by the police on a number of other occasions.Only one of these other investigations resulted in criminal charges against the accused, in relation to an alleged incident of violence and gunfire in September of 2004.However, this matter was ultimately resolved by Mr. Ellis entering into a peace bond.In my view, this evidence, which appears to have been led to cast an adverse light on the general character of the accused and the quality of the company he occasionally keeps, is entitled to little, if any, weight.Analysis1.Introduction[12]Having carefully considered the submissions of the parties, I am driven to the conclusion that the Crown has, indeed, shown cause why the accused should be detained in custody pending the imposition of sentence.More particularly, I am satisfied that the detention of the accused pending sentence is required by the “tertiary” ground outlined in s. 515(10)(c) of the Code, as the immediate detention of the accused is necessary in order to maintain confidence in the administration of justice, having regard to the following considerations.2.The Guilty Verdict of the Jury[13]It is no longer necessary to address the likelihood of conviction or try to accurately assess the “apparent strength of the prosecution’s case” against the accused under s. 515(10)(c)(i) of the Code.The trial proceedings are over and the accused has already been found guilty of the alleged firearms offences by the jury.As a result of the unanimous verdict of the jury, the accused is no longer presumed innocent.Instead, there is simply an enforceable finding of guilt.As the Court of Appeal for Ontario observed in R. v. Farinacci (1993), 1993 CanLII 3385 (ON CA), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 32, at p. 37:… the presumption of innocence is spent by the verdict, be it a conviction or an acquittal.A conviction does not create a presumption of guilt.It constitutes a legal, conclusive finding of guilt.Like an acquittal, it is enforceable unless and until reversed.After a conviction, there is no presumption left, one way or the other.There is an enforceable finding of guilt.3.The Gravity of the Firearms Offences Generally[14]While the offences committed by the accused did not involve any actual violence against others, these firearms offences are, nevertheless, very serious crimes.The sheer gravity of these crimes is properly considered under s. 515(10)(c)(ii) of the Criminal Code.[15]There is no gainsaying the current reality that the possession of illegal firearms is one of the most serious problems facing large urban centers in Ontario and elsewhere.Such firearms have unfortunately produced a host of tragic results in and around Toronto in particular.The human cost of such offences is often immeasurable.Well-informed, fair-minded, reasonable members of our community can only be increasingly concerned about the ongoing commission of such offences, and must have their rapt attention focused on the treatment of such offenders by the courts.Their confidence in the administration of justice must be maintained.See: R. v. Danvers (2005), 2005 CanLII 30044 (ON CA), 199 C.C.C. (3d) 490 (Ont.C.A.) at para. 77; R. v. Whervin, [2006] O.J. No. 443 (S.C.J.) at para. 14; R. v. David, [2006] O.J. No. 3833 (S.C.J.).[16]This is not meant to suggest that the courts should pander to public opinion.Indeed, in his text, The Law of Bail in Canada (3rd ed., Loose-leaf), Mr. Justice Trotter and the authorities he helpfully discusses, at § 3.4(b), observe that courts must not “react to public clamour or hysteria” or the “visceral and negative reaction to crime and criminals” that is sometimes displayed.The courts must, rather, serve as a model of “serene, impartial and exemplary justice.”See also: R. v. Lamonte (1990), 1990 CanLII 3479 (QC CA), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 530 (Que.C.A.) at p. 542.Accordingly, when considering the need to “maintain confidence in the administration of justice,” as obliged by s. 515(10)(c) of the Code, courts must concentrate on how the administration of justice would be perceived by a reasonable, fair-minded and well-informed member of the public, who is fully knowledgeable about the facts of the case and the applicable legal and constitutional principles.See also: R. v. Hall, 2002 SCC 64 (CanLII), [2002] 3 S.C.R. 309, at para. 41; R. v. Valente, 1985 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 673, at p. 689; R. v. MacDougal (1999), 1999 BCCA 509 (CanLII), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 38 (B.C.C.A.) at p. 48; R. v. Mordue (2006), 2006 CanLII 31720 (ON CA), 223 C.C.C. (3d) 407 (Ont.C.A.) at para. 27; R. v. Nguyen (1997), 1997 CanLII 10835 (BC CA), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 269 (B.C.C.A.) at para. 18; R. v. D.(R.) (2010), 2010 ONCA 899 (CanLII), 106 O.R. (3d) 755 (C.A.) at para. 55; R. v. Gale, 2011 ONCA 144 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 6410 (C.A.) at para. 25.4.The Particular Circumstances of These Offences[17]In the present case, the accused took the necessary steps to store a fully loaded semi-automatic handgun in a secret compartment inside his motor vehicle.There is no evidence as to why he elected to so arm himself.There was certainly no lawful justification or laudable purpose that would have permitted him to do so.[18]Moreover, the particular manner in which this loaded firearm was stored reveals that the accused wanted to ensure that this firearm was always at the ready, and could be quickly and easily accessed in its hidden compartment whenever circumstances requiring the use of the firearm might present themselves.[19]The secret storage of a loaded firearm, in a motor vehicle being driven by the accused on the city streets of Toronto, created a very real and significant risk to public safety.While the evidence did not disclose that the accused ever actually “used” the firearm, there is no denying that it was always ready to be used.These circumstances of the crimes committed by the accused must be taken into account pursuant to s. 515(10)(c)(iii) of the Criminal Code.5.Mandatory Minimum Term of Imprisonment[20]According to s. 515(10)(c)(iv) of the Code, the court must take into account whether the accused is liable, on conviction, to a “potentially lengthy term of imprisonment” or, in the case of a firearms offence, “a minimum punishment of imprisonment” for three years or more.[21]The parties do not agree as to the potential sentence the accused now faces as a result of his conviction for these crimes.The Crown contends that, as this is the “second” series of firearms offences committed by the accused, and because the accused has been duly served with notice that an increased punishment would be sought, the accused is liable to be sentenced to at least the mandatory statutory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment, as required by s. 95(2)(ii) of the Criminal Code.On the other hand, the accused contends that, as a result of the lengthy period of time that has passed between the first and the second series of firearms offences committed by the accused, the applicable statutory mandatory minimum sentence is only three years imprisonment.[22]In addition, the accused has indicated that he proposes to challenge the constitutional validity of this statutory three year mandatory minimum period of imprisonment.See, for example: R. v. Charles (2010), 2010 ONSC 5437 (CanLII), 262 C.C.C. (3d) 120 (Ont.S.C.J.); R. v. Elliston, 2010 ONSC 6492 (CanLII); R. v. Nur (2011), 2011 ONSC 4874 (CanLII), 275 C.C.C. (3d) 330 (Ont.S.C.J.); R. v. Smickle (2012), 2012 ONSC 602 (CanLII), 280 C.C.C. (3d) 365 (Ont.S.C.J.).[23]The resolution of those controversial issues will have to await the sentencing proceedings in this case.However, at this point in time, and without pre-judging any of these or any other potential sentencing issues in this case, it is accurate to observe that the accused currently faces “a minimum punishment of imprisonment” for a term of three years or more.6.Repeat Offender – Violated Prohibition Order[24]Significantly, the accused has previous convictions for similar firearms offences, has already served a significant jail term in relation to those offences, and has been prohibited – for life – from ever possessing such a firearm again.In short, the particular circumstances of these offences display that the accused, now a repeat offender, committed serious firearms offences while prohibited from doing so.According to the opening language of s. 515(10)(c) of the Code, the court must have regard not only to the specifically enumerated statutory factors, but to “all the circumstances” of the case.See: R. v. D.(R.), at para. 54; R. v. Andersen, 2012 ONSC 6358 (CanLII), at para. 29.The personal antecedents of the offender are certainly one of the circumstances of this case that must be considered.7.Conclusion[25]In summary, I am satisfied that, having regard to all of these various circumstances, against the entire factual backdrop of this case, the immediate detention of the accused prior to the imposition of sentence is necessary to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice.In my view, fair-minded, reasonable members of the community, fully informed of all of the relevant circumstances of this case and the applicable legal and constitutional principles, and thinking about the issues rationally and dispassionately, would seriously question the due administration of our judicial interim release system if the accused were permitted to remain at large in the community pending the imposition of sentence.As McLachlin C.J.C. stated in R. v. Hall, at para. 27, “[p]ublic confidence is essential to the proper functioning of the bail system and the justice system as a whole.”See also: R. v. Mordue.[26]I appreciate that the governing judicial authorities suggest that, at least in the pre-trial context where an accused fully enjoys the presumption of innocence, the detention of an accused based upon the “tertiary ground” in s. 515(10)(c) of the Code should be “used sparingly” and be a “relatively rare” occurrence.See, for example: R. v. B.(A.) (2006), 2006 CanLII 2765 (ON SC), 204 C.C.C. (3d) 490 (Ont.S.C.J.); R. v. LaFramboise (2005), 2005 CanLII 63758 (ON CA), 203 C.C.C. (3d) 492 (Ont.C.A.); R. v. D.(R.), at para. 51-53; R. v. Andersen, at para. 25.In the present case, however, the accused has been convicted by a jury of his peers and all of the statutory considerations outlined in s. 515(10)(c) of the Code are clearly evident.When these statutory considerations are properly and fairly assessed in light of all of the various factual circumstances of this case, this case requires the immediate detention of the accused pending the imposition of sentence in order to properly maintain confidence in the administration of criminal justice.See: R. v. Mordue; R. v. S.(B.) (2007), 2007 ONCA 560 (CanLII), 255 C.C.C. (3d) 571 (Ont.C.A.).[27]In light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider whether or not the Crown has also shown cause justifying the detention of the accused under any of the other statutory grounds for detention outlined in s. 515(10) of the Code.Conclusion[28]In the result, given that the Crown has met its burden and has shown cause justifying the immediate detention of the accused, I order, pursuant to s. 523(1)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code, that the current judicial interim release order be vacated and, in its place, shall issue an order detaining the accused in custody pending the imposition of sentence.___________________________Kenneth L.

The offender, who was 38 years old at the time, sexually abused his seven to nine year old adopted daughter. He did so several times over a two year period. In consequence, she was emotionally traumatized, left in need of professional help, and sent to live elsewhere.[2]At the sentencing hearing, the Attorney General asked for a term of incarceration of nine to eighteen months, stressing the gravity of the offence, the sentencing objectives of deterrence and denunciation, and the frequency with which such offenders are required to serve their sentences in jail rather than in the community. Counsel for the offender asked for a conditional sentence to be served in the community, emphasizing the man’s personal circumstances, including his remorse, employment history, emotional stress, and so on. The sentencing judge, moved by the man’s personal circumstances and satisfied a term of incarceration was unnecessary, imposed a conditional sentence of twenty three months.[3]The Attorney General then applied to this Court, asking for leave to appeal and, if granted, for judgment setting aside the conditional sentence and imposing in its place a term of incarceration of at least nine months. In the submission of the Attorney General, to whom we granted leave to appeal, the sentencing judge failed: (i) to properly consider the sentencing objectives of deterrence and denunciation; (ii) to give effect to the gravity of the offence and moral culpability of the offender; and (iii) to heed the principle that like offenders should be given like sentences.[4]The conditional sentence imposed by the sentencing judge rests upon an order he made on the authority of section 742.1 of the Criminal Code. The making of this order constitutes the primary issue—the length of the term is secondary—and the issue is whether he misapplied this section. Whether he did so falls to be determined in light of the standard of review adopted in R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, and of the sentencing provisions of sections 718 to 718.2 of the Code. The import of these provisions was considered at length in R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, so the principles underlying the question are well settled and need little elaboration. Such difficulty as these provisions continue to pose—and this is especially true of section 742.1—has principally to do with their application.[5]In this instance, Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff and I are convinced the sentencing judge misapplied section 742.1. The section reads thus:742.1 Imposing of conditional sentence—Where a person is convicted of an offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, andthe court(a) imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years, and(b) is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2,the court may, for the purposes of supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions of a conditional sentence order made under 742.3.[6]Before making an order under this section allowing the offender to serve his sentence in the community, the judge had to be satisfied, as required by clause (b), that this would not endanger the safety of the community. This is a condition precedent to the making of such an order, not a primary reason for doing so, a distinction that tended to be overlooked judging from the reasons for judgment. But that said, the judge was satisfied, and on ample evidence, that the offender posed no danger should he be allowed to serve his sentence in the community. There can be no quarrelling with that assessment.[7]The judge had also to be satisfied, as required by clause (b), that allowing the sentence to be served in the community would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing as set out in section 718 to 718.2 of the Code. It is these which, in our respectful opinion, the sentencing judge misapplied.[8]Section 718 identifies the fundamental purpose of sentencing: To contribute to respect for the law and to the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society by the imposition of “just sanctions” having one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce lawful conduct;(b) to separate offenders form society, where necessary;(c) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims and the community;(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and society.[9]With an eye to this section and the circumstances of the case, the judge identified the paramount objectives as deterrence and denunciation, saying he was satisfied the offender was not in need of rehabilitation. Having regard for what he had to say of deterrence, however, it is doubtful he gave it much weight. He seems to have regarded this as a rather discredited notion, largely devoid of utility. During argument he asked counsel for the Attorney General if the Crown had any statistical evidence demonstrating the validity of this notion and, when told deterrence seemed intuitively to work, he said: “Well I can tell you it hasn’t worked for centuries because we still have a lot of crime don’t we?”[10]With the greatest of respect, such personal views of deterrence have no place in sentencing. Indeed, if they find their way into the exercise by judges of their discretionary power to allow a sentence to be served in the community, which seems to be the case here, they will vitiate the exercise of that discretionary power. We are not here concerned with specific deterrence, which is irrelevant in the circumstances, but of general deterrence. The concept of general deterrence, which is aimed at discouraging potential offenders, has been much studied, has tended to draw cautious to sceptical academic assessment, and has waxed and waned in the hands of judges. Common sense has sustained the concept, courts have repeatedly invoked it in relation to sex offences, and Parliament has endorsed it. Only recently, in the context of adopting the present provisions of the Criminal Code regarding sentencing, Parliament expressed its confidence in the concept and its efficacy, requiring judges to have regard for deterrence as a legitimate objective of sentencing. So judges must, as a matter of law, accept and give effect to the notion of general deterrence as Parliament intended: R. v. Johnson(D.K) (1996), 1996 CanLII 3148 (BC CA), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at 235 (B.C.C.A.).[11]Experience suggests a measure of caution and selectivity and balance in giving effect to the notion, particularly when choosing between a conditional sentence and incarceration, a point made in R. v. Proulx, cited earlier. Experience also suggests that general deterrence and denunciation play a significant role in relation to sex offences, even those placed along the lower end of the scale of gravity. The authorities in support of this point are many, especially out of this Court, but it might be well to go further afield to support the point, and so we refer to R. v. R.A.R., 2000 SCC 8 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 163; R. v. R.N.S., 2000 SCC 7 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 149; and R. v. L.F.W., 2000 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 132.[12]In the first of these cases the Supreme Court of Canada set aside a conditional sentence as unfit in a case involving the sexual assault of a young woman. The assault consisted of the offender ordering the young woman to lie down in a stable and then removing her panties and inserting his finger in her vagina. In setting aside the sentence on behalf of the majority of the Court—and restoring a one-year term of incarceration—Madam Justice L’Heureux-Dubé relied in significant measure upon general deterrence and denunciation, invoking the following notion drawn from R. v. Proulx:[114]Where punitive objectives such as denunciation and deterrence are particularly pressing, such as cases in which there are aggravating circumstances, incarceration will generally be the preferable sanction. This may be so notwithstanding the fact that restorative goals might be achieved by a conditional sentence.[13]The second of these cases concerned the sexual abuse of a girl between the ages of 5 and 8 by her grandfather. He fondled her vagina on numerous occasions and on two or three occasions paid her to touch his penis. He was sentenced initially to a nine-month term of incarceration, which was converted on appeal to a conditional sentence. The Supreme Court of Canada set aside the conditional sentence and restored the term of incarceration for the reason, among others, that the conditional sentence did not serve to sufficiently denounce the offence.[14]In the third of these cases the Supreme Court of Canada was evenly split on the fitness of a conditional sentence pertaining to a sex offence. Half the judges expressed reservations but favoured upholding the sentence on application of the standard of review. The other half favoured setting it aside notwithstanding the constraints of the standard of review. The case involved several incidents of forced masturbation and fellatio of a boy of 12 who suffered emotional trauma in consequence. Madam Justice L’Heureux-Dubé, who spoke for those who would have set aside the conditional sentence, held it to be unfit on the footings it did not answer adequately to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence, nor give adequate effect to the fundamental principle of sentencing.[15]The point of the reference to these cases is that the sentencing judge in the present case was bound, when determining whether a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose of sentencing as required by section 742.1, to have regard for the objectives of both general deterrence and denunciation, and bound to accord sufficient weight to each. Considered in light of the circumstances of the case, and in conjunction with the fundamental and other principles of sentencing, we are satisfied he failed to do so. He expressly made too light of general deterrence, and impliedly attached too little weight to denunciation.[16]This was an incidental failing, in the sense it followed upon the sentencingjudge’s misapprehension of the case relative to section 742.1(b) and its requirementthat a conditional sentence be consistent with the fundamental principle of sentencing. It is here, particularly, where Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff and I locate the error of the judge and find the unfitness of the sentence. The fundamental principle of sentencing is this:718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree ofresponsibility of the offender.This has two elements to it: The gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender. Both may be seen to work against the imposition of a conditional sentence in this case.[17]Let us first consider the gravity of the offence. By any standard, what this man did to this child constitutes a grave crime. The Criminal Code calls it “sexual interference”, according to section 151, which is defined as touching the body of a person under the age of fourteen years for a sexual purpose. Obviously, this encompasses a wide range of conduct. Depending on the particular conduct, the offence is treated as either a summary conviction or an indictable offence. In this instance it was treated as an indictable offence. As such, it was potentially punishable by a ten year term of imprisonment. This says something of Parliament’s view of the gravity of the offence in the abstract, especially when the underlying conduct merits treatment as an indictable offence, suggesting Parliament then views the offence asparticularly grave. Indeed, Parliament is of the view this offence is as grave as sexual assault, a section 271 offence. As with sexual interference, sexual assault is either a summary conviction or indictable offence and carries the same potential punishments.[18]Beyond the abstract lies the concrete. This child was six or seven—it is not entirely clear which—when her father began engaging her sexually. He did so in substitution, it seems, for a chronic lack of marital intimacy and sex. In a sensitively conducted interview by a female member of the R.C.M.P., the child painfully and haltingly recounted her sexual experience with her father, recalling how it started, progressed, and finally ended.[19]One evening, after she had climbed up onto his lap and kissed him, he asked her if she would like to know about “French kissing.” Being a curious and trusting six or seven year old, she said “Okay” and, with that, he inserted his tongue into her mouth and kept it there for a while. Not long afterwards, as he was reading to her at bedtime and she was hugging him, he rolled her onto his stomach and, with his hands on her hips, moved her groin area up and down on his “to make him feel good” as she remembered, remembering as well that he was then “hard.” She was in her pajamas and he was clothed. Sometime later, this same thing occurred.[20]On another occasion he came into her bedroom wearing only a bathrobe, lay down beside her, placed her on top of him, opened his robe, and had her move up and down on his erect penis. She later recalled that this was the first time she had seen his penis. As before, she was dressed in her night clothes when this occurred, but this time he was frontally naked.[21]On still other occasions—at least two of them—he slipped into her bedroom late at night, took her hand, and “slapped” it around on his penis. He apparently ejaculated on these occasions, for after he had finished and gone to sleep, she got up, went to the bathroom, and washed the “wet” from her hands.[22]These things happened over a period of about two years. They then came to a head with another incident, one that served to bring to a close a course of conduct which, according to the pre-sentence report, had an element of grooming to it, as though he was systematically readying her for more. On this occasion, she was ill and lying in her room when he came in and lay beside her. In time he slipped his hand underneath her pajamas, worked his finger into her vagina, and moved his finger around, asking her if it hurt. She told him it did not and he continued for about five minutes to move his finger around inside of her. In admitting to this later, he recalled fearing he had gone too far, for she had become rigid. This prompted him to never again engage her sexually.[23]She lived with her “secret” for the next five or six years, during which she became increasingly rebellious and resistant to authority. She took to smoking, hanging out, partying, and getting into trouble at school. One evening, as her father placed his hand on her during a prayer session, she broke down emotionally and soon afterwards disclosed what had happened. Her father and mother, assisted by some good Samaritans, thought it best to hush up the matter and send the girl away. She was sent from her home in Saskatoon to an uncle in Edmonton.She was deeply disappointed, sad, and homesick, and was experiencing nightmares and feelings of distrust. She was searching, as she expressed it, “to find a safe place in my mind where I can find some peace.” So she was introduced to a clinical psychologist and undertook a course of therapy.[24]She later moved back to Saskatoon, left school, and moved in with her boyfriend at age sixteen. She remains somewhat troubled by the experience with her father, though she profited from the psychological counselling she received, and shehas been trying of late to rebuild her relationship with her family, including her father.[25]Such is the gravity of the offence as committed in this instance. We cannot gloss over it in the context of considering whether an order allowing the offender to serve a sentence of imprisonment in the community would be consistent with this limb of the fundamental principle of sentencing. Nor can we gloss over it in turning to the other limb—the degree of responsibility of the offender.[26]This speaks to moral blameworthiness. What can one say of the extent of the moral blameworthiness of a thirty-eight year old man who, in a fatherly position of nurture, would do something such as this to an uncomprehending little person filled with affection and trust for him? It is not as though his faculties were somehow impaired. He was neither intellectually deficient, nor uneducated, nor even befuddled by alcohol or drugs. He was clear-minded, knew what he was doing, knew it was wrong, and knew he was taking a risk. Perhaps the only thing he did not appreciate was the extent of the lasting harm he was visiting on this little girl.[27]Not long ago this Court heard a similar case: R. v. D.L.M. (2001), 2001 SKCA 39 (CanLII), 207 Sask. R. 228 (Sask. C.A.). There the offender had engaged in a progressive series of sexual acts with his ten year old daughter over a period of two to four months. The acts ranged from rubbing his penis against her to repeated cunnilingus. He was given a conditional sentence. In a unanimous decision, the Court set the sentence aside as unfit and imposed another in its place, namely a term of incarceration of two and half years. Speaking for the Court in explanation of why we had done this, I commented upon our view of the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender, saying:[16]Whatever may be said of the gravity of this offence in the abstract, its commission on this occasion constituted a grave crime. This man’s conduct was highly repulsive. Rather than protect and nurture the life of his little girl, he preyed upon her sexually,debasing her, driving her into a foster home, and leaving her emotionally scarred. She was only 10, a child of tender years who implicitly trusted her father, only to havethat trust breached in this vile way and to this devastating effect.The true character of what he did cannot be glossed over.And his gross breach of trust speaks decisively to his degree of responsibility.[28]We went on in that case to stress the need for judges, when choosing between a conditional sentence and incarceration, to have careful regard for the fundamental principle of sentencing. Without suggesting a conditional sentence is never available in relation to an offence of this nature, we observed that such a sentence was inappropriate in the circumstances of the case, given fundamental principles of sentencing, together with the other principles and the objectives of general deterrence and denunciation.[29]In yet another of these cases, R. v. E.S. (2002), 2001 SKCA 38 (CanLII), 213 Sask. R. 312, this Court took the same view of a conditional sentence. This, too, was a case of sexual interference, or touching of a child, contrary to section 151 of the Criminal Code. The incidents were far more numerous than in other cases, and of a more depraved quality, but still what the Court had to say is apposite. Speaking for a unanimous Court, Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff said this:[5]The gravity of this offence is self evident. It is difficult to imagine anything more harmful to a child than abuse of this nature from a person in such a position of trust.Where the child should have received love and nurture, she received abuse for the self gratification of another..... . .[7]Although the charge is sexual touching, rather than sexual assault, the conduct is, given the age of the child [a youngster],just as serious as sexual assault. And thisCourt has repeatedly imposed sentences of three years imprisonment for serious sexual assault.These references to the equivalent seriousness of sexual assault and to the repeated imposition of sentences in the range of three years merits note. That this Court has repeatedly imposed such sentences, even for single acts of non-consensual intercourse between drunken adults, is borne out by the following line of cases: R. v. Bird (1992), 1992 CanLII 8307 (SK CA), 105 Sask R. 161; R. v. Cappo (1993), 116 Sask. R. 15; R. v. Jackson, 1993 CanLII 4414 (SK CA), [1994] 3 W.W.R. 125; R. v. Roberts (1995), 1995 CanLII 3924 (SK CA), 128 Sask. R. 158; R. v. Van de Wiele, 1997 CanLII 9695 (SK CA), [1997] 3 W.W.R. 477; R. v. D.W.C. (1997), 1997 CanLII 9728 (SK CA), 152 Sask. R. 224; and R. Creber (1998), 1997 CanLII 9788 (SK CA), 158 Sask. R. 265.[30]There are many other reported decisions of this Court, including manyinvolving sex offences against children. Collectively they demonstrate this Court’s view of what amounts to a fit or an unfit sentence, depending on the circumstances. In general, what these other decisions demonstrate is this: In instances such as the one now before us, neither a suspended sentence nor a conditional sentence is fit. The following cases serve to make the point: R. v. V.M.W. (1989), 1989 CanLII 4764 (SK CA), 76 Sask. R. 299; R. v. A.S.U. (1990), 1990 CanLII 7667 (SK CA), 86 Sask. R. 191; R. v. S.M.W. (1997), 1997 CanLII 9774 (SK CA), 158 Sask. R. 205; R. v. Creber, supra; R. v. D.L.M. (2001), 2001 SKCA 39 (CanLII), 207 Sask. R. 228; and R. v. E.S., supra. The circumstances varied from case to case, of course, so the sentences imposed by the Court ranged through nine months, to one or two years, to three years. But in none was a suspended or conditional sentence found to be fit. These cases span the last decade or more and are generally consistent with the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. R.A.R.; R. v. R.N.S.; and R. v. L.F.W., cited earlier.[31]What these cases suggest is the misapplication by the sentencing judge of yetanother principle of sentencing, and that is the principle of parity set out in section 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code:718.2 Other principles of sentencing—A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:....(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.This principle, which has been in existence for a very long time and has given rise to ranges of sentences for offences of one kind or another, was commented upon at length in R. v. McGinn (1989), 1989 CanLII 4784 (SK CA), 49 C.C.C. (3d) 137 (Sask C.A.). It was also commented upon in R. v. Proulx, cited earlier. Nothing is to be gained by further comment, and once again what the matter reduces to in this case is the application of the principle to the facts of the case.[32]Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff and I are of the respectful view the sentencing judge failed to give effect to this principle, though we hasten to add he was placed in a difficult position, given some of the past cases that were drawn to his attention, including his own decision and that of this Court in R. v. D.J.J. (1998), 1998 CanLII 12411 (SK CA), 172 Sask R. 182 (Sask. C.A.). There the offender was initially assessed as a danger to the community, an assessment that changed on appeal with the introduction of fresh evidence. He was also taken on appeal to have limited mental capacity, which served to reduce his degree of moral culpability. Clearly, that is not the case here, and in that sense the case is distinguishable and represents a particular application of the principle of parity to a particular set of facts as found on appeal.[33]The past cases are many and there is nothing to be gained in recalling any more of them. Suffice it to say in sum that, for these reasons as a whole, Mr. Justice Sherstobitoff and I have been persuaded to set aside the conditional sentence imposed by the sentencing judge. In our respectful opinion it was imposed in error, and is demonstrably unfit in any event, and must be replaced with a sentence of incarceration to better reflect the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing as required by section 724.1(b).[34]This brings us to the secondary issue, namely the length of the term of imprisonment that should be imposed. What we have had to say so far would suggest a period of incarceration near the top end of the range suggested by the Attorney General—something approaching eighteen months. But there is another principle of sentencing at work here, namely that found in section 718.2(a):(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender....[35]We have already mentioned the aggravating factors, including the offender’s abuse of his child and of his position of trust, but we have not mentioned the mitigating factors, and there are some. To begin with, he took responsibility for what he did, admitted to the whole of it, and entered a plea of guilty to the charge. He thus spared his daughter the wrenching experience of having to testify and left it easier for forgiveness and reconciliation to set in. And there is no doubting his genuine and profound sense of remorse. He has not only expressed it, he has demonstrated it. His was something of a fragile personality to begin—shy and unassertive and sensitive—and was made more so by this experience. He became depressed, so much so he needed professional assistance, which he has been receiving. And on top of this, he and his wife separated and he as at risk of losing his job. He is something of a religious man, has gained much insight, and is making a brave and commendable effort at regaining his daughter’s respect. She has begun to reciprocate, for she too seems anxious to leave this behind. All in all this has been a tragic family experience, humiliating and hurtful for father and daughter alike. And painful for others, too.[36]Reason and compassion alike are drawn to reduction on account of this. Were it not for considerations such as these, a term near the top of the range suggested by the Attorney General would be appropriate. But as it is, we shall temper the term.Having regard for the whole of the matter, including the comparative gravity of the incidents underlying the conviction and the comparative degree of harm suffered by the girl, we have decided that a term at the bottom of the range suggested by the Attorney General is appropriate. Accordingly, we impose a period of incarceration of nine months.[37]As we have said many times in the past, subjective factors are occasionally overborne by objective considerations and judges must, however painful, do their duty.Nothing short of a term of incarceration of this duration can adequately serve the ends of justice. What remains is for the authorities to administer the sentence as they see fit.JACKSON J.A. (in dissent)[38]M.S. was charged that between January 1, 1991 and December 31, 1994 he repeatedly touched R.S., a person under 14, directly with a part of his body, contrary to section 151 of the Criminal Code.[1]R.S. is the daughter of M.S.[39]Following receipt of the guilty plea and at the sentencing hearing, Crown counsel described the incidents giving rise to the offences in these terms:. . . What we found out from the victim, and this is at -- it started at about age seven, she provided a statement indicating it started at seven, it was in [named town] and basically what she’s indicating is that she would be in the bedroom in her pyjamas, panties on, and he would come in and they would -- he would place her on top of him with an erection and he would rub his penis against her vagina.She describes it as typical starting slow and then moving faster and faster and then eventually stopping.She doesn’t indicate as to whether or not there was ever any ejaculation, but she describes that as the pattern for the incidents.She also indicates that it was overtop of her underwear, overtop of her panties and not directly on her vagina.She also indicates that on another occasion he taught her how to french kiss and that there was -- that took place between he and -- he and his daughter.He also -- she also indicates on another occasion that he was going into the bathroom area and he undid his robe and rubbed his penis against her on that occasion.He had also, she indicates, on two occasions, came in and took his hand -- her hand, placed it on his penis and what she indicates is she made a slappy motion with her hand. This went on for some time and she said that afterwards her hand was wet and that she would have to go and wash it off.Again, she’s not able to indicate whether or not there was ejaculant (sic).She finally indicates that on one occasion there was vaginal penetration with the finger.This took place over five minutes and she indicates that at the time she was nine years of age.[2][40]At the sentencing hearing, Crown counsel took the position that a conditional sentence would never be available in the circumstances present in this case. This exchange took place between the Court and Crown counsel:THE COURT:Are you saying it’s a position of the Crown that in every case where there’s a father and a child, that there must be incarceration? Is that -- is that your position?MR. KRITZER:In -- on -- for sexual assaults?THE COURT:Yes.MR. KRITZER:Yes.THE COURT:Very well.So that’s the position of the Crown, that there ought -MR. KRITZER:Yes.THE COURT:- never to be a conditional sentence in these circumstances.MR. KRITZER:Yes.THE COURT:Very well.MR. KRITZER:We’re taking the position that a conditional sentence would be inappropriate in these circumstances in accordance with denunciation.That it wouldn’t meet with the societal demand for denunciation in terms of facts of this incident.You’ve got an incident that’s repeated over -- on a number of occasions over the course of a number of years, involves sexual touching of a significant nature and has had a significant impact on the victim.In those cases we would submit that the range is nine to 18 months incarceration and that a conditional sentence should not be seen as an option in regards to this sentencing matter.We’re also suggesting two years probation to follow, reporting and assessment counselling and treatment for sex offenders as may be directedby the probation officer . . . [3][41]For his part and in response to this, respondent’s counsel cited R. v.Proulx[4] and its four companion cases including R. v. R.N.S.[5] where the Supreme Court of Canada did not reject the possibility of a longer conditional sentence being an acceptable equivalent to a nine-month sentence of custody for offences similar to those committed here.[42]The learned sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 23 months to be served in the community, with a curfew of 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. for nine months, and 100 hours of community service. In addition, the Court ordered that M.S. take such sexual offender assessment, counselling and treatment as directed by his conditional sentence supervisor.[6][43]In making this decision, the learned sentencing judge noted that: (i) a conditional sentence is available for any type of offence;(ii) in R. v. D.J.J.[7] this Court imposed a conditional sentence for one count under s. 151 and one under s. 271 where there was little risk of re-offence following a report to that effect; (iii) Dr. Nicholaichuk testified that M.S. was in the lowest category of offence risk; (iv) M.S.’s wife stated that M.S. had begun to reestablish a healthy relationship with his daughter and that her father’s incarceration would be detrimental to her; (v) M.S.’s wife stated that her husband’s financial support was “essential” for her and her family to avoid hardship; and (vi) while M.S.needs to support his wife and five year old son, he is at an age when re-employment after prison may be problematic. The sentencing judge then acknowledged that the offence to which M.S. pleaded guilty is “a very serious offence which is compounded by the position of trust he held with regard to the victim.”[8] He concluded with these words:[14]On the other hand, there is a very low likelihood that the accused will re-offend. In the opinion of Dr. Nicholaichuk he has been rehabilitated. The interference stopped eight years ago at the first indication of resistance by the victim. He has no prior criminal record. He has a significant record of employment. He provides much needed financial support to the family and if he lost his job it would be difficult for him, at his age, to find other suitable employment.In my view, in the proper circumstances a conditional sentence can fulfil the sentencing objectives of general deterrence, specific deterrence and denunciation. When I weigh and consider all of the circumstances I conclude that in this case a conditional sentence is appropriate.[15]I note that the probation officer concluded that electronic monitoring did not appear to be viable given the accused’s circumstances.[9][44]The Crown appeals. Crown counsel argues that the sentencing judge placed undue emphasis on jail’s lack of deterrent effect, M.S.’s low risk to re-offend and the family’s needs, and failed to recognize the serious nature of the incidents. As a consequence, it is said, the sentencing judge did not give sufficient or any regard for his duty in relation to general deterrence, denunciation and retribution. Finally, it is submitted that the sentencing judge should not have relied on R. v. D.J.J.as that decision concerned the sentencing of a learning disabled youth, but instead he should have considered such cases as R. v. D.L.M.[10] and R. v. McKay.[11][45]For his part, respondent’s counsel relies and expands on the submissions that he made to the sentencing judge, makes reference to the standard of appellate review and submits an additional letter from the victim wherein she advises this Court that she is satisfied with the sentence her father received. In addition, he takes issue with Crown counsel’s use of, what he argues is, inflammatory language. Respondent’s counsel writes in his factum:13.The more serious material errors in which the Crown goes beyond what the evidence disclosed include:a.The Crown uses inflammatory language such as: “he digitally penetrated her vagina once for some five minutes . . . after that incident he forced no further sexual contact upon her” [¶ 7 Appellant’s Factum]; “Serial offences such as in the case at bar” [¶ 28 Appellant’s Factum]; “Forced sexual intercourse is one example. Multiple instances of serious sexual abuse, including the digital violation of one’s child is another”[¶ 37 Appellant’s Factum]; “This was a considered and deliberate crime, done repeatedly and with care by a mature adult male in full possession of his faculties.His only explanation is that he wasn’t finding sexual satisfaction in his wife.” [¶ 40 Appellant’s Factum]....b....The Appellant’s statement that the Respondent would “rub his erect penis against her vagina with clothing in between” is an error, a matter which was brought to the attention of the prosecutor at the time of the sentencing proceeding on October 17, 2002, when if necessary further evidence would have been led on the point: [Transcript 34:2-8] and subsequently stated by the prosecutor as follows: “she also indicates that it was over top of her underwear, over top of her panties and not directly on her vagina.” [Transcript 37:4].In her statement to the police, [R.S.] was asked what position she was in when she was on top of the Respondent to which she said: “Well . . . my legs were together though, I was just laying on top of him”: [p. 13 Statement of [R.S] Tab 1].c.¶ 6 Appellant’s Factum -- The Respondent admits to sexual touching as stated, but that does not amount to the same thing as teaching the victim “to masturbate him” and there is no evidence of misconduct going that far.The witness statement makes clear that in connection with this type of misconduct the daughter pretended she was sleeping and she guessed he thought she was sleeping: [p. 19-21 Statement of [R.S.] Tab 1];d.¶ 7 Appellant’s Factum -- The Respondent never forced sexual contact upon the victim at any time and in fact stopped immediately when she gave the first sign of resistance.The Crown’s use of the term “penetration” is inflammatory and seriously prejudicial.The ordinary meaning of the term “penetrate” carries an implication of force and is a trigger word for forcible rape or attempted rape....[12][46]Respondent’s counsel offers his explanation of all this from the pre-sentence report and examinations of M.S. I do not take it that he is attempting to minimize the serious nature of the incidents. Rather, I interpret his submission on this point to be a recognition of the gravity of the offence, while at the same time asking that it not be overstated or stated beyond what was presented at the sentencing hearing. His submission is that the punishment M.S. received should be assessed against the words which were used to sentence him. I agree. The sentencing judge found that there were four to seven incidents which occurred over a period of two years when the child was aged seven to nine. The sentencing judge did not need to comment further on the nature of the incidents as they were a matter of record and agreement.[47]Leaving that aside, and turning to the substance of the appeal, I first observe that there have been many decisions written about the impact of the 1995 amendments which brought about the present Part XXIII of the Criminal Code. As this is an oral judgment, I do not intend to analyse those decisions here. It is sufficient to offer the comment that Part XXIII gives the courts additional guidance and resources in terms of sentencing tools and principles so as to permit offenders to be sentenced more appropriately. In particular, these tools and principles recognize the place for restorative justice in sentencing. Since the enactment of Part XXIII, our task has been to consider past sentencing practices in the light of Parliament’s direction and sentence accordingly.[48]The Crown emphasizes the need to deter offenders, denounce the conduct and provide retribution. While I agree with the need to do so, I do not agree that a custodial sentence is the only means to effect these results. As has been said many times before by this Court and others, incarceration is only one tool available to a judge considering the appropriate sentence. Incarceration cannot be the presumptive choice for any offence.[49]Notwithstanding what the sentencing judge said during the sentencing hearing, he must be taken to have given effect to deterrence, denunciation and retribution by imposing a significantly longer sentence than that suggested by the Crown while ordering that it be served in the community. A 23-month conditional sentence which includes a curfew for nine months, 100 community service hours and compelled treatment must be considered as serving the ends of deterrence, denunciation and retribution as well as being proportional to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. It is surely the functional equivalent of a sentence at the low end of the range offered by Crown counsel at the sentencing hearing.At the same time, it permits the accused to keep his job, support himself and his family and maintain family relationships. Giving greater importance to the punitive aspects of sentencing than this will visit hardship on R.S. and the other members of her family.[50]I find the cases cited by the Crown to be distinguishable. The case which comes closest is R. v. D.L.M., but this describes the nature of the sexual acts and D.L.M.:[5]Mr. M. engaged in a progressive series of sexual acts with his 10 year old daughter over a period of two to four months. He started by licking her vagina, then began rubbing his penis on her vagina and having her fondle his penis, and finally took to performing cunnilingus on a regular, if not daily, basis, ejaculating on at least one occasion.He engaged in these acts while his son was playing outside during the day or sleeping in his room at night. His daughter repeatedly asked him not to do these things, but to no avail, until she was removed from the home by family services.[6]As might be expected, this experience had an emotionally devastating impact upon the child, requiring therapy in an effort to restore her sense of self‑esteem, her ability to concentrate on her school work, and so on. She is now in foster care.[7]Previous to the commission of this offence, Mr. M. had been convicted of others, including theft, obstruction of a police officer, possession of a narcotic, and two assaults. He was said to have been raised in a loving, caring home by hard working and responsible parents. He was also said to have been free of childhood abuse, with the exception, he suggested, of having been encouraged at the age of six or eight to engage in some sexual acts with his sister's 16 year old girlfriend. He had taken to using drugs and alcohol at an early age and had drifted from one place to another, and one endeavour to another, until he finally settled on the ... First Nations with his two children.[8]He showed little insight into his offence. He ascribed his actions to the influence of alcohol and pornography, passed off the harm to the child, and viewed himself as a victim. While he was willing to take alcohol, drug, and sexual offender treatment, he was said to be insincere in this and was assessed at a high risk to re‑offend.[13]Moreover, in D.L.M. this Court imposed a penitentiary sentence which precluded the possibility of a conditional sentence. A case like R. v. McKay,[14] which was an offender’s appeal against a custodial sentence, as opposed to this Court not upholding a conditional sentence, has little precedential value.[51]These are the factors which set this case apart from the cases cited by the Crown:1.the number and age of the incidents:four to seven and having occurred more than eight years ago;2.the nature of the charge, which was under s. 151 of the Criminal Code (uponM.S. pleading guilty, the Crown stayed a charge of repeated acts of sexual assault contrary to s. 271);3.the respondent stopped his offending behaviour on his own initiative;4.the family remained together for some seven years after the last incidentwhich demonstrates the lack of risk;5.the respondent has no record;6.the respondenthas otherwise lived a productive life, having worked for the same company for some 28 years;7.the respondent is currently the financial mainstay of his estranged wife and other child;8.the respondent is beginning to reestablish a healthy relationship with the victimwho wants that relationship;9.the respondent is extremely remorseful and, prior to the hearing, had already undergone treatment on his own initiative; and10.an expert called on the respondent’s behalf at the sentencing hearing confirmed that he was at virtually no risk to re-offend.Nor do I discount the importance of such factors as the respondent’s guilty plea and complete cooperation with the authorities, but I do not mention them further because in some of the cases cited by the Crown these factors were also present.[52]Again, as this is an oral judgment, I will not spend a long time on the standard of review which would permit intervention. It has been often stated that a court of appeal can intervene only in limited circumstances to overturn a sentencing judge's decision. A court of appeal should intervene only if the sentencing judge has erred in principle or the sentence is demonstrably unfit.[53]On my review of the sentencing transcript, the various reports, letters and judgment, I neither see an error in principle nor agree that this sentence is demonstrably unfit.I would dismiss the appeal.[1]R.S.C. 1985, c.

Corby, Esq. for the AppellantJames H. Appleton, Esq. for the RespondentBY THE COURTLeave to appeal sentence is granted. The appeal is allowed. The conditional discharge is set aside. It is directed that a conviction be entered against Ms. McNamara but that the imposition of sentence be suspended for a period of one year. The Probation Order is confirmed.BY THE COURTThe respondent Jean Elizabeth McNamara pleaded guilty to two counts of theft from her two employers, each exceeding $1,000.00, contrary to s.334(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada. In respect of these offences a Provincial Court Judge ordered that Ms. McNamara be discharged on the conditions prescribed in a Probation Order.The Probation Order was for the term of one year. In addition to keeping the peace and being of good behaviour, Ms. McNamara was ordered to perform 100 hours of community service. This service was performed by Ms. McNamara prior to the hearing of this appeal. In addition, subsequent to a civil judgment against her, but prior to the laying of the criminal charges, Ms. McNamara made restitution to her employers of the sum of $4,126.01 which included the amount stolen as well as interest and costs.The Crown has appealed the granting of the conditional discharge contending that the trial Judge failed to place proper emphasis on the general deterrent aspect of sentencing and imposed a sentence that was manifestly inadequate having regard to all of the circumstances and the nature of the offence. At trial the Crown, citing previous decisions of this Court, sought the imposition of a custodial sentence in the range of 30 days. In any event, it is our opinion that this is a proper case for the granting of leave to appeal.As we have said on previous occasions, the public interest requires that it be made very clear to one and all that in the absence of special circumstances a person holding a position of trust who steals from his or her employer must expect a term of imprisonment. The trial Judge in the instant case purported to find special circumstances in this case in the[Page 2]age of Ms. McNamara (she is 24) and the assertion that she did not hold a \"complete position of trust\" with her employers. In our opinion, these are not the special circumstances contemplated by the jurisprudence.The fact of the matter was that Ms. McNamara was employed as a bookkeeper/secretary for two corporations. Her responsibilities included writing cheques, keeping ledgers and making bank deposits. During her term of employment of just over one year, she used her position of trust to steal various amounts of money from the two corporations by three different methods and to manipulate the accounting process in order to avoid detection. It was determined, for example, that on ten occasions she altered her own pay cheque after it had been signed to give herself a higher amount. On six other occasions, she made payments to fictitious suppliers when, in fact, the money went to her. When the thefts were detected, Ms. McNamara's only explanation was that she had used the stolen funds to cover credit card debts that she had incurred.We are of the opinion that the conditional discharge, together with community service work that was ordered by the trial judge, was not an adequate punishment in the circumstances of the present case. However, because Ms. McNamara is a young first offender who has made full restitution and has a very favourable pre-sentence report, we are of the opinion she is entitled to some leniency. While a term of imprisonment of thirty days as requested by the Crown might have been appropriate in the circumstances, in view of the fact that Ms. McNamara has already performed 100 hours of community service, we allow the appeal, set aside the conditional discharge, direct that a conviction be entered against her and[Page 3]suspend the imposition of sentence for a period of one year. We confirm the Probation Order."}

Christie, forthe Defence)Defendant))))HEARD:July 7, 2017REASONS FOR SENTENCEM. J. Donohue, J.Overview[1]Mr. D’Souza stands to be sentenced after conviction on one count of possession of heroin, and one count of possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking.Mr. D’Souza was acquitted on a charge of trafficking.The total amount seized from his auto body shop was 34.2 grams of heroin.Circumstances of the Offence[2]On July 17, 2013, Mr. D’Souza and his auto body shop were under surveillance by police in the street crime and drug unit.He was observed to come out of his body shop and get into a parked car on the passenger side to converse with the driver.The driver, Mr. Samra, testified that Mr. D’Souza sold him heroin in a manila envelope.Police followed Mr. Samra and arrested him.Sometime later Mr. Samra told police that he was sold the heroin by Mr. D’Souza.[3]In search of the body shop conducted under warrant on the evening of July 17, 2013 the police found a package of heroin with dime baggies in the cabinet above the main desk in the office.[4]A 32-gram bag of heroin was located in the pocket of a sweater hanging in the office alcove.Other indicia of trafficking were found, including a debt book on the desk, dime baggies in the desk drawer and $900 in cash which Mr. D’Souza had on his person that evening upon his arrest.[5]It was admitted in the trial that the total of 34.2 grams had a street value of $8,208 if sold at the gram level.[6]Mr. D’Souza explained that the sweater belonged to his employee Andres and he denied ownership of, or knowledge about, the drugs either in the sweater or the desk cabinet. He confirmed that he met with Mr. Samra in the car outside his body shop but testified that they discussed doing work on Mr. Samra’s car and they did not transact a sale of drugs.[7]The jury found Mr. D’Souza not guilty of trafficking but guilty of the possession charges.[8]The jury, in convicting on the possession charges must have rejected some of Mr. D’Souza’s explanations. On the basis of all the evidence, they must have found that Mr. D’Souza had knowledge and control of the drugs located in his office and possessed them.[9]I was satisfied that his knowledge and control of the drugs was reasonably inferred from the surrounding circumstances of being located in the office he owned and at the desk where he worked.Circumstances of the Offender[10]Mr. D’Souza is age 58 and was born in the USA.He immigrated to Canada 25 years ago to marry his wife.They have three adult sons. He was very involved in raising their sons and encouraged sports.[11]Mr. D’Souza graduated from the University of Maryland in 1980 from a Criminal justice program.He also got a diploma in private investigations.He worked for an American airline for a number of years.He was laid off just before the airline went bankrupt.This coincided with his move to Canada.[12]His wife has been the breadwinner of the family.Initially Mr. D’Souza was not granted a work visa.He was a stay at home dad until their youngest child was school aged. He was not successful in his business ventures.Mr. D’Souza tried a Dive Shop, CFX Auto Collision, Miata Used Parts Shop and finally Capital Auto Collision, each of which struggled financially and did not survive.[13]Mr. D’Souza, as confirmed by his wife, sister, and doctor, has never used illegal substances.[14]Mr. D’Souza denies responsibility for the offences before the Court.He blames his employees.His wife and sister describe him as naïve and someone that was taken advantage of.His wife said he was a family man who cared deeply about his community. She said he has done volunteer work as well.[15]The probation officer’s assessment was,” The subject minimizes his involvement in the offence and does not appear to accept responsibility for his actions.The subject’s approach to such serious charges was very relaxed.The subject’s sister opines that the subject “does not grasp consequences well”, which places him in dangerous situations without fully understanding how it will affect his life.”[16]Mr. D’Souza has no criminal record.Impact on the Victim and/or Community[17]The Ontario Court of Appeal, in R. v Sidhu, [2009] O.J. No.325 (Ont. C.A.)242 emphasized the danger of heroin and stated, “Time and again, this court and the Supreme Court of Canada have made it clear that heroin is the most pernicious of the hard drugs—it is the most addictive, the most destructive and the most dangerous.Heroin trafficking has been described as a “despicable” crime and one that “tears at the very fabric of our society.”Legal Parameters[18]Possession of a heroin is punishable by a maximum of seven years imprisonment.[19]Possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking has a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.Positions of Crown and Defence[20]The Crown seeks a penitentiary sentence of five years as being the range for this offender in these circumstances. The Crown seeks the ancillary DNA orders and weapons prohibition.[21]Defence proposes a sentence of 2 years less two days as appropriate to meet the appropriate principles of sentencing in this area. The defence submitted that the range for a low level trafficker is 2 to 4 years.Case Law[22]The Crown relies on the following four cases: R. v. Pimentel, [2004] O.J. No. 5780 (Sup. Ct.); R. v. Van Nguyen (1997), 31 O.T.C. 132 (Ct. J. (Gen. Div.)); and R. v. Mete, [1980] O.J. No. 1438 (S.C. C.A.); R. v. Dhillon, 2017 ONSC 258 (CanLII).[23]In Pimentel the offender was sentenced to four years imprisonment for possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking and possession of the proceeds of crime.The heroin had a value of $2,300 and the offender had a lengthy criminal record.The court reviewed a number of cases of similar amounts of heroin which resulted in a range of custodial sentences ranging from 3-7 years in length.[24]At paragraph 14 the court referred to the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal of R. v. Belanger, [1973] O.J. No. 355 (S.C. C.A.) at para. 2:Heroin is a pernicious and addictive narcotic.Consequently, severe sentences are imposed by the courts to deter those tempted by commercial gain from trafficking in the illicit drug.Heroin is considered a ‘hard drug’.[25]In Van Nguyen the 28 year old offender, who had no criminal record, was sentenced to seven years penitentiary time.The charge was trafficking in 27.95 grams of heroin, sold for $6,000.[26]In Mete the Ontario Court of Appeal reduced a sentence from twelve years to seven years for an offender guilty of trafficking in heroin of two-thirds of an ounce of heroin for $2,000.The offender had been an addict who trafficked to supply his own habit and had an extensive criminal record, including a previous conviction for trafficking in heroin.[27]R v Dhillon, a decision of the Superior Court of Ontario, involved a 53 year old male with no criminal record convicted of trafficking in heroin involving ½ a kilogram.The court considered that the global range in those circumstances was six to nine years in jail.He was sentenced to seven years in custody less time served.The court noted that this was not a mistake of youth in light of the defendant’s age.[28]The defence relies on the case of R. v. Anang, 2016 ONCA 825 (CanLII), 367 C.R.R. (2d) 289, when the Court affirmed the trial judge’s sentence of four years’ imprisonment. The case involved 75 grams of heroin with an estimated street value of $18,000. The defence points out that this was twice the amount of drugs located in this case.[29]The defence also relies on the case of R. v. Zamani, [1999] O.J. No. 3780 (C.A.). The accused was convicted of selling 50 grams of heroin for $5,500. The sentence imposed was 2 years less a day. The Court of Appeal noted that the trial judge could have imposed a sentence of 3 to 4 years on the facts of the case. The majority of the court deferred to the trial judge’s conclusion that the accused showed a strong potential for rehabilitation. They decided that they could not say that an imposition of a maximum reformatory term was outside the range.[30]I note that the dissenting Judge, Charron J.A., stated that the mitigating factors of “no criminal record and a supportive wife and family” did not justify the imposition of a sentence outside of the general range.Mitigating and Aggravating Factors[31]There are a number of aggravating factors in this case.[32]Because Mr. D’Souza is not a user or addict of heroin, it follows that he must have been in possession of the drugs for the purpose of making a commercial profit. This is also an aggravating factor.[33]There are also several mitigating factors.[34]Mr. D’Souza has no prior criminal record.[35]Mr. D’Souza has been a loving father and husband. He is noted to be an community minded person by family. He does not abuse substances.He has good family support and loving relationships.Right of Allocution[36]The accused was advised of his right of allocution and he indicated that he did not wish to say anything.Principles of Sentencing[37]The Criminal Code sets out the purpose and principles of sentencing as follows:718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:(a)a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,(b)a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;[38]Section 10(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act provides as follows:(1) Without restricting the generality of the Criminal Code, the fundamental purpose of any sentence for an offence under this Part is to contribute to the respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society while encouraging rehabilitation, and treatment in appropriate circumstances, of offenders and acknowledging the harm done to victims and to the community.[39]None of the aggravating factors set out in s. 10(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act apply in this case.[40]Section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code allows the court to make a DNA order for the circumstances of this charge on application by the prosecutor, if the court is satisfied that such an order is in the best interests of the administration of justice. In deciding whether to make the order, the court is required to consider the following: the defendant’s criminal record; the nature of the offence; the circumstances surrounding its commission; and the impact such an order would have on the defendant’s privacy and security of the person.Reasons[41]The most important sentencing principles in a case such as this are denunciation, and deterrence. The sentence must also be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.[42]Counsel agreed that Mr. D’Souza was in the category of a “low level trafficker”.[43]On review of the case law relied on by the defence I do not find the circumstances of Mr. D’Souza place him in any exceptional category where a sentence in the appropriate range would not be necessary.Mr. D’Souza is not an addict, he is a man of mature years, and the substance involved was heroin. Further, Mr. D’Souza had education, experience and a level of comfort in his living circumstances.He was not a vulnerable person as we often see in the court system.[44]The sentence of four years in custody, is reasonable in light of the authorities, and takes into consideration Mr. D’Souza’s personal circumstances of being a loving father and community minded member of society. It is my decision that a sentence of four years in custody is required for the purposes of denunciation in a case such as this.[45]An order for the taking of a D.N.A. sample pursuant to 487.051(3) is appropriate in this case.Ancillary Orders[46]A weapons prohibition order under s. 109(2)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code shall issue for a period of ten years after Mr. D’Souza’s release from custody.[47]A D.N.A. order under s. 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code shall issue.Final Decision[48]Mr. D’Souza is sentenced to four years in custody on each count/charge to be served concurrently, less a day for pre-sentence custody.[49]A D.N.A. order under s. 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code shall issue.[50]A weapons prohibition order under s. 109(2)(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code shall issue for a period of ten years after Mr. D’Souza’s release from custody.___________________________M.

Brekerfor the CrownChristopher Funtfor the accusedSENTENCING JUDGMENTBARRINGTON-FOOTE J.JUNE 28, 2016[1]The accused is subject to a 10 year long-term supervision order [LTSO]. On June 17, 2016, he pled guilty to breaching a condition of that order by consuming and possessing alcohol on July 27, 2016, contrary tos. 753.3 of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46.[2]The Crown submits that the accused, who has been in custody pending the disposition of a charge of aggravated assault since his arrest on that charge on July 27, 2015, should be sentenced to a term of between 18 months and 2 years. The accused submits that the appropriate sentence is less than the 12 months imposed in R v Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII), [2012] 1 SCR 433 [Ipeelee], the leading authority on the application of the principles and purposes of sentencing for breach of an LTSO.Background[3]On the evening of July 26, 2015, police were called to a residence in Regina, Saskatchewan, and found a seriously injured male. The accused, who was reported to have been at the residence, became the subject of a police search. The police were advised by the accused’s wife that he had called and told her that he was at a hotel in Regina. At approximately 11:00 a.m. on July 27, 2015, police attended at the Coachman Inn, and found the accused naked in a hotel room. When the accused saw the police, he began drinking heavily from a 26 ounce bottle of whiskey. He was arrested, first acting as if he had passed out, and then making disparaging comments to the police. He was charged with an aggravated assault of the male found at that residence, and acquitted of that charge by a jury on May 18, 2016.[4]The accused, who is 52 years old, was born on the ---- First Nation. He has a lengthy record of both violent and nonviolent offences. Those offences include assault causing bodily harm in March 1980, October 1980, June 1982, September 1982, July 1986, and May 1989; aggravated assault in November 1987 and October 2002; break and enter and aggravated assault in November 1987; armed robbery in April 1992; uttering threats and break and enter and commit an indictable offence in August 2000 and manslaughter in October 2000. The accused also has a lengthy record of justice system offences. Those offences include breaches of probation in 1980 and 1982; obstructing a police officer in 1985 and 1987; failing to appear in 1982, 1986, 1989, 1992; and disobeying an order of the court and breaching a recognizance in 2000.[5]Further, the accused breached the terms of his statutory release in the course of his 10 year sentence for manslaughter which was the predicate offence for his long-term offender designation, on three occasions. He was first released in April 2010, and breached three conditions of his release by travelling to the Pasqua First Nation, consuming alcohol and assaulting his common-law wife in October 2010. In the result, the accused was convicted of assault in February 2011. He was sentenced to one year consecutive, and his statutory release was revoked. As the Crown noted, the October 2010 breaches occurred very shortly after the expiration of a condition that the accused live in a community correctional facility.[6]The accused was again granted statutory release in August 2013. He breached his conditions by failing to abstain from alcohol and drugs in 2013, and again in 2014, resulting in the revocation of his release in May 2014.[7]The accused was granted statutory release for a third time in September 2014. He reached his warrant expiry date on December 27, 2014, resulting in the commencement of his LTSO, which included conditions that he abstain from alcohol and reside at the Oskana Center for six months. The Crown noted that the breach resulting in the offence for which the accused will now be sentenced was also committed very shortly after the expiration of that residency condition.[8]The Crown filed records from the Correctional Service of Canada, and a National Parole Board assessment and decision at the sentencing hearing. Those records include a series of Correction’s plans and assessments from January 2003 to July 2015. They confirm that the accused generally performed well while incarcerated, and had participated in all required core programming. His 2015 assessments conclude that he has made progress. Officials believed he was motivated to change, and appeared to have both gained insight into his stressors and improved his ability to identify and implement positive coping mechanisms. They indicate that his drug and alcohol screens were negative for the first six months of his LTSO, that he obtained employment and was in a potentially supportive relationship with his new wife.[9]These records also confirmed, however, that the accused is capable of extreme violence, and that alcohol has contributed to his offending. A May 5, 2013 assessment, for example, contains the following summary description:The HCR-20 and VRAG indicate a low risk of general recidivism and a high risk for violence; E.W.’s history indicates long periods of controlled emotional instability, and explosive rage with violence. In the community the offender is prone to display emotional instability and poor management of emotions and self control. His actions indicate that he can be impulsive when bombarded with distorted emotions that are led by arguments that cause frustration. E.W.’srisk of instability is exacerbated when he isunder the influence of intoxicants that hinder hisjudgment and ability to rationalize the outcome of his decisions.[10]The March 3, 2015 assessment contains similar comments, including drawing the readily apparent link - which the accused admits - between his long struggle with alcohol abuse and violence, as follows:File information indicates that E.W.’s primary risk factors that have contributed to his criminal offending behaviour appear to be his substance abuse, negative peer associations, impulsive behaviour and inability to link behaviours with consequences. He appears to be vulnerable to negative peer influence and when under the influence of substance is easily provoked to impulsive acts of violence.[11]The accused is a First Nations person. Members of his family, including four of his six siblings, attended residential school, and some of his siblings were placed in foster care. He was abandoned by his caregiver at the age of 12, and was obliged to take care of himself and his siblings at an early age. He also experienced physical, emotional and mental abuse during childhood. Although the accused at one stage expressed an interest in participating in cultural ceremonies while incarcerated, there is no evidence that he pursued that interest. It is reported in his May 5, 2013 assessment that he was not interested in participating in elder interventions at that time.Law[12]Ipeelee constituted a significant change in the approach to sentencing for breach of an LTSO. LeBel J. there confirmed (see generally paras. 40 – 54) as follows:•An LTSO, which is a form of conditional release governed by the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, SC 1992, c 20, has two objectives: “(1) protecting the public from the risk of reoffence, and (2) rehabilitating the offender and reintegrating him or her into the community” (para. 48).•Although rehabilitation and reintegration are the ultimate purpose of an LTSO, rehabilitation is not always the primary consideration when sentencing for breach of an LTSO. Rather, a sentencing judge must “…apply all of the principles mandated by ss. 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code in order to devise a sentence that furthers the overall objectives of sentencing.” As with any sentencing decision, the relative weight to be accorded to each sentencing principle or objective will vary depending on the circumstances of the particular offence. In all instances, the sentence must be proportionate to both the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the accused”. (para. 51)•The ten year maximum penalty for a breach of an LTSO indicates that Parliament views the breach of an LTSO more seriously than the breach of a probation order. However, there is no minimum sentence, and all sentencing options are available. (para. 54)•The sentencing judge must determine, within this open range of sentencing options, a sentence proportionate to both the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. As LeBel J. stated:The severity of a particular breach of an LTSO will depend, in large part, on the circumstances of the breach, the nature of the condition breached, and the role that condition plays in managing the offender's risk of reoffence in the community. This requires a contextual analysis. As Smith J.A. states in R. v. Deacon, 2004 BCCA 78 (CanLII), 193 B.C.A.C. 228 (B.C. C.A.), at para. 51, \"the gravity of an offence under s. 753.3 must be measured with reference not only to the conduct that gave rise to the offence, but also with regard to what it portends in light of the offender's entire history of criminal conduct.[13]Ipeelee also confirmed that ss. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code must, as in every case, be taken into account in sentencing for breach of an LTSO. That does not mean that an accused convicted of a breach of s.753.3 is entitled to what LeBel J. referred to as a “race-based discount”.Rather, as he put the matter, referring to the principles specified in R v Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 SCR 688 [Gladue]:75 … sentencing judges are required to pay particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders in order to endeavour to achieve a truly fit and proper sentence in any particular case. This has been, and continues to be, the fundamental duty of a sentencing judge. Gladue is entirely consistent with the requirement that sentencing judges engage in an individualized assessment of all of the relevant factors and circumstances, including the status and life experiences, of the person standing before them. …[14]In this case, both counsel submitted, and I agree, that a period of incarceration is the correct sentence. The accused has been in custody almost continuously since 2000. He has completed addictions and other programming directed at his needs. Defence counsel did not propose a restorative justice approach. Indeed, he submitted that a sentence that would call for this accused to confront those elements of his past that engage Gladue principles might be unhelpful.[15]The particular Gladue principle that must nonetheless be considered is that, as LeBel J. noted (at para. 73 of Ipeelee), “systemic and background factors may bear on the culpability of the offender, to the extent that they shed light on his or her level of moral blameworthiness”. As Richards C.J.S. emphasized in R v Chanalquay, 2015 SKCA 141 (CanLII), [2016] 4 WWR 242, however:52A sentencing judge should not simply stack up all of the Gladue-type considerations at play in a case and, if the list is long or severe, automatically proceed on the assumption such factors have had a substantial limiting effect on the offender's culpability. The required analysis is more demanding than that. To determine the extent to which Gladue factors impact on an offender's moral culpability, a sentencing judge must examine both the nature of the relevant factors and the particulars of the crime in issue. He or she should then consider the extent to which the unique circumstances of the offender \"bear on his or her culpability\" (Ipeelee at para 83) in the specific context of the case at hand. As mandated by the Supreme Court, the search here is not for a cause-and-effect relationship but for circumstances that cast light on the degree of the offender's blameworthiness for the specific offence in issue. It might be that the Gladue considerations impact the offender's culpability a great deal, not at all, or only to some intermediate extent.[16]As he further noted (at para. 54), “a finding of reduced moral culpability rooted in Gladue factors does not automatically lead to a shorter period of incarceration.”[17]The fundamental purpose and objectives of sentencing are set out in s. 718 of the Criminal Code, which provides as follows:718 The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect society and to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct and the harm done to victims or to the community that is caused by unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders; …[18]The fundamental principle of sentencing, which is specified bys. 718.1 of the Criminal Code, is that a sentence “must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.” Section 718.2 of the Criminal Code requires that I take account of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender. It also requires that I consider the principle of parity. That is, “a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances”.Positions of the Parties[19]Counsel for the accused focused squarely on rehabilitation as a sentencing objective. He submitted that the Crown’s characterization of the accused’s criminal record as one of uninterrupted violence did not take proper account of the fact that his offending has been “on a downward trend”, and that his more recent actions support the conclusion that he has gained insights and is internalizing his rehabilitation programming. In his view, it is important not to interrupt that rehabilitative process by imposing a further period of incarceration. He noted that the accused has already been in custody and thus without access to alcohol since July 2015.[20]As to the circumstances of the offence, defence counsel submitted that the most likely explanation for the accused’s behaviour was that he expected to be arrested for a very serious offence. He suggested that his decision to drink was equivalent to a condemned man having one last cigarette before the firing squad. He also suggested that the circumstances of the offence were less serious as they were committed “without guile”.[21]Crown counsel, on the other hand, emphasized the accused’s lengthy and serious criminal record, and his several breaches while on statutory release and now while subject to an LTSO for the same offence. He submitted that the accused has demonstrated a clear pattern of committing breaches when he is no longer under close supervision in a correctional facility. He noted that the accused committed the majority of his offences while intoxicated. In his view, the accused presents a serious risk to the public, and that protection of the public, denunciation and deterrence should be the primary considerations in this case.[22]The Crown also submitted, relying on R v Gatza, 2016 ABPC 37 (CanLII) [Gatza], that the accused should not receive enhanced credit for the time spent in custody since his arrest on July 27, 2015, as the accused’s long-term supervision order has continued to run pending this sentencing. Gatza relies on R v Bourdon, 2012 ONCA 256 (CanLII), 110 OR (3d) 168 [Bourdon], finding that it would be anomalous for an offender to receive both enhanced credit and credit towards his LTSO.Analysis[23]In my view, there are several key considerations in this case.The accused may well be motivated to change, and appears to have made progress since 2003. However, he has a long history of alcohol abuse, and a long history of breaching court orders, including the 2010 breach involving alcohol and violence, and three recent breaches while on statutory release. Based on this history and the circumstances of this offence, I conclude that there is a very significant risk that the accused will turn to alcohol, particularly if faced with stress. There is compelling evidence that he has been repeatedly and easily provoked to violence when he is intoxicated, and that as a result, he presents a significant risk to public safety. Further, and with respect, I do not agree with defence counsel that the circumstances of the offence are less serious because the accused drank “without guile”, in the face of the police. Faced with stress, the accused drank, and did so defiantly.[24]It would, of course, be inappropriate to sentence the accused as if he breached by drinking and committing a violent offence. As LeBel J. noted in Ipeelee: (at para. 91)… A fit sentence should seek to manage the risk of reoffence he continues to pose to the community in a manner that addresses his alcohol abuse, rather than punish him for what might have been. To engage in the latter would certainly run afoul of the principles of fundamental justice.[25]That said, the condition of his LTSO that the accused abstain from alcohol is a key to managing the risk that he will reoffend. I am very concerned by “what it portends in light of the offender's entire history of criminal conduct”. (Ipeelee at para. 55)[26]I have considered the potential impact of a further period of incarceration on the rehabilitation of the accused. I do not share the concern expressed by defence counsel that further incarceration may compromise the accused’s progress. Gladue factors have contributed to the accused’s pattern of alcohol abuse, and accordingly reduce his blameworthiness for this offence. However, it is my view that protection of the public and deterrence are the sentencing objectives that should be given the greatest weight in this case.[27]Having taken all of these factors into account, I sentence the accused to 15 months. In my view, that sentence is consistent with the principles and purposes of sentencing, including the principle of parity, which calls for a longer sentence than those imposed in Ipeelee. The accused shall receive 11 months credit for the time spent in custody since July 27, 2015, for the reasons specified in Bourdon.[28]The accused shall pay a victim fine surcharge of $200, within 90 days of his release from custody.J.B.A. BARRINGTON-FOOTE"}

J. TOMKINS, J[1]On August 5, 2008, three young men reported to the Regina Police Service that they had been robbed the evening before.They had been walking by a residential park when a man called them over.It is conceded that the man was the accused, Chad Rogers, and that he was very intoxicated.[2]When the young men did not come after he called to them, Mr. Rogers asked them whether they were scared and suggested that they should be.He jumped in front of them and demanded theirmoney, threatening that someone would be hurt if they did not give it.[3]When the first young man responded that he had no money, Mr. Rogers hit him in the face.The second young man showed his wallet and that it was empty; Mr. Rogers knocked receipts from his hand and punched him in the face.He then hit the first young man again.[4]In the meantime, Mr. Rogers had realized that the third young man was related to a friend of his and sent him away.No threats were made to him, nor was money demanded from him.Instead, he went to the mutual friend who came to the scene and settled events.[5]Neither of the young men suffered significant injury as a result of the violence used against them.[6]Based on these incidents, Mr. Rogers was charged that he, with intent to steal Canadian currency, used violence toward Thomas Wilkes and Terry Selinger and thereby committed the offence of robbery, contrary to section 344(b) of the Criminal Code.Mr. Rogers pleaded guilty to this charge.[7]I must fix an appropriate sentence for Mr. Rogers.Personal Circumstances of the Accused, Chad Rogers[8]Mr. Rogers is 29 years old and was 27 at the time of this offence.[9]He has a prior record, both as a youth and an adult, including three convictions involving violence. The most recent of these, and the only such conviction as an adult, was for common assault almost ten years ago.His most recent convictions were made in November 2010.[10]Mr. Rogers is the third child in a hard-working family and his behaviour was challenging and distressing for them for some time.However, his mother provided a letter in which she says that he has “done a complete turnaround” in the last 3 ½ years.She says that whereas he used to associate with questionable people, he is now settled with a wonderful woman and works hard at his job.She says the family is proud of him and it is implicit in her letter that there was a significant period of time when she could not have said this.[11]I was also provided a letter from Mr. Rogers’ employer.He says that Mr. Rogers has worked at his bar and grill since April 2010 and is a very valued employee.While he began in more menial roles, he has worked hard and willingly and is now a strong leader in the workplace.He is seen as reliable and trustworthy.He will be welcomed back when his sentence has been completed.Submissions of Counsel[12]For the Crown, Ms. Calvert drew my attention to R. v. McKay[1] where a sentence of two years less a day was imposed.Based on that case and the fact that the circumstances in McKay were more serious than those before me, the Crown admits that an appropriate sentence for Mr. Rogers will be less than that imposed on Mr. McKay.She suggests a sentence of 18 months incarceration.[13]Mr. Behler, on the other hand, submitted that Mr. Rogers’ offence is on the lower end of the scale for robbery and urged me to consider a sentence in the range of three to nine months incarceration, followed by probation.Analysis[14]In imposing a sentence for Mr. Rogers, I must be mindful of the purposes and objectives of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code.[15]Section 718 states that the fundamental purposes of sentencing are to contribute to respect for the law and to maintain a just, peaceful and safe society.The objectives of sentencing are:·denunciation of unlawful conduct;·deterring the offender and others from committing offences;·separating offenders from society, when necessary;·assisting in the rehabilitation of offenders;·promoting a sense of responsibility in offenders;·providing reparations for harm done to victims or the community; and·acknowledging the harm done to victims and to the community.[16]Sections 718.1 and 718.2 set out principles that must be applied in determining an appropriate sentence.The following of the principles are most applicable to this matter:·The sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.·The sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances; and·The sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender.[17]In Mr. Rogers’ case, there are a number of aggravating factors.His offence involved the use of violence and, equally offensive, the instillation of fear in his three victims.The violence was entirely gratuitous as the three young men did not have any money and told Mr. Rogers so; the infliction of injury did not and could not yield the result Mr. Rogers sought.[18]Mr. Rogers has a significant record both as a youth and adult, including one conviction for common assault and two for assault with a weapon.His record also shows convictions for, among many others, uttering threats, weapon possession, property offences and obstruction.[19]In mitigation, however, I note that the most recent conviction involving violence was for common assault and that conviction is almost ten years old. The weapons-related charges are years older than that.His most recent property-related offence is also almost ten years old.[20]His November 2010 convictions are in regard to offences that occurred between 2003 and 2007.Including this conviction, which involves an offence in August 2008, he has no record for offences at all in the last two and a half years.[21]I think it mitigating that the offence was neither sophisticated nor premeditated and that no weapons were involved.I am also impressed that Mr. Rogers personally apologized to his victims some time ago.[22]Mr. Rogers’ counsel says that Mr. Rogers finally “gets it” and that he is unlikely to return to the pattern of criminal conduct that his record suggests.I have reason to believe that this is not puffery.[23]First, I am mindful of the emotional but apparently honest words of Mr. Rogers’ mother, suggesting that he has turned himself around in recent years.Her submission is supported by the fact that there are no offences, including this one, after August 2008.It is also supported by the very positive letter of reference provided by Mr. Rogers’ employer; he does not describe a man who is walking a downward path.[24]Against these factors, I turn to sentencing decisions in other cases.[25]The Crown urged me to consider R. v. McKay, supra.I agree with the Crown that the case involves circumstances that are more serious than those before me.[26]Mr. McKay approached two mentally-challenged boys near an autoteller.Mr. McKay accosted the older of them and demanded $100.00.The victim did not have this amount but offered the few cents he had in his pocket.Mr. McKay refused the offer.He pushed the younger brother and punched the victim in the face.A passerby intervened and held Mr. McKay until the police arrived.[27]Mr. McKay was on bail for an offence of violence – aggravated assault – at the time of this offence.His bail conditions included a curfew and abstinence; he was in breach of both of these conditions, as well as that to keep the peace and be of good behaviour, at the time of this offence.[28]Also, Mr. McKay, while only 22 years old, had a relatively lengthy record including at least 35 convictions.[29]These factors, plus the fact that his victims were visibly vulnerable, render Mr. McKay’s offence more serious.[30]Other cases submitted for my consideration include R. v. Cheekinew[2], R. v. Peepeetch[3], R. v. Pakula[4], R. v. Smallboy[5], R. v. Hunter[6] and R. v. Moorehead[7].In each of these casesthe robberies involved some or all of: weapons, more serious assaults with more serious consequences to the victims and offenders with more serious records.All involve multiple assailants against single victims.It is likely for these reasons that in all but two - Cheekinew and Pakula - the Court of Appeal imposed or upheld sentences in excess of that sought by the Crown in this case.[31]Mr. Rogers’ offence is distinguished in that it involves none of these factors.Given this and the fact that the Crown does not seek a sentence exceeding 18 months incarceration,I turn to the two authorities that imposed sentences within the range the Crown seeks in this case.[32]In Cheekinew, the Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of 18 months incarceration.Mr. Cheekinew and his brother approached the victim and asked for cigarettes and money.When the victim declined, Mr. Cheekinew grabbed him, rifled his pockets and took a water bottle from him.The victim tried to flee onto the bus but before he did, Mr. Cheekinew punched him with such force that his tooth was chipped and his right eye was swollen.Mr. Cheekinew’s record included two prior convictions for robbery.Clearly, Mr. Cheekinew’s circumstances and those of the offence are more aggravated than those in the case before me.[33]In Pakula, the offender and four others drove alongside the victim who was riding a bike.When the victim rebuked him, the offender chased him down.Another man from the car told the victim to stop “lipping off” and pushed him, causing him to fall off the bike.Mr. Pakula then showed a pair of scissors and threatened to use them if the victim did not surrender the bike.Fortunately, the victim was able to ride away.[34]Believing this was Mr. Pakula’s first offence, the trial judge suspended sentence and placed Mr. Pakula on probation for one year.In fact, Mr. Pakula had misled the court.He had nine previous convictions, at least five of which were related.By the time his appeal was heard, he had completed five months in a community training centre.Taking this into account, the Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal and imposed a sentence of ten months’ incarceration followed by two years of probation.[35]I have also considered R. v. Rollheiser[8].Mr. Rollheiser and two others, after an afternoon of drinking, went for a walk.They came upon and approached a group of six boys under 16 years of age.In a menacing manner, Mr. Rollheiser and his co-accused threatened and intimidated the young boys over a period of 30 to 45 minutes. Eventually one of the boys offered to give them money.The accused and his co-accused took it and demanded more.Two of the others anted up small amounts.By this point the young boys were able to run and they did.[36]This robbery and a concurrent conviction for assault were Mr. Rollheiser’s first criminal offences.He had a supportive family and was considered a low risk to re-offend.A sentence of 90 days incarceration followed by one year probation was upheld by the Court of Appeal.[37]Counsel are agreed that there will be a custodial sentence in this case.I agree.A non-custodial sentence in these circumstances and given the record of this accused could not be supported.[38]I am satisfied that an appropriate sentence will be significantly lower than that imposed in McKay but certainly higher than that in Rollheiser.Of the authorities provided, I find Rollheiser and Pakula most instructive.[39]I have considered the sentences imposed in those cases - 90 days and ten months - and the favourable and aggravating factors that distinguish those cases from Mr. Rogers’ case.I have also considered the aggravating factors at play in this case, but also the many mitigating factors.[40]In fixing an appropriate sentence for Mr. Rogers, I am satisfied that the sentence ought not to be so long as to irreparably disrupt Mr. Rogers’ progress toward rehabilitation but must adequately denounce his conduct and deter others.[41]I am also mindful that Mr. Rogers’ actions on the day of this offence, and indeed for virtually all of his record, were influenced by alcohol.He has a problem with alcohol which he has apparently had some success keeping under control.It is critical to his rehabilitation that he receive assistance with his efforts in this respect.Primarily for this reason, a period of probation will follow his incarceration.Keeping totality in mind, the period of incarceration must be such as to reflect the additional penalty of probation.[42]For all of these reasons, Mr. Rogers will be sentenced to a period of six months incarceration, followed by a period of 12 months probation.[43]The terms of the probation will be that he:·keep the peace and be of good behaviour;·attend Court as and when required by the Court;·report to Probation Services within three working days of his release from custody and thereafter report as required by his probation officer;·abide by all reasonable and lawful instructions of his probation officer, including any instruction that he attend for assessment, counselling and/or programming for substance abuse; and·if referred for assessment, counselling or programming for substance abuse, participate actively and not behave in such manner as might cause him to be dismissed therefrom.[44]There will be an order under section 109 of the Criminal Code prohibiting Mr. Rogers from possessing any firearm, cross-bow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition or explosive substance or all such things.[45]There will be an order under section 487.051 requiring Mr. Rogers to provide the number of samples of bodily substances that is reasonably required for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis.[46]In light of the imposition of a custodial sentence, there will be no Victim Impact Surcharge imposed.Comment[47]Mr. Rogers’ mother urged me not to impose a custodial sentence.She suggested, in effect, that it would serve no purpose.I understand her position – that her son has changed his ways and is living a positive lifestyle.She sees no benefit if this is disrupted.[48]In imposing a suitable sentence, I must be mindful of purposes well beyond Mr. Rogers’ current circumstances.I must consider the seriousness of the offence and robbery is certainly serious.Mr. Rogers must accept responsibility and be accountable.[49]I must consider deterrence, not just for Mr. Rogers but for others who might commit similar offences.Of course, I must also consider Mr. Rogers’ rehabilitation but this is only one factor among many that must be balanced.[50]I believe the sentence I have imposed addresses all relevant principles and objectives in a balanced manner.Dated at Regina, Saskatchewan this 17th day of February, 2011.______________________________________B.

FISHMARIE DESCHAMPS, JJ.A.ERNEST JANTUAH,APPELLANT - accusedv.HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN,RESPONDENT - prosecutrixOPINION OF FISH, J.A.IErnest Jantuah pleaded guilty on April 7, 1993, to a charge of importing into Canada approximately 475 grams of heroin.For that offence, he was sentenced on June 3 to imprisonment for 10 years.Pursuant to article 741.2 of the Criminal Code, the judge also ordered that Jantuah serve one half of his sentence before he may be released on full parole.He gave no specific reasons for doing so.On June 22, 1993, Jantuah notified the Crown of his intention to appeal the order made against him under section 741.2 of the Code.His motion for leave did not question the fitness of the sentence itself and, to that extent, did not put the 10-year term of imprisonment in issue.Four months later, on October 20, 1993, the Crown advised appellant that it would urge this Court to increase the 10-year sentence.At the hearing of the appeal on December 8, 1993, we granted the appellant's motion for leave and reserved judgment on the two remaining issues:first, as to the order made by the judge under section 741.2;second, as to the Crown's application for a more severe sentence.On the first issue, this appeal is governed by R. v. Dankyi, C.A.M., 1993 CanLII 4283 (QC CA), 500-10-000158-939, November 15, 1993, J.E. 93-1940, andR. v. Leblanc, C.A.M., 1993 CanLII 4287 (QC CA), 500-10-000285-930, November 17, 1993, which were both decided after the Judge had imposed sentence in this case.For the very reasons set out in Dankyi and Leblanc, the order made against Jantuah under section 741.2 of the Code cannot stand.Accordingly, I would set it aside.In dealing with the second issue, I shall assume, without deciding, that we are entitled, under the authority of Hill v. The Queen (No. 2) (1975), 1975 CanLII 38 (SCC), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 6 (S.C.C.), to increase the appellant's sentence on an appeal by him against the order made under Section 741.2 of the Criminal Code.I shall assume as well that we can properly permit the Crown, more than four months after sentence has been rendered, to place the fitness of the sentence in issue for the first time, and this without the Court's leave and without an extension of delays.IIThe Crown's notice raises the following grounds:a)la nature du crime:importation de stupéfiant.b)la nature du stupéfiant:héroïne.c)la quantité:475 grammes.d)le degré de pureté du stupéfiant.e)la valeur du stupéfiant sur le marché.f)l'implication de l'appelant dans le crime commis.g)le désir de donner effet à la volonté réelle du juge de première instance, telle que manifestée lors de l'imposition de la sentence.At the hearing of the appeal, Crown counsel quite properly abandoned ground g), recognizing that it was untenable on the face of the record:in imposing sentence, the judge gave his reasons for fixing a 10-year term of imprisonment without any reference at all to section 741.2 of Criminal Code.Only afterward,in response to the Crown's request, did the judge make an order under that section.With respect to grounds d), e), and f), the record provides no basis for intervention.The purity and value of the narcotic were dealt with perfunctorily, if at all, at trial.As to the implication of the appellant in the crime that concerns us, there is some evidence concerning his apparently uncommon skill in ingesting and expelling heroin-laden condoms with speed and efficiency.There is also ground for suspicion, arising out of entries in the appellant's passport, that he has on more than one occasion travelled international routes said to be favoured by traffickers in narcotics.This might well justify serious doubt whether the appellant was engaged in his first nefarious adventure, but it does not in my view establish that he was anything more than a courier.The more difficult question is whether, on the remaining grounds ── gravity of the crime, harmfulness of heroin, and quantity involved in this case ── the sentence imposed is inadequate and therefore requires correction.The appellant, it should be noted, was detained for nearly six months prior to receiving his sentence, which is thus equivalent to an 11-year term.More severe sentences have been either imposed or confirmed by this Court.Generally speaking, however, the more severe sentences have involved significantly larger quantities of heroin.Where sentences of 15 years have been imposed in Superior Court or on appeal, the reported quantities were in most instances three or more times greater than in this case:see Chetrit, CAM 1990 CanLII 2990 (QC CA), 500-10-000171-866, December 11, 1990, J.E. 91-166, 2.6 kilos;Hooter, SCT 700-01-002349-929, December 21, 1992, 3.06 kilos;Yazdani (1993), 50 QAC 288, 3 kilos;Brullo (1989), 16 QAC 136, 1.5 kilos.Both here and elsewhere in Canada, sentences of 12 years' imprisonment or less have not been unusual:Mediratta (1988), 29 OAC 333, 7 years;Sair, QL reference [1988] O.J. No. 1428, Nelson-Kent, BCCA No. 009032, June 3, 1988, 12 years;Setoudah, C.A.M. 1988 CanLII 1292 (QC CA), 500-10-000368-884, December 7, 1988, J.E. 89-275, 42 months;Tsoi and Chan (1982), 36 A R 606 (QB), 12 and 10 years;Lagos, BCCA No. CA 002009, October 16, 1984, 10 years;Marshall, BCCA No. CA V00730, November 15, 1988, 5 years.Some of these cases involved less than a pound of heroin;in others, the quantity was much greater.In Mediratta, for example, the accused had imported 3.64 pounds of heroin having an estimated street value of one to three million dollars.Speaking for the Court, Zuber J.A. considered that a seven-year sentence was justified because the drug was heroin, the quantity was large, and the sole motivation was lucre.This statement was expressly approved by the Ontario Court of Appeal in Sair, which involved an even larger quantity than Mediratta, valued at 4.8 million dollars.Dubin A.C.J.O. (now C.J.O.) and McKinley and Griffiths JJ.A. were, in Sair, \"all of the view... that the sentence of seven years was a fit and proper one\".IIIAssuming without deciding, as I said earlier, that we are entitled on this appeal by Jantuah to increase his sentence at the request of the Crown, I would decline to do so.In relation to other sentences imposed in this jurisdiction for like offences committed in similar circumstances, a 10-year term of imprisonment does not appear severe, even after six months of preventive detention.Nor, on the other hand, was it so strikingly inadequate as to provoke a timely appeal by the Crown.In the result, I would allow Jantuah's appeal and set aside the order made against him under section 741.2 of the Criminal Code.I would decline to increase the sentence, as requested by the Crown, since I am not persuaded that 10 years' imprisonment is, in the circumstances of this case, an unfit punishment, within the meaning of section 687(1) of the Criminal Code.MORRIS J.

(orally)[1]The appellant pled guilty to one count of fraud exceeding $200 and one count of attempted fraud exceeding $5,000.The date of the first offence occurred between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 1980 and the second offence occurred between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2000.He was sentenced to 14 months in jail and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $10,273.77.[2]Both the charges arose out of the appellant misrepresenting to the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (“SCIC”) the amount of acreage he actually seeded.[3]The restitution order was based on the total claim made on the four quarters of farmland the appellant owned.In fact, the over-claimed acreage was only on one quarter section and the amount actually defrauded was $3,457.28.The Crown agreed, and correctly, the appeal should be allowed to the extent of correcting the restitution order but argued the sentence of incarceration was a fit sentence.[4]The second false claim giving rise to the attempted fraud was discovered before it was paid out and SCIC refused to indemnify the appellant. Had the false claim been paid out it would have amounted to $24,934.60.[5]The appellant claims his sentence is unfit because it fails to recognize the principle of parity, that is, the sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.He further argues he ought to have received a conditional sentence.[6]At the sentencing hearing defence counsel and the Crown agreed the sentence should be 18 months and the argument presented to the sentencing judge was whether the sentence should be a conditional sentence or incarceration.Given the agreed submission as to the length of sentence the issue of parity was never argued before the sentencing judge.[7]The sentencing judge clearly addressed the need for denunciation and deterrence when crimes such as these are committed.People who take dishonest advantage of publicly funded programs of this nature undermine the integrity of the very programs themselves.Crop Insurance relies on farmers to provide accurate production information.In R. v. Frampton,[1] Tallis J.A. had this to say:[2]…In this case the learned trial judge emphasized the importance of deterrence (in its widest sense) in the following passage:This is a case where deterrence of others is of paramount consideration.Farmers who defraud Saskatchewan Crop Insurance are stealing from their friends and neighbours, and must absorb the loss by paying increased crop insurance premiums.As well, the fraud constitutes a huge breach of faith because Crop Insurance adjusters trust that farmers will provide accurate production information.The trust element is integral to adjusting the loss, in that it is relatively simple for unscrupulous farmers to beat the system.It is necessary that the farming community should understand that a conviction for cheating Saskatchewan Crop Insurance will attract harsh consequences.Those who sample the easy pickings of Sask. Crop Insurance must pay a painful price.[8]The type of sentences for crimes of this nature range from a conditional sentence in R. v. Moulton[2] to a period of incarceration of 22 months in R. v. Traynor[3] depending on the usual factors including the amount defrauded.[9]In R. v. Chubey[4] where the accused unlawfully obtained an extension of credit in the amount of $41,875 the term of imprisonment was set at five months on appeal.In R. v. Clay[5] where the accused unlawfully obtained an extension of credit in the amount of approximately $90,000 he was sentenced to a term of five months imprisonment on appeal.A sentence of six months incarceration was upheld in Frampton where the amount of the fraud against SCIC was $17,700; and in R. v. Rezansoff[6] where the accused attempted to collect from Crop Insurance $10,000 to which he was not entitled, the Court upheld a sentence of six months imprisonment.[10]We are all of the view the sentence below was unfit and a term of incarceration of seven months is appropriate in the circumstances.Deterrence of others must continue to be of paramount consideration when these crimes are committed.The appellant defrauded the Corporation once and attempted to do it again.[11]As stated above, the Crown conceded that the restitution order should be reduced to $3,457.28 from $10,273.77.If the full amount has already been paid, there will be an order directing a refund to the appellant for the difference.The appeal therefore is allowed and a sentence of seven months incarceration is imposed and the restitution order is set at $3,457.28.[1] (1997), 1997 CanLII 9756 (SK CA), 152 Sask.

These offences occurred during incidents between October 20th, and October 23rd, 2010 at or near 737 Fern Drive, in Beaverbank, Nova Scotia. The issue for the court is to determine a fit and proper sentence in all of the circumstances of this offence and this particular offender.[2]The Crown recommends a jail sentence of 90 days followed by a period of probation of 2 years, a section 110 Criminal Code firearms order for 5 years and a DNA order under section 487.051 of the Code since the assault and threats charges are secondary designated offences.[3]Defence counsel submits that, in all of the circumstances of the case, a fit and proper sentence would be a conditional sentence order in the range of 6 months followed by a period of probation for 18 months. The Defence has no objection to the ancillary orders.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCES:[4]During the early morning hours of October 21, 2010, Mr. Sydney went to 737 Fern Drive in Beaverbank, Nova Scotia which was the residence of his former partner, Pamela Harris. Ms. Harris is the mother of their son, William, who is 3 years old and resides with his mother. Mr. Sydney was intoxicated when he attended at his former partner’s residence. He did not have a key to get in the residence and started banging on the door to gain entry. Ms. Harris let him in and scolded him for arriving at that late hour as their son William was at home and still awake because he was sick. Ms. Harris and Mr. Sydney got into a verbal argument about his banging on the door. He became more irate when she called him a “loser” and he eventually threatened to “bash in” her head and to harm her father.[5]Mr. Sydney refused to leave the residence and eventually grabbed the area of Ms. Harris’ head and neck and threw her to the floor. Defence counsel contends that her client did not place Ms. Harris in a “headlock.” However, Defence counsel says that Mr. Sydney did attempt to hug Ms. Harris and pick her up. During that contact, his arms accidentally slipped up to her neck and as she resisted him, he let go of her and she slipped and fell to the floor. In response to questions by the court for clarification, although there is a dispute as to the exact manner in which Mr. Sydney applied force to Ms. Harris, it was agreed by counsel that Ms. Harris had not consented to any direct application of force by Mr. Sydney which caused her to fall to the floor.[6]The Crown also contends that the assault of Ms. Harris by Mr. Sydney caused air to be cut off to her lungs for a second, however, that potentially aggravating factor is disputed by Defence counsel who submits that if it did occur, then that act was not intended, but was completely accidental. Since this remains a disputed fact, I do not rely on it as an aggravating fact as it has not been established by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt pursuant to section 724(3)(e) of the Criminal Code.[7]In addition, during his recitation of the facts, the Crown Attorney indicated that there was no bruising, no visible bleeding and that Ms. Harris was not hospitalized. However, the Crown Attorney noted, in reviewing the Victim Impact Statement, that Ms. Harris had stated that there was bruising on her neck from the assault. Defence counsel maintains that the disclosed facts upon which her client entered his guilty plea did not contain any reference to bruising, and that this alleged fact was only disclosed well after her client entered his guilty pleas. On further submissions by counsel in relation to this point, Defence counsel added that her client accepted responsibility for the assault of Ms. Harris and therefore, the Defence does not take issue with the fact that some bruising occurred as a result of Mr. Sydney’s assault of Ms. Harris.[8]At the time when Mr. Sydney assaulted Ms. Harris at 737 Fern Drive in Beaverbank, Nova Scotia, he was subject to a probation order made September 11, 2009 which prohibited him from going to that residence. As a result of Mr. Sydney going to the residence of Ms. Harris between the dates alleged in the Information, without her permission, he breached one of the terms of his probation order.[9]Mr. Sydney spent 2 days on remand before he was released on a Recognizance, dated October 25, 2010, which contained a curfew to remain in his residence between the hours of 10 PM and 6 AM the following day, 7 days per week. Defence counsel submitted that these 2 days in custody had a salutary effect on her client. The Recognizance was varied on February 16, 2011 to allow Mr. Sydney to contact Ms. Harris by telephone for the purpose of arranging access to their child, William, or as set out in a Family Court order.DEVELOPMENTS AFTER SUBMISSIONS OF COUNSEL:[10]The facts and circumstances of the offences relied upon by the Crown and the submissions of counsel were made on September 11, 2012 and I reserved my decision on sentencing to September 21, 2012. At the outset of the court’s hearing on September 21, 2012, Defence Counsel advised the court that there had been some recent developments, which had just come to her attention and were not known to her when counsel made their submissions. Defence counsel indicated that she was informed that Mr. Sydney was alleged to have breached a term of his Recognizance on September 7, 2012, but the charge in relation to that breach was only laid after the submissions of counsel on September 11, 2012. At Mr. Sydney’s first appearance in court on September 13, 2012, he entered a guilty plea to breaching a term of the Recognizance contrary to section 145(3) of the Code. He was sentenced to a term of 30 days in prison, to be served intermittently, commencing on September 21, 2012.[11]As a result of that intermittent sentence having been imposed by the court, Defence Counsel advised that Mr. Sydney has lost the employment as a chef at the restaurant where he would have been working under the “Red Seal” program. Counsel stated that her client believes that he has another job lined up if the court was to impose a conditional sentence order in this case. Defence counsel also indicated that, if the court ordered a jail sentence of 90 days as recommended by the Crown so that the sentence could be served on an intermittent basis, there would be a significant consequence for her client. Counsel stated that, if this court was to order a jail sentence which, when combined with the 30 day sentence imposed on September 13, 2012, exceeded 90 day limit for sentences served on an intermittent basis, the consequence of this court’s order would result in an aggregate sentence requiring Mr. Sydney to serve that sentence on a straight time basis in a correctional centre. In that event, her client would not be able to work and his ability to make financial support payments for his son would be impacted.[12]Defence counsel also added that since the initial submissions were made on September 11, 2012, the parties have appeared in Family Court and it is now quite clear that Ms. Harris does not wish to have any direct or indirect contact with Mr. Sydney. In addition, counsel also advised the court that the Family Court order does allow for access to their child, William, through an agreed-upon 3rd party. The recent proceedings in the Family Court have clarified Ms. Harris’ position with respect to the issue of ongoing contact or communication with Mr. Sydney.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER:[13]Mr. Sydney is currently 34 years old. In June 2008, he started dating Ms. Pamela Harris, now age 35, who is the victim of the assault and threats charge. Mr. Sydney and Ms. Harris have a 3-year-old son, William, and at the time of the preparation of the Pre-Sentence Report, it was reported that Mr. Sydney and Ms. Harris had an amicable relationship and that he saw his son on a regular basis. In the last few months, Mr. Sydney has commenced a relationship with another woman who has 2 children, aged 7 and 4, from a previous relationship. Mr. Sydney reported that their relationship is quite positive and that their relationship has progressed to the point where they would like to reside together.[14]During his formative years, Mr. Sydney reported that he suffered physical abuse at the hands of his father and was placed in various foster homes between age 11 and age 16. His sister confirmed the difficulties of his childhood and that Mr. Sydney has anger management issues which may have originated from their father, who also had anger management issues.[15]Mr. Sydney had been working as a chef for a number of years and at the time of the submissions, he was working with a chef at a new restaurant under the Nova Scotia Community College’s “red seal” program. As a chef, he was required to work at the restaurants on the weekends, and Defence counsel noted that if he was to be ordered to serve a jail sentence, even on an intermittent basis, he would likely lose his job. He was now paid a salary of $13 per hour and from that, he was voluntarily providing some financial assistance to Ms. Harris to help with expenses for his son. At the time of the submissions of counsel, there was no court order for custody, access or child support for his son.[16]Mr. Sydney has a prior, related criminal record. On June 4, 2009, he was granted a 9 month conditional discharge for an assault contrary to section 266(b) of the Code which occurred between December 22, 2007 and March 22, 2008. It is not clear from the Pre-sentence report or the JEIN Offender Summary Report whether this assault charge involved a common-law partner. However, on September 11, 2009, it is clear that he was sentenced for 2 offences - a spousal assault contrary to section 266 of the Code which involved Ms. Harris and a breach of probation contrary to section 733.1(1)(a) of the Code.For these subsequent offences, which occurred between July 12, 2009 and September 8, 2009, Mr. Sydney was ordered to serve a conditional sentence order of 4 months followed by a period of probation of one year. Mr. Sydney was subject to the terms of that probation order, at the time of the current offences.[17]Since October 2010, Mr. Sydney has been subject to the terms and conditions of a Recognizance under which he was released on bail and required to observe a curfew as well as other conditions. There had been no breaches of that Recognizance between October 25, 2010 and September 7, 2012.VICTIM IMPACT:[18]Ms. Harris completed a victim impact statement on September 6, 2012. In it, she reports bruising on her neck and stress related symptoms, such as gaining weight, hair loss and feelings of anxiety and fatigue as a result of worrying for her safety and that of her family. She missed some days at work, has attended counseling sessions through her employee assistance program and is concerned that she will be harassed by Mr. Sydney. At the same time, Ms. Harris expresses psychological concerns for financial security, loneliness and avoidance by friends as a result of the breakdown of her relationship with Mr. Sydney.[19]During the sentencing submissions, I noted that the Victim Impact Statement contained remarks which indicated a significant discrepancy from the remarks attributed to her in the Pre-Sentence Report. In the Pre-Sentence report which was prepared on August 23, 2012, the probation officer stated that Ms. Harris had indicated that she still has contact with Mr. Sydney and that they were getting along well in the interests of their son. Ms. Harris was noted to have said that she did not feel Mr. Sydney was a threat to her and therefore did not believe that there was any need for a no contact condition to be ordered by the court at this time. However, Ms. Harris’ position with respect to any ongoing direct or indirect contact and communication with Mr. Sydney has now been clarified following the receipt of her Victim Impact Statement and the recent Family Court proceedings.AGGRAVATING AND MITIGATING FACTORS:[20]In the Crown’s submission, a term of imprisonment is the fit and proper sentence given the aggravating factors which are present in this case. The Crown Attorney submits that the court should emphasize specific and general deterrence, denunciation of the unlawful conduct and the statutory aggravating factor contained in section 718.2(a)(ii) of the Code, that is, that there was evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused his common-law partner. The Crown also points to the aggravating factors that Mr. Sydney had committed 2 prior assaults and that at least one of them involved Ms. Harris. In terms of that spousal assault, Mr. Sydney was sentenced on September 11, 2009 to a conditional sentence order of 4 months, followed by a period of one year on probation. Furthermore, the Crown says that it is an aggravating factor that, at the time of this incident, Mr. Sydney was subject to the terms of a probation order which required him to stay away from the residence of Ms. Harris.[21]Defence counsel, in her submissions, acknowledges that her client’s actions represent a loss of self-control and completely unacceptable behavior. In terms of mitigating factors, counsel submits that the court should note that her client accepts full responsibility for his actions, entered an early guilty plea, is remorseful, wishes to apologize to Ms. Harris and has made numerous positive changes in his life. Since the incident, he has stopped drinking alcohol and completed the “New Start” program with respect to anger management, particularly within intimate relationships. Mr. Sydney has been subject to and fully complied with a curfew in a Recognizance for approximately 2 years which required him to be in his residence between the hours of 10 PM and 6 AM subject to limited exceptions. Furthermore, Defence counsel submits that Mr. Sydney’s ability to comply with the terms of his Recognizance for that period of time demonstrates that he has the ability to comply with terms and conditions of a conditional sentence order.[22]Defence counsel submits that the primary purposes and principles of sentencing under section 718, 718.1 and 718.2 of the Code which are relevant in this case should have an equal focus on specific and general deterrence as well as rehabilitation of the offender and promoting a sense of responsibility in addition to acknowledging the harm done to the victim. Counsel also submits that the 2 days her client served on remand had a salutary effect and that Mr. Sydney should not be ordered to serve a sentence in jail, since a less restrictive sanction would be appropriate in all of the circumstances of this case.[23]In terms of promoting a sense of responsibility, Counsel stated that Mr. Sydney had recently obtained a position as a chef and that he was in the “Red Seal” Program, an apprenticeship program through the Nova Scotia Community College. In that program, he would be eligible to earn a Certificate of Apprenticeship if he continued to work with the head chef at that restaurant. Defence counsel stated that her client has now lost the job that he had at the time of the submissions of counsel due to the imposition of the intermittent sentence on September 13, 2012. However, if the court was to order a conditional sentence of imprisonment, Mr. Sydney has lined up another job as a chef and therefore, his ability to pay child support to Ms. Harris for their son would not be affected.IMPACT OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS ON SENTENCING:[24]The first issue which arises from the recent imposition of the 30 day intermittent sentence for the breach of the curfew condition contained in the Recognizance made on October 25, 2010, is whether that additional fact should be taken into account in this sentencing decision. In this regard, section 725(1) of the Criminal Code permits the sentencing court to consider other offences for which the defendant has already been found guilty or with consent of the prosecution and the defence, to consider other offences to which the offender consents to plead guilty and to pass sentence for those offences.[25]In R. v. Angelillo, 2006 SCC 55 (CanLii) (CanLII), the Supreme Court of Canada examined section 725(1) of the Code with regard to new charges which were alleged to have been committed while the offender was awaiting the sentencing decision, but which came to light after the accused was sentenced on the other charges of a similar nature. Charron J. points out in para. 24 that there are many provisions of the Criminal Code under which evidence that is capable of showing that the offender has committed another offence can be admitted at a sentencing hearing. For example, there is section 721(3)(b) of the Code which provides that, unless otherwise specified by the court, any Pre-Sentence Report must contain the history of prior convictions.[26]In Angelillo, supra, Justice Charron concludes in para. 24 that there is no doubt that the court may take prior convictions into account in determining the appropriate sentence. In doing so, the court must not punish the offender again for that other offence. The fundamental principle of proportionality requires that the sentence be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender; a prior conviction cannot, therefore, justify a disproportionate sentence.[27]Madam Justice Charron also points out in paragraph 32 of Angelillo, supra, that the sentencing court must be careful in considering extrinsic facts from other concluded or uncharged offences to ensure that the court is considering those facts for the purpose of establishing the offender’s character and reputation or risk of reoffending for the purpose of determining the appropriate sentence for the offence of which he or she has been convicted. In providing a practical example of how this extrinsic evidence may be considered, it is interesting to note that Justice Charron utilized the example of a man who has assaulted his spouse and that extrinsic evidence may be adduced at the sentencing hearing by the party who seeks to rely on the relevant fact to demonstrate that the act was either an isolated incident or that the person was a violent offender.[28]If this extrinsic evidence relates to an uncharged incident that has not been determined by the court, Charron J. states that if the extrinsic evidence is contested, the prosecution must prove it beyond a reasonable doubt (See s. 724(3)(e) Code). In addition, the sentencing judge must exclude otherwise relevant evidence if its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value such that the offender’s right to a fair trial is jeopardized: See Angelillo, supra, at para.32.[29]As a result, I am satisfied that Mr. Sydney’s subsequent conviction and sentence under section 145(3) of the Code for the breach of the curfew condition contained in his Recognizance, which occurred after submissions in this case, but before my sentencing decision, is properly before me.[30]As Charron J. pointed out in Angelillo, I must consider the subsequent s. 145(3) Code conviction in determining the offender’s character and reputation, his ability to potentially comply with the terms of a conditional sentence order if I was to impose one as well as his risk of reoffending for the purpose of determining the appropriate sentence for the offences before the court today. Again, it is important to note that the sentence ordered today must be proportionate to the gravity of those offences and Mr. Sydney’s degree of responsibility.[31]A second issue which arises as a result of these recent developments is the potential impact of the prior 30 day intermittent sentence on the possibility of the court ordering a conditional sentence order. This issue relates to the interpretation and context of ordering intermittent sentences under section 732 of the Code and whether or not a subsequent conditional sentence order has the effect of collapsing an intermittent sentence into a straight time period of incarceration in a custodial facility. This issue was addressed in the case of R. v. Middleton, 2009 SCC 21 (CanLii) (CanLII) where the court held that imposing a conditional sentence of more than 90 days cannot render illegal the unexpired intermittent sentence imposed on the same offender for a different offence. The Court also noted that it is irrelevant whether the sentence to be served on an intermittent basis preceded or followed the conditional sentence order. Since each type of sentence has its own specific purpose, intermittent and conditional sentences can be effectively combined to take advantage of their complementary purposes: see Middleton, supra, para’s 45-53.[32]After having considered the Middleton decision, supra, I am satisfied that one of the sentencing options that is still available is the imposition of a conditional sentence order to be served in the community when Mr. Sydney is not serving his intermittent sentence of imprisonment. However, I also note that if I were to order an intermittent sentence, it would have to be combined with the 30 day sentence for the s.145 (3) Criminal Code which was made on September 13, 2012. If the combined sentence exceeded the 90 day limit imposed by Parliament in section 732(1) of the Code, that aggregate sentence would be collapsed to a sentence to be served on a straight time basis.ANALYSIS:[33]At the outset of my analysis to determine a fit and proper sentence in the context of a spousal assault, it bears noting that domestic violence is a serious matter and, generally speaking, a sentence for a spousal assault must impress upon the offender and others that specific and general deterrence as well as denunciation of this unlawful conduct must be the paramount considerations.[34]As pointed out by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Inwood, [1989] O.J. No. 428 (OCA), “domestic assaults are not private matters, and spouses are entitled to protection from violence, just as much as strangers. This does not mean that in every instance of domestic violence a custodial term should be imposed, but that it should be normal where significant bodily harm has been inflicted, in order to repudiate and denounce such conduct.”[35]In R. v. Bates (2000), 2000 CanLII 5759 (ON CA), 146 CCC (3rd) 321 (Ont. C.A.), the Court observed that the principles they expressed in Inwood remained equally applicable at that time and that courts have repeatedly recognized that offences of domestic violence are rarely isolated incidents. The victim is often subjected not only to continuing abuse, both physical and emotional, but also experiences perpetual fear of the offender. In fact, the principles established in those decisions are now statutorily recognized in section 718.2(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code.[36]Of course, in any sentencing decision, other sentencing principles require the court imposing a sentence to also take into account any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or to the offender: see section 718.2(a) of the Code. In this case, I find that there are several aggravating factors to consider:a)Mr. Sydney assaulted his common-law partner in her home;b)The assault was committed in the presence of their 3-year-old child;c)Mr. Sydney has a recent and related conviction for spousal assault involving Ms. Harris;d)At the time of the assault, Mr. Sydney was subject to terms of a probation order which prohibited him from going to the residence of Ms. Harris; ande)The statutory aggravating factors of abuse of a common-law partner and abuse of a position of trust in relation to the victim found in section 718.2(a) (ii) and (iii) of the Criminal Code.[37]I also find that there are several mitigating factors to consider:a)Mr. Sydney entered an early guilty plea;b)He recognized the effect that his misuse of alcohol had on his conduct and has taken steps on his own to stop drinking alcohol altogether;c)Mr. Sydney has taken and completed the “New Start” program for anger management in the context of domestic relationships;d)He has accepted full responsibility for the offence, is remorseful and wishes to apologize to Ms. Harris for his completely unacceptable behavior;e)He has been steadily employed over the years and has recently taken steps to earn an apprenticeship certificate as a chef and has provided child support to Ms. Harris on a voluntary basis;f)Mr. Sydney has been under restrictive terms of a Recognizance since October 25, 2010 which required him to remain in his residence subject to a curfew between the hours of 10 PM and 6 AM, 7 days a week, subject to very limited exceptions. There were no breaches of that Recognizance known to counsel at the time of the submissions of counsel, however, on September 13, 2012, Mr. Sydney pled guilty to breaching the curfew condition on September 7, 2012;g)The presentence report was generally positive and noted Mr. Sydney’s troubled upbringing, suffering physical abuse at the hands of his father and being placed in several foster homes.[38]In all sentencing decisions, determining a fit and proper sentence is highly contextual and is necessarily an individualized process which depends upon the circumstances of the offence and the particular circumstances of the specific offender. On this point, the Supreme Court of Canada stated, in R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 SCR 500 at paras. 91 and 92, that the determination of a just and appropriate sentence requires the trial judge to do a careful balancing of the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the gravity of the offence while at the same time taking into account the victim or victims and the needs and current conditions in the community.[39]I agree with both counsel that denunciation of the unlawful conduct and specific and general deterrence are important purposes and principles of sentencing in section 718 of the Code which must be considered in the context of domestic violence. In this case, given the circumstances of the offence and this particular offender, I find that my decision must also focus on sentencing purposes and principles which are focused on rehabilitating Mr. Sydney, promoting a sense of responsibility in him and acknowledging the harm done to the victim.[40]In the sentencing decision, it is also important for the court to consider the fundamental principle in sentencing expressed in section 718.1 of the Code which reminds judges that the sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. In this case, given the nature of the assault and injuries suffered by Ms. Harris, I find that the gravity of the offence is toward the lower end of a continuum of assaults. There was no evidence in this case that the assault was a prolonged attack, nor was there any evidence that the assault caused any significant or long-standing physical injuries to the victim. Furthermore, I have no evidence that this assault was one incident in a pattern of abuse of Ms. Harris which continued over an extended period of time.[41]In looking at other principles and purposes of sentencing found in section 718.2 of the Code, I am also required to consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances and not to deprive the offender of his liberty if a less restrictive sanction is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.[42]Defence counsel has submitted that it would be appropriate to order Mr. Sydney to be subject to the terms of a conditional sentence order. In R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 SCR 61, Chief Justice Lamer said at paragraph 102 that incarceration will usually provide more denunciation than a conditional sentence, but a conditional sentence can still provide a significant amount of denunciation. This is particularly so when onerous conditions are imposed and the duration of the conditional sentence is extended beyond the duration of the jail sentence that would ordinarily have been imposed in the circumstances. The Chief Justice also expressed similar remarks with respect to issue of deterrence and conditional sentence orders: see Proulx, supra, at para.107.[43]Pursuant to section 742.1 of the Criminal Code, the court must first conclude that a conditional sentence order is an available sanction, and if so, then the court must go on to consider whether it is an appropriate sanction. This latter consideration requires the court to be satisfied that the service of the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing set out in section 718 to 718.2 of the Code.[44]In this case, I find that a conditional sentence order is an available sanction which may be imposed by the court under section 742.1 of the Criminal Code as there is no maximum term of imprisonment or minimum term of imprisonment which would preclude the court from making a conditional sentence order of imprisonment to be served in the community. Furthermore, I conclude that a conditional sentence order is an available sanction since I find that an appropriate sentence, in all the circumstances of this case, would not result in a federal term of incarceration, but at the same time, it would not be a fit and proper sentence to suspend passing sentence and order Mr. Sydney to serve a period on probation.[45]Having considered all of the purposes and principles of sentencing that ought to be considered in all of the circumstances of this case and also considering all of the aggravating and mitigating factors that are present in this case, I find that a conditional sentence of imprisonment provides a significant amount of denunciation and with the terms and conditions to be imposed, will also provide a significant level of specific and general deterrence. Put another way, I am not satisfied that, after having considered all of the circumstances of the offence and the specific offender, that specific deterrence of Mr. Sydney and denunciation of his unlawful conduct requires his separation from society through incarceration in a custodial facility. As such, I find that a conditional sentence order, in all the circumstances of this case, is consistent with the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing set out in section 718 to 718.2 of the Code.[46]Once the court concludes that a conditional sentence order would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing, then the court must also determine whether it would be appropriate to serve the sentence in the community and whether it would endanger the safety of the community. In Proulx, supra, the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that this issue would require an analysis of the risk of reoffending and the gravity of the damage that could ensue should the offender re-offend, including the risk of economic harm. This analysis must be done on a case-by-case basis, but relevant factors would include the nature and circumstances of the offence, the relationship of the accused to the victim, the personal circumstances of the offender (including his or her prior criminal record, mental state and family situation), the conduct of the offender following the commission of the offence and the danger that the offender might pose in the community: See Angelillo, supra, at para. 35.[47]Looking at those factors in assessing the issue of the safety of the community, these charges relate to an incident between Mr. Sydney and his former common-law partner, Ms. Harris. The common-law relationship between Mr. Sydney and Ms. Harris has ended; they have not lived together for almost 2 years. Mr. Sydney had complied, without incident until a few days ago, with the term in the Recognizance not to have any direct or indirect communication with her, except as provided in that order. Mr. Sydney has recently become involved in a common-law relationship with another woman and the Recognizance was varied on September 11, 2012 to allow him to reside at her house. Mr. Sydney has successfully completed the “New Start” anger management program in the context of domestic violence and has stopped drinking alcohol, both of which played a significant role in the circumstances of the offences before the court.[48]In considering the risk of Mr. Sydney re-offending or failing to comply with the court’s order, it has been pointed out that there was one prior breach of probation and that today’s sentence also includes a further breach of probation. I am satisfied that Mr. Sydney’s compliance with the restrictive terms of the Recognizance for a period of almost 2 years shows that he has the ability to fully comply with court orders. However, for some unknown reason, after almost 2 years of compliance with the restrictive terms of a curfew condition contained in his Recognizance, Mr. Sydney has admitted that he breached the curfew condition.[49]As indicated above, I find that it is appropriate for me to consider the recent sentence for the curfew violation in the context of considering the offender’s character and reputation as well as the risk of reoffending. The fact that the breach of the Recognizance occurred just before the court’s sentencing decision in this matter, causes me to further reflect on the issue of whether Mr. Sydney has the motivation and ability to fully comply with a conditional sentence order. While I am concerned that Mr. Sydney has recently breached the terms of a court order, I do note that in breaching the terms of the Recognizance, Mr. Sydney’s actions did not involve the commission of any other substantive criminal offences in relation to Ms. Harris or for that matter any other members of the community. Finally, I must remember that Mr. Sydney has been punished for that breach of the Recognizance and that today’s sentencing decision must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of this offender and to not punish Mr. Sydney again for that other offence.[50]During her submissions, Defence counsel stated that the 2 days that Mr. Sydney spent in custody until being released under the terms of the Recognizance had a salutary effect on him. Mr. Sydney had not been incarcerated prior to that time and I expect that the 2 days spent on remand did have a salutary effect. I am also satisfied that the intermittent sentence for the breach of the Recognizance will provide, as the Supreme Court of Canada phrased it in Middleton, supra, at para. 45, a balance between the denunciatory and deterrent functions of “real jail time” and the rehabilitative functions of preserving the offender’s employment, family relationships and responsibilities and obligations to the community. Furthermore, I am satisfied that the recent imposition of the intermittent sentence will also have a salutary effect on Mr. Sydney.[51]I find that all of these factors point favorably to my conclusion that the safety of the community would not be endangered by him serving the sentence of imprisonment in the community.[52]Having concluded that a conditional sentence order to be served in the community is available and that it is also an appropriate disposition which is consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing and would not endanger the safety of the community, I hereby order Mr. Sydney to be subject to a conditional sentence order of imprisonment in the community for a period of 8 months, with the 1st 4 months of that order to be served under terms of house arrest and the final 4 months being served under a curfew condition from 11:59 PM to 6 AM, 7 days per week, subject to certain exceptions. Following the 8 months conditional sentence order, Mr. Sydney will be subject to a probation order for the next 16 months.[53]The eight-month conditional sentence order of imprisonment will be broken down as follows: 6 months on the assault charge, 2 months consecutive for the uttering threats charge and 2 months concurrent for the breach of the probation charge. The period of probation will attach to the assault and threats charge[54]Mr. Sydney will be required to report to the sentence supervisor today and thereafter as directed by the sentence supervisor or probation officer. The conditional sentence order of imprisonment in the community will commence at 6 PM today.[55]During the Conditional Sentence Order and the period of probation that follows, will also be subject to the statutory conditions keep the peace and be of good behavior, appear before the court as and when required to do so by the court and notify the court, probation officer or supervisor, in advance, of any change of name, address, employment or occupation.[56]While Mr. Sydney is on house arrest, he will be required to remain in his residence at all times, subject only to the following exceptions which allow him to be outside of his residence during that period would be as follows:a)when at regularly scheduled employment and traveling to and from that employment by direct route;b)when dealing with medical emergency or medical appointment involving him or a member of his household and traveling to and from it by direct route;c)when attending a scheduled appointment with your lawyer or probation officer and traveling to and from the appointment by a direct route;d)when attending court at a scheduled appearance or under subpoena and traveling to and from court by a direct route;e)when attending a counseling appointment, treatment program or meeting such as the Alcoholics Anonymous, at the direction of and with permission of your probation officer and traveling to and from that appointment program or meeting by a direct route;f)with the prior written approval of your sentence supervisor;g)for not more than 4 hours per week for the purpose of attending to your personal needs with the prior approval of the sentence supervisor;[57]During the curfew period which requires you to remain in your residence between the hours of 11:59 PM and 6:00 AM the following day, 7 days per week, the only exception would be when you are dealing with a medical emergency involving you or member of your household and traveling to and from it by a direct route.[58]Finally, you are required to prove compliance with the house arrest and curfew conditions by presenting yourself at the entrance to your residence should a sentence supervisor or a peace officer attend there to check compliance.[59]During the conditional sentence order you are not to possess take or consume any alcohol or intoxicating substances and you are not to possess take or consume any controlled substances as defined in the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act except in accordance with a physician’s prescription for you or a legal authorization;[60]During both the Conditional Sentence Order and the Probation Order:a) You are not have possession of any firearm, cross-bow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition or explosive substance;b)You are not to have any direct or indirect contact or communication with Ms. Pamela Harris except through a lawyer or in accordance with the written separation agreement or court order for access to a child or children or where the contact is initiated by her and is subject to her express consent which may be withdrawn at any time;c)You are not to be on or within 50 meters of the premises known as any residence or place of employment of Pamela Harris, except on those occasions as may be authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction for arranging for access to your son or Ms. Harris has contacted you or a 3rd party to make arrangements for access to your son;d)You are to attend for substance abuse assessment and counseling as directed by the probation officer, assessment and counseling in anger management as directed by your probation officer and to attend for assessment and counseling for violence intervention and prevention program as directed by the probation officer and in particular the spousal or partner related program. Finally, you are to attend for assessment, counseling or any program as directed by the probation officer and participate in and cooperate with any assessment, counseling or any program that may be directed by the probation officer.[61]In addition to the foregoing orders, there will also be a section 110 Criminal Code order prohibiting you from possessing any firearms, crossbow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition or explosives substance, for a period of 5 years.[62]I am also making an order under section 487.051 of the Criminal Code which will require you to provide a sample of your DNA.[63]Finally, given the fact that you have recently started a new job and have just lost that employment, you are paying child support to Ms. Harris and will, in all likelihood, be assisting your current partner with her household expenses, I find that it would be an undue hardship to impose the victim fine surcharge in the circumstances of this case. As such, I will waive the imposition of the Victim Fine Surcharge on all of the charges that were before the court today for sentencing."}

Moore of the Ontario Court of Justice, dated January 29, 2010.Tulloch J.A.:A.OVERVIEW[1]The appellant pleaded guilty to five firearms-related offences, including possession of a restricted firearm with ammunition, contrary to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code and breach of a firearms prohibition order. He received a global sentence of nine and one-half years.[2]The appellant sought leave to appeal his sentence. He argued that under the applicable provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1 (“YCJA”), he should not have been treated as a second or subsequent offender for the purpose of determining the applicable mandatory minimum penalty under s. 95(2) of the Criminal Code.[3]At the end of oral argument, the court dismissed the appeal indicating:The sentence, while lengthy, regardless of whether this conviction triggered the mandatory minimum sentence for subsequent convictions, was not “demonstrably unfit”.We cannot interfere. We will release reasons at a later date addressing the proper interpretation of the relevant provisions of the YCJA.B.the relevant facts[4]In November 2007, the appellant was found guilty of a number of offences, including possession of a restricted firearm with ammunition contrary to s. 95(1) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced as a youth under the YCJA and received a short custodial sentence, a period of probation and a firearms prohibition.[5]In February 2009, police received information that a small group of men in a vehicle parked in the Regent Park neighbourhood of Toronto were in possession of a restricted firearm. Officers approached the vehicle to investigate. Suddenly, a door to the car flung open and the appellant exited the vehicle and fled.[6]The officers gave chase and observed the appellant throw an object into a nearby dumpster as he ran. After a brief search of the dumpster, police discovered that the object was in fact a .45-calibre semi-automatic firearm with capacity for 12 rounds. Eleven out of the 12 rounds in the handgun were chambered and ready to fire. The serial number on the firearm had been scratched out and it was later found to have been stolen in the United States and illegally brought to Canada.[7]Shortly after the discovery of the handgun, police dogs located the appellant nearby. The appellant was taken to the police station where he provided a statement and admitted possession of the handgun recovered from the dumpster. He was charged with, inter alia, possession of a restricted firearm with ammunition.[8]In October 2009, the appellant pleaded guilty to the offences charged and was remanded for sentencing.[9]In January 2010, the sentencing judge imposed a global sentence of nine and one-half years. At the sentencing hearing, Crown counsel, defence counsel and the sentencing judge agreed that the appellant’s finding of guilt under the YCJA in 2007 on a charge under s. 95(1) made this conviction under s. 95(1)(a) a “second or subsequent offence” for the purposes of determining the applicable mandatory minimum under s. 95(2).C.ANALYSIS(1) The Operation of the Criminal Code Provisions[10]Persons, like the appellant, convicted under s. 95(1) are subject to minimum penalties. In the case of a first offence, the minimum penalty is three years, and in the case of second or subsequent offences, the minimum penalty is five years: s. 95(2) of the Criminal Code. An offence is a “second or subsequent offence” if within the 10 years prior to the conviction for which the accused is being sentenced, he or she was convicted of any of the offences enumerated in s. 84(5). Section 95(1) is one of the enumerated offences. Consequently, and setting aside the YCJA provisions for the moment, the appellant’s conviction under s. 95(1) in November 2007 made this conviction on a s. 95(1) charge a “second or subsequent offence” and triggered the five-year minimum penalty in s. 95(2).(2) The applicable YCJA provisions[11]The appellant submits that because he was found guilty under the YCJA for his previous s. 95(1) offence, this s. 95(1) conviction does not constitute a “second or subsequent offence” for the purpose of determining the applicable minimum penalty. The appellant relies on s. 82(4) of the YCJA:Finding of guilt not a previous conviction(4) A finding of guilt under this Act is not a previous conviction for the purposes of any offence under any Act of Parliament for which a greater punishment is prescribed by reason of previous convictions, except for(a) [Repealed](b) the purpose of determining the adult sentence to be imposed.[12]Standing alone, s. 82(4) supports the appellant’s position. However, that subsection is subject to s. 119(9)(a):Application of usual rules(9) If, during the period of access to a record under any of paragraphs (2)(g) to (j), the young person is convicted of an offence committed when he or she is an adult,(a) section 82 (effect of absolute discharge or termination of youth sentence) does not apply to the young person in respect of the offence for which the record is kept under sections 114 to 116;[13]The term “period of access” is defined in s. 119(2). For the appellant’s purposes, the relevant definition appears in s. 119(2)(h):Period of access(2) The period of access referred to in subsection (1) is…(h) subject to paragraphs (i) and (j) and subsection (9), if the young person is found guilty of the offence and it is an indictable offence, the period ending five years after the youth sentence imposed in respect of the offence has been completed;[14]The appellant was convicted of an indictable offence under the YCJA in November 2007. Consequently, under s. 119(2)(h), the period of access ended five years after the conviction in November 2007. The appellant’s subsequent convictions, which are the subject of this appeal, were entered in February 2009, well within the access period.(3) Resolving the interpretation issue[15]The appellant submits that s. 119(9)(a) applies only to s. 82(1). Therefore, regardless of the fact that this s. 95(1) conviction was well within the five-year access period, s. 82(4) applies and the appellant’s finding of guilt as a youth under s. 95(1) is not a previous conviction. Accordingly, this s. 95(1) conviction is the appellant’s first such offence and he is subject to the three-year mandatory minimum sentence in s. 95(2).[16]The respondent, on the other hand, contends that the application of s. 82(4) is also limited by the operation of s. 119(9)(a). Accordingly, the appellant is well within the “period of access” defined in s. 119(2) and the enhanced five-year mandatory minimum in s. 95(2) for second or subsequent offenders should apply.[17]I agree with the respondent. In Rizzo \u0026 Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re), 1998 CanLII 837 (SCC), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, the Supreme Court of Canada held that statutory interpretation must begin with the words of the relevant statutory provisions, read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense and interpreted harmoniously with the scheme and the object of the legislation and with Parliament’s intention.[18]The relevant portion of section 119(9)(a) provides that “[s]ection 82 (effect of absolute discharge or termination of youth sentence) does not apply”. On a plain reading, this can only mean that the protection of s. 82, and that of each of its subsections, is extinguished in the event that an adult is convicted of an offence within the period of access applicable to his or her youth record. There is no indication on the face of the legislation why the application of s. 119(9)(a) would be restricted to s. 82(1).[19]The appellant points to the words “effect of absolute discharge or termination of youth sentence” in parentheses in s. 119(9)(a) as evidence that it should only apply to s. 82(1). However, s. 2(3) of the YCJA demonstrates that the words in parentheses are merely a matter of convenience and are to hold no interpretive weight:Descriptive cross-references(3) If, in any provision of this Act, a reference to another provision of this Act or a provision of any other Act is followed by words in parentheses that are or purport to be descriptive of the subject-matter of the provision referred to, those words form no part of the provision in which they occur but are inserted for convenience of reference only. [Emphasis added.][20]The appellant also referred the court to s. 119(9)(c), which deems the finding of guilt as a young person to be a conviction for the purposes of Criminal Records Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-47 if a person with a youth record is convicted of an offence during the access period as an adult. He submits that, had Parliament intended all findings of guilt to be treated as previous convictions for all statutes, it would not have included the reference to the Criminal Records Act.[21]I disagree. As a whole, s. 119(9) concerns the consequences that flow from an individual having been convicted of an offence as an adult during the relevant period of access. Section 119(9)(c) addresses the ramifications of the Criminal Records Act where an offence is committed during the access period. Section 119(9)(c) does not purport to speak to the effects of s. 82 and the impact on those effects of a conviction during the access period. Regardless of whether the language in s. 119(9)(c) was general enough to encompass the effect of a conviction within the access period for all purposes, s. 119(9)(a) would still be necessary to nullify the operation of the general rule in s. 82(4). Therefore, the specific reference to the Criminal Records Act in s. 119(9)(c) is necessary.[22]Furthermore, the interpretation of ss. 82 and 119(9)(a) that I accept accords with the objectives of the YCJA. These objectives can be found in the preamble to the YCJA. While the preamble has a broad and general compass, it also “fosters responsibility and ensures accountability through meaningful consequences and effective rehabilitation and reintegration”. Effective rehabilitation and reintegration require that young persons are given an opportunity to move on with their life and put their interaction with the criminal justice system behind them. However, a balance must be struck: strings must be attached when providing young persons with such an opportunity.[23]This interpretation has also been discussed in the academic literature. In Nicholas Bala and Sanjeev Anand’s Youth Criminal Justice Law, 3rd ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2012), at pp. 482-483, the authors comment on the general treatment of youth records under the YCJA:The [YCJA] defines a period during which there can be access to a record by specified persons. After that statutory period, in general there can be no access to the record, and no use should be made of the fact that the youth was convicted of that offence. This general rule is subject to some statutory exceptions whose exact scope has been the subject of judicial controversy.[1]If the youth commits a further offence within the statutory periods, records of earlier offences can be retained and accessed for a further period of three years for a later summary offence and a further five years for a later indictable offence. [Footnote added.][24]There is also support for this interpretation at the trial level in Ontario. In Elliston, Aston J. pronounced on the very issue of using prior findings of guilt to support the imposition of an enhanced mandatory minimum sentence within the statutory access period. Aston J. described it as “a reasonable and nuanced approach by Parliament in balancing the need to punish recidivists without allowing offences committed when one is very young to haunt an individual in perpetuity”. Elliston has since been followed in the Superior Court: see e.g. R. v. Mensah and Sadat, 2011 ONSC 3303 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 3052.[25]In my view, such an interpretation of the scheme fulfill’s Parliament’s purpose and realizes the YCJA’s objective of fostering “responsibility and ensur[ing] accountability through meaningful consequences and effective rehabilitation and reintegration”.[26]In addition, and although it is not required to dispose of this ground of appeal, I wish to comment on the role of s. 82(4)(b). Section 82(4)(b) provides that:Finding of guilt not a previous conviction(4) A finding of guilt under this Act is not a previous conviction for the purposes of any offence under any Act of Parliament for which a greater punishment is prescribed by reason of previous convictions, except for…(b) the purpose of determining the adult sentence to be imposed. [Emphasis added.][27]The term “adult sentence” is defined in s. 2 of the YCJA. Section 2 provides that an:“‘adult sentence’ in the case of a young person who is found guilty of an offence, means any sentence that could be imposed on an adult who has been convicted of the same offence.” [Emphasis added.][28]Therefore, the reference in s. 82(4)(b) to an “adult sentence” applies only to an adult sentence imposed on a young person under the YCJA. Practically, s. 82(4)(b) would arise in cases where a court concludes that a young person should be sentenced as an adult and where the young person has an earlier finding of guilt that would give rise to a greater punishment on sentencing.[29]That is not this case. The appellant was an adult at the time of his second offence under s. 95(1). As an adult, the earlier finding of guilt he received as a youth became an “earlier offence” within the meaning of s. 84(5) of the Criminal Code by virtue of the interaction between ss. 119(9)(a) and 82 of the YCJA.D.Disposition[30]Since the appellant was found guilty for the earlier s. 95(1) offence in November of 2007, less than two years before his convictions for the charges in the case at bar, he lost the protection of s. 82(4) by operation of s. 119(9)(a) within the scheme set out in the YCJA and interpreted in the foregoing reasons. Therefore, the finding of guilt against the appellant as a young person was an “earlier offence” within the meaning of s. 84(5) of the Criminal Code and the applicable mandatory minimum – on which counsel and the judge at the sentencing hearing had agreed – was five years.[31]As indicated at the end of oral argument, leave to appeal the sentence is granted. However, the appeal is dismissed.Released:“JUN 11 2013”“M. Tulloch J.A.”“DD”“I agree Doherty J.A.”“I agree Janet Simmons J.A.”[1] There are numerous exceptions in the YCJA to this general rule. However, the authors do not elaborate on this point. Nevertheless, I note that the authorities placed before this court on the appeal support the interpretation I have set out above: see e.g. R. v. Elliston, 2010 ONSC 6492 (CanLII), 225 C.R.R. (2d) 109, at para. 24. In addition, I have been unable to find any authorities that would support the appellant’s position."}

No. 3 (P.C.).STATUTES CONSIDERED: The Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C., 1985,JUDGMENT OF GORMAN, P.C. J.(SENTENCE)INTRODUCTION:[1]Mr. Basha has pleaded guilty to having stolen items from two stores in Corner Brook, contrary to section 334(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985.This is not the first time that Mr. Basha has done so.On October 17, 2012, I endorsed a joint submission and granted Mr. Basha an absolute discharge for the same offence (see [20102] N.J. No. 345 (P.C.)).[2]The Crown proceeded by way of summary conviction in relation to each charge. The sole issue for determination is the imposition of an appropriate sentence for these offences.[3]Mr. Basha seeks a conditional discharge with probation.The Crown, based upon the prior offence and the presence of two new offences, opposes the granting of a discharge. The Crown seeks the imposition of a suspended sentence with a period of probation.[4]The granting of an earlier discharge does not disentitle an offender from the same leniency on a later occasion (see R. v. Small, 2001 BCCA 91 (CanLII), [2001] B.C.J. No. 248 (C.A.), at paragraphs 12 and 13).Discharges do not contain any form of exclusionary rule prohibiting resort to them more than once for the same offender.However, the granting of a discharge on an earlier occasion is a significant factor weighing against the subsequent granting of a discharge, but there is no absolute rule.[5]In this case, Mr. Basha is sixty-six years of age.He has been a contributing member of his community and he is suffering from depression and “obsessive-compulsive disorder.”The two theft offences occurred in 2013. In all of the circumstances, I am satisfied that the principles of sentencing can be satisfied by the imposition of a conditional discharge with a period of twelve months probation.[6]Let me explain my reasons for this conclusion by commencing with a review of the circumstances of the offences committed by Mr. Basha.THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCES[7]On May 9, 2013, Mr. Basha stole a drill from the Canadian Tire store in Corner Brook.He had placed the drill into a reusable shopping bag and left the store.[8]On July 17, 2013, Mr. Basha stole a number of items (valued at $60.00) from the Dominion store inCorner Brook.He had placed the items into a reusable shopping bag and left the store.[9]All of the items were recovered.[10]In R. v. Lundrigan, 2012 NLCA 43 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal indicated that a “fit sentence” is one “that takes account of the circumstances of the offences and the offender.”THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER[11]Mr. Basha is sixty-six years of age.He is retired and was employed as a businessman in Corner Brook for a significant period of time.As pointed out earlier, he has one prior and related finding of guilt.[12]Mr. Basha has been diagnosed with “obsessive-compulsive disorder.”A letter from a psychologist who is treating Mr. Basha indicates that Mr. Basha suffers from “severe symptoms of depression and anxiety.”The letter suggests that the prognosis “for treatment of [Mr. Basha’s] symptoms appears to be good.”[13]The evidence in relation to Mr. Basha’s diagnosis is sparse, but an offender's mental health will always be a factor in sentencing.As pointed out in R. v. Peters (2000), 2000 NFCA 55 (CanLII), 194 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 184 (N.L.C.A.), \"the mental illness of an offender will often be considered a mitigating factor in sentencing even though it is not of the sort that would establish a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder at the time of the commission of the offence. The focus in sentencing such offenders may properly therefore be placed on mechanisms that will promote rehabilitation and treatment, rather than on punishment.\"However, there is no evidence in this case that Mr. Basha did not understand the nature of the thefts he committed.[14]In R. v. Branton, 2013 NLCA 61 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal considered the issue of imposing sentence upon an offender suffering from a mental illness. In Branton, the accused was convicted of the offences of sexual assault and breach of probation. The trial judge, [2012] N.J. No. 474, imposed a period of nine months incarceration for the sexual assault offence and one month incarceration, consecutive, for the breach of probation offence. The Crown appealed from the sentence imposed and one of the arguments the Crown raised in support of its position was that the sentencing judge placed too much emphasis on the offender's mental illness.[15]The Court of Appeal increased the sentence imposed in Branton for the sexual assault offence to twenty-three months imprisonment. The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge erred in placing undue emphasis on the offender's \"mental health issues.\" At paragraph 34, the Court of Appeal indicated that the \"general principle articulated in Peters, 2000 NFCA 55 (CanLII), [2000] N.J. No. 287, Edmunds and Lundrigan is that an offender's mental health issues are a relevant factor in his or her sentencing when there is an established connection between an offender's mental health issues and the commission of his or her crimes.\" However, the Court of Appeal stated that the presence of a mental illness does not \"automatically justify a lighter sentence than would otherwise be appropriate\" (at paragraph 35):Mental illness covers a broad spectrum of behaviours, and it does not, by itself, absolve an offender of responsibility for an offence (outside of the provisions of section 16 of the Criminal Code) or automatically justify a lighter sentence than would otherwise be appropriate. When an offender has mental health issues, treatment can sometimes be provided to him or her while incarcerated and if probation is ordered, through the imposition of conditions directing that the offender seek medical assistance, participate in treatment programs, and so forth. Such conditions are designed to assist in the offender's rehabilitation and supervise him or her with the objective of preventing him or her from reoffending. These probationary conditions are \"blunt tools\", as Crown counsel put it in argument, and they do not guarantee results.[16]The Court of Appeal concluded that though Mr. Branton's \"medical diagnoses are part of his personal circumstances and were therefore a legitimate consideration for the sentencing judge in the same way an offender's health is often a sentencing consideration...they were overemphasized and afforded great weight when there was no connection established between them and the offences committed, and no recognition that Mr. Branton had been assessed and counselled in relation to his behaviours in the past and that despite same, he has continued to offend.\"[17]This does not mean that Mr. Basha’s diagnosis is irrelevant to sentencing.He has committed relatively minor offences and he is actively receiving treatment.THE PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[18]In R. v. Knott, 2012 SCC 42 (CanLII), it was held that \"the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code are meant to take into account the correctional imperative of sentence individualization.\"[19]Section 718 of the Criminal Code states that the fundamental purpose of sentencing \"is to contribute...to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society.\"This is to be achieved by imposing sentences which have, among other objectives, the objectives of:-separating offenders from society, where necessary;-denouncing unlawful conduct;-general deterrence;-rehabilitation; and-the promoting of a \"sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and the community.\"[20]Section 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code states that \"a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.\"[21]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code states that any sentence imposed must be \"proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\"In R. v. Cluney, 2013 NLCA 46 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal, at paragraph 16, indicated that the “principle of proportionality applies to sentencing for all criminal offences…The appropriate range of sentence is related to the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.”[22]Section 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code indicates that a \"sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender.\" In R. v. Briand, 2010 NLCA 67 (CanLII), [2010] N.J. No. 339 (C.A.), the Court of Appeal stressed the importance of considering an offender's personal circumstances in applying section 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code.[23]Section 718.2(d) states that \"an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances\" and section 718.2(e) states that \"all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.\"THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES[24]As pointed out earlier, the dispute between the parties involves the propriety of a second discharge being granted.THE CROWN:[25]Ms. Mouland submitted that based upon the earlier offence and the presence of two similar offences, an additional discharge would not be appropriate.Ms. Mouland argued that the granting of a discharge would be contrary to the public interest.She recommended that sentence be suspended and that Mr. Basha be placed on probation.Ms. Mouland noted that the imposition of such a sentence would allow for Mr. Basha to seek treatment while satisfying the principle of specific deterrence.[26]In support of her position, Ms. Mouland relied upon R. v. Elsharawy (1997), 1997 CanLII 14708 (NL CA), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 565 (N.L.C.A.).Ms. Mouland pointed out that in Elsharawy the Court of Appeal indicated that in order to grant an offender a discharge the offender must be “a person of good character, usually without previous conviction or discharge.\"MR. BASHA:[27]Mr. Martin Q.C., on behalf of Mr. Basha, submitted that despite the earlier absolute discharge, a conditional discharge should be imposed.[28]Mr. Martin Q.C. referred to Mr. Basha’s age and circumstances in support of his position.Mr. Martin Q.C. pointed out that these offences took place almost two years ago, without repetition.He argues that Mr. Basha is a “person of good character who is ill” and that these factors should be reflected in any sentence imposed.[29]In R. v. Ang [2014] ACTCA 17, at paragraph 39, it was held that there “must always be a place for the exercise of mercy” though this “is, of course, constrained by the requirement that a sentence is not manifestly inadequate.”One of the ways that the sentencing principle of restraint can be practically employed by a sentencing judge is through the use of the discharge provision in the Criminal Code.THE CRIMINAL CODE’S DISCHARGE PROVISION[30]The Court's authority to grant an offender a discharge is found in section 730(1) of the Criminal Code.It states as follows:Where an accused, other than an organization, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence, other than an offence for which a minimum punishment is prescribed by law or an offence punishable by imprisonment for fourteen years or for life, the court before which the accused appears may, if it considers it to be in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of convicting the accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged absolutely or on the conditions prescribed in a probation order made under subsection 731(2).[31]Thus, this provision allows the Court to refrain from entering a conviction, despite proof that an offence has been committed, if it is satisfied that two prerequisites exist.The Court must be satisfied that a discharge is (1) in the best interests of the offender; and (2) not contrary to the public interest.[32]In Elsharawy, the Court of Appeal indicated that the first factor \"presupposes that the accused is a person of good character, usually without previous conviction or discharge\" and the second factor \"involves a consideration of the principle of general deterrence with attention being paid to the gravity of the offence, its incidence in the community, public attitudes towards it and public confidence in the effective enforcement of the criminal law\" (at paragraph 3).[33]In R. v. Sellars, 2013 NSCA 129 (CanLII), the accused pleaded guilty to the offence of fraud.It involved “obtaining monies from her employer’s health care plan.” The accused requested that a conditional discharge be granted, but the trial judge declined and suspended sentence and placed the accused on probation.In declining to grant a discharge the trial judge stated:Under these circumstances, I don’t think it’s in the public interest to grant a conditional discharge.[34]The accused appealed from the sentence imposed.The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal referred to the trial judge’s comments and concluded that he had incorrectly “placed an obligation on the appellant to demonstrate a positive impact on the public interest.”The Court of Appeal held that this was not the test for determining if a discharge should be granted.It held that the granting of a discharge “does not have to be in the public interest” (at paragraph 27):A discharge does not have to be in the public interest. It is available so long as the offence is not punishable by fourteen years, or life, it is in the best interests of the offender, and not contrary to the public interest. The difference between requiring a positive impact on public interest and demonstrating the sentence would not be contrary to the public interest is well expressed by LeBlanc J. in R. v. D’Eon, 2011 NSSC 330 (CanLII) where he wrote:[25] If the Sentencing Judge did apply a test requiring that a conditional discharge be “in the public interest” rather than being “not contrary to the public interest,” this would be the wrong test. There is a substantive difference between the two phrases; the correct “not contrary” test simply means that a conditional discharge would not be deleterious. It is not required to be have actual positive effect on the public interest.[35]In R. v. Burke, 1996 CanLII 11083 (NL CA), [1996] N.J. No. 179 (C.A.), the accused, a former Christian Brother, was convicted of the offence of assault causing bodily harm in relation to a child at the Mount Cashel Orphanage in 1975.He was sentenced to a period of one month imprisonment by the trial judge.On appeal, an absolute discharge was substituted.[36]In R. v. Edmunds, 2012 NLCA 26 (CanLII), [2012] N.J. No. 177 (C.A.), the accused pleaded guilty to one count of breach of trust by a public officer and two counts of theft. The offender, who was employed as a correctional officer, stole monies from two prisoners. The sentencing judge imposed a conditional discharge with twenty-four months of probation.The Crown appealed from the sentence imposed.[37]The Crown’s appeal from sentence was dismissed. The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal concluded in Edmunds that “the Crown has not pointed the Court to any binding or persuasive authorities that would suggest that a conditional discharge was a demonstrably unfit and clearly unreasonable sentence in these circumstances.”The Court of Appeal noted, at paragraph 20, that in “some circumstances, evidence of particular effects on the offender will be required if the offender is relying on such factors.However, a sentencing judge may take judicial notice of the fact that a criminal conviction will have a negative impact on a person's future, whether related to employment opportunities, travel, and so forth.”[38]In R. v. House, [2012] N.J. No. 219 (C.A.), the accused was convicted of the offences of assault and unlawfully being in a dwelling house.In concluding that a conditional discharge was warranted for both offences, the Court of Appeal indicated that the accused is \"a promising young man who, in his twenties, is still maturing and developing the basis for a productive life including employment and relationship opportunities and decisions\" (at paragraph 24):As discussed in Elsharawy, in an assessment of whether a conditional discharge is in the best interests of Mr. House, the first condition presupposes that the accused is a person of good character, ordinarily with no previous criminal conviction or discharge. Based on the above, this supposition is satisfied in this case. As to the need for personal deterrence or rehabilitation, I note that Mr. House was on release, with conditions, on a Promise to Appear prior to his trial, and that he obtained judicial interim release, again with conditions, pending determination of his appeal. He has been compliant with the terms of release, particularly the requirement to keep the peace and be of good behaviour, for almost four years. Given the nature of the offence and Mr. House's conduct since the offences were committed, personal deterrence and rehabilitation are not matters of concern. Finally, regarding adverse repercussions from a criminal conviction, Mr. House is a promising young man who, in his twenties, is still maturing and developing the basis for a productive life including employment and relationship opportunities and decisions. A criminal record, where such is unnecessary for purposes of protection of the public, may result in roadblocks in terms of this development. Such a result is to be avoided provided Mr. House is otherwise a proper candidate for a conditional discharge.[39]As can be seen from these precedents, discharges have been granted inthis Province for very serious offences.The circumstances in Burke, House and Edmunds are, for instance, more serious than what occurred here.SENTENCING PRECEDENTS-THEFT[40]The range of sentence for minor thefts ranges from the imposition of a discharge to relatively short periods of imprisonment when the offender has a related criminal record (see R. v. Prowse (1998), 1998 CanLII 18024 (NL CA), 168 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 289 (N.L.C.A.), R. v. C.C., [2012] N.J. No. 121 (P.C.), R. v. Reid, [2012] N.J. No. 164 (P.C.), R. v. Roberts, [2013] N.J. No. 214 (P.C.), R. v. J.B., [2013] N.J. No. 218 (P.C.), R. v. Park, [2013] N.J. No. 244 (P.C.), R. v. Sutherland, [2013] N.J. No. 53 (P.C.), R. v. Durnford, [2014] N.J. No. 5 (P.C.),R. v. Courtney, [2014] N.J. No. 172 (P.C.), R. v. Bennett, [2014] N.J. No. 51 (P.C.), R. v. Sutherland, [2014] N.J. No. 228 (P.C.) and R. v. Jacobs, [2015] N.J. No. 3 (P.C.)).[41]In R. v. Keeping, 2012 NLTD(G) 57, the accused was convicted of two counts of theft.She cashed a cheque belonging to her husband and stole $27,934.50 from a company which was owned by her estranged husband. She had a criminal record consisting of two thefts, two breaches of recognizance, a failure to comply with a probation order, an assault and an assault with a weapon.A conditional discharge and a period of six months probation were imposed.[42]In R. v. Samson, 2015 YKCA 7 (CanLII), the accused stole $8,380.78 from her employer.The trial judge imposed a conditional discharge with probation.A Crown appeal from sentence was dismissed.ANALYSIS[43]In Branton, the Court of Appeal pointed out, at paragraph 18, that “it is worth restating that sentencing judges enjoy a broad discretion to craft a sentence that is tailored to the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the offender and that a sentencing judge has the discretion to decide on the particular blend of sentencing goals and the weight to be given to relevant aggravating or mitigating factors to decide each particular case.However, this discretion is constrained by statute and fettered by binding jurisprudence.”[44]In this case, Mr. Basha committed two relatively minor theft offences.Considering his age and circumstances, a discharge would be an appropriate sentence.The difficulty, however, is the prior finding of guilt.As Ms. Mouland points out, this requires that I consider the sentencing principle of specific deterrence.[45]There is no evidence in this case that the entering of a conviction will have a negative impact upon Mr. Basha.It will not, for instance, result in the loss of employment or limit his employment prospects. However, as pointed out by the Court of Appeal in Edmunds: “a sentencing judge may take judicial notice of the fact that a criminal conviction will have a negative impact on a person's future, whether related to employment opportunities, travel, and so forth.”[46]Considering the totality of the circumstances, I am satisfied that the prerequisites for the granting of a discharge are present in this case.I am satisfied that based upon the nature of the offences; the nature of the prior finding of guilt; the time period between the offences and today’s date; and Mr. Basha having sought treatment, that it would not be contrary to the public interest for a conditional discharge to be imposed.Accordingly, Mr. Basha is sentenced to a conditional discharge with a period of probation of twelve months.THE TERMS OF THE PROBATION ORDER[47]In addition to the statutory conditions which apply, Mr. Basha must:-report to a probation officer in person as required;-comply with all directions received from his probation officer;-attend all counseling or treatment sessions arranged by his probation officer; and-make a charitable contribution in the amount of $500.00 to a food bank chosen by his probation officer. This must be paid to the Provincial Court in Corner Brook within sixty days of today’s date.[1]A VICTIM SURCHARGE[48]The imposition of victim surcharges would not constitute an undue hardship for Mr. Basha.Thus, he must pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $50.00 in relation to each count to theProvincial Court within thirty days of today’s date.CONCLUSION[49]For the reasons provided, Mr. Basha is sentenced to a conditional discharge with twelve months of probation.[50]Judgment accordingly.[1]I am satisfied for the reasons provided in R. v. Penney, [2013] N.J. No. 340 (P.C.), at paragraphs 73 to 81, that this condition is a reasonable one which will allow Mr. Basha to make reparations to the community."}

Chisholm, the same judge who had taken his plea back in January, 2009.After two days of hearing, Chisholm, P.C.J. rendered a decision now reported at 2011 NSPC 8 (CanLII)wherein he dismissed the appellant’s motion to withdraw his plea.Following counsels’ submissions he accepted their joint recommendation and sentenced the appellant to six months in custody, to be served under house arrest with strict conditions, together with various ancillary orders, followed by two years’ probation.[8]The appellant now asks that we allow the appeal, strike the guilty plea, and remit the case to the Provincial Court for either a rehearing of the motion to withdraw his plea, or a new trial, before a different judge.[9]After carefully considering the record and counsels’ submissions we are unanimously of the view that the appeal ought to be dismissed.[10]In addressing the validity of the appellant’s guilty plea, and quite apart from having to be satisfied that the plea was voluntary and unequivocal, Judge Chisholm was also obliged to determine whether the plea was informed by an awareness of the nature of the allegations as well as the effect and consequences of the plea.See, for example, R. v. Nevin, 2006 NSCA 72 (CanLII), and R. v. Laffin, 2009 NSCA 19 (CanLII).[11]Given the appellant’s denial that he ever sexually assaulted his son and that he was only attempting to teach the boy personal hygiene, Judge Chisholm was required to very carefully test the appellant’s explanation and his overall credibility.In that, Judge Chisholm had the benefit of a full hearing which included: detailed affidavits submitted by both the appellant and his former counsel Mr. Andrew Pavey; cross-examination of the appellant and the probation officer who authored the pre-sentence report; as well as comprehensive written and oral submissions from counsel.[12]Ultimately the judge rejected the appellant’s assertions.He noted the internal inconsistencies in the appellant’s evidence, as well as the contradictions between the appellant’s evidence and that of his former counsel, and probation officer.[13]A few brief examples will illustrate the obvious conflicts in the evidence.Under cross-examination at the hearing, Mr. L. denied telling the probation officer, Mr. Phillip Ralph Josey, that he accepted responsibility for sexually assaulting his son, or expressing remorse for having done so.He said Mr. Josey “did not understand him well” and that his expression of regret related to the break-up of the family.He said he told the probation officer that he was simply repeating the same lesson on personal hygiene that he had once learned from his own father.He said he was doing nothing more than “just passing this knowledge on to his son.”When he told the probation officer that he accepted responsibility for his actions, all he meant was that he had been too harsh with the lad and had expected too much of a young child.[14]By contrast, Mr. Josey’s evidence was that he never had any difficulty communicating with Mr. L. over the course of his supervision, and that there had never been any request to have an interpreter present.Mr. Josey confirmed that the appellant had accepted responsibility for his actions and that when he had questioned Mr. L. he was not able to offer an explanation for his behaviour.Had he provided an innocent explanation, Mr. Josey said he would have certainlyincluded such an account in his report.[15]In his affidavit filed in support of his motion, Mr. L. swore:[11]... Having heard my son’s allegations, I most seriously deny that I have touched him in any sexual part of his body, or had him participate in any sexual kind of activity with me....[13]I did not understand the nature of the sexual allegations that were the basis of the sexual assault charge at the time that I entered my guilty plea.I should not have entered that plea. ...[14]I therefore ask to withdraw my guilty plea and to have a trial of the allegations that my son has made against me.[16]However, on cross-examination at the hearing, Mr. L. admitted that his former counsel, Mr. Pavey, had related to him the details of the allegations of sexual assault but that he had decided to plead guilty and acknowledge the facts upon which the charge was based, even though “he knew he was pleading guilty to something that was not true” because “... he wanted to close the case as soon as possible because he was unemployed and he was unable to pay his lawyer.”Mr. Pavey’s affidavit makes it clear that the appellant (with his translator present) was fully advised of all of the allegations and the facts to be relied upon at the sentencing hearing.He was told that the joint submission on sentencing to be made by counsel would include a sex offender assessment and counselling as required as well as other standard ancillary orders.Mr. Pavey swore that he had clear and complete instructions from his client to proceed on that basis with the plea.[17]Judge Chisholm noted that the defence chose not to cross-examine Mr. Pavey on his affidavit.In rejecting Mr. L.’s evidence, Judge Chisholm wrote, in part:[51] ... The Defense position is that Mr. Pavey participated in concluding a plea and sentence negotiation and the entering of a guilty plea knowing that the accused denied that he committed the act of sexual assault as alleged or any other sexual assault.For counsel to do so would be improper.The only evidence that this occurred was the evidence of Mr. [L.].The interpreter who was present was not called to give evidence.Mr. [L.]'s evidence was not found credible by the Court.[18]It cannot be seriously suggested that the judge erred in the conduct of the hearing or that his questioning of the appellant was improper or gives rise to an apprehension of bias.[19]We see no error in Judge Chisholm’s recitation or treatment of the evidence; his application of the law to the evidence; his analysis; or his conclusion.Based on the record before him, it was certainly open to the judge to conclude that Mr. L.’s assertions were not credible, and that he had failed to satisfy the heavy burden of demonstrating that when he entered his plea he failed to fully appreciate the allegations which led to the charge of sexual assault.[20]If the appellant wished to challenge the facts relied upon by the Crown, he could have done so after losing the motion to withdraw his plea, and before proceeding to sentencing.Yet he made no attempt to put the Crown to strict proof of its facts.Rather, through counsel, he accepted the facts stated by the Crown at the sentencing hearing as the basis for the sexual assault against his son.[21]On March 16, 2011, following release of the judge’s decision, and with an interpreter present, counsel raised a factual error with the trial judge.Counsel for the appellant advised the judge that the reference in his reasons to Mr. L’s convictions for assaulting his son and for uttering threats against his estranged wife, were mistaken (the references had apparently been reversed).The judge acknowledged the error and edited his decision to reflect the correction noting in open court on the record, that “It would not affect my overall view with respect to Mr. [L.]’s evidence and the Court’s conclusion on the motion.”We accept that the judge’s error was minor, easily and appropriately corrected, and of no consequence to the outcome, or the merits of this appeal.[22]In conclusion, the appellant’s credibility was an issue Judge Chisholm had to decide.He did so fairly with reasons that are clear, cogent and fully supported on the record.Judge Chisholm did not miss, mistreat, or misapprehend the evidence.He correctly applied the law.There was no miscarriage of justice.The appeal is dismissed.Saunders, J.A.Concurred in:Hamilton, J.A.Beveridge, J.A."}

Neil Smith and Terry D. White, for the respondent.[1]Handrigan, J.: The Appellant appeared in Provincial Court of Newfoundland and Labrador sitting as a Youth Justice Court at Grand Bank, NL on February 11, 2004. He was sentenced on that date for three offences to which he had pled guilty: one breach of s. 4(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act[1] and two breaches of s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act[2].[2]The Youth Justice Court Judge sentenced the Appellant to six months closed custody for each of the offences to be served concurrently. He also ordered that the Appellant be supervised in the community for 90 days after the custodial sentences ended. Finally, he placed the Appellant on supervised probation for 12 months, to begin after the expiration of the community supervision order.[3]The Appellant appeals the custodial and supervision parts of his sentence. His primary argument is that the sentencing judge was not authorized by law to impose a custodial sentence, but he also contends that the sentences did not comply with sentencing principles for young persons.BackgroundThe Appellant[4]The Appellant is 18 years old. He was born on June 8, 1986. His parents are separated and he lives with his mother. The Appellant is a Level III student who is capable academically and should graduate high school this year. He intends to enroll in a post-secondary educational programme in fall 2004 to qualify to work in a trade.[5]The Appellant’s family environment is unstable and lacks the structure and control that he requires. His friends are older than he is and are not a positive influence in his life. The Appellant uses alcohol and marijuana regularly and does not appear to be concerned about their effects on him, despite being hospitalized twice because of severe intoxication.[6]The Appellant has a record of prior convictions. He appeared in Youth Court[3] at Grand Bank on February 14, 2001 and was placed on 12 months’ unsupervised probation for a breach of s. 70(2) of the Liquor Control Act[4]. He appeared in the Youth Justice Court[5] again on October 1,2003 and was placed on supervised probation for 12 months and ordered to perform 40 hours of community services.The Offences[7]The Appellant breached the probation order that was imposed on him in October, 2003 by being under the influence of alcohol on November 8, 2003, just a little over a month after the order was made. One of the conditions contained in that probation order said that he was not to “...possess, use or consume alcohol or nonprescription drugs”. He was charged with a breach of s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act and pled guilty on December 17, 2003. A pre-sentence report was ordered and the matter was adjourned to February 11, 2004.[8]The Appellant was awaiting sentencing for that offence when he was found in possession of a quantity of marihuana on January 12, 2004. This resulted in a further charge under s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act for a breach of the same condition in the October 1,2003 probation order, as well as a substantive charge under s. 4(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The Appellant pled guilty to the two new charges on February 11, 2004 and was sentenced for all three offences.The Sentences[9]The Youth Justice Court Judge who sentenced the Appellant acknowledged having read the pre-sentence report he had ordered on December 17, 2003. He focused on the difficulties the Appellant was having with the use of alcohol and drugs as related in the report, noting that it was “not particularly positive”[6]. He summarized his reasons for sentence this way:“Now I’m aware of the principles set out in the Youth Criminal Justice Act and the primary concern that I have today is Mr. S’s rehabilitation. To some lesser extent I’m concerned about general deterrence, but it doesn’t really play a large part of my thinking this morning, but as I say, I’m primarily concerned about Mr. S. and his future. And I’ve concluded, with respect to counsel, that a period of closed custody is necessary before Mr. S. self de-structs.”The Appeal[10]This appeal focuses on whether the Youth Justice Court Judge was authorized to impose custody on the Appellant. The Appellant contends that he was limited by para. 39(1)(b) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act to non-custodial sentences. The Appellant also argued that the Youth Justice Court Judge should not have imposed custody on him even if he was authorized by the Act. He says generally that the custody of the Youth Justice Court Judge imposed was more onerous than was necessary to achieve the objectives of sentencing young persons. He further contends, in a more particular way, that his rehabilitation and reform, which were of primary concern to the sentencing Justice, could have been achieved by a remedy less restrictive than closed custody. He cites open custody or supervised probation as alternative sanctions available to the Justice.[11]Paragraph 39(1 )(b) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act provides that the “...youth justice court shall not commit a young person to custody...unless...the young person has failed to comply with non-custodial sentences...” The Appellant focuses on the plurality of the word “sentences” in that paragraph. He argues that a young person can only be given a custodial sentence under para. 39(1 )(b) if he has failed to comply with more than one non-custodial sentence. He goes farther than that and says that a custodial sentence is not authorized under the paragraph even where the young person has more than one failure to comply with a single non-custodial sentence.[12]The Youth Justice Court Judge gave the Appellant supervised probation in October, 2003. The Appellant failed to comply with a condition of that non-custodial sentence [probation] that he was not to “...possess, use or consume alcohol or non-prescription drugs” when he drank on November 8, 2003 and had possession of marijuana on January 12, 2004. Both failures to comply related to the same probation order. The Appellant has never failed to comply with another probation order, although he received unsupervised probation on February 14, 2001.[13]The Appellant says that he cannot be sentenced to custody because he has failed to comply with a single non-custodial sentence and not with “non-custodial sentences”, even though he did so twice. He argues that the Youth Justice Court Judge who sentenced him could only have imposed custody if he had failed to comply with at least two non-custodial sentences. His argument may be summarized this way: More than one failure to comply with a single non-custodial sentence is not the same thing as more than one failure to comply with more than one non-custodial sentence. Only the latter is contemplated by para. 39(1 )(b) of the Act.The LawLegislation[14]The Youth Criminal Justice Act came into effect on April 1, 2003. It replaced the Young Offenders Act and made significant changes to how young persons were dealt with in the criminal justice system. The Youth Criminal Justice Act is clear that custody may only be imposed on young persons as a last resort. The legislation is replete with this view, whether it is stated directly or only inferentially. I will review the procedural and substantive limitations imposed by the Act on the use of custody as part of the framework in which the words “non-custodial sentences” used in para. 39(1)(b) are interpreted.[15]A recital in the Preamble to the Act says that “...Canadian society should have a youth criminal justice system that...reduces the over-reliance on incarceration for non-violent persons”. Sub-paragraph 3(l)(b)(i) says that it is one of the principles of the Act that the “...criminal justice system must be separate from that of adults and emphasize...rehabilitation and reintegration...”[16]This is one of the mandatory principles that a Youth Justice Court must apply when determining sentences: “...all available sanctions other than custody that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all young persons...”[7]. Elsewhere the Act says that the sanction imposed must be the “least restrictive sentence” that promotes accountability in the young person and rehabilitation and reintegration into society, while protecting the public[8].[17]Section 39 of the Act places the most severe limitations on the Youth Justice Court that is inclined to impose custodial sentences on young persons. These are the only circumstances in which the Youth Justice Court has any authority to impose custody: “A youth justice court shall not commit a young person to custody unless...” he has committed a violent offence, has failed to comply with non-custodial sentences, has committed an indictable offence for which an adult would be liable to more than two years in prison and has a history that indicates a pattern of findings of guilt, or is an exceptional case, but then only if he has committed an indictable offence with aggravating circumstances[9]. (Underlining mine)[18]If one or more of these criteria apply the Court is still not permitted to impose a custodial sentence”...unless [it] has considered all alternatives to custody raised at the sentencing hearing that are reasonable in the circumstances, and determined that there is not a reasonable alternative, or combination of alternatives, this is in accordance with the purposes and principles set out in section 38”[10]. (Underlining mine) Youth Justice Courts “...shall not use custody as a substitute for appropriate child protection, mental health or other social measures”[11].[19]It has been said that there is “only one rule” of modern statutory interpretation: The court must consider all relevant and admissible indicators of legislative meaning, including legislative context, the presumptions and special rules of interpretation, and external aids. It must then come to an interpretation which complies with the legislative text, promotes the legislative purpose and produces an outcome that is reasonable and just[12].Cases[20]Counsel for the Appellant and Respondent said that they have searched exhaustively and were unable to locate any authority that considered the specific point raised by this appeal. They each referred to some decisions, none of which were at the appellate level, which dealt with the issue tangentially or commented in obiter. I have read the authorities provided by counsel and several of them have assisted me in deciding this case. I will refer to these briefly before turning to my analysis of the issue in this case.R. v. C.(D.L.)[21]Gorman, P.C.J., sentenced the young person in R. v. C.(D.L.)[13] for two counts of break and enter and one breach of a non-custodial disposition[14]. He imposed nine months custody on the young person for each break and entry charges and three months for the breach of the non-custodial disposition, all to be served concurrently. He discussed the limitations that s. 39 of the new Act placed on the court’s ability to impose custodial sentences and made these comments about para. 39(1 )(b) in particular: “Subsection 39(1 )(b) of the [Youth Criminal Justice] Act allows the Court to impose a period of custody if the ‘young person has failed to comply with noncustodial sentences’. Interestingly, this category requires a failure to comply with more than one such sentence...”[15] (Underlining mine)[22]Gorman, P.C.J., found that break and entry is a “violent” offence within the meaning of para. 39(1 )(a) and imposed custodial sentences without referring to para. 39(1 )(b). His remarks are obiter of the decision, although C.(D.L.) had a lengthy record with five convictions for failure to comply with a disposition under the Young Offenders Act, all of which had resulted in custody, both open and secure.R. v. 1.(D.A.)[23]R. v. I.(D.A.)[16] dealt with a Crown application to detain the young person pending trial. Section 29(2) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act contains a presumption that pretrial detention is not necessary if “...the young person could not, on being found guilty, be committed to custody on the grounds set out in subsection 39(1)(a) to (c)”. I.(D.A.) was charged with possession of a stolen motor vehicle and with “hit and run” offences. He had a prior record which included breach of a curfew, for which he was given a conditional discharge and placed on probation for two months.[24]Auxier, P.C.J., disagreed with the Crown’s suggestion that s. 33(2) of the Interpretation Act[17] applied to the interpretation of the phrase “non-custodial sentences” in para. 39(1 )(b). The subsection reads: “Words in the singular include the plural and words in the plural include the singular”. He refused to consider I .(D. A.)’s single prior conviction for breach of a curfew as sufficient to rebut the presumption that I.(D.A.) should not be detained prior to trial: “...[I]t’s clear that the intention of the [Youth Criminal Justice] Act is toward avoiding incarceration of young persons. If the Crown could rebut the presumption against pretrial detention merely by showing that the accused had one breach of a non custodial disposition, it would be contrary to that intent”[18].R. v. A.(E.S.)[25]In R. v. A.(E.S.)[19], the Crown urged the Court to apply s. 33(2) of the Interpretation Act to the single breach of probation on A.(E.S.)’s record so that it could impose custody on him for having had sexual contact with a child contrary to s. 151 of the Criminal Code[20]. Once again the Court refused: “...I have concluded that the Crown cannot succeed on this argument. In my opinion, the entire scheme of the [Youth Criminal Justice] Act is such that incarceration should only be used for the most serious offences. To give section 39(1 )(b) the meaning suggested by Crown counsel, would, in my opinion, be contrary to the scheme of this Act. In my opinion, section 39(1)(b) can only be read as meaning the plural and not the singular”[21].R. v. C.(W.S.)[22][26]C.(W.S.) applied for bail. She was charged with numerous offences, including one breach of probation and several breaches of undertaking. The Crown argued that the breaches of undertaking should be treated as “non-custodial sentences”, justifying her detention. Whalen, P.C.J., rejected the argument, saying that a “...plain reading of this section restricts its application to failures to comply with non-custodial sentences”. He added these comments: “There must be more than one failure to comply with a non-custodial sentence. It suggests that two failures to comply with one previous non-custodial sentence would not qualify, but rather that there must have been a failure to comply with two separate non-custodial sentences”[23]. (Underlining mine)Legal Commentary[27]Paragraph 39(1)(b) has been commented on by authors who specialize in the area of youth criminal justice law. The Honourable Peter J. Harris of the Ontario Court of Justice dealt briefly with the interpretation of para. 39(1)(b) in his Youth Criminal Justice Act Manual: “It is important to note that since the word “sentences” is plural there must be at least two previous failures to comply with non-custodial sentences”[24]. (Underlining mine)[28]Tustin and Lutes asked the question that I have to decide in this appeal in the 2004 edition of their text, A Guide to the Youth Criminal Justice Act[25]. They declined to answer it directly but inferred that “...a young person would not need to have two separate noncustodial sentences as two breaches of any sentence would suffice even if they both arise from the same sentence”[26]. (Underlining mine). They justified their inference by observing that the “intent” of s. 39(1) is “...to reinforce the principle that non-custodial sentences should be used before using custody...”[27].[29]Nick Bala is not in doubt about how para. 39(1 )(b) of the Act should be interpreted: “This provision clearly requires that there must have been at least two prior non-custodial sentences which the youth did not comply with”[28].Analysis[30]I agree with Nick Bala’s interpretation of para. 39(1 )(b) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. It is as clear to me as it is to Bala that a young person can only be given a custodial sentence under para. 39(1 )(b) if he has failed to comply with more than one non-custodial sentence. Multiple failures to comply with one noncustodial sentence are not enough, but at least two failures to comply with two separate noncustodial sentences are sufficient. I will explain.[31]It is clear from the Youth Criminal Justice Act that the legislators were concerned that youth courts were relying too heavily on custodial dispositions under the Young Offenders Act. Concern about over-reliance on incarceration for young persons is written into the preamble of the Youth Criminal Justice Act and appears expressly or by implication in many of the substantive parts of the legislation.[32]The Act makes repeated calls for using the least restrictive sanctions that are justifiable when sentencing young persons. Custodial sentences can only be imposed as last resort. Even if custodial sentences are available under s. 39(1) of the Act they must not be imposed until the court considers all reasonable alternatives. Pre-trial detention cannot be ordered until the Crown has shown that the young person, if convicted, could be sentenced to custody under paragraphs 39(1 )(a) to (c) of the Act.[33]Paragraph 39(1 )(b) appears in this legislative milieu and must be interpreted accordingly. The Youth Criminal Justice Act provides a range of sentences which can be imposed by the Court before custody, the ultimate sanction, should be considered. The alternatives cover a broad spectrum starting with a reprimand, through absolute and conditional discharges, fines of up to $1,000, and restitution and probation for up to two years. Community or personal service work orders for the victim are also available, as are participation in a community-based program of intensive supervision and support. Custody cannot be imposed if one of these sentences is a reasonable alternative. Custody may never be used as a substitute for appropriate child protection, mental health or other social measures.[34]There is a loosely-applied notion that sentences for offenders should build progressively in severity. Of course, this is heavily dependent on the circumstances of both the offence and the offender and is likely observed as much in breach as in application. The Youth Criminal Justice Act responded to a concern that this idea might be at work in youth justice courts by expressly providing that “[t]he previous imposition of a particular non-custodial sentence on a young person does not preclude a youth justice court from imposing the same or any other noncustodial sentence for another offence”[29]. This is included in the legislation out of an abundance of concern that courts will not use non-custodial sentences as frequently as they might, especially if they have not been effective before.[35]Paragraph 39(1)(b) of the Act provides one of the four criteria that must be met before a young person can be given a custodial sentence. Custody cannot be ordered unless one of these criteria is met. The sentencing judge has less discretion to impose custody under the new Act than he had under the Young Offenders Act, which it replaced[30]. The new Act emphasizes a need to reduce the use of incarceration when sentencing young persons and para. 39(1 )(b) must be interpreted according to its context.[36]The implications of this are obvious: If para. 39(1 )(b) is open to alternative readings, one of which could result in a higher incidence of custodial sentences, the other reading must be adopted. The parties to this appeal have argued that para. 39(1)(b) is open to alternative interpretations. The defence says that the words “noncustodial sentences” can only have one meaning: The young person must have received at least two prior sentences that did not involve custody.[37]The Crown says that this reading of the words is too restricted. It says that the plural “sentences” in para. 39(1 )(b) must be read generically so that the court may impose custody on young persons, like the Appellant, who have failed to comply more than once with a single prior non-custodial sentence. In effect, the Crown says that the Appellant’s two failures to comply with the probation order made in October, 2003 are “non-custodial sentences” that expose him to a custodial sentence now.[38]The Crown says that the defence’s interpretation of para. 39(1 )(b) may lead to absurd consequences: A young person could commit numerous breaches of a single probation order (or other non-custodial sentence) and the court would never be able to impose custody on him, regardless of the severity of the breaches. I agree with the Crown that a young person might never be exposed to the risk of a custodial sentence in those circumstances. However, it is not absurd because that is what the law intended to achieve.[39]But it is also an unlikely scenario: How reasonable is it that a young person could repeatedly breach a probation order without running afoul of the other criteria in s. 39(1 ) of the Act? Or, how likely is it that the same young person would avoid another non-custodial sentence arising from one of his breaches which he would just as readily breach, so that he then has more than one non-custodial sentence on his record that he has failed to comply with[31]?[40]The Appellant’s interpretation of para. 39(1 )(b) will result in fewer custodial sentences for young persons. Custody cannot be imposed on a young offender who has failed to comply with only one non-custodial sentence, regardless of the number of times that he has failed to comply. It is self-evident that there will be fewer young persons who have received more than one non-custodial sentence than there will be young persons who have received a single non-custodial sentence. There should, by extension, be fewer custodial sentences and that is one of the main themes of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.[41]My analysis of the issue in this case has proceeded on the supposition that the words “non-custodial sentences” are ambiguous, that they allow for alternative, if not competing, interpretations. That is wrong. The words are not ambiguous. The plural “sentences” simply means, as it should, more than one. If para. 39(1 )(b) had been intended to include a single non-custodial sentence, singular “sentence” could have been as easily used so that the criterion defined by that paragraph would have been “...failed to comply with a non-custodial sentence”.[42]It is equally wrong to interpret the words of the paragraph as the Crown is suggesting so that the Appellant’s two failures to comply with the October, 2003 probation order bring him within its meaning. This is the effect of what the Crown is suggesting: The words “failed to comply with non-custodial sentences”, can mean, “failed at least twice to comply with a non-custodial sentence”. The words cannot bear that meaning.[43]The youth justice court judge made an error of law: He relied on para. 39(1)(b) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act to impose custodial sentences on the Appellant when he sentenced him in February, 2004. He was not permitted to impose custody since it had not been shown that the Appellant had failed to comply with noncustodial sentences. The Appellant’s two failures to comply with the non-custodial sentence that he received in October, 2003 do not make para. 39(1 )(b) of the Act applicable to him. The Crown and defence agree, as I do, that none of the other criteria in s. 39(1) of the Act apply to the Appellant. There was no basis to give him custody.[44]The custody of the Appellant received is set aside. This includes the community supervision order that the youth justice court judge made pursuant to s. 42(2)(n) of the Act, effective for 90 days from when the expiration of custody.A Fit Sentence[45]The youth justice court judge said that he was primarily concerned with the Appellant’s rehabilitation. He felt that a closed custody sentence would help the Appellant to rehabilitate himself. The pre-sentence report the judge relied on indicated that the Appellant’s parents had no control over him, there was conflict in his family, his associates were older than and had a negative influence on him, and he used alcohol and marihuana indiscriminately. The report also said that the Appellant had shown that he was unable to comply with a probation order.[46]The pre-sentence report was not entirely negative: It did show that the Appellant was gaining insight into how drugs and alcohol affected him, that he had the ability and was determined to succeed academically, and, that he accepted responsibility for his actions. It is also noteworthy that the Appellant was reported to be “...shocked when he realized that he would be spending a night in jail...”[32] following his arrest for breaching the probation order by being intoxicated in November, 2003.[47]I am not certain how the sentencing judge expected that a closed custody sentence would promote the Appellant’ rehabilitation. It is likely that he wanted to provide some temporary structure in the Appellant’s life and possibly to enhance the shock value of the Appellant’s night in jail.[48]It is not necessary for me to remit this matter to the youth justice court judge for sentencing. I have the complete record of what was before that court, including the transcript from the sentencing hearing, and I am in as good a position as was the judge at first instance to decide what an appropriate sentence is for the Appellant. I agree with the sentencing judge that the Appellant needs more structure in his life. Custody, which can provide the ultimate structure, is not available as a sentencing option. But structure can be provided by lengthening the probation order that was made at first instance and bolstering its terms.[49]Two things should be noted: The Appellant is no longer a “young person”. He was 18 on June 8,2004 and will appear in adult court in the future. As well, the Appellant lives with his mother and she has made it clear that she will not tolerate it when he breaches his probation. She has provided, and I hope will continue to provide, an important and necessary policing function over the Appellant’s conduct.[50]The probation that the youth justice court judge ordered was scheduled to come into effect after the expiration of the custodial sentences and the community supervision. It comes into effect immediately. Its duration is increased from 12 to 18 months and will include, in addition to the statutory conditions and those imposed by the sentencing judge, the following:• Adhere to a curfew to be set by the Appellant’s mother in consultation with the Youth Court Worker.• Refrain from associating or having contact with those persons identified by the Appellant’s mother who have a negative influence on him. A list of names shall be compiled by the Appellant’s mother in consultation with the Youth Court Worker. The original of the list is to be filed with this court by July 31, 2004. A copy of the list shall be provided to the Appellant and the Youth Court Worker and one is to be retained by the Appellant’s mother.Summary and Disposition[51]The Appellant appealed a sentence that was imposed on him by a Provincial Court Judge sitting as a Youth Justice Court under the Youth Criminal Justice Act. The sentence included three concurrent terms of closed custody, followed by community supervision, and then probation. The Appellant claimed that the custodial sentences were not authorized by law and should be set aside. Alternatively, he claimed that custody was not necessary and should be revisited on general sentencing principles.[52]Custody was not authorized. The only possible based for the custody was the criterion set out in para. 39(1 )(b) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. However, it did not apply here since the Appellant had failed to comply with a single non-custodial sentence, and not “sentences” as required by the statute. The custody is set aside. It was unnecessary to remit the matter to the youth justice court judge for sentencing. The Appellant needed structure in his life and this could be achieved by lengthening his probation and adding to its conditions.Order[53]In the result, I order that:I. The appeal is allowed.II. The custodial sentences imposed by the Youth Justice Court Judge are set aside.III. The probation order takes effect immediately, and its length is increased from 12 to 18 months.IV. The following conditions are added to the probation:a. Adhere to a curfew to be set by the Appellant’s mother in consultation with the Youth Court Worker.b. Refrain from associating or having contact with those persons identified by the Appellant’s mother who have a negative influence on him. A list of names shall be compiled by the Appellant’s mother in consultation with the Youth Court Worker. The original of the list is to be filed with this court by July 31, 2004. A copy of the list shall be provided to the Appellant and the Youth Court Worker and one is to be retained by the Appellant’s mother.

Immediately after Whalen, P.C.J., makes this observation, he adds a further comment: “This is consistent with the pattern that is referred to in s. 39(1)(c)”. Nick Bala drew a similar comparison to the “pattern” that is referred to in para. 39(1 )(c) in his text Youth Criminal Justice Law, Irwin Law, p. 449: “Section 39(1 )(c) is intended to allow a youth justice court to respond with a custodial sentence to a case where a youth has a history of nonviolent offending. The use of the plural ‘findings’ requires, at a minimum, at least two prior convictions. Indeed, in contrast to section 39(1)(b), the use of the words ‘history’ and ‘pattern’ and the plural ‘findings’ in section 39(1 )(c) suggests that there must be at least three prior offences.”[24] Canada Law Book Inc., p. 4-9.[25] LexisNexis, Butterworths.[26] Ibid, p. 65.[27] Ibid.[28] Ibid, footnote 23, p. 448.[29] Section 39(4).[30]Tustin and Lutes noted that the YOA provided “...few rules to safeguard against a youth’s circumstances influencing the decision for a custody sentence. For example, some youth court judges routinely ordered a youth found guilty of assault into custody, even when the assault was less serious and the youth was a first-time offender”. Ibid, footnote 25, p. 66. See also Nick Bala’s comments on this point: “In contract to section 24 of the YOA, which allowed a discretionary balancing of factors when judges were deciding whether to impose a custodial disposition, section 39 of the YCJA imposes clear preconditions which must be satisfied before a custodial sentence can be imposed”. Ibid, footnote 23, p. 447.[31] A young person may be shown to have failed to comply with a non-custodial sentence if no charge was laid under s. 137 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act or s. 26 of the Young Offenders Act. Paragraph 39(1 )(b) is concerned with “failures to comply with” and not convictions for breaches of non-custodial sentences. Thus, as Andrea Tuck-Jackson says in the Annotated Youth Criminal Justice Act Service (LexisNexis, Butterworths, p. 3177), “...the Crown could establish the previous non-compliance as part of the sentencing process, either based on an admission by the youth or via evidence called at the sentencing hearing that proves the youth’s failure to comply with non-custodial sentences beyond a reasonable doubt”. It will generally be easier for the Crown to prove prior non-compliance as part of the sentencing process than it will be to charge the young person with non-compliance and obtain a conviction that becomes a part of his record. This possibility lowers the threshold somewhat for the Crown and exposes the young person to greater risk of matching the criterion set out in s. 39(1 )(b).[32] Page 4 of the Pre-sentence Report dated February 9, 2004."}

No. 100Between:Her Majesty the QueenandSelby Floyd CurtisSchwartz, J.Counsel:Mark Linehan, for the Crown;Barbara MacAdam, for the accused.[1]Schwartz, J. [orally]: Selby Floyd Curtis has pleaded guilty to the following two charges:\"1. That on or about the 24th day of October, A.D., 1998 at or near [name of town omitted], in the Province of Newfoundland, did commit a sexual assault on E.J. contrary to section 271 of the Criminal Code of Canada.2.

He then forced his way into the home.[4]The complainant asked the accused to leave her property after he entered. He indicated he would, but instead, Curtis grabbed the complainant, forced her onto a bed, and began taking her pants off. The accused placed his hand over the complainant's mouth and threatened her by saying \"if you tell anyone you'll be sorry.\" He then removed the complainant's clothing and penetrated her vagina.[5]After, the accused asked for other sexual acts but this was refused by the complainant. He proceeded to leave but before doing so stated: \"I'll be back again tonight and if you don't let me in I'll come through the window again.\" He then left the residence and the complainant immediately went to her brother's home and called the police.[6]It is on the foregoing facts that convictions were entered concerning both charges.The Victim[7]E.J. is a widow and presently 36 of age. In a victim impact statement she related she is afraid of the accused and sometimes afraid to sleep at night thinking that the accused will come back into her home.[8]The incident has caused the victim considerable emotional upheaval and she now has difficulty trusting male individuals.The accused[9]Selby Floyd Curtis is a 33 year old individual and the father of two children. He is divorced from his former spouse.[10]The accused has a Grade Six education and during his working life has had periods of employment as a labourer.Sentencing Considerations[11]In R. v. Vokey (H.A.) (2000), 2000 NFCA 14 (CanLII), 186 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 1; 564 A.P.R. 1 (Nfld. C.A.), the Newfoundland Court of Appeal determined that an eighteen month sentence for a sexual assault involving intercourse with a young complainant was out of the normal sentencing range considered to be generally appropriate. The court found at p. 14 of that decision:\"The appropriate range, absent special circumstances, is that stated by the Crown before this court, that is, 3 to 5 years. However, that alone is not determinative of the issue. As this court noted in R. v. R.W.B., [see Note 3 below] which is filed concurrently with this decision, there may exist factors which could result in a lesser or greater sentence than the normal range.\"[12]Courts in this jurisdiction have recognized that the appropriate sentence for a sexual assault, which involves intercourse, should be three years or more dependent on the circumstances of a particular case.[13]Aggravating factors which I have considered in this matter include the degree of violence used by the accused. Curtis forced his way into the complainant's home in the early hours of the morning, took control of his victim, threatened physical harm if she told anyone, and further threatened that he would return to the house.[14]The accused also has a criminal record containing assault related offences and threats for which he has been incarcerated.[15]This court has also considered the mitigating factors which favour the accused. These include the guilty pleas to the charges, which has saved the complainant the further trauma of coming to court to give evidence, and the fact that the accused was co-operative with the R.C.M.P. after his arrest.Sentence[16]I have considered the foregoing and the submissions of counsel in determining an appropriate sentence in this matter.[17]In cases of sexual assault such as this I am satisfied that the principles of deterrence, punishment, and protection of the public must be paramount in determining a proper sentence. However, the sentence must never be used as a tool of vengeance against the accused.[18]Mr. Curtis has spent 5.5 months in pretrial custody before a determination was made by the Crown that such was not necessitated. Generally, any pretrial custody is multiplied by two and credited toward a final sentence for an accused. I am satisfied the accused has spent the equivalent of one year of incarceration for these offences prior to this hearing.[19]An appropriate sentence for this charge of sexual assault, without consideration of the time already spent in custody, would be in the range of 3.5 years. I am therefore sentencing the accused to a further 30 months in Her Majesty's Penitentiary for this offence after giving due consideration to the pretrial custody.[20]Mr. Curtis is also sentenced to a further six months in Her Majesty's Penitentiary for the breach of s. 349(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada. This is to be served concurrent with the previous sentence.[21]The accused is also prohibited from possessing any firearm, crossbow, prohibitive weapon, restricted weapon, prohibitive device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition, and explosive substance for a period of 10 years following the accused's release from imprisonment. Order accordingly."}

Benrtson, 2000 SKCA 47 (CanLII), [2000] S.J. 237 (Sask.C.A.).STATUTES CONSIDERED: Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 ss.122, 368.(1), 386.(1)(c), 718.(1), 718.(2).REASONS FOR JUDGMENTDYMOND, J.:[1]Wilson (Wally) Andersen has entered guilty pleas to two Counts: one Count for uttering forged documents in connection with his public duties against the government; the second Count involves breach of trust in connection with his public duties against the government, contrary to s.122 of the Criminal Code.[2]s.368. (1) states:“Every one who, knowing that a document is forged,(a) uses, deals with or acts upon it, or(b) causes or attempts to cause any per to use, deal with or act upon it, as if the document were genuine,(c) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a terms not exceeding ten years.[3]The total amount relating to the forgery charge as set out in an Agreed Statement of Facts is $59,054.34.(See Schedule “A”, attached.)The Agreed Statement of Facts sets out one instance involving the purchase invoice of a snowmobile.The amount involving the forgery was $6,020, which was fictitious.[4]The largest dollar amount of the forgery count involves translation services that did not take place.This involved some 69 forged invoices, which resulted in $33,559.50 being claimed for services which did not take place.[5]These fraudulent transactions span over the years 1997 through to 2006.The Agreed Statement of Fact sets out other areas of forged documents involving the rent of office space, transportation, and a housing study that was never conducted.A final area involves the payment of a $600 light bill on behalf of a client.It was not Mr. Andersen’s light bill, but one of his constituent’s light bills, where the constituent could not afford to pay the bill and Andersen forged documents to cover the cost.[6]Count number 2 involves s.122 of the Criminal Code set out below:“Every official who, in connection with the duties of his office, commits fraud or a breach of trust is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, whether or not the fraud or breach of trust would be an offence if it were committed in relation to a private person.”[7]The activities involving this offence related to expenditures over and above monies allowed for constituency allowance spending.[8]In the fiscal year 2002 – 2003, Mr. Andersen claimed $15,657 over and above what he was entitled to claim legitimately.In the fiscal year 2003 – 2004, Mr. Andersen claimed $14,783 over and above what he was entitled to as set out on page 13 of the Agreed Statement of Facts.These were monies that were claimed without receipts, mainly due to the poor system of accountability that was in place at the House of Assembly to catch such over-spending by MHAs in the years 2003 and 2004.[9]The system was based on the honor system.MHAs knew their spending allowances; anything over should have been caught by the system.For reasons outlined in a public inquiry into the spending habits of MHAs, it is clearly documented why these allowances were not picked up.The accused has admitted to his over-spending on these amounts.He admits that he had knowledge of the over-spending in the amount of $30,440, set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts.THE ACCUSED[10]Mr. Wally Andersen, as he likes to be referred to, is now 59 years of age.He has served in public life as an MHA for the large geographic district of Torngat Mountains in Labrador, since first being elected as a member of the House of Assembly in 1996.He remained in that position until his resignation in 2007.[11]Mr. Andersen served as the Minister of Labrador and Aboriginal Affairs from February of 2003 to October of 2003.That particular position ended as a result of the election which took place in 2003.Mr. Andersen now comes before the Court as a first-time offender.Although of aboriginal ancestral descent, Mr. Andersen does not ask the Court to consider his aboriginal background, pursuant to the Gladue Principles for the purposes of sentencing.Through his counsel, Mr. Andersen says this would not be appropriate under the circumstances of this case.As such, I will deal with the sentencing of Mr. Andersen as I would any first-time offender that comes before this Court.[12]I have no further personal information on Mr. Andersen, other than what his counsel has put on the record.[13]Mr. Andersen makes no excuses for his behavior by way of alcohol abuse, drug abuse or gambling addictions, which are so often the case in these types of crimes.Monies acquired by fraudulent means are often used to feed the habit of offenders, as referred to in R. v. Benrtson 2000 SKCA 47 (CanLII), [2000] S.J. 237 (Sask.C.A).This is not the case with Mr. Andersen.So Wally Andersen, directly in his own words and through the words of his counsel, claims that his weakest attribute was that he did not know how to say no to his constituents who were often in need of necessities, including shelter, heat and light, and other basics.[14]Mr. Andersen himself, when asked if he had anything to add to what his counsel had to say on his behalf, did say he did not personally benefit from the monies unlawfully in his possession, as a result of these fraudulent means.This may well be the case; however, Mr. Andersen would have benefited indirectly by being able to do things for his constituents which members who did not over-spend were unable to do.This is an unproven or untraceable possible benefit.As the Crown quite properly pointed out, that is why there are spending limits, to create a level playing field.If elected members cannot be trusted to obey the law, then what message does that send to the general public.[15]That said, I accept that some of these monies could well have been used for the benefit of Mr. Andersen’s constituents.This however does not take away from the fact that Mr. Andersen, as a public official, broke the law over a considerable period of time and this is not a case of an isolated incident.CASE LAW[16]Sentences for these types of offences vary from sentences which involve suspended sentences in isolated instances, to federal prison terms for other offences, and conditional sentences with house arrest for specific individual cases, or straight periods of imprisonment.(Refer to cases set out in Crown’s List of Authorities.)[17]The most recent decision of this jurisdiction is the case of R. v. Byrne, 2009, Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R., 286 (Prov.Ct.), a decision arising out of the same spending scandal as is Mr. Andersen’s case.The case is relevant in that Honourable Chief Judge D. Mark Pike, of the Provincial Court, who presided over the Byrne decision, has canvassed many of the cases that have been submitted by counsel in the present case.I will review a couple of these cases in a few minutes.It is sufficient to state that Judge D. Mark Pike’s analysis was thorough and up-to-date.[18]In the Byrne decision, the issue before the Trial Judge was not so much the length of the sentence as it was whether the sentence should be served conditionally in the community with house arrest.Judge Pike summed up his view on that issue at paragraph 42 of his decision, when he stated:“In circumstances such as these, the need for denunciation is so pressing that incarceration in custody is the only suitable way to express society’s condemnation of the offender’s conduct.A message must be sent by the sentence imposed by the court that will help the public understand that this conduct was highly reprehensible and that it carries with it serious criminal consequences.”[19]In that case, it was pointed out to Judge Pike that a conditional sentence could, in fact, be appropriate for a fraud case.The Judge summed up the situation after citing the case of R. v. Coffin, (2006) 2006 QCCA 471 (CanLII), 210 CCC (3rd) 227 (Que.C.A.), which was on appeal from a two year conditional sentence.At paragraph 35 of the Byrne decision, the Judge cites the Coffin decision:“After a thorough review of the cases, the Court of Appeal concluded as follows:66This should not be seen to imply that conditional sentences may not be imposed in cases of fraud; indeed, the decisions cited by the respondent illustrate that they may.It should be noted however that, generally speaking, conditional sentences have been granted by appellate courts in response to particular circumstances.67In the R. v. Bunn, a decision of the Supreme Court, the amount of money was only $86,000.68As the attached table shows, counsel for the respondent have also cited one decision of the Court of Appeal of Alberta, two of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and four of this Court and one of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, all of which granted conditional sentences in cases of fraud.69Of all the judgments relied upon by the respondent, only Moulton involved a misappropriation of public funds (approximately $274,000).In other cases of fraud against the government or one of its agencies, appellate courts have imposed custodial sentences.See R. v. Kerntopf (5 years), R. v. Dudek (4 years) R. v. Bouchard (1 year), R. v. Poirier (3 years), R. V Oliynyk (1 year) and R. v. Bernston (1 year).”[20]Judge Pike then concludes, at paragraph 36 of the Byrne decision, as follows:“[36]The court in Coffin (supra) went on to find that the “prime objectives” of general deterrence and denunciation were not given proper consideration by the sentencing judge.The conditional sentence was set aside and a period of 18 months in custody substituted.”[21]In Coffin, the accused was a first-time offender who had pleaded guilty to 15 counts of fraud through his advertising company; the accused submitted 373 fraudulent invoices to the Government of Canada, with a total misappropriation ofa little over $1.5 million dollars.The accused was 62 years old with no criminal record.[22]After reviewing the case law set out above, Judge Pike imposed the two years less a day in prison sentence on Mr. Byrne for bribery and for defrauding the Provincial Government.[23]In Judge Pike’s conclusion at paragraph 37, he states:“[37]In many aspects, the circumstances of the offences committed by Byrne were more egregious than those in Coffin (supra) and the other cases cited above in paragraph 33 in which custodial sentences were held to be appropriate.There is a higher degree of moral blameworthiness.”[24]In the case of Wally Andersen, neither the Crown nor the Defence is asking the Court to impose a conditional sentence on Mr. Andersen.The issue before me is: what is a proper sentence for Mr. Andersen for the two offences he had pleaded guilty to.POSITION OF THE CROWN AND DEFENCE AS TO THELENGTH OF SENTENCE[25]The Crown makes its case based on the Byrne decision, and cases such as R. v. Bogart, 2002 CanLII 41073 (ON CA), 167, CCC (3rd) 390; 2002 Carswell Ont. 2537 (C.A), where the court imposed 18 months incarceration; and the case of R. v. Coffin, (2006) 2006 QCCA 471 (CanLII), 210 CCC (3rd) 227 (Que.C.A.), I referred to at paragraph 19 above, where the court set aside a two year conditional sentence and substituted 18 months imprisonment along with restitution.[26]The Crown argues that the sentence on Mr. Andersen should be either at the high end of two years less a day, and no lower than 18 months globally for the two offences before the court.[27]The Defence asked the court to consider the circumstances of Mr. Anderson, the size of his district, the fact that there was no monetary gain (something the Crown disputes), the guilty plea, and the fact that Mr. Andersen is a first-time offender, and the circumstances surrounding how the monies were used to impose a low end sentence of six months to a high end of nine months.[28]ANALYSIS(A) Mitigating Factors:[29]The plea of guilty is a mitigating factor.The fact that Mr. Andersen is a first-time offender is also a mitigating factor.The fact that the motive was not for personal gain or greed is a factor the court has to consider.Some of the monies may have been redirected to the constituency and its constituents, according to counsel for Mr. Andersen and Mr. Andersen’s own statement.Mr. Andersen certainly gained indirectly as a result of his actions, as I explained earlier.Mr. Andersen has expressed remorse for is actions, which I accept as genuine, and his guilty plea was timely, considering the length of time the investigation took and the complexity of the documentation involved.(B)Aggravating factors:[30]Mr. Andersen was an MHA and a Cabinet Minister for at least part of the time these offences were committed.He was aware he had spending limits, yet he exceeded these limits.He was aware that services he claimed for did not take place and the forgeries were numerous and continued over several years.Mr. Andersenbreached a position of public trust.These are all aggravating factors to consider in this case.[31]The Crown argues that the case is similar to the Byrne decision and the Coffin decision, therefore justifying an upper limit in relation to sentencing and that the high end of 24 months is appropriate.[32]However, I have reviewed the Byrne decision and I feel that it is distinguishable from the case at bar to some degree.Mr. Byrne had been charged with bribery.He induced an employee at the House of Assembly by allegedly paying some $18,000 to get extra monies.The maximum sentence for bribery is 14 years in prison.Mr. Byrne was also clearly the beneficiary of these monies.The charge of forgery has a 10 year maximum penalty and any sentence should reflect the maximum placed by Parliament for each offence that an offender is either found guilty of or pleads guilty to.[33]These are observations that are relevant to the sentencing judge, but not necessarily important to the public, who looks at bribery, forgery, and fraud all in the same light.In other words, public money has gone missing.[34]Bribery of a public official, I submit, is a more serious offence than is forgery.Mr. Andersen did not involve a third party in his actions to defraud; it is his own responsibility.That is not to say it is not serious, but it is less serious and distinguishable, but not forgivable in the context of sentencing.[35]The deterrence principle, both general and specific, as outline in s.718.(1) and 718.(2) of the Criminal Code, is meant to deter Mr. Andersen from future criminal activity.More importantly, the deterrence of like-minded persons who serve public office or are in positions of trust has to be targeted.[36]This is why a conditional sentence of two years or any time less than two years is not an appropriate sentence on the facts and the circumstances Mr. Andersen finds himself in.[37]I have carefully reviewed the Statement of Fact as introduced by the Crown and the Defence.I have reviewed the cases as presented by Mr. Coffey and Ms. Knickle and I have carefully considered the arguments put forward by both the Crown and the Defence.[38]Mr. Andersen, would you please stand?[39]I have decided that an appropriate sentence on the forgery charge, under s.386(1)(c), considering everything that I have said above, to be 15 months in prison.In relation to the breach of s.122, breach of trust by a public official, an appropriate sentence should be 9 months in prison, to be served concurrent to Count number one.[40]I will impose a Restitution Order to be paid by Mr. Andersen, in the amount of $89,474.34, to be repaid to the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador.The terms of repayment should be negotiated with the representatives of the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador; that no amount will have to be repaid until Mr. Andersen is released from prison.[41]This sentence will not satisfy the public; however, I believe the sentence is a reasonable balance for deterrence of you and like-minded government officials.Yet, it is not so crushing that it will prevent you from rehabilitating yourself and allowing yourself to become a productive member of the public, in much the same way you were when you were an MHA for Labrador.[42]I see no need for a probationary period following the release, as I believe Mr. Andersen is at a low risk to re-offend._____________________________WAYNE G.

CARDINAL, JINTRODUCTION[1]Over the course of two days in November 2012, Mr. Neault broke into two motor vehicles and stole three firearms (two rifles and a shotgun) as well as some ammunition and other items.On November 21, 2012, after making inquiries as to who might wish to buy these firearms, Mr. Neault found a buyer and sold the three firearms to another person.After the commission of these offences, he committed further offences in December relating to theft of items from vehicles.During the police investigation, Mr. Neault told the police that another person had committed the offence of breaking and entering and stealing a firearm from a vehicle when he knew that was not true.Further police investigation proved that the named person was not involved and Mr. Neault confessed his own involvement and to misleading the police.[2]As a result of his actions, Mr. Neault has pled guilty to the following charges:Count 1:Between November 12, 2012 and the 19th day of November 2012, at or near Tisdale, Saskatchewan he did break and enter a certain place to wit a motor vehicle situated at the Recplex in Tisdale, Saskatchewan and did steal a firearm located in it contrary to s. 98(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.Count 2: Between the 12th day of November 2012 and the 19th of November 2012, did steal Canadian currency, the property of unknown person of a value not exceeding $5,000.00 contrary to s. 334(b) of the Criminal Code.Count 6: On or about November 21, 2012, he did transfer a firearm to wit: two rifles and a shotgun knowing that he was not authorized to do so contrary to s. 99(2) of the Criminal Code.Count 7: On or about the 8th day of December 2012 and the 11th day of December 2012, at Tisdale did steal a GPS system and Canadian currency the property of unknown person of a value not exceeding $5,000.00 contrary to s. 334(b) of the Criminal Code.Count 11: On or about December 17, 2012, did commit public mischief in that with the intent to mislead he caused Cst. Cameron Schmidt, a peace officer, to enter upon an investigation by making a false statement to Cst. Cameron Schmidt that accused N.B. of having committed the offence of break and entering to steal a firearm contrary to s. 140(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.[3]The Crown elected to proceed by indictment with respect to the break and enter into the motor vehicle and steal the firearms contrary to s. 98(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.There is no minimum penalty.[4]Of concern is the charge that he transferred firearms, being two rifles and a shotgun, knowing he was not authorized to do so contrary to s. 99(2) of the Criminal Code.The Crown proceeded by indictment and this offence carries a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a first offence of three years and a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years.[5]The remaining matters proceeded by way of summary conviction and all carry a maximum sentence of six months imprisonment.[6]Mr. Neault has given notice and is challenging the constitutional validity of the mandatory minimum penalty in s. 99(2) of the Criminal Code as a violation of s. 12 of the Charter, being his right not to be subject to cruel and unusual punishment.By agreement of counsel, it was decided that the Court would first determine an appropriate sentence without considering the three year minimum sentence.If I find that a fit sentence is one that is less than three years, further argument will be made regarding the constitutionality of s. 99(2) and whether it violates s. 12 of the Charter and if so, whether it can be saved by a s. 1 analysis or if it should be declared of no force and effect.[7]Counsel for Mr. Neault submits that an appropriate sentence is in the range of two years less a day incarceration for all charges, but is not arguing that a Conditional Sentence Order be made.The Crown submits that a global sentence of three and one-half years is appropriate, with three years being the appropriate sentence for the s. 99 trafficking offence.FACTS[8]The Crown read in the facts and they are not in dispute.On November 12, 2012, Mr. Neaultand his co-accused looked through vehicles for things to steal.Approximately $5.00 was stolen from one vehicle, and the accused found a shotgun in another vehicle, stole it and gave it to the co-accused to conceal.They returned to Mr. Neault’s residence where Mr. Neault then kept the shotgun, hiding it in a mattress under a trailer.No value was provided for the shotgun.[9]On November 19, 2012, the stealing continued with $13.00 being stolen from two vehicles.Mr. Neault and his co-accused again found two rifles locked in a vehicle.They broke in and stole the rifles, one being a .22 calibre and the other a Browning lever action (no calibre given) equipped with a scope, with a combined valued of $1,700.00.Mr. Neault took them home and hid them with the shotgun. Also taken was a backpack, knives, two boxes of .22 calibre ammunition, a spotting scope and range finder all valued at approximately $930.00.[10]Mr. Neault let it be known to others that he wanted to sell the firearms.On November 21, 2012, a buyer met Mr. Neault and purchased the three firearms for $300.00.According to Mr. Neault, the buyer was aware the firearms were stolen and that the sale was unlawful.[11]On December 8, 2012, Mr. Neault continued to steal items, being two GPS systems and $80.00 in cash from two vehicles.On December 11, 2012 he stole $40.00 from two vehicles.[12]The police investigation led to Mr. Neault, and on December 19, 2012, Mr. Neault provided a statement to the police implicating another young man in the break and enter and theft of the firearms.The police investigated further and found that person was not involved with the thefts.On December 20, 2012, Mr. Neault admitted to police that he had lied about the young man’s involvement and was just trying to get him into trouble as they had a previous disagreement.By this point the co-accused had provided information implicating Mr. Neault, and Mr. Neault then admitted his own involvement.[13]The firearms have not yet been recovered although the person who purchased them has been charged.[14]Before venturing into the constitutionality of the mandatory and minimum sentence in s. 99(2) of the Criminal Code, I must first determine if a sentence of three years or more is appropriate.If such a sentence is appropriate in the circumstances, then the constitutionality of the provision is academic.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ACCUSED[15]A Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) was prepared in this matter.Mr. Neault advised that as a child his family was transient but he did not experience any problems or abuse.He did not know his biological father while growing up, but did reconnect with him at age 18.His stepfather appears to have been a positive influence, but that relationship broke down when his mother and stepfather ended the relationship.He has a close relationship with his four siblings, but has not seen his two stepsisters in the last 4 or 5 years.He has positive support from others, especially his girlfriend of 18 months.She does not use drugs or alcohol nor does she have any criminal involvement.[16]Mr. Neault’s work history is sporadic and he has been fired from jobs for not attending hisscheduled shifts.He was unemployed at the time of the offences and is currently unemployed.He has some physical health issues as a result of falls in 2012 but is not on medication.However, during argument, counsel for Mr. Neault indicated that Mr. Neault has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and does take medication for it.There was no indication when that diagnosis occurred or how long he has been taking medication.[17]He identified that he has experimented with illicit drugs since he was 13 and has used alcohol since the age of 17.While he has tried cocaine, crystal methamphetamine, MDMA and ecstasy, his drug of choice is marihuana, which he used every two or three days since the age of 13.He advises he was consuming drugs and alcohol during some of the offences, but has not used drugs or alcohol since his release on conditions on December 24, 2012.His family have voiced concerns about his drinking, but Mr. Neault does not view it as problematic, even though he admits his longest period of sobriety since he started drinking was 7 months (that being the time he has been on release conditions).However, during submissions, counsel for Mr. Neault advised the Court that Mr. Neault will take drug and alcohol counselling if ordered to do so and will comply with any order not to consume drugs or alcohol.[18]At page 9 of the PSR it notes: “Jessie stated his motivation for his current offences was for financial gain to pay for food, rent and outstanding bills.When Jessie was asked if he felt crime was wrong or not, he stated, “that is a tricky question”.He feels without crime it would be a perfect world, but with crime it keeps the world balanced.In his opinion, crime is “bad” but there are reasons for people to commit crimes.”The report noted that while Jessie stated his peers are not involved in criminal activity, of the peers he identified, two were his co-accused.[19]The Saskatchewan Primary Risk Assessment placed Mr. Neault’s overall risk for general re-offending as being high.He was assessed as being at the 86th percentile which means 14% of Saskatchewan offenders were assessed as having more risk factors.His major risk factors are: peers and companions, residence instability, substance abuse, attitude, unemployment, financial difficulties and a lack of self management.Mitigating Factors[20]In mitigation, Mr. Neault is a 20 year old young man who entered timely pleas of guilty to these offences.[21]Mr. Neault has a minimal criminal record which is comprised of a previous conviction as a youth in 2009 where he was granted a six month conditional discharge for theft under $5,000.00.His only conviction as an adult was on June 4, 2013, for possession of a weapon dangerous to the public peace contrary to s. 88 of the Criminal Code for which he was sentenced to four months probation.While he completed the period of probation, he re-offended by committing these offences approximately one and a half months after his period of probation ended.Aggravating Factors[22]Mr. Neault committed the offences for financial gain.[23]He stole three firearms and returned them to his residence where he hid them.[24]It was Mr. Neault who actively sought buyer(s) for the firearms.[25]Mr. Neault and the buyer met at Mr. Neault’s residence and negotiated the sale.Both knew the firearms were stolen and that Mr. Neault was not able to lawfully transfer them.[26]The firearms were not recovered.[27]He did not admit his responsibility easily, but rather misled the police and implicated an innocent person in a serious criminal matter, simply because he was upset with that person.[28]After stealing and hiding the firearms and negotiating their sale, Mr. Neault continued to steal items from other vehicles.His criminal behaviour would have continued but for police intervention.Gladue Factors[29]There are no Gladue factors to consider.PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[30]The purpose and principles of sentencing are set out in s. 718, 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code:718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.[31]As noted in R. v. Christensen, 2012 BCPC 374 (CanLII), at paragraph 10:The overarching duty of a trial judge is to apply all legitimate principles of sentencing to determine a “just and appropriate sentence” which reflects the gravity of the offence committed and the moral blameworthiness of the offender (R. v. C.A.M., 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), (1996) 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327).Section 99[32]As the constitutionality of section 99 of the Criminal Code is being challenged, I shall first consider the appropriate sentence for trafficking in firearms without consideration of the three year minimum sentence mandated.If, after applying the general principles of sentencing to this offence and this offender, I find the appropriate sentence is three years or more, the constitutionality issue will become academic.(See Christensen, supra, at para. 13.)[33]Section 99 of the Criminal Code appears in Part III: Firearms and other Weapons, under the heading “Trafficking Offences”.As observed by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII), at para. 147, “Firearms trafficking offences are extremely serious, carrying substantial penalties.”[34]Neither counsel provided any case law from Saskatchewan concerning sentences for charges under s. 99 or offences involving trafficking in or possession for the purpose of trafficking in firearms.There are a number of other cases involving carrying a weapon (a firearm) dangerous to the public peace or carrying a loaded firearm, but these are not helpful as it is one thing to have possession of a firearm and quite another to traffick in firearms.Counsel have filed cases from other jurisdictions which provide some guidance.[35]Firearms offences concern both the Court and the community at large as they are inherently dangerous.The strict regulation of the purchase and sale of firearms is necessary to protect the public and guard against the illegal sale and distribution of firearms.[36]In Christensen, supra, the accused was sentenced to four years imprisonment after being found guilty on a number of firearm offences including possession of a prohibited firearm with readily accessible ammunition (s. 95(1)) and offering to transfer firearms (s. 100) which carried mandatory minimum sentences of three years and maximum sentences of ten years.As the constitutionality of those provisions was in issue, the sentencing judge determined a fit sentence without resort to the minimum punishment.Mr. Christensen was 19 years of age at the time of the offences and had no previous criminal record.He had purchased firearms from a co-accused and intended to sell them for a profit.After crediting him with double credit for 6 months time served, he was ordered to serve the remaining three years incarcerated, and the constitutionality issue became academic.[37]In R. v. C.L., 2012 ONCJ 413 (CanLII), a sentence of two years less a day with credit for one year time served was imposed on charges of trafficking in cocaine, with one year consecutive for firearms trafficking as well as three years probation.This case is distinguishable as the accused had offered to sell a .45 calibre firearm to an undercover police officer during drug transactions.The Court accepted that it was a “hollow offer” meant to keep the officer returning to purchase more drugs and that the accused did not have actual possession of a firearm nor did he have access to one or anyintention to transfer it.The Court considered that his criminal culpability was more directly connected with the sale of cocaine.[38]I agree with this observation in C.L., supra, at para. 11:...While firearms in general and handguns in particular are dangerous and a pressing public concern in the greater Toronto area, the hollow offer that forms the substance of this charge has to be seen to be a less serious offence than the actual possession of a firearm.The likelihood of danger that a firearm could be used, to harm members of the public, is much higher in the case of actual possession of a gun, than is the offering to get one in the future, and particularly so when the offerer has no intention of actually making the firearm available. ...[39]In R. v. Ivanic, 2011 BCCA 158 (CanLII), the accused sold 3 restricted and 2 prohibited firearms to an undercover police officer.He was also involved in a shoot out when he was attacked by people he was involved with in a drug deal.His minimal criminal record contained a recent conviction for trafficking in drugs where he received a conditional sentence and firearm prohibition.He was sentenced to 8 years incarceration, but with double credit for 22 months time served his cumulative sentence was 44 months.The sentence was upheld on appeal.While Mr. Neault is not facing a sentence of that magnitude, these comments of the Court at para. 21 are applicable:[21] ... Offences involving firearms and the sale of firearms are serious matters and sentences need to reflect society’s condemnation against those who participate in such activities.DECISION[40]Mr. Neault has a limited criminal record, but does have a recent conviction for a weapons related offence.His moral culpability is high.He participated in the theft of three firearms and other items from vehicles, motivated by financial gain.Mr. Neault took the initiative to locate a buyer and successfully arranged the sale of the firearms to another person.While counsel for Mr. Neault argued that the guns were sold to a local resident, not to a known criminal organization or gang member, that is immaterial in my opinion.The fact remains he stole and then sold firearms.[41]The degree of planning and deliberation is also a factor in determining the severity of the offence (See Christensen, supra, at para. 22).Mr. Neault may have stumbled upon the firearms in the sense that he was not specifically seeking them during his break and entry into automobiles.He did however, hide the firearms and then actively seek a buyer, which involved him talking to others.One of these people provided the name of the buyer and the sale occurred rather quickly.This ability to turn the guns quickly into financial gain, although not requiring a lot of sophisticated planning,places the offence toward the middle of the scale.[42]Mr. Neault lacks insight into his own behaviour and has a simplistic view of how to avoid criminal behaviour.He initially failed to recognize his alcohol and drug issues, but now, belatedly, admits drug and alcohol use is an issue that he is willing to address.The attitude that comes through in the PSR is one of an immature young man who cannot maintain employment and seeks what he perceives to be an easy way out of financial difficulties by committing serious criminal offences.He does not seem to appreciate the gravity of the firearm offences.As noted in Christensen, supra, at paragraph 23, crimes committed for financial gain garner higher sentences.[43]A significant period of incarceration is warranted to denounce in the strongest terms Mr. Neault’s conduct in stealing and then trafficking in firearms.Specific and general deterrence also must be stressed to ensure Mr. Neault does not find criminal behaviour appealing, or a justifiable response to financial difficulties.Similarly, the threat of a penitentiary sentence is necessary to ensure others do not travel down this path.[44]In this case, while there is hope for rehabilitation of Mr. Neault, that principle is not at the forefront.He continued with a pattern of criminal behaviour that included repeated thefts, stealing firearms, trafficking in firearms and culminating with obstructing justice by blaming an innocent person.[45]Without considering the three year minimum sentence for the offence of trafficking in firearms, I find a fit sentence for Mr. Neault is three years.Such a sentence addresses the seriousness with which trafficking in firearms offences are treated by Parliament and other courts.It speaks to society’s condemnation and serves as a warning to others that such dangerous criminal behaviour will be visited by lengthy periods of incarceration.[46]Further, the offence of breaking and entering into a vehicle and stealing firearms contrary to s. 98 (1)(b) of the Criminal Code carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.Neither counsel filed any case law.It may be argued that this offence is at least as serious as the trafficking in firearms, although it does not carry a minimum sentence.The availability of life imprisonment underscores the seriousness of stealing firearms and sends a strong message of deterrence.Nothing short of a period of incarceration of at least three years is warranted even for a first offence for an offender with no criminal record.Anything less fails to address denunciation and deterrence in the widest sense.[47]Mr. Neault spent four days on remand prior to his release on conditions in December 2012.I will credit those four days on Count 11.In all of the circumstances, and taking into account Mr. Neault’s guilty pleas, and considering the totality principle, I sentence Mr. Neault to the following:Count 6:trafficking in firearms contrary to s. 99(2) of the Criminal Code - 3 years incarceration;Count 1:break and enter a motor vehicle and steal a firearm contrary to s. 98(1)(b) - 3 years incarceration concurrent;Count 11:commit public mischief with intent to mislead a peace officer contrary to s. 140(1)(a) of the Criminal Code - 124 days minus the 4 days spent on remand, results in 120 days incarceration consecutive to Count 6 but concurrent to all other charges;Count 2:theft of currency of a value not exceeding five thousand dollars contrary to s. 334(b) of the Criminal Code - two months incarceration concurrent to all charges;Count 7:steal a GPS system and Canadian currency of a value not exceeding five thousand dollars contrary to s. 334(b) of the Criminal Code - three months incarceration concurrent to all charges.[48]I will hear submissions from counsel concerning collateral orders and surcharges.CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE[49]Having found a fit sentence is three years incarceration for trafficking in firearms pursuant to section 99(2) of the Criminal Code, the constitutional challenge to the mandatory minimum sentence of three years incarceration is academic and will not be further considered.I.

The judge took note of that fact, but observed that the six-month sentence he imposed «aurait été raisonnable sans égard au minimum prescrit par la loi» (paragraph [10]). We agree. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to consider whether the statutory minimum sentence is constitutional.FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS THE COURT:[9]GRANTS the respondent’s motion to dismiss the grounds for appeal based on the unconstitutionality of the minimum sentence for the offence;[10]DISMISSES the motion for leave to appeal;[11]ORDERS the appellant to surrender himself to the prison authorities within 72 hours of this judgment.LOUIS ROCHETTE, J.A.NICHOLAS KASIRER, J.A.CLAUDE C.

(3d) 360 (NLCA).STATUTES CONSIDERED: Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.EDITED ORAL REASONS FOR JUDGMENTStacK, J.:INTRODUCTION[1]George Keeping takes his surname literally; at least he did regarding his long-suffering wife, Gail.Key to his idea of a successful marriage was keeping strict control over his spouse – physically, emotionally and financially.Ms. Keeping did not always suffer in silence, though.At times she struck back, physically and financially.When she struck back physically, he would have her charged; she has the criminal record for assault to show for it.When she struck back financially, he would also have her charged; she already has one conviction for stealing from him and she now faces sentencing on two more.[2]In sentencing Ms. Keeping, I must balance society’s interests in denouncing her criminal conduct and in deterring her and others from engaging in such conduct against society’s equally important interest in rehabilitating the offender so that she has the best possible prospects of a crime-free future.charges and agreed statement of facts[3]On March 2, 2012, Ms. Keeping pleaded guilty to one count of theft over $5000 and one count of theft under $5000. Convictions were entered on both based upon the agreed statement of facts that provides:On October 20, 2009 the Grand Bank Detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) entered into a theft investigation.George Keeping of Fortune, NL advised the police that his company, Keeping Enterprises, had been the victim of a series of thefts.On routine review of the company’s books, Mr. Keeping’s accountant discovered multiple cash withdraws from automatic bank machines (ABMs) and brought it to Mr. Keeping’s attention.The person responsible had withdrawn cash in varying amounts from the business account on numerous occasions between January 22, 2009 to October 14, 2009.The total amount of the monies taken was $27,934.50.Most of the ABM withdrawals took place at the Grand Bank branch of Scotiabank where there was a surveillance camera installed.Mr. Keeping went to the bank and asked that the bank check the footage from the camera against the withdrawal statements to determine if there was footage of the person using his debit card.The bank subsequently provided several photographs to Cst. Mark Jenkins of the RCMP.Upon viewing the photographs, Mr. Keeping identified the person making the ABM withdrawals in the photos as his wife, Gail Keeping.Mr. Keeping told the RCMP that his wife Gail was not a partner in Keeping Enterprises.Mr. Keeping did not use ABM machines for cash withdrawals from his business account, but rather used cheques or point-of-sale transactions.On February 1, 2010, George Keeping attended the Grand Bank RCMP with a copy of a cheque that had been cashed.The cheque was from the Coast Guard and was made out to Mr. Keeping in the amount of $871.05.He claimed that he had never received the cheque but his name had been signed on the back and the cheque had been cashed at Collins Fresh Mart.Mr. Keeping told the RCMP that the signature on the cheque was not his own.He told police that he believed Gail Keeping might have cashed the cheque without his knowledge and had taken the money.On February 1, 2010, Gail Keeping attended the Grand Bank RCMP and agreed to provide a cautioned statement to Cst. Jenkins.In her statement Gail Keeping first denied having anything to do with the stolen money but eventually she confessed to taking the debit card without Mr. Keeping’s knowledge and withdrawing money.Gail said she knew the PIN number because he had told her what it was.She was reluctant to admit that she had been withdrawing the money since January 2009, saying that she thought that she had started around September 2009.She also said she did not think she had taken anywhere near the total amount of money that had been stolen.She estimated that she had taken around $8,000-$9,000.She later stated that is was possible that she had been taking the money since January 2009 and that she had taken closer to the full amount but she could not remember doing so as her memory was poor due to prescription drug use.With regard to the Coast Guard cheque, Gail Keeping admitted that she had indeed cashed the cheque.She said that Mr. Keeping had been sick and told her to take it and get groceries with it.She said she had bought about $500.00 worth of groceries and believed that she had given Mr. Keeping the change.She could not remember if she had signed Mr. Keeping’s name to the cheque or not.The RCMP subsequently charged Gail Keeping with two counts of theft.sentencing in contextPre-Sentence Report and Ms. Keeping’s Testimony[4]The facts as set out in the Agreed Statement of Facts do not put these crimes in their proper domestic context.For that, one needs to look to the Pre-Sentence Report and Ms. Keeping’s testimony at her sentencing hearing.The Crown has not contested the facts as set out in the Pre-Sentence Report and did not subject Ms. Keeping to a very rigorous cross-examination at the hearing.The Crown concedes that Ms. Keeping’s actions were in the nature of a self-help remedy.On the facts, that is a reasonable position to take.Let me explain why.[5]Ms. Keeping is 48 years old, was born in Happy Valley-Goose Bay and is of Inuit descent.She had a reasonably stable upbringing in Happy Valley-Goose Bay with her parents, who both worked at the air force base, and her 6 siblings.Unfortunately, she was sexually assaulted by one of her brothers when she was between 11 and 14 years old.[6]When Ms. Keeping was 17, she gave birth to a son, Brandon.Brandon was raised by his maternal grandparents until he turned 13 when he went to live with Ms. Keeping in Fortune on the island portion of the Province.That is where Ms. Keeping moved to in 1984.The next year she married George Keeping and they were together for 26 years.They have two children, Christian and Lisa, born in 1986 and 1988, respectively.[7]The Pre-Sentence Report describes a life of “physical and emotional abuse, fear, control and domestic violence by Mr. Keeping”.One assault caused her to miscarry, another caused an injury to her back from which she still suffers chronic pain.He threw a pot of hot soup at her, pushed her down the stairs, hauled her by the hair and smacked her in the face.Mr. Keeping called her “Eskimo”, fat, stupid and ugly, but said that if he could not have her no one would and he would shoot her.He treated Brandon differently than he treated his own children.[8]Although Ms. Keeping worked in the family fishing enterprise for 18 years, Mr. Keeping controlled her money.Sometimes he would pay her half of it and expect her to pay the bills and buy groceries and other necessities with the rest.Other times he would make her endorse her cheques over to him.Still other times she was not paid at all.Ms. Keeping was told that 20% of the business was in her name but later found that this was not true.[9]Ms. Keeping finally left her husband in 2004, but went back with him for most of the period until February of 2010.In her evidence she stated that she finally left when she felt that the children were able to live on their own.[10]The parties entered into a Separation Agreement dated November 29, 2004. The Separation Agreement acknowledged that Mr. Keeping had the higher income; nevertheless, Ms. Keeping was not paid spousal support.There was a division of matrimonial property, however, and among the amounts due to Ms. Keeping from her husband was $600 per month for 10 years.Mr. Keeping made only one of those payments.It is important to note that although the Separation Agreement provided that any spousal or child support would cease during a period of resumed cohabitation, payments for division of property would not.Consequently, Mr. Keeping was required to pay Ms. Keeping the $600 per month until December 1, 2014, even though she resumed living with him until 2010.[11]At the time of the thefts for which she is now being sentenced, Brandon was in a hard way financially.He and his four children were living in a place with no heat.Ms. Keeping bought groceries for them, diapers for the children and other necessities.She did the same for Christian’s child and for Lisa’s child.Ms. Keeping had no income of her own that year.Mr. Keeping took her name off the employment roll and as a result she did not qualify for Employment Insurance.He said he would give her money, but did not.[12]In the first instance of theft, Ms. Keeping took her husband’s bank card and, because she knew the PIN, could make withdrawals.The card was in his name and she did not know that the account from which she took the money was a corporate account.The second instance involved cashing a cheque that was in Mr. Keeping’s name at the grocery store.[13]Ms. Keeping has a long history of psychiatric health issues.After she got involved with Mr. Keeping she suffered a “nervous breakdown” and had to be hospitalized.On at least three occasions she overdosed on pills.She is currently under the care of Dr. David Collins for “major depression” for which she is prescribed medication.She has had a Percocet addiction.She has been referred for counseling through the Nunatsiavut Government of which she is a beneficiary.[14]Ms. Keeping has a grade 9 education and, despite encouragement from the probation officer, does not think that she is smart enough for Adult Basic Education.She worked in her husband’s fishing enterprise from April to October for 18 years and then in the fish plant in the winters.Most recently, she was employed at NorthMart in Happy Valley-Goose Bay.A very positive letter from her employer was entered as an exhibit at the sentencing hearing.Unfortunately, she left that job for a higher paying opportunity fishing that did not work out.At the time of the sentencing hearing she was looking to get back on at NorthMart or with a cleaning company that pays $4.00 an hour more.[15]Ms.Keeping is living in another relationship now and has accommodations on the Goose Bay air force base.[16]Importantly, Ms. Keeping has made full restitution to Mr. Keeping and his company through the proceeds of a family law action that she commenced to recover the monies owing to her under the Separation Agreement.Victim Impact Statement[17]In his victim impact statement, Mr. Keeping says that these crimes placed him in a state of shock and caused him depression, exacerbating his existing panic attacks.He also says that the loss of the money adversely affected his fishing enterprise.Finally, he says that his sense of trust has been shattered by his wife of 25 years doing these things.Criminal Record[18]Ms. Keeping has a record consisting of two thefts, two breaches of recognizance, a failure to comply with a probation order, an assault and an assault with a weapon.Of note is the assault with a weapon which, according to her, and undisputed by the Crown, occurred when her husband threatened to smash a photograph of her late, cherished father and she chased him away with a hammer.The thefts, she says, occurred when Mr. Keeping would not give her the money she needed to maintain the household; in respect of the most recent theft, restitution was ordered for $52.92.Positions of the PartiesThe Crown[19]Crown counsel acknowledges that this was a crime of “self-help”. Ms. Keeping took from her husband some of what he should have paid her under the Separation Agreement.Yet the Crown submits that, given Ms. Keeping’s criminal record, this is not a suitable case for a conditional discharge.He points to the premeditation and pattern disclosed by the crimes.The range of sentences is from a discharge to a period of incarceration.Because of these unique facts, the Crown says that there are no cases that provide guidance (I point out, however, that there are almost always cases to be found on point and, although a case may not be readily found that is “on all fours” with the case at Bar, there are always instructive cases to be found at the appellate level that will provide guidance to the sentencing judge; the empty-handed counsel risks a decision adverse to his submissions and, worse, one that may be contrary to the law).Although Ms. Keeping poses no risk to the community at large, the Crown submits that sentencing must reflect denunciation and deterrence.Because of her record, a discharge in this case would be a step backwards.A conditional sentence for three months was recommended.The Defence[20]The Defence, however, says that a conditional discharge is precisely appropriate here because the dominant sentencing principle should not be deterrence, but rehabilitation.Ms. Keeping sought to plead guilty as soon as possible and was only prevented from doing so earlier because the family law matter had to be first resolved in order to facilitate restitution.That is, Ms. Keeping was able to repay Mr. Keeping and his company in full with money that he owed her under the Separation Agreement.[21]Ms. Keeping is settled back in Happy Valley-Goose Bay where she has family support and the prospects of employment.Her biggest fear is that a fresh criminal record for theft will thwart her attempts to secure employment.Employment is central to her new-found independence and prospects for a successful future.[22]The question implied by the Defence is, in these unique circumstances, do I let the important principles of denunciation and deterrence potentially countervail a successful rehabilitation?It is important to note that the Crown is not seeking a sentence to be served in jail.The distinction is whether Ms. Keeping will be certain to have a criminal record stemming from these crimes or whether she will acquire one only if she does not abide by her conditions of discharge.[23]The Defence cited one case, the 2010 decision of Gorman, P.C.J., in R. v. Kelly, 2010 CanLII 44697 (NL PC), 2010 CanLII 44697 (NLPC).There the offender stole from two retailers, the second being his employer.The first theft was of sundry consumer items; the second was $82.55 worth of food.Mr. Kelly had no previous record.The only impediment that Judge Gorman saw to imposing a discharge was that in the second instance, Mr. Kelly stole from his employer and it was suggested that a discharge was not appropriate where there was a breach of trust.[24]Following a thorough analysis, Judge Gorman looked at the small amount of food that was stolen and that the theft was not for financial gain but for necessities.He was satisfied that for that offender, who had no previous record, rehabilitation should be the primary sentencing goal, notwithstanding the breach of trust.A conditional discharge was granted.The Law Regarding Discharges[25]For Ms. Keeping to be discharged, she must satisfy me that two hurdles can be overcome.The first is that a significant amount of money was taken; the second is that Ms. Keeping has a prior criminal record.Let me review some of the law in this area to better explain why these are important considerations.[26]The ability to grant a discharge is provided by section 730 of the Criminal Code:730. (1) Where an accused … pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence … the court before which the accused appears may, if it considers it to be in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of convicting the accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged absolutely or on the conditions prescribed in a probation order …(3) Where a court directs under subsection (1) that an offender be discharged of an offence, the offender shall be deemed not to have been convicted of the offence …(4) Where an offender who is bound by the conditions of a probation order made at a time when the offender was directed to be discharged under this section is convicted of an offence … the court that made the probation order may … revoke the discharge, convict the offender of the offence to which the discharge relates and impose any sentence that could have been imposed if the offender had been convicted at the time of discharge … .[27]Section 730 has been interpreted and applied numerous times by the courts, including the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador, Court of Appeal.[28]I note at the outset that the entering of convictions following the guilty plea does not preclude me from substituting discharges on sentencing (R. v. Bartlett, 2005 NLCA 75 (CanLII)).[29]The case most often cited in respect of discharges is the British Columbia Court of Appeal decision in R. v. Fallofield, (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 450. After a review of the case law, the court set out 8 factors that have been consistently considered by the courts of other provinces:From this review of the authorities and my own view of the meaning of s. [730], I draw the following conclusions…:(1)The section may be used in respect of any offence other than an offence for which a minimum punishment is prescribed by law or the offence is punishable by imprisonment for 14 years or for life … .(2)The section contemplates the commission of an offence. There is nothing in the language that limits it to a technical or trivial violation.(3)Of the two conditions precedent to the exercise of the jurisdiction, the first is that the Court must consider that it is in the best interests of the accused that he should be discharged either absolutely or upon condition. If it is not in the best interests of the accused, that, of course, is the end of the matter. If it is decided that it is in the best interests of the accused, then that brings the next consideration into operation.(4)The second condition precedent is that the Court must consider that a grant of discharge is not contrary to the public interest.(5)Generally, the first condition would presuppose that the accused is a person of good character, without previous conviction, that it is not necessary to enter a conviction against him in order to deter him from future offences or to rehabilitate him, and that the entry of a conviction against him may have significant adverse repercussions.(6)In the context of the second condition the public interest in the deterrence of others, while it must be given due weight, does not preclude the judicious use of the discharge provisions.(7)The powers given by s. [730] should not be exercised as an alternative to probation or suspended sentence.(8)Section [730] should not be applied routinely to any particular offence. This may result in an apparent lack of uniformity in the application of the discharge provisions. This lack will be more apparent than real and will stem from the differences in the circumstances of cases.Good Character:Effect of Previous Convictions[30]When considering whether discharge would be in the best interests of the offender, there is generally an assumption that the offender “is a person of good character, without previous conviction…”. If having no previous conviction is a prerequisite for a discharge, then Ms. Keeping does not qualify.But is there a rigid rule in this regard?Such a rule runs counter to the purpose of section 730, which is to give the sentencing judge discretion to consider the circumstances of the offender and of the offence in making a determination, that is, to determine proportionality.Inflexible considerations should not be at play.The issue is whether the offender is a person of good character, which would normally imply that she has no previous conviction.But that is only one factor to be considered.[31]In R. v. Elsharawy, 1997 CanLII 14708 (NL CA), 1997 CanLII 14708 (NLCA), our Court of Appeal gives life to this more elastic view ofsection 730 when it describes the best interests of the offender as presupposing:…that the accused is a person of good character usually without previous conviction or discharge, that he does not require personal deterrence or rehabilitation and that a criminal conviction may have significant adverse repercussions. [Emphasis added][32]Thus, a previous conviction is not a bar to a discharge, but it will be an unusual case where a person with a previous conviction will be discharged.[33]I note, for clarity, that it is not only previous convictions that apply to the assessment of the offender’s character under section 730.Because the information is being used for that purpose only and not for seeking a more severe sentence, the timing of the other event or events is not important.It is simply evidence of the character of the offender that is admissible for the purpose of the character analysis under section 730 (Elsharawy at paragraph 4).Good Character:Need for Rehabilitation[34]One other of the elements in the passage quoted from Elsharawy bears mention as well.It states a person of good character is presumed not to require rehabilitation.I read that as rehabilitation that can be provided by way of other sentencing alternatives, such as incarceration (see R. v. Sanchez-Pino, (1973), 1973 CanLII 794 (ON CA), 11 C.C.C. (2d) 53 (ONCA) at paragraph 17).Where the offender’s chances of successful rehabilitation are in part contingent on the discharge itself, then to read it otherwise would be to run afoul of the last part of the above quotation from Elsharawy, i.e. “that a criminal conviction may have significant adverse repercussions”.One of those adverse repercussions may be interference with the rehabilitation of the offender.Not Contrary to the Public Interest[35]The Court of Appeal also provides guidance on the second component of the test, that the discharge not be contrary to the public interest.The sentencing judge must consider the principle of general deterrence, specifically with regard to the gravity of the offence, its incidence in the community, public attitudes toward it and public confidence in the effective enforcement of the criminal law (Elsharawy at paragraph 3).analysisSection 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code[36]I have considered section 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code by which I am to consider all reasonable sanctions other than imprisonment, especially for aboriginal offenders.Neither the Crown nor the Defence drew particular attention to how Ms. Keeping’s aboriginal status has led her to her present circumstances.This may have been because the Crown is not seeking imprisonment for Ms. Keeping.Nevertheless, her status as an Inuk woman forms part of her history that I have described above and is therefore part of her antecedents that I have considered in imposing sentence.I have considered it in balancing the gravity of the offences against the degree of responsibility of the offender; I have attempted to balance the principles of denunciation and deterrence with that of rehabilitation so as to promote “the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society” while at the same time ensuring justice for the offender (R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII), [2012] S.C.J. No. 13 at paragraphs 36 and 37).Here, however, Ms. Keeping’s Inuk heritage appears to play less of a role in her circumstances than does her status as a victim of domestic abuse.Unfortunately the two are related, as are her mental health issues, substance abuse and lack of self-esteem.These are not Trivial Crimes[37]Ms. Keeping, it is true, stole a significant amount of money from Mr. Keeping and his company.Discharges are not, however, confined to technical or trivial violations (Fallofield at paragraph 21).It could be argued that it was money to which she was entitled in that her husband had not made more than the first $600 monthly payment under the Separation Agreement.The court does not condone crimes for self-help, but here Ms. Keeping needed the money for her upkeep and for the upkeep of her grandchildren.In R. v. Prowse, 1998 CanLII 18024 (NL CA), 1998 CanLII 18024 (NLCA), a conditional discharge was ordered where the accused stole a Honda generator as part of an ongoing monetary dispute between the appellant and the complainant.Although what Ms. Keeping did was a crime, in these circumstances I would not let the amount of money deter me from granting a discharge.This is particularly so because full restitution has been made (R. v. Montgrand, 2008 SKCA 50 (CanLII) at paragraph 11).Is Ms. Keeping of Good Character?[38]Ms. Keeping’s criminal record is another matter.To be granted a discharge Ms. Keeping must demonstrate that she is of good character.As we saw above, this means “usually without a criminal record”.But how does one compare the character of Ms. Keeping with that of the former Irish Christian Brother in R. v. Burke, 1996 CanLII 11083 (NL CA), 1996, 108 C.C.C. (3d) 360 (NLCA)?He had no criminal record but was initially convicted of assault causing bodily harm against a student.I would have thought that the offence itself spoke to his character.Nevertheless, the passage of 20 years and a great number of letters in support of Mr. Burke led the Court of Appeal to grant a discharge.[39]In Montgrand, notwithstanding the other considerations that would incline towards leniency (guilty plea, full restitution, support from the victim, employment and the cessation of alcohol consumption), the 25 year old offender’s 51 prior criminal convictions led the court to convict him and impose a fine of $500.Mr. Montgrand had been charged with mischief and causing property damage in excess of $5000.[40]What were Ms. Keeping’s previous crimes?They were not trivial and should not be minimized.But, they occurred in the same unfortunate domestic circumstances that led to the ones for which she is being sentenced today. She stole money from her husband to buy necessities and chased him with a hammer when he threatened to destroy the photograph of her father.Ms. Keeping’s crimes appear to be confined to her abusive marriage.They may demonstrate poor judgment and impulsiveness, but I am not satisfied that they demonstrate bad character to the extent that she should be deprived of the benefits of a discharge.The Tests in s.730:Best Interests of the Offender and not contrary to the Public Interest[41]Is it in Ms. Keeping’s interest that she be granted a discharge?Yes, for the reasons stated above.She has finally begun a new life here in Happy Valley-Goose Bay.Her matrimonial legal issues are behind her.She is in a new relationship.Now she needs to resume employment in order to establish a degree of financial independence. This is key to her rehabilitation. Two new theft convictions could interfere with that.[42]Can it be said that a discharge in these circumstances is “not contrary to the public interest”?That is more problematical, because denunciation and general deterrence are important principles.As noted by the Court of Appeal in Burke, however, inherent in the fact of being charged and going through the criminal trial process culminating in a guilty plea is a component of denunciation and deterrence.Specific deterrence is not required here because Ms. Keeping is not, as the Crown conceded, a risk to the community at large.Because these offences arise out of a matrimonial property dispute, the money was taken to purchase necessities, Ms. Keeping has pleaded guilty and full restitution has been made, public confidence in the administration of criminal law can be maintained through the imposition of appropriate conditions.[43]Ms. Keeping will not have gotten off “scot-free”; she will be subject to a period of probation as a condition of her discharge.If she breaches the probation, then she can lose the benefit of the discharges and be convicted of these offences.Is that not the better way to address the public interest here?The public has an interest in the rehabilitation of Ms. Keeping; if she abides by the conditions imposed upon her that interest can be achieved.The public also has an interest in the blameworthy being sentenced in a manner that denounces their crimes and deters others from committing similar crimes; if Ms. Keeping does not abide by her terms of probation, then convictions can be entered and this principle will be honoured.sentence[44]Discharges are granted sparingly.Rarely will one be granted where a significant amount of money was stolen and the offender has a criminal record, especially for both violent and property crimes.This is one of those rare cases.The factors that make a conditional discharge appropriate here are:•the antecedents of the offender;•the money taken was less than was owed to her by the complainant under the 2004 Separation Agreement;•the stolen money was used to purchase necessities;•the offender pleaded guilty at the first opportunity;•full restitution was made;•the offender’s previous criminal record also arose out of her troubled domestic relationship; and•further convictions for theft may interfere with the offender’s employment prospects thereby depriving her of her best chance of rehabilitation.[45]Ms. Keeping, please stand.I substitute conditional discharges on both counts with supervised probation for six months on count #1 for breach of section 334(a), and six months supervised probation, concurrent on count #2, for breach of section 334(b).The conditions of probation are that you are to:1)Keep the peace and be of good behaviour;2)Report to a probation officer today and thereafter as required;3)Report any change in your name, address or occupation to your probation officer; and4)Attend and actively participate in any counseling programs as recommended by your probation officer._____________________________Robert P.

Michael Buchinskifor the offender__________________________________________________________________________SENTENCING JUDGMENTPOPESCUL C.J.Q.B.April 15, 2016__________________________________________________________________________I.INTRODUCTION[1]The offender, Justin Gryba [offender], who is 27 years of age, was arrested on November 23, 2011 and charged with several child pornography related offences. He was released from custody and ultimately plead guilty to one count of making child pornography available and one count of possessing child pornography. On January 21, 2013, after accepting a joint submission, a Provincial Court judge sentenced him to two years less one day in custody, followed by three years probation.[2]At the sentencing hearing before the Provincial Court judge the Crown referred to numerous images of child pornography found on the offender’s computer. The Crown made it clear, however, that it was unable to access two “DataLocker” external hard drives with military grade encryption features found in the offender’s possession and that whatever may be subsequently found on those hard drives formed no part of the sentencing process that took place in Provincial Court at that time. The Crown warned that continued efforts would be made to access the hard drives and that, if and when, the DataLocker hard drives were decrypted, the offender would face further charges.[3]The police eventually gained access to the offender’s DataLocker hard drives. More child pornography was found and, as warned, more child pornography related charges were laid. As a result, on September 17, 2014, the offender, who had already been released on parole, was once again arrested. He has been in custody ever since.[4]The offender plead autrefois acquit and autrefois convict with respect to the new charges. He argued that the basis for the new charges is the same as the old charges and that he ought not be tried again for the same thing. I found that the offender had failed to establish the basis for the special pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict and put him to his election. See R v Gryba, 2015 SKQB 372 (CanLII) [Gryba].[5]The offender has now entered a plea of guilty to four of the seven counts contained in the indictment. The Crown intends to stay the other three charges at the conclusion of the sentencing process.[6]Sentencing submissions have been made and it is now up to the court to pass a just and appropriate sentence.II.PRELIMINARY COMMENTS[7]Sentencing one’s fellow man is one of the most important and difficult tasks judges are called upon to perform. At the sentencing stage the Crown will have proven what it has alleged beyond a reasonable doubt or, as in this case, the offender will have admitted guilt by pleading guilty. The presumption of innocence has been displaced. The offender is, in fact and in law, guilty.[8]The issue now facing the court is this: what is the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon this offender for these crimes in this community. In crafting the appropriate sentence the court must have regard for all of the factors set out in the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, the personal circumstances of the offender and the nature of the offences committed. Guidance can be obtained from the jurisprudence; however, no two cases are exactly the same and the sentencing process is a highly individualized process. Accordingly, as the Supreme Court of Canada said in R v Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII), at para 38, [2012] 1 SCR 433, “Sentencing judges must have sufficient manoeuvrability to tailor sentences to the circumstances of the particular offence and the particular offender.”[9]Invariably, sentencing judges attract criticism regardless of the result. Some will say – however harsh the sentence – that it is not harsh enough. This is understandable. The imposition of a sentence can never perfectly right a wrong. Others will say – however lenient the sentence – that the sentence is too severe. What good does it do to send a potentially rehabilitatable offender to jail, at great cost to the state, where the end product can often be an individual more hardened and corrupted than the person that entered the institution?[10]Such is the lot of a sentencing judge. Despite these tensions, the sentencing judge must nonetheless strive to craft the best possible sentence that achieves the goals set forth by Parliament in the Criminal Code.[11]While Canadian courts do not impose sentences in response to public clamour or in a spirit of revenge, sentences are not imposed in a vacuum. The punishment inflicted for grave crimes should reflect society’s revulsion such that sentences, by and large, should have the support of reasonably informed, concerned and right thinking citizens. See R v Oliver, [1977] 5 WWR 344 (BCCA). While some perceive the imposition of a sentence by a judge as a wielding of power, those exercising that function perceive it more as an exercise of immense responsibility.III.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCES[12]An online investigation of a file sharing network named “GigaTribe” led to the execution of a search warrant at the offender’s residence on November 23, 2011. The police seized a tower computer, a laptop computer and two DataLocker hard drives.[13]The police examined the two computers and found approximately 3,000 child pornography files. The files were predominantly still images, but also included videos. As a result of this discovery, the offender was charged with several child pornography related offences. The specific details were fully set out in my decision respecting autrefois acquit/convict. See Gryba at paras 4-9.[14]On January 21, 2013 the offender plead guilty to Counts 2 and 3 after which the Crown stayed Counts 1 and 4. Counts 2 and 3 as set forth in the informationare as follows:(2)between the 31st day of August, A.D. 2011 and the 8th day of September, A.D. 2011 at or near SASKATOON, SASKATCHEWAN didCommit the offence of making images of children under 18 years of age engaged in explicit sexual activity and/or the focus of the image was the genital or anal region of a child under 18 years of age available to other internet users, contrary to Section 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code.(3)on or about the 23rd day of November, A.D. 2011 at or near SASKATOON, SASKATCHEWAN didHave in his possession child pornography to wit: Images and videos of children under 18 years of age engaged in explicit sexual activity and/or the focus of the image was the genital or anal region of the child under 18 years of age, contrary to Section 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code.[15]The Provincial Court sentencing judge accepted a joint submission of two years less one day, followed by three years probation. There were also a number of ancillary orders made.[16]The offender went to jail that day. On May 21, 2014 he was paroled.[17]After extensive efforts the police were finally able to decipher the code and enter the offender’s DataLocker hard drives. More child pornography was found. The accused was arrested on September 17, 2014 and charged with seven child pornography related offences. He has entered guilty pleas to four of the seven counts. A summary of the circumstances relating to each of those individual counts is as follows.(a)Count 1[18]Count 1 reads:(1)On or about the 23rd day of November, A.D. 2011 at or near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, did:Have in his possession child pornography to wit: images of children under 18 years of age engaged in explicit sexual activity and/or the focus of the image was the genital or anal region of the child under 18 years of age, contrary to section 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code.[19]Using further advanced technology, the police re-searched the offender’s red Dell laptop computer that had been seized during the initial investigation on November 23, 2011, and found 16 video or picture images that constituted child pornography. The police also found a video of a young boy urinating in a toilet at the offender’s residence. This boy was subsequently identified. The Crown submits that the offender created the recording, although they have chosen not to lay a charge of making child pornography relating to this event; rather the Crown is content to have this circumstance considered as part of the child pornography material possessed by the offender and covered by Count 1. Additionally, the Crown submits that the images created by the offender, which are the subject of Count 2 and Count 3 were also possessed by him. This is the essence of Count 1.(b)Count 2[20]Count 2 reads:(2)Between the 10th day of November, A.D. 2009 and the 21st day of September, A.D. 2010, at or near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, did:Make child pornography to wit: making images of a known person under 18 years of age engaged in explicit sexual activity and/or the focus of the image was the genital or anal region of that person, contrary to section 163.1(2) of the Criminal Code.[21]The offender volunteered with the Big Brothers Big Sisters [BBBS] organization. In this capacity he was entrusted with the care of two boys, D.H. and J.H., who were brothers. The offender took them to a swimming pool. While in the dressing room, the offender surreptitiously recorded them changing in and out of their bathing suits on several occasions. The boys were together and the videos were made of them at the same times and same places. Those files were located on a folder named “SPI” that was on the encrypted DataLocker hard drives. These videos were made and possessed by the offender, but were never shared with anyone.(c)Count 3[22]Count 3 reads:(3)Between the 10th day of May, A.D. 2011 and the 6th day of December, A.D. 2011, at or near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, did:Make child pornography to wit: making images of a known person under 18 years of age engaged in explicit sexual activity and/or the focus of the image was the genital or anal region of that person, contrary to section 163.1(2) of the Criminal Code.[23]This count is essentially the same as Count 2, except the victim is a different young boy named S.D. These videos were made at a different time than those made in Count 2. As in the case of the boys who are the subject of Count 2, the offender had volunteered with the BBBS organization. While with S.D., who had been entrusted to his care, the offender surreptitiously video recorded him changing in and out of his bathing suit in a pool dressing room. These videos, also, were not disseminated or shared with anyone else.(d)Count 6[24]Count 6 reads:(6)Between the 8th day of March, A.D. 2010 and the 20th day of November, A.D. 2011, at or near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, did:Have in his possession child pornography to wit: images or videos of children under eighteen years of age engaged in explicit sexual activity and/or the focus of the images or videos was the genital or anal region of the child, contrary to section 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code.[25]Once the police cracked the code and entered the offender’s DataLocker hard drives they found what can be described as a treasure trove of child pornographic videos and images.[26]According to the police, whose evidence is not disputed, there were 12,775 “unique” child pornographic images or videos. The Crown is prepared to concede that some of the images on the DataLocker hard drives could have been the same as the approximately 3,000 videos or images that were the subject of the first sentencing. Giving the offender the benefit of that doubt, it still means that there were approximately 9,775 new videos and/or images for which he has not been sentenced.IV.SUMMARY OF AGGRAVATING AND MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES[27]Section 718.2 directs the court to consider the aggravating and mitigating circumstances when determining the appropriate sentence for an offender. What follows is not an exhaustive list, but rather a brief mention, of the most significant aggravating and mitigating factors at play in this case.(a) Aggravating factors[28]The most prevalent aggravating circumstances that are present include:(i)The sheer quantity and the vile nature of the materialA.Counts 1 and 6[29]The Crown played for the court a sample of the images and videos that comprise Counts 1 and 6. Words cannot begin to express the vile and depraved nature of these sickening and disgusting recordings. The images and recordings depicted, among other things, very young children – some just toddlers – engaged in oral, vaginal and anal sex with adults. I echo the words of Dovell J. in R v Pattison, 2012 SKQB 330 (CanLII), at para 72, 403 Sask R 145 [Pattison], who after being shown a sampling of the child pornography in that case, said:… [the images and videos] are vile in nature to the point of being “life changing” in their effect upon one’s psyche. At points when being shown these images, the Court was numbed by their depravity. … .[30]The offender is being sentenced for possessing approximately 9,775 child pornographic files, including still photos and videos. This represents 9,775 child victims. The material was repugnant, disturbing and reprehensible.B.Counts 2 and 3[31]The offender made 11 videos of young boys changing in the dressing room. A sample of these videos was played for the court. The focus of the recordings is obviously on the boys’ genitals. The offender is not depicted doing anything with the boys – other than secretly recording them as they changed. As mentioned, these videos were not posted on the internet or shared with anyone.(ii)The victims were children[32]The fact that the victims were children is specifically designated by the Criminal Code as an aggravating circumstance by ss. 718.01 and ss. 718.2(a)(ii.1),(iii)The offender was in a position of trust with respect to the victims in Counts 2 and 3[33]The fact that the offender occupied a position of trust is specifically designated by the Criminal Code as an aggravating circumstance by virtue of s. 718.2(a)(iiii).(iv)Harm to the victims[34]There is real harm to the thousands of unnamed unknown child victims whose images/videos were used for sexual gratification by people, like the offender, who view this material. Further, as set forth by the victim impact statements of the mothers of the boys, whose dignity was violated by the surreptitious video recording, the psychological hurt is deep and real. The court has listened to these victims and has taken their comments into account in arriving at the offender’s sentence.(v)Alleged failure to assist in the investigation: Not an aggravating circumstance[35]The Crown argued forcefully at the sentencing hearing that the court should consider, as aggravating, the fact that the offender did not come totally clean and assist the police in their DataLocker investigation. The suggestion being that this showed a lack of remorse. However, the failure to assist in the investigation, at best, would be the neutralization of what could have been a mitigating factor. It is not an aggravating factor. As stated by the Court of Appeal in R v Leroux, 2015 SKCA 48 (CanLII), at para 62, 460 Sask R 1 [Leroux]:… an accused individual is always entitled to rely on the right to remain silent, the presumption of innocence and the right to make full answer and defence, etc. In other words, accused individuals are entitled to maintain their innocence, plead not guilty and conduct a full trial on the charges without repercussion at sentencing for doing so.[36]The “cost” however, is the inability to advance the act of co‑operation as a mitigating factor. Further, laying in the weeds can have negative repercussions in that as old offences emerge, an offender is required to face multiple sentencing situations, as is the case here.(b)Mitigating factors[37]The most prevalent mitigating circumstances that are present include:(i)No previous criminal record[38]But for the conviction for the related convictions, the offender has no previous criminal record.(ii)Guilty plea[39]The offender plead guilty to the charges under consideration, thus accepting responsibility for his actions.(iii)The offender’s age[40]At only 27 years of age, the offender is a young man. At the time of his arrest he was only 23 years old. Generally speaking, the young age of an offender is considered a mitigating factor because it presents the greatest opportunity for reform.(iv)The offender’s rehabilitation[41]The offender has taken significant steps to rehabilitate himself and, by all accounts, his rehabilitation is progressing very well.(v)Remorse[42]The offender, in my view, is genuinely remorseful. He has filed with the court apology letters to the boys he video recorded. He has addressed this court in a positive and respectful way and has demonstrated through both words and actions that he is truly sorry for what he did.(vi)Low risk to re-offend[43]As a result of the offender’s treatment and genuine self-introspection, he has been assessed at a low risk to re-offend.(vii)Positive conduct since initial arrest[44]Since the offender’s arrest almost 4-1/2 years ago, he has made positive strides toward reformation and there is no evidence that he has re-offended. He has done everything asked of him.V.POSITION OF THE CROWN AND THE DEFENCE(a)The Crown’s Position[45]The Crown requests that the court impose a global sentence of five years incarceration which, after appropriate credit for time spent on remand, would result in an additional sentence of 31 months in jail.[46]The Crown seeks 18 months on Count 2 (making of child pornography), the minimum sentence for which is 12 months incarceration. The Crown justifies its request for a sentence in excess of the mandatory minimum on the basis that the offender was in a position of trust at the time that the offence was committed.[47]The Crown seeks an additional 18 month sentence on Count 3 (making of child pornography of the other child victim), to be served consecutively. Given that the creation of these video recordings involves a different victim on different occasions a similar, consecutive sentence of 18 months should be imposed.[48]The Crown seeks a two year consecutive sentence for Count 6. The Crown submits that, generally speaking, a four to five year sentence would be appropriate given the magnitude of the collection. Although the child pornography files, the subject of Count 6, are distinct from those files for which the offender has already been sentenced, the Crown acknowledges that the previous circumstances need to be factored in. The Crown justifies the lower two year request on the basis that this somewhat lower sentence would factor in the previous convictions.[49]The Crown seeks a 12 month concurrent sentence for Count 1. The Crown acknowledges that given the overlapping, albeit distinct, nature of the offences committed during the same time frame as the current offences and given the offences for which the offender has already been sentenced, a concurrent sentence is justified.[50]The Crown, fairly, concedes that the offender should be credited with a 1.5 credit for time spent in pre-trial custody. See R v Summers, 2014 SCC 26 (CanLII), [2014] 1 SCR 575; R v Carvery, 2014 SCC 27 (CanLII), [2014] 1 SCR 605; and R v Calliou, 2014 ABCA 158 (CanLII), 575 AR 86. The offender was arrested on September 17, 2014, which means that up to, and including today, he has spent 577 days on remand. Crediting the offender 1.5 days for every day in pre-trial detention results in a credit of 865.5 days, or, 29 months (865.530 = 28.85 29 months). This would result in a further 31 more months in custody.[51]In addition, the Crown seeks a DNA order (s. 487.051), an order under the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, SC 2004, c 10 [SOIRA] (s. 490.013(2.1)), a lifetime prohibition order restricting the offender’s presence in parks, pools, etc. (s. 161), and a forfeiture order respecting the seized items (s. 490.1).(b)The Defence’s Position[52]The defence argues that the offender should be sentenced to time served, and released today. The defence points out that there have been no new criminal acts committed by the offender since his initial arrest on November 23, 2011. All of the charges, so argues the defence, arose out of the same set of circumstances. An additional 24 months in custody would be appropriate to punish the offender for the additional images recovered by the police. Accordingly an additional 24 months should be imposed for Count 6.[53]The defence concedes that the minimum mandatory sentence of one year should be imposed for Counts 2 and 3, but argues that the sentences should be made concurrent to each other and Count 6. The defence agrees with the Crown’s position of 12 months concurrent on Count 1. The total aggregate sentence would be 24 months. When credit is then given for the 29 months spent in pre-trial custody, the result is that the accused should be released today.[54]The defence does not take issue with the Crown’s request for the imposition of the ancillary orders – other than the Crown’s request for a lifetime order pursuant to s. 161. Defence counsel submits that to prohibit the offender from ever going to a park or playground or pool for the rest of his life – even with his own children, should he have them – is unduly harsh. The defence contends that there is no need to impose a lifetime s. 161 order on a person in his 20s for what is, in essence, his first offence.VI.PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER[55]The offender is 27 years of age, soon to be 28 on April 28. He was just 23 years old when he was arrested. He is not married. He has no children. By all accounts, he comes from a caring, loving family. He has the support of his father, his two younger brothers, and the rest of his family. Tragically, his mother passed away suddenly in January 2012, shortly after his initial arrest. He graduated from high school with a 95 percent average. Prior to his initial arrest he had been attending university and maintained a 90 percent plus average. He was aspiring to be a medical doctor – a goal that was potentially within his reach.[56]He has sought treatment and has been under the care of a clinical psychologist, Dr. Brian Chartier, since December 2011. He has been seen by the psychologist 44 times since then. The defence filed with the court a report from the psychologist that is very positive. The psychologist notes the presence of actual remorse. Dr. Chartier states in his report:… In working with him, I now see the presence of remorse not for being caught but for the effect of his behaviour on others. …He has taken sex offender treatment. A report was filed. It suggests that the offender was an active, eager and engaged participant.[57]The offender completed the “Thinking For A Change Program”. It is a voluntary program that was comprised of 22 lessons. Each lesson was 2.5 hours. He was rated “Low” on the Primary Risk Assessment. The program facilitator had this to say about the offender:Summary and Recommendations:Justin took the program very seriously. He participated at an exceptionally high level through out the course. He quickly understood the concepts and was able to put the information into his own words. He often was able to bring the information to a much higher level and see implications of the course content to other areas of life. He was very mature and considered the needs of others in the group as well.He showed excellent improvement between the pre-test and the post-test scores. This is consistent with the information written in his homework assignments and the answers given in classroom discussions.He had an exceptionally detailed relapse prevention plan. He showed great understanding of his risky thoughts and feelings. He could readily see what was causing the problem. He also could see what he needed to do to cope with the issues and avoid them in the first place.Overall, he successfully completed the Thinking for a Change program.[58]This prompted that facilitator to write in one of his reports:… He has one of the most defined and comprehensive relapse prevention plans seen. This doesn’t guarantee [that there will be no] relapse but understanding and planning for it definitively reduces the likelyhood [sic] of it occuring [sic] again.[59]While taking a treatment program the offender, in the context of responding to a question of likelihood to reoffend, wrote these insightful words:I am 99% certain that this will never happen again, leaving that remaining 1% chance as my strongest motivation to continue taking every possible step to ensure that it really won’t ever happen again. The largest promising factor in my vow to never reoffend is also unfortunately the factor that I am most ashamed of: that my actions were and are completely under my control. It is still devistating [sic] for me to admit that nothing made me seek out that material that I somehow allowed myself to ignore my moral code in a selfish and blind quest for wholeness. Yet it is that very point that has been empowering in showing me that with a critical set of cognitive skills, I am able to consciously and proactively avoid that same criminal activity. The skills I examined and developed through T4C such as understanding my own feelings, the process of cognitive self-change and understanding the feelings of others – place upon me not only the ability but the responsibility of actively countering any opportunity to commit a future offence. By working through the thoughts, feelings, situations and warning signs associated with an increased chance of reoffending and creating action plans to constructively deal with them … I feel I am as confident as possible without becoming complacent to [sic] vigilance.In addition to T4C, a number of programs have assisted in developing skills to deal with potential risky thoughts, feelings and situations as well as exploring a deeper awareness into the causes, effects, repercussions and thought processes related to my offence. These programs include: the continual help of my psychologist over the last year, the Courage 2 Change program, the Grief and Loss program, the Key to Your Expected End program, the Return to Spirit program and the Goal Setting program.Along with how these programs have empowered me, they have also revealed and emphasized the vast support network that surrounds me and how I am connected to them. They are there so I do not need to deal with my issues alone. They have also shown me how intricately tied their lives are to mine and how my actions have far reaching effects on others, stressing how devistating [sic] and unreconcilable any reoffence would be not just to myself but to all those around me. I have been given a second chance to be a productive member of society, to seek and recieve [sic] forgiveness for my inexcusable actions, and to live my life that demonstrates to myself and to others that I have the power to change. They are all there for me, supporting me, helping me to ensure that this first offence is my last offence.I liken my experience through this all to that of the process of refinement: through struggles and difficulties I have not only identified my risks, weaknesses, and errors, but I have also emmerged [sic] with a clear understanding of who I am and the direction I must take. I have emmerged [sic] stronger. I have emmerged [sic] with a future, and so I towards that remaining 1% chance I have of reoffending as the guide in directing my thoughts, feelings and actions in a way that consciously and actively, personally and communally brings me to live a life consistent with my values. A life I am proud of.[60]The offender did a terrible thing. But there is hope for him.VII.ANALYSIS(a)Counts 2 and 3: Making child pornography[61]I agree with the Crown’s submissions respecting Counts 2 and 3 – the two counts of making child pornography. The seriousness with which Parliament views this offence is demonstrated by the maximum and minimum penalties set forth in the Criminal Code. At the time the offence was committed the offence could be prosecuted by either indictable or summary procedure. For an indictable offence the maximum term of imprisonment was 10 years; the mandatory minimum was one year. Today, the offence is no longer punishable by summary conviction procedure. The minimum punishment remains at one year, however the maximum has been increased to 14 years.[62]The offender, by law, must be sentenced in accordance with the provisions that existed at the time the offence was committed – which was, a mandatory minimum of one year up to a maximum of 10 years imprisonment.[63]The circumstances of the offence itself, albeit despicable and creepy, are on the lower end of the scale. “Making child pornography” covers a wide range of territory, from recording reprehensible non-consensual sexual acts to pure voyeurism. This was a surreptitious recording of young boys changing, which is wrongful and unlawful, but amounts to a form of voyeurism. Although towards the lower end of the scale, it is, nonetheless, definitely a form of abuse.[64]What makes it more serious is the fact that the recordings happened on several occasions, the victims were children and the offender was in a position of trust. It is probably enough to state that applying common sense compels a conclusion that these factors are aggravating and require the level of punishment to be moved off of the mandatory minimum. This common sense conclusion is bolstered by a number of sentencing principles that the court must consider and balance, as directed by s. 718 of the Criminal Code. Of particular relevance are:718.01 When a court imposes a sentence for an offence that involved the abuse of a person under the age of eighteen years, it shall give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence of such conduct.718.2…(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,…(ii.1) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a person under the age of eighteen years;(iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim.…shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances.[65]Although the act itself is not as serious as some offences of this nature, the existence of the above referred to aggravating factors requires a sentence more profound than the mandatory one year minimum.[66]The Crown’s suggestion of 18 months for each count strikes the right balance and amounts to a fit and proper sentence in the circumstances.[67]Generally speaking, and subject to the principle of totality, offences that occur on separate occasions against separate victims will attract a consecutive sentence. See Leroux, at para 94. To make the sentences concurrent in this case would, in effect, mean that no sentence at all was imposed for one of the offences. Therefore Counts 2 and 3 should attract a sentence of 18 months on each count, to be served consecutively.(b)Count 6[68]The offender must now also be sentenced for the possession of approximately 9,775 child pornographic images and videos. This, as I pointed out earlier, is in addition to the approximately 3,000 other images and videos for which he has already been sentenced.[69]The possession of 9,775 “unique” image or video files represents the victimization of 9,775 children. Granted, in the context of this count, the offender did nothing other than view the material. The uninformed may say, “What is the harm of simply viewing some pictures or some videos?” As the offender now recognizes the very existence of child pornography is inherently harmful to children and society. The Supreme Court of Canada in R v Sharpe, 2001 SCC 2 (CanLII), at paras 28 and 158, [2001] 1 SCR 45, put it this way:28 … no one denies that child pornography involves the exploitation of children. The links between possession of child pornography and harm to children are arguably more attenuated than are the links between the manufacture and distribution of child pornography and harm to children. However, possession of child pornography contributes to the market for child pornography, a market which in turn drives production involving the exploitation of children. Possession of child pornography may facilitate the seduction and grooming of victims and may break down inhibitions or incite potential offences.…158The very existence of child pornography, as it is defined by s. 163.1(1) of the Criminal Code, is inherently harmful to children and to society. This harm exists independently of dissemination or any risk of dissemination and flows directly from the existence of the pornographic representations, which on their own violate the dignity and equality rights of children. The harm of child pornography is inherent because degrading, dehumanizing, and objectifying depictions of children, by their very existence, undermine the Charter rights of children and other members of society. Child pornography eroticises the inferior social, economic, and sexual status of children. It preys on preexisting inequalities.[70]Today, possession of child pornography, if prosecuted by indictment, attracts a minimum term of imprisonment of one year. The maximum term of imprisonment is 10 years. At the time of the commission of the offence, convictions for indictable offences required a minimum of 45 days in jail; the maximum was five years in jail. As stated earlier, the law is clear that the offender must be sentenced according to the law that existed at the time the offences were committed. However, the increase in the minimum and maximum penalties signals the seriousness with which Parliament views this type of offence.[71]The act of amassing this quantity of child pornography requires a stiff sentence to send the message that the commission of this type of offence will result in a lengthy period of incarceration. Although, as has already been said, there is no specific prison term that is automatically associated with a particular quantity of child pornography; penitentiary terms are now the norm. Counsel for both the Crown and defence filed case authorities with this court. All of those decisions were reviewed, and in some respects studied. I do not intend to list them here. They are on the court file. Decisions such as Pattison and R v Stupnikoff, 2013 SKPC 57 (CanLII), 416 Sask R 307, and the decisions referred to therein, were instructive. Although the precise term of incarceration tends to vary there appears to be a general upward trend. I am also mindful of s. 718.2(b) that directs that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.[72]Complicating the sentencing of this offender for this charge is the fact that he has already been sentenced for possessing similar (albeit far less in quantity) images/videos on other devices that were seized on November 23, 2011. How does that circumstance factor into this sentencing? Strictly speaking, in theory, the Crown could lay a separate charge for each piece of child pornography allegedly possessed by an offender. Typically the Crown does not do that. However, the fact that the Crown generally does not do so, does not mean that the offender should get some type of “bulk discount”. See R v Andrukonis, 2012 ABCA 148 (CanLII), 524 AR 306. However, notwithstanding this general concept, the previous circumstances must be factored in. But how?[73]In Leroux, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal addressed a situation that raised similar considerations. In 1998 Mr. Leroux was convicted of sexually assaulting 14 boys between 1968 and 1979. He was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.[74]After serving that sentence, several other complainants stepped forward alleging similar sexual abuse during a similar period of time. At para. 60 Caldwell J.A. speaking for the court determined that the simple fact of the existence of the previous sentence is not mitigating per se but is “… something that must be worked into the mix of considerations”. In that case, however, he noted that, “… given what is already in the mix in this case, it has no appreciable effect on sentence here”.[75]A similar conclusion was arrived at by the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R v James, 2013 MBCA 14 (CanLII), 288 Man R (2d) 269 [James]. In 1997 the offender was convicted of sexually abusing two boys while he was their hockey coach. He received a sentence of 3-1/2 years in prison. Then, 14 years later, in 2011, two other boys, who had also been coached by the offender came forward and alleged sexual abuse in a similar fashion in roughly the same time frame. The Manitoba Court of Appeal found that it was an error for the sentencing judge to have approached the second sentencing by hypothesizing what the total sentence would have been in 1997 had the two new allegations been included in the sentencing at that time. The appeal court found that the starting point was not what would have happened in 1997, but rather the focus should have been on the offences before the court at that time. At para. 57 the court said:57 What happened in 1997 was clearly relevant information for consideration by the judge in determining what an appropriate sentence would be in respect of the offences against [the two new complainants], but it was an error to give that factor the pre-eminent focus which she did.[76]I extract from these two decisions the principle that the focus must be on the present offences and that the previous disposition ought to be considered, albeit, not unduly so.[77]Applying this concept and taking into account all the factors that I am required to consider as outlined in s. 718 of the Criminal Code leads me to the conclusion that the Crown’s position of two years, consecutive is appropriate. This factors in the circumstance that the offender has been subject to some legal process since the day of his original arrest on November 23, 2011, a period of four years, four months, 24 days. A good portion of that time has been in custody serving his sentence and on remand awaiting disposition of these charges.[78]He has not reoffended, has successfully completed programs aimed at his rehabilitation and has expressed what I believe to be genuine remorse.[79]Accordingly, I believe that the appropriate sentence, before applying the principle of totality, for this offence is two years, consecutive.(c)Count 1[80]Both the Crown and defence agree that 12 months concurrent is the appropriate disposition for Count 1. Many of the elements of this count are also present in the other counts. For instance, this count includes possession of the videos that the offender is already being sentenced for under Counts 2 and 3 – making child pornography. Although the additional 16 video/images are different than those included in Count 6 and were stored in a different place, there is a sufficient nexus between Count 1 and Count 6 to justify a concurrent sentence.[81]Accordingly, I believe that the appropriate sentence for Count 1 is 12 months incarceration, concurrent.VIII.APPLICATION OF THE TOTALITY PRINCIPLE[82]The principle of totality may be applied where consecutive sentences are imposed. In James, the Manitoba Court of Appeal, at para. 61, said:61 … the principle of totality is considered where consecutive sentences are imposed and where, before the sentence is finally determined, a “last look” is taken to determine that the cumulative or aggregate sentence which would otherwise be imposed does not exceed the overall culpability of the offender.[83]The principle of totality is conceptually related to the “Fundamental principle” of sentencing set forth in s. 718.1 of the Criminal Code, and at least one of the “Other sentencing principles” listed in s. 718.2(c). These sections read as follows:Fundamental principle718.1A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.Other sentencing principles718.2 …(c) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh.[84]When discussing this concept the Manitoba Court of Appeal offered the following helpful comments, at paras. 62 and 63:62In R. v. M. (C.A.), Lamer C.J.C. wrote with approval of the comments of D. A. Thomas in Principles of Sentencing, 2d ed. (London: Heinemann Educational Books Ltd., 1979) at 56, and of the comments of Clayton C. Ruby in Sentencing, 4th ed. (Markham: Butterworths Canada Ltd., 1994) at 44-45. Lamer C.J.C. wrote (at para. 42):In the context of consecutive sentences, this general principle of proportionality expresses itself through the more particular form of the “totality principle”. The totality principle, in short, requires a sentencing judge who orders an offender to serve consecutive sentences for multiple offences to ensure that the cumulative sentence rendered does not exceed the overall culpability of the offender. As D. A. Thomas describes the principle in Principles of Sentencing (2nd ed. 1979), at p. 56:The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate sentence is “just and appropriate”.Clayton Ruby articulates the principle in the following terms in his treatise, Sentencing, supra, at pp. 44-45:The purpose is to ensure that a series of sentences, each properly imposed in relation to the offence to which it relates, is in aggregate “just and appropriate”. A cumulative sentence may offend the totality principle if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of a sentence for the most serious of the individual offences involved, or if its effect is to impose on the offender “a crushing sentence” not in keeping with his record and prospects.63The application of the totality principle necessitates a consideration by a sentencing judge of the gravity of the offences, the offender’s degree of guilt or moral blameworthiness with respect to the crimes committed, and the harm done to the victim or victims.[85]Consideration respecting pre-sentence credit ought only be applied after addressing totality. See R v Constant, 2013 MBCA 97 (CanLII), 299 Man R (2d) 196. Accordingly, it is necessary to first apply the totality principle, and then make the pre-sentence credit adjustment.[86]Taking a “last look” in the context of the application of the totality principle requires an examination of a number of factors including the gravity of the offences, the offender’s degree of guilt, the harm done to the victims, and the offender’s personal circumstances. Here, the gravity and degree of guilt is high and the harm to the victims is significant. On the other hand, the offender, who has had the weight of his wrongful conduct on his shoulders for almost 4-1/2 years, has worked hard towards rehabilitation. He has no previous criminal record other than for the earlier related convictions and has a bright future. To impose a further five year sentence would amount to an overly harsh and crushing sentence not in keeping with his prospects and the principle of proportionality.[87]In my view the application of the totality principle should operate to reduce the aggregate sentence of 60 months (five years) to 53 months, less one day. Then, applying the remand credit adjustment, the 53 months, less one day, is reduced further by 29 months to 24 months, less one day. A “totality” principle reduction from the aggregate sentence of seven months, one day, results in a go-forward sentence of two years, less one day. This term of incarceration is fair and takes into account two other important considerations.[88]Firstly, a sentence of two years less one day means that the offender will serve the rest of his sentence in a provincial jail rather than a federal penitentiary. Keeping the offender out of the federal penitentiary system will benefit both the offender and society in general by reducing the odds that his continued rehabilitation will be hampered in the harsh federal setting. Secondly, reducing the aggregate sentence in this way permits the court to impose probation, additional to the incarceration – a sanction not available for sentences of incarceration over two years by operation of s. 731(1)(b). A probation order of three years would be, in my view, most appropriate. It permits a further level of control to best ensure that the possibility of recidivism is reduced. Especially considering the offender’s age and positive prospects, reducing the aggregate sentence by a further seven months, one day, and replacing it with three years probation results in a sentence that must closely balance all the considerations and principles that I am required to take into account in crafting the best possible sentence in all of the circumstances.[89]Even with this adjustment, the net effect is that the offender will have spent the vast majority of his 20s in jail.IX.SENTENCE[90]I find that the appropriate sentence for this offender to be:Count 2:18 monthsCount 3:18 months, consecutiveCount 6:17 months, less one day, consecutiveCount 1:12 months, concurrent.[91]The aggregate period of incarceration, is therefore, 53 months, less one day, incarceration.[92]This total is reduced by 29 months, which represents the time the offender spent in pre-sentence custody on these charges. This results in an actual sentence, on a go-forward basis, from today, of two years less one day. Of course, and just to be clear, this is over and above the two years less one day sentence he has already served for related offences.[93]In addition, the offender will be placed on probation for three years. The terms of the probation order shall be the same as those ordered by the Honourable Judge Agnew on January 21, 2013, attached as Appendix “A” herein. I know counsel spent some time in drafting these provisions. I have reviewed them and find them to be appropriate here.X.ANCILLARY ORDERS[94]I make the following ancillary orders:(a)The offences under consideration are primary designated offences within the meaning of the Criminal Code. Therefore there shall be a DNA order pursuant to s. 487.051(1) of the Criminal Code in Form 5.03, authorizing the taking of samples from the offender for the purpose of DNA analysis.(b)The offences under consideration are designated offences within the meaning of s. 490 of the Criminal Code. Therefore, there will also be an order in Form 52, requiring the offender to comply with the SOIRA, pursuant to s. 490.013. Since the offender has plead guilty to more than one designated offence the order herein made applies for life.(c)The Crown also seeks a lifetime prohibition order pursuant to s. 161 of the Criminal Code. That section requires that when sentencing offenders for these types of offences that the court consider whether the offender should be prohibited from certain activities, such as attending a public swimming area where young people are reasonably expected to be. This discretionary prohibition may be for life, or a lesser period if the court considers it desirable. A lifetime prohibition order, as requested by the Crown is too harsh and is a disproportionate response to the circumstances here. A five year prohibition order strikes the correct balance. Accordingly, using the provisions of s. 161 in effect at the time the offences were committed, I hereby prohibit the offender from:i)attending a public park or public swimming area where persons under the age of 16 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, or a daycare centre, school ground, playground or community centre, unless while in the presence of a sober responsible adult who is aware of his conviction;ii)seeking, obtaining or continuing any employment, whether or not the employment is remunerated, or becoming or being a volunteer in a capacity, that involves being in a position of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 16 years; oriii)using a computer system within the meaning of ss. 342.1(2) for the purpose of communicating with a person under the age of 16 years;for a period of five years from his release from imprisonment.(d)There shall also be a forfeiture order pursuant to s. 490.1 of the Criminal Code, in the form of the draft order filed and attached as Appendix “B” herein, by the Crown forfeiting the following items to the Crown:1.PE9 Dell Laptop XPS L5C2X with hard drive, serial number H86HSQ1, with hard drive serial number WXB1A6147554;2.PE16 DataLocker Enterprise Encrypted hard drive, serial number DL0207K09002925; and3.PE18 DataLocker external drive serial number 3000850.(e)These offences occurred prior to October 24, 2013, the day on which the ability of a judge to waive imposition of victim’s surcharges was restricted. In view of the fact that the offender will continue to be incarcerated, the victim surcharge otherwise payable pursuant to s. 737(5) is waived.(f)Finally, there will be an order releasing all exhibits filed by the Crown in this proceeding to the Saskatoon Police Service for their proper disposal, upon expiry of all appeal periods. In the meantime all documents already ordered sealed by the court, shall remain sealed.[95]Does the Crown wish to stay the remaining charges?C.J.Q.B.M.D. POPESCUL"}

Nordheimer of the Superior Court of Justice dated January 10, 2002.E N D O R S E M E N T[1]The appellant was convicted of dangerous driving causing death and dangerous driving causing bodily harm.The charges arose out of a car accident which occurred on a city street in Toronto.The appellant was driving at an excessive speed on a wet road and lost control of his vehicle.The appellant appeals his conviction and the sentence of two years less a day imposed by the trial judge.[2]The appellant advances two grounds of appeal on the conviction appeal.He contends that the trial judge erred in holding that the appellant’s right under s. 11(b) of the Charter had not been infringed.The appellant also argues that the trial erred in his interpretation of s. 577 of the Criminal Code and should have found that the Attorney General had no power to consent to the preferring of the indictment.The appellant had been committed for trial but, that committal had been quashed by a judge of the Superior Court.The Attorney General then preferred an indictment under s. 577(a).[3]The trial judge addressed the two arguments advanced on appeal in careful and detailed reasons.We agree with those reasons and do not propose to add anything to his analysis of the s. 11(b) claim.For the reasons set out by the trial judge we reject that claim.[4]With respect to the interpretation of s. 577(a) of the Criminal Code as it read at the time of the trial, like the trial judge, we agree with the interpretation of that section found in R. v. Charlie (1998), 1998 CanLII 4145 (BC CA), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 513 (B.C. C.A.) and R. v. Ewen (2000), 2000 SKCA 36 (CanLII), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 277 (Sask. C.A.).In those cases, the courts held that where a committal for trial was quashed, it could not be said that a preliminary inquiry had been held for the purpose of s. 577(a) of the Criminal Code.The Attorney General or his Deputy were, therefore, authorized to consent to the preferment of the indictment.[5]Section 577 of the Criminal Code limits the power of the prosecutor to prefer an indictment set out in s. 574.We read s. 577 as providing that where there has been no judicial determination that there is a prima facie case against an accused, an indictment can be preferred against the accused only where the Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General personally consents to the preferment of the indictment.This limitation is intended to give the accused added protection from unwarranted prosecution absent a judicial determination that a trial is justified.The interpretation of s. 577 in R. v. Charlie, supra, is consistent with the purpose of s. 577.We agree with the trial judge that the Attorney General had the authority to prefer this indictment under s. 577(a).[6]As to sentence, the trial judge erred the principle in holding that a conditional sentence would not be appropriate because he could not be assured that there was a sufficient structure that would ensure obedience to the conditions.In fairness, the trial judge did not have the benefit of this court’s decision in R. v. Nault (2002), 2002 CanLII 44945 (ON CA), 59 O.R. (3d) 388.We are not convinced that this error did not infect the trial judge’s findings respecting the need for deterrence and denunciation.It therefore falls to this court to determine the appropriate sentence.[7]We are not persuaded that this is the proper case for a conditional sentence given the serious conduct that led to the offence.In our view, given the appellant’s good character, minimal driving record, the fact that alcohol played no role in the accident and the relatively brief nature of the bad driving, an appropriate sentence would be fifteen months imprisonment.[8]Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed and the sentence is reduced to fifteen months imprisonment.The driving prohibition as imposed by the trial judge will stand.Given the time the appellant has been on bail pending appeal, we see no need for probation and that part of the sentence will be set aside.“Doherty J.A.”“John Laskin J.A.”“M.

He received a suspended sentence. He appealed his conviction and sentence to the Summary Conviction Appeal Court. Both appeals were dismissed. Mr. Sohal now seeks leave to appeal his sentence.The Circumstances of the Offence and the Offender[2]The case arose from an incident that occurred on a sidewalk in Brampton. Several motorists witnessed the applicant and the complainant (his girlfriend) in an altercation. The witnesses saw the applicant grab the complainant’s arm and then strike her. Some of them pulled over to assist the complainant.[3]The applicant was 22 years old at the time of sentencing. He had no prior criminal record. The applicant came to Canada from India in 2012 on a student visa. As a result of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, his conviction makes him inadmissible based on criminality. We are advised that the applicant will be deported on May 31, 2017.[4]The sentencing judge was aware of the applicant’s immigration status. He was not persuaded that a discharge, which would avoid the immigration problems accompanying a conviction, was a fit sentence for this incident of domestic violence. He entered a conviction and imposed a suspended sentence with nine months of probation. The Summary Conviction Appeal Court Judge (“SCACJ”) agreed and dismissed the appeal against sentence.Analysis[5]The applicant argues that leave to appeal should be granted because the SCACJ erred in: (1) relying on aggravating factors that were not relied upon by the sentencing judge; and (2) misapplying the law as it relates to the immigration consequences faced by the appellant. Applying the principles in R. v. R.R. (2008), 2008 ONCA 497 (CanLII), 90 O.R. (3d) 641, we would not grant leave to appeal on either ground.(1)Aggravating Factors[6]In his reasons for dismissing the appeal, the SCACJ mentioned that the offence occurred in a public space and “ceased only after the intervention of a few Good Samaritans.” The SCACJ also mentioned that one of the witnesses said that, in the aftermath of the assault, the applicant attempted to justify his actions on the basis of his own cultural beliefs. He considered this to be an additional aggravating factor.[7]In referring to the Good Samaritans, the language used by the SCACJ may have been imprecise. The trial judge did not find that the assault stopped because others physically intervened or restrained the applicant. However, it is clear that those who responded to what they saw did so with the purpose of assisting the complainant and preventing further problems.[8]We agree that the SCACJ erred in relying upon an imputed cultural justification as an aggravating factor. The Crown did not rely upon it as an aggravating factor. The trial judge did not find that the applicant said these words. He did not consider this factor in sentencing the applicant.[9]In all of the circumstances, these references in the reasons of the SCACJ were inconsequential. They had no tangible impact on his review of the fitness of the sentence that was imposed. The trial judge’s reasons for sentence show that he applied the proper principles and the sentence imposed is owed deference. There was simply no basis for the SCACJ to intervene, nor is there any basis for this court to interfere. Consequently, leave is denied on this ground.(2)Immigration Consequences[10]The applicant argues that the SCACJ misapplied the law relating to the impact of the applicant’s immigration status on the fitness of the sentence. We disagree.[11]Although the SCACJ failed to mention R. v. Pham, 2013 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2013] 1 S.C.R. 739, which had been referred to during submissions, he considered a number of earlier cases that addressed this issue. One of the authorities he relied on was R. v. Hamilton (2004), 2004 CanLII 11188 (ON CA), 71 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.). The reasoning in that case that was expressly adopted by the Supreme Court in Pham, at para. 19.[12]The failure to cite Pham was inconsequential. The SCACJ was satisfied that the sentencing judge gave appropriate consideration to the applicant’s immigration status. The applicant’s immigration consequences were given serious consideration by both judges: see R. v. McKenzie, 2017 ONCA 128 (CanLII), 35 C.R. (7th) 216, para. 35. Neither judge was persuaded that it ought to have resulted in a more lenient disposition. We see no basis to intervene.Disposition[13]Leave to appeal is denied.“Paul Rouleau J.A.”“G.T.

His convictions on the charges of invitation to sexual touching and sexual assault were stayed. The accused met the 13-year-old complainant on an Internet chat room site and asked her how old she was. She told him that she was 14. He never again inquired about her age notwithstanding many comments she made which should have caused him to make additional inquiries about her age, including a statement that she was in grade 9. He repeatedly encouraged her to expose her naked breasts while he masturbated [page482] and exposed his genitals to her by webcam. He recorded and saved the images. When the complainant's mother discovered the accused's telephone number on her telephone bill and learned that the complainant had met the accused in a chat room, the mother called the accused, told him that the complainant was \"way underage\" and warned him that she would call the police if the contact persisted. The accused and the complainant continued to communicate over the Internet, and the accused arranged a clandestine meeting with the complainant at a hotel, where they engaged in various sexual acts, short of sexual intercourse. The accused was 24 years old at the time of the offences and had no criminal record. He was sentenced to a total of 23 months' incarceration (18 months for Internet luring, four months consecutive for sexual interference, one month consecutive for possession of child pornography and one month concurrent for indecent exposure), less two-for-one credit for 73 days of pre-sentence custody, followed by three years' probation. He appealed the convictions, arguing that the trial judge erred in rejecting the limited defence of mistake of age. He also appealed the sentence.Held, the appeal should be dismissed.The trial judge was fully alert to the fact that s. 172.1(4) of the Criminal Code required the accused to take \"reasonable steps\" to ascertain the complainant's age, while s. 150.1(4) required him to take \"all reasonable steps\". He correctly concluded that the accused's conduct in relation to ascertaining the complainant's age met neither of those standards. The trial judge also did not err in employing the equivalent of a due diligence test in assessing whether the accused took reasonable steps to ascertain the complainant's age. Section 172.1(4) requires an accused who claims mistake of age to have exercised a degree of care in ascertaining a complainant's age that a reasonable person in the circumstances would have exercised. To the extent that the trial judge's reasons could be read as requiring the accused to be highly sceptical of the complainant's assertion that she was 14 years old, there was no error in light of the many and varied red flags that the complainant may not have been 14 years old.The trial judge expressly took the duration and conditions of the accused's restrictive bail into account as a mitigating factor in imposing sentence. He was not required to engage in a precise mathematical calculation of the credit to be given for pre-sentence bail. The mitigating weight to be assigned to pre- sentence bail, if any, is a discretionary matter for the sentencing judge. Nor was the overall sentence unfit. The accused was persistent and relentless in his pursuit of sexual gratification from the complainant, and his conduct was consistent with grooming her. Grooming and possession of the child pornography in the context of Internet luring constitutes an aggravating feature when determining a fit sentence for the offence of luring.APPEAL by the accused from the conviction entered by R.J.

Introduction[1] The appellant, Bogdan Dragos, was convicted of Internetluring, sexual interference, indecent exposure, sexual assault,invitation to sexual touching and possession of childpornography. His convictions on the charges of invitation tosexual touching and sexual assault were stayed on the basis ofR. v. Kienapple, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, [1974] S.C.J. No. 76. Hewas sentenced to a total of 23 months' imprisonment, lesscredit for 73 days of pre-sentence custody on a two-for-onebasis, plus three years' probation. He appeals from hisconvictions on all [page484] counts, except for the possessionof child pornography count to which he pleaded guilty, [SeeNote 1 below] and against sentence.[2] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss both theconviction and the sentence appeals.II. Facts[3] The appellant met the complainant, \"E.B.\", on an Internetchat room site in late September or early October of 2006.During their first encounter on the chat room site, theappellant asked E.B. how old she was. She told him she was 14years old. In fact, she was only 13 years of age. This was theonly time that the appellant inquired of E.B. about her age.[4] In their initial online conversation, the appellant toldE.B. that he was 18 years old. He subsequently disclosed to herthat he was actually 24 years of age.[5] For the next three and one-half months, the appellant andE.B. communicated regularly over the Internet using the MSNchat service. At trial, approximately 1,000 pages of theirelectronic exchanges were admitted into evidence. Thesecommunications contain examples of explicit sexual language,and incidents in which the appellant repeatedly encouraged E.B.to expose her naked breasts to him while he masturbated andexposed his genitals to her by webcam. When E.B. did expose herbreasts, the appellant recorded the images by webcam and savedthem on his computer. There is no suggestion that hedisseminated these images to anyone else.[6] Throughout her contacts with the appellant, E.B. tried topresent herself as older than she actually was. Whenregistering on the chat room site, she indicated that she was14 years old, one year older than her true age. Although shewas in grade 8, she told the appellant that she was in grade 9.In her numerous MSN messages, she indicated that she hadpreviously dated \"older guys\", used sexually explicit \"streetlanguage\", implied that she was sexually experienced andsuggested -- notwithstanding her age -- that her weight wassimilar to that of an 11-year-old.[7] In December 2006, E.B.'s mother discovered long-distancetelephone calls to the appellant's telephone number on herphone bill. She called the number and spoke with the appellant.[page485] On discovering that the appellant had met E.B. ina chat room, E.B.'s mother told the appellant that E.B. was\"way underage\". She also told him that he was to have nofurther contact with E.B. and warned that if she saw his numberon her phone bill again, she would call the police. At the timeof this call, E.B.'s mother was unaware of the extent andsexual nature of the communications between E.B. and theappellant.[8] Contrary to E.B.'s mother's clear directions to theappellant, the appellant and E.B. continued to communicate overthe Internet and the appellant arranged to meet E.B. in January2007 at a hotel near E.B.'s home for a sexual encounter. E.B.attended the rendezvous, as agreed.[9] While alone together in a hotel room, the appellant andE.B. removed their clothes and participated in various sexualacts and sexual touching, but did not engage in sexualintercourse. The police arrived while the appellant and E.B.were still undressed and in the hotel room. They were taken tothe police station, the appellant was arrested and both gavevideotaped statements to the police. In his statement, theappellant said that he had stopped short of having intercoursewith E.B. because they both \"felt bad about it\" but that they\"did everything else\".III. Limited Defence of Mistake of Age[10] At trial, the defence theory was that the appellant atall times had an honest but mistaken belief that E.B. was 14years of age. Relying on E.B.'s statement to him that she was14 years old, the fact that they met on an Internet chat sitefor people 14 years old and older, E.B.'s claims that she wasin grade 9 and that she had dated older guys, and her use ofsexualized language in their communications, the appellantmaintained that he had taken sufficient steps in thecircumstances to ascertain E.B.'s actual age.[11] The central issue, therefore, was whether the Crown hadproved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant failed totake sufficient steps in all the circumstances to ascertainE.B.'s age.[12] Under the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code,R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, the requisite legal standards for thedetermination of the sufficiency of steps taken to ascertain acomplainant's age arguably vary according to the offencealleged. Thus, at the relevant times, in respect of theoffences of sexual interference (s. 151), invitation to sexualtouching (s. 152) and indecent exposure (s. 173(2)), s.150.1(4) of the Code stated:150.1(4) It is not a defence to a charge under section 151or 152 . . . or 173(2) . . . that the accused believed thatthe complainant was fourteen [page486] years of age or moreat the time the offence is alleged to have been committedunless the accused took all reasonable steps to ascertain theage of the complainant. [See Note 2 below](Emphasis added)[13] In contrast, in respect of the offence of child Internetluring (s. 172.1(1)(c)), s. 172.1(4) of the Code provided inmaterial part as follows:172.1(4) It is not a defence to a charge [of Internetluring under s. 172.1(1)(c)] that the accused believed thatthe person . . . was at least . . . fourteen years of age. . . unless the accused took reasonable steps to ascertainthe age of the person.(Emphasis added)[14] Sections 150.1(4) and 172.1(4) of the Code thusestablish a limited defence of mistaken belief in the age of acomplainant. For the class of offences contemplated under thatprovision, s. 150.1(4) creates this limited defence where theaccused took \"all reasonable steps\" (emphasis added) toascertain the age of the complainant. In relation to theoffence of child Internet luring, s. 172.1(4) contemplates adefence of mistake of age on proof that the accused took\"reasonable steps\" to ascertain the age of the recipient ofthe electronic communication.[15] In this case, the appellant argued in his factum thatthe difference in the wording of ss. 150.1(4) and 172.1(4) ofthe Code indicates that different standards apply for theassessment of the sufficiency of steps taken to ascertain acomplainant's age, depending on the nature of the offencecharged. However, as I will explain, during oral argument theappellant resiled somewhat from this position, contendinggenerally that the trial judge erred by applying the \"allreasonable steps\" standard, based on a due diligence approach,to the Internet luring charge. In contrast, the Crownmaintained that the nature of the distinction between thestandards in these provisions, if any, is irrelevant in thiscase.IV. Trial Judge's Decision[16] The trial judge found that the Crown had established theactus reus of the sex offences charged to the requisitecriminal standard of proof. In his view, expressed at para. 4of his reasons [page487] [2010 ONSC 3093 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 2764 (S.C.J.)], thesole issue was whether the Crown had also proven beyond areasonable doubt that the appellant \"failed to take allreasonable steps, or reasonable steps for Count #5 [theInternet luring charge], to ascertain the age of [E.B.]\".[17] The trial judge concluded, at para. 50 of his reasons,that the appellant \"did not take any steps let alone reasonablesteps\" to ascertain E.B.'s age after she initially told himthat she was 14 years of age. He found, at para. 50:[R]elying [on] the complainant's language and statementsindicating that she could be 14 years of age or older did notconstitute taking reasonable steps or all reasonable steps toascertain her true age in all the circumstances, especiallyafter being warned by her mother to stop all contact or shewould call the police and stating that the complainant wasway too young for him.[18] The trial judge summarized his conclusion on theInternet luring charge in this fashion, at para. 55:The [appellant] made no further inquiries and sought noadditional identification evidence other than an initial proforma inquiry as to the complainant's age. I find that theCrown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the[appellant] did not take \"reasonable steps\" or \"allreasonable steps\" to ascertain the age of the person andreasonable steps would include more than an initial pro formaquestion and reliance on statements made on an MSN internetchat line that indicated [E.B.] could be 14 years of age.V. Issues[19] There are two main issues on the conviction appeal:(1) Did the trial judge err in law by using the wrong test forassessing the sufficiency of the appellant's steps toascertain E.B.'s age (a) by applying the \"all reasonable steps\" rather than the\"reasonable steps\" standard in relation to theInternet luring charge; or (b) by applying a \"due diligence\", rather than a reasonablebelief, requirement in assessing the appellant'sconduct?(2) Did the trial judge further err in assessing thesufficiency of the appellant's steps to ascertain E.B.'sage (a) by failing to conduct the contextual analysis requiredunder ss. 150.1(4) and 172.1(4) of the Code; [page488] (b) by holding, in effect, that the appellant should haveapproached E.B.'s assertion of her age with a highdegree of scepticism; and (c) by requiring evidence of active conduct by theappellant to ascertain E.B.'s age?[20] The sole issue on the sentence appeal is whether thetrial judge erred by failing to reduce the appellant's overallsentence to take account of the strict terms and duration ofthe appellant's bail, contrary to R. v. Downes (2006), 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA), 79 O.R.(3d) 321, [2006] O.J. No. 555 (C.A.).VI. Analysis (1) Conviction appeal (i) Trial judge did not apply the wrong legal testsunder ss. 172.1(4) and 150.1(4) of the Code (a) \"Reasonable steps\" or \"all reasonable steps\"[21] As I have said, the appellant initially argued that thetrial judge erred in his assessment of the sufficiency of theappellant's steps to ascertain E.B.'s age by treating thestandards of \"all reasonable steps\" under s. 150.1(4) and\"reasonable steps\" under s. 172.1(4) of the Code asinterchangeable. During oral argument, he took no firm positionon whether there is a meaningful distinction between thesestandards, arguing generally that the trial judge erred byapplying the \"all reasonable steps\" standard, based on a duediligence approach, to the Internet luring charge.[22] I would reject both arguments. The trial judge's reasonsconfirm that he was fully alert to the difference in languagebetween the standards established under ss. 150.1(4) and172.1(4) of the Code. At the beginning of his reasons, at para.4 [2010 ONSC 3093 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 2764 (S.C.J.)], the trial judge set out theissue to be decided in the case, stating: \"The issue to bedecided is whether the Crown has proven beyond a reasonabledoubt that [the appellant] failed to take all reasonable steps,or reasonable steps for count #5 [the Internet luring charge],to ascertain the age of the complainant.\"[23] Then, at the outset of the analysis section of hisreasons, at para. 40, the trial judge again indicated that the\"reasonable steps\" standard applied under s. 172.1(4) of theCode to the Internet luring charge (count 5). Further, at para.41, he noted that the \"all reasonable steps\" standard appliedunder s. 150.1(4) of the Code to the offences of sexual assault(count 1), sexual [page489] interference (count 2),invitation to sexual touching (count 3) and indecent exposure(count 6).[24] Thus, the trial judge was mindful of the differentlyexpressed thresholds under ss. 150.1(4) and 172.1(4) of theCode for proof of the sufficiency of steps taken to ascertain acomplainant's age.[25] I accept that it might have been preferable if the trialjudge had distinguished more clearly in his reasons between hisconsideration of s. 150.1(4), on the one hand, and s. 172.1(4)of the Code, on the other hand. That said, I agree with theCrown's submission that, in this case, any distinction betweenthe applicable standards under ss. 150.1(4) and 172.1(4) of theCode is of no moment.[26] I say this because, read as a whole, the trial judge'sreasons reveal that he ultimately concluded that theappellant's conduct in relation to ascertaining E.B.'s age metneither of the standards under ss. 150.1(4) and 172.1(4) of theCode. Recall his holding, at para. 50, that the appellant'sreliance on E.B.'s language and statements as confirmation thatshe was 14 years of age or older \"did not constitute takingreasonable steps or all reasonable steps to ascertain her trueage in the circumstances\" (emphasis added).[27] Moreover, the trial judge concluded, at para. 55 [2010 ONSC 3093 (CanLII), [2010]O.J. No. 2764 (S.C.J.)], that \"the Crown has proven beyond areasonable doubt that the accused did not take 'reasonablesteps' or 'all reasonable steps' to ascertain the age of theperson\" (emphasis added). He continued, at para. 57, that hewas not satisfied that \"the evidence introduced at trial raisesa reasonable doubt that the accused took reasonable steps orall reasonable steps to ascertain the age of [E.B.]\" (emphasisadded).[28] Thus, the trial judge found that the defence of mistakeof age was not made out because the applicable \"reasonablesteps\" threshold under s. 172.1(4) of the Code had not beenmet, just as the \"all reasonable steps\" standard under s.150.1(4) of the Code equally had not been satisfied. In thesecircumstances, as the Crown submits, it was unnecessary for thetrial judge to separately outline his interpretation andapplication of the standards established under s. 150.1(4) (inrelation to counts 1, 2, 3 and 6) and s. 172.1(4) (in relationto count 5). This case did not require a detailed analysis ofthe distinction, if any, between the two standards. Nor is suchan analysis required for the disposition of this appeal. On thetrial judge's unchallenged factual findings, the appellant'sconduct fell short of meeting either standard. [page490] (b) Due diligence or reasonable belief[29] The appellant further argues that the trial judge erredby employing the equivalent of a due diligence test, instead ofa reasonable belief test, in assessing whether the appellanttook reasonable steps to ascertain E.B.'s age. Morespecifically, he contends that the trial judge erred byinterpreting the phrases \"reasonable steps\" and \"all reasonablesteps\" under ss. 172.1(4) and 150.1(4) of the Code as mandatingan inquiry as to those steps that a reasonable person wouldhave taken to ascertain E.B.'s age, rather than an evaluationof whether a reasonable person could have believed that E.B.was 14 years of age on the basis of the information availableto the appellant.[30] I would also reject this argument.[31] In various parts of his reasons, the trial judgereferred to the steps that a reasonable person would have takenin the circumstances to ascertain E.B.'s age, in contrast tothe appellant's conduct. This approach did not reflect legalerror.[32] Relying on this court's decision in R. v. Thain, [2009]O.J. No. 1022, 2009 ONCA 223 (CanLII), the trial judge held [2010 ONSC 3093 (CanLII), [2010] O.J.No. 2764 (S.C.J.)], at para. 43, that the \"reasonableness ofthe steps taken to ascertain the age of the person must beassessed in context\". He further held, at paras. 46 and 47,that whether \"reasonable steps\" or \"all reasonable steps\" weretaken must be assessed on an objective, reasonable personbasis. These observations accord with the controlling legalprinciples. What constitutes \"reasonable steps\" in a given caseis a fact-specific inquiry that turns on the circumstances ofthe case.[33] The Supreme Court of Canada has described the s.150.1(4) \"all reasonable steps\" requirement as a \"due diligencedefence\": R. v. Hess; R. v. Nguyen, 1990 CanLII 89 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 906, [1990]S.C.J. No. 91. Similarly, the British Columbia Court of Appealhas interpreted the applicable test under s. 150.1(4) as askingwhat steps \"a reasonable person would take in thecircumstances\" to ascertain a complainant's age: R. v. P.(L.T.), 1997 CanLII 12464 (BC CA), [1997] B.C.J. No. 24, 113 C.C.C. (3d) 42 (C.A.), atpara. 20. See, also, R. v. Hayes, [1991] A.J. No. 1232, 12W.C.B. (2d) 457 (Q.B.).[34] The appellant contends that the s. 172.1(4) \"reasonablesteps\" requirement applicable to the Internet luring chargemust mean something less strict. He points to the SupremeCourt's statement in R. v. Levigne, [2010] 2 S.C.R. 3, [2010]S.C.J. No. 25, 2010 SCC 25 (CanLII), at para. 31, that the s. 172.1(4)reasonable steps requirement \"was enacted by Parliament toforeclose exculpatory claims of ignorance or mistake that areentirely devoid of an objective evidentiary basis\" (emphasisadded). In the [page491] appellant's submission, this statementmeans that the reasonable steps requirement is met by proof ofsome objective basis on which a reasonable person could makethe same mistake of age asserted by the accused.[35] In my view, s. 172.1(4) requires an accused who claimsmistake of age to have exercised a degree of care inascertaining a complainant's age that a reasonable person inthe circumstances would have exercised. I say this for thefollowing reasons.[36] I note, first, that in Levigne, the Supreme Court upheldconvictions for child Internet luring, holding that the defenceof mistake of age is not available when an accused has failedto take \"the reasonable steps he was required by law to take\":see paras. 36-38 (emphasis in original).[37] Second, the plain language of s. 172.1(4) focuses onwhether an accused \"took reasonable steps\" to ascertain the ageof the complainant, not whether there was an objective basisfor the accused's honest belief in the complainant's age. AsLevigne confirms, at para. 41, s. 172.1(4) requires both thatreal steps be taken to ascertain the age of the person withwhom an accused is communicating and that those steps be\"reasonable\" in the circumstances.[38] Third, the statutory purpose of s. 172.1, the Internetluring provision of the Code, weighs in favour of aconstruction of \"reasonable steps\" that protects children byrequiring an accused to take more, rather than fewer,precautions in ascertaining a complainant's age.[39] Fourth, the \"reasonable steps\" language of s. 172.1(4)may be analogized to the requirement under s. 273.2(b) of theCode that an accused \"take reasonable steps, in thecircumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertainthat the complainant was consenting\" in order to make out adefence of an honest but mistaken belief in consent against acharge of sexual assault. See R. v. A. (J.), [2011] 2 S.C.R.440, [2011] S.C.J. No. 28, 2011 SCC 28 (CanLII). This court has heldthat this provision \"requires the accused to act as areasonable person would in the circumstances by takingreasonable steps to ascertain whether the complainant wasconsenting\": R. v. Cornejo (2003), 2003 CanLII 26893 (ON CA), 68 O.R. (3d) 117, [2003]O.J. No. 4517 (C.A.), at para. 22, leave to appeal to S.C.C.refused [2004] S.C.C.A. No. 32.[40] The similarity in language between ss. 172.1(4) and273.2(b) of the Code lends further support to the conclusionthat a due diligence formulation of the \"reasonable steps\"requirement is appropriate in the s. 172.1(4) context, as it isunder s. 273.2(b). [page492][41] Finally, contrary to the appellant's submission, I seenothing in this court's decision in Thain that is inconsistentwith the application of a due diligence approach to the\"reasonable steps\" requirement of s. 172.1(4). As the trialjudge noted, Thain holds, at para. 37, that \"the reasonablenessof the steps taken to ascertain the age of the person must beassessed in context\". The contextual analysis mandated by Thainin no way conflicts with an assessment of the steps areasonable person would take in the circumstances to ascertainthe age of a complainant.[42] Accordingly, this ground of appeal also fails. (ii) Trial judge did not err in his assessment of thesufficiency of the appellant's steps to ascertainE.B.'s age (a) Requisite contextual analysis[43] The appellant attacks the trial judge's assessment ofthe sufficiency of his steps to ascertain E.B.'s age on severalfronts. He submits, first, that the trial judge essentiallyfailed to conduct the requisite contextual analysis todetermine if the appellant took \"all reasonable steps\" (inrelation to counts 1, 2, 3 and 6) and \"reasonable steps\" (inrelation to count 5, the Internet luring charge) to ascertainE.B.'s age. I disagree.[44] The trial judge recognized that the Crown bore the onusof proving that the appellant failed to take sufficient stepsto determine E.B.'s actual age and, as I have mentioned, heexpressly adverted to the objective and contextual nature ofthe sufficiency inquiry.[45] The trial judge's reasons indicate that he carefullyconsidered all the circumstances surrounding and the context inwhich the appellant's interactions with E.B. unfolded. Forexample, at para. 17 [2010 ONSC 3093 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 2764 (S.C.J.)], the trialjudge described the evidence of E.B.'s consistent efforts toportray herself as older than she in fact was and, at paras. 23and 36, the steps taken by the appellant to ascertain E.B.'sage.[46] After doing so, the trial judge, at para. 39, set out 14factors that, in his view, indicated that the appellant hadfailed to take \"all reasonable steps\" to ascertain E.B.'s age.He then specifically addressed the evidence establishing thatthe appellant failed to take \"reasonable steps\" to ascertainE.B.'s age. This included evidence that(a) there was a significant age difference between theappellant (24 years of age) and E.B. (ostensibly 14 yearsof age) (para. 39(e)); [page493](b) the appellant failed to take further steps to ascertainE.B.'s age after he received a warning from E.B.'s motherthat E.B. was \"way too young\" (paras. 39(i), 49, 50 and52);(c) the appellant also failed to make further inquiries aboutE.B.'s age even after he was warned by E.B.'s mother thatif he contacted E.B. again, she would contact the police (paras. 39(i), 49, 50 and 52);(d) the appellant's communications with E.B. were mostly by MSNchats on the computer (para. 49);(e) E.B. might be under age because she was very small and hadthe body weight of an 11-year-old (para. 49); and(f) the appellant's sole inquiry about E.B.'s age, when hefirst met E.B. on the Internet chat room, was a pro forma,rather than an earnest, inquiry (para. 51).On the facts of this case, these were proper considerations inthe sufficiency inquiry.[47] Further, in assessing whether the steps taken by theappellant to ascertain E.B.'s age were sufficient to constitute\"reasonable steps\" within the meaning of s. 172.1(4) of theCode, the trial judge held, at para. 53 [2010 ONSC 3093 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 2764(S.C.J.)]:The complainant looked young enough and small enough (shewas the weight of an 11 year old) to raise a suspicion aboutwhether or not she was 14 years old. Where in addition theaccused has met the young person on an anonymous internetchat site, where children who are under 14 years of age maybe participating, where there is a large age differencebetween them, where the accused was warned that thecomplainant was way too young and that she would call thepolice if he continued to contact the complainant, and hecontinued in secret. In these circumstances, I find that theCrown has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accusedfailed to take reasonable steps to ascertain the age of E.B.(Emphasis added)[48] When the trial judge's reasons are carefullyscrutinized, it is clear that he took account of the fullcontext and circumstances in which the appellant's interactionswith E.B. took place for the purpose of determining thesufficiency of the appellant's efforts to ascertain her age.This ground of appeal therefore also fails. (b) Requirement for scepticism concerning E.B.'sasserted age[49] I reach a similar conclusion concerning the appellant'sclaim that the trial judge erred by holding, in effect, thatthe [page494] appellant should have approached E.B.'s assertionthat she was 14 years old with a high degree of scepticism.[50] The appellant submits that many of the circumstances ofthis case could have led a reasonable person to infer, as theappellant says he did, that E.B. was telling the truth when shesaid that she was 14 years old.[51] Again, I disagree. In my opinion, on any objectivestandard, the circumstances surrounding the appellant'sinteractions with E.B. were replete with warning signsregarding the truthfulness of E.B.'s claim that she was 14years of age.[52] The appellant met E.B. on a website that, by its natureand context, was attractive to young people. Further, thewebsite and the chat room were anonymous, containing noassurance of the accuracy of any postings. The appellanthimself lied about his age on the chat room, in order to appearyounger than he in fact was.[53] Moreover, from the beginning of his interactions withE.B., the appellant knew that there was a significantdifference in age between them: even if E.B. was 14 years ofage, as she claimed, she would have been ten years younger thanthe appellant.[54] And, again to the appellant's knowledge, E.B. was slightin build and young in appearance. The appellant viewed E.B. bywebcam and, later, in person, when they met at a hotel room inJanuary 2007. E.B. herself told the appellant that she had thebody of an 11-year-old.[55] In addition, the numerous chat records admitted at trialreveal that the appellant was fixated on E.B.'s diminutive sizeand appearance. They also reveal E.B.'s immaturity and the factthat she and the appellant discussed her friendships withpersons in grades 6 and 7.[56] Finally, this is a case where the accused was explicitlywarned that he was associating with an underage girl. E.B.'smother told the appellant that her daughter was underage, that,in effect, the appellant should have nothing further to do withher, and that, if she again discovered through her phone billsthat the appellant and E.B. had been in contact, she would callthe police.[57] Although the appellant contends that these starkwarnings from E.B.'s mother meant only that E.B. was under 18,rather than 14, years of age, the intended meaning of E.B.'smother's remarks is irrelevant. The important point is that theappellant was clearly and bluntly told that E.B. was too youngfor him and continued contact between the appellant and E.B.would trigger police involvement. [page495][58] I recognize that E.B.'s mother did not tell theappellant E.B.'s precise age. Nonetheless, in my opinion, it isinconceivable that her warnings to the appellant, whichdirectly called E.B.'s age into question, would not have givena reasonable person in the circumstances cause to doubt E.B.'sassertion of her age. Standing alone, these warnings weresufficient to put a reasonable person on further inquiryregarding E.B.'s actual age.[59] Thus, there were many, and varied, \"red flags\" that E.B.may not have been 14 years of age, as she claimed. To theextent, therefore, that the trial judge's reasons may be readas requiring the appellant to be highly sceptical of E.B.'sassertion that she was 14 years of age, I see no error. Indeed,taken together, the factors that I have describedoverwhelmingly support the conclusion that, in this case,sufficient steps to determine E.B.'s age necessarily includedheightened inquiry and scepticism regarding her professed age. (c) Requirement for active steps[60] The appellant also asserts that the trial judge erred inhis analysis of the sufficiency of the appellant's conduct byinterpreting the requirement of \"reasonable steps\" under s.172.1(4) of the Code as requiring active, rather than merelypassive, steps to ascertain E.B.'s age. He relies on severalpassages from the trial judge's reasons in support of thisassertion. For example, at para. 55 of the reasons [2010 ONSC 3093 (CanLII), [2010] O.J.No. 2764 (S.C.J.)], the trial judge found that the appellant\"made no further inquiries and sought no additionalidentification evidence other than an initial pro forma inquiryas to the complainant's age\". Further, at para. 56, the trialjudge stated:Where there is a substantial age difference between twopersons, one of whom is a young person, who meet on ananonymous internet chat group site and where there is apossibility that one is less than the age of 14 then I findtaking reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the youngerperson requires the accused to take steps beyond merelyrelying on a statement made on the internet by the youngperson that she is 14 years old.[61] The appellant submits that these and similar comments inthe reasons are tantamount to a finding that an accused musttake active steps to ascertain a complainant's age as aprerequisite to mounting the threshold of \"reasonable steps\"under s. 172.1(4). This, the appellant says, constitutes anartificial distinction between things an accused actively doesand information that he or she receives concerning acomplainant's age. The appellant argues that for the purpose ofthe limited defence of mistaken belief as to a complainant'sage, an accused [page496] is entitled to rely on informationconveyed to him or her, whether or not it is actively soughtout.[62] I do not accept that the trial judge erred in the mannerasserted by the appellant. Put simply, I do not read the trialjudge's challenged comments as holding that, as a matter oflaw, proof of active steps by an accused to ascertain acomplainant's age is a precondition to satisfying the\"reasonable steps\" standard set out in s. 172.1(4) of theCode. Rather, the trial judge determined the sufficiency of thesteps taken by the appellant to ascertain E.B.'s age on anobjective basis, in the light of the particular circumstancesand context of this case. This is what he was required to do.[63] I agree that the appellant was entitled to rely onE.B.'s representation of her age, when they first met on theInternet chat room, as one indicator of E.B.'s age. I did notunderstand the Crown to argue otherwise. Nor do the trialjudge's reasons suggest to the contrary.[64] I also agree that the appellant was entitled to rely onE.B.'s other actions in aid of her effort to appear 14 years ofage (for example, her statement that she was in grade 9, heruse of sexually explicit language in her communications withthe appellant and her claim that she had dated \"older guys\").[65] However, that does not end the matter. The question iswhether, on the totality of the circumstances, the appellant'sactions to determine E.B.'s age were sufficient to meet the\"reasonable steps\" standard established by s. 172.1(4) ofthe Code. The determination of this question required carefulexamination of all the circumstances surrounding theappellant's interactions with E.B. As I have already indicated,in my view, this is precisely the type of inquiry undertaken bythe trial judge.[66] The trial judge concluded that further steps by theappellant were required to meet the reasonableness standardunder s. 172.1(4) of the Code. I see no basis for interferencewith this conclusion. The full circumstances of this case,examined objectively, mandated further inquiry by the appellantregarding E.B.'s age. I have already described the multiple\"red flags\" suggesting that E.B.'s representation of her agemay be unreliable and that she may have been untruthfulregarding her age.[67] In particular, the warnings about E.B.'s age andpotential police involvement received by the appellant fromE.B.'s mother cried out for further steps by the appellant toascertain E.B.'s true age. In the absence of those steps, onthe facts here, the trial judge was fully justified inconcluding that the appellant had failed to make out thedefence of mistake of age regarding E.B. [page497] (2) Sentence appeal[68] The appellant grew up in a large religious family insouthern Ontario. He was the ninth of 17 children. The evidencebefore the trial judge on sentencing indicated that, by age 24,the appellant had never had a serious romantic relationship orengaged in sexual intercourse. He was described in his pre-sentence report as \"quiet and reserved\". He had no priorcriminal record or history of anti-social behaviour.[69] The appellant was arrested on January 19, 2007, detainedin custody and released on bail on April 2, 2007. Under theterms of his pre-sentence bail, he could not be out of his homeafter 9:00 p.m. in the evening and at all other times had to beaccompanied by a surety when he left his house. He remainedunder these strict bail terms for almost four years, until hewas sentenced on February 8, 2011.[70] The appellant says that his bail terms were akin to\"house arrest\" conditions. Relying on the decision of thiscourt in Downes, he argues that the strict terms and thelengthy duration of his pre-sentence bail warranted a reductionof 12 months from his total sentence of 23 months'imprisonment. He submits that the trial judge erred in hissentencing analysis by failing to take account of theappellant's \"house arrest\"-type bail in mitigation of sentence.[71] In Downes, this court held, at para. 33:[T]ime spent under stringent bail conditions, especiallyunder house arrest, must be taken into account as a relevantmitigating circumstance. However, like any potentialmitigating circumstance, there will be variations in itspotential impact on the sentence and the circumstances maydictate that little or no credit should be given for pre-sentence house arrest . . . [I]t is incumbent on thesentencing judge to explain why he or she has decided not totake pre-sentence house arrest into account. The failure todo so will constitute an error in principle[.][72] Subsequently, in R. v. Lawes, [2007] O.J. No. 50, 2007ONCA 10 (CanLII), at para. 10, and in R. v. Hunjan, [2007] O.J. No. 520,2007 ONCA 102 (CanLII), this court clarified that a sentencing judge'sfailure to refer in his or her reasons to bail conditions doesnot automatically constitute an error in principle.[73] And, in R. v. Ijam (2007), 87 O.R. (3d) 81, [2007] O.J.No. 3395, 2007 ONCA 597 (CanLII), at para. 36, this court held thatbail, even with stringent conditions, and pre-trial custody arenot to be regarded as equivalents in every case. MacPhersonJ.A., writing for a majority of a five-person panel of thiscourt on this issue, stated, at para. 37:[T]here will be cases -- Downes, with long-term house arrestbail conditions, is one -- where a sentencing judge shouldgive mitigation effect to pre-trial [page498] bail. However,there will be many other cases -- Lawes and Hunjan areexamples -- where this factor should attract little, if anyweight.[74] In this case, at trial, the Crown sought a totalsentence of three years' imprisonment (two years' imprisonmenton the Internet luring charge and a further 12 months'imprisonment on the remaining charges). The defence urged asentence of 12 months' imprisonment, less two-for-one creditfor pre-trial custody and less further credit of six or sevenmonths for time spent on restrictive bail conditions. If thisdefence submission had prevailed, the appellant's overallsentence may well have been in the order of one or two months'imprisonment.[75] The trial judge sentenced the appellant as follows:-- Internet luring -- 18 months' imprisonment, plus threeyears' probation;-- sexual interference -- four months' imprisonment,consecutive;-- possession of child pornography -- one month's imprisonment,consecutive;-- indecent exposure -- one month's imprisonment, concurrent tothe sentence on the possession of child pornography.Total: 23 months' imprisonment, plus three years' probation.[76] The appellant submits that, in crafting these sentences,the trial judge erred by declining, despite the defence requestat trial, to give the appellant any credit for the time spenton stringent bail conditions and to explain why such credit wasinappropriate. I would reject this submission.[77] To begin, while I accept that the appellant's bail termswere strict, he was not subject to house arrest bail.Nonetheless, in accordance with Downes and its progeny, I agreewith the appellant's submission that the terms and duration ofhis pre-sentence bail were relevant mitigating circumstances onsentencing. I did not understand the Crown to argue otherwise.[78] That said, I do not agree that the trial judge failed totake account of and afford the appellant's restrictive bail anymitigation effect. In my opinion, the trial judge's sentencingreasons undercut this contention.[79] When outlining the parties' positions on sentence, thetrial judge expressly noted [2011 ONSC 183 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 536 (S.C.J.), atpara. 19]: \"The defence argues that a period of twelve monthsin jail would be appropriate with credit for the lengthy periodthat the accused has been subject to strict conditions while onbail.\" [page499] Thus, the trial judge was fully cognizant ofthe defence request for a reduction of the appellant's overallsentence based on his strict bail conditions.[80] The trial judge next reviewed ten mitigating and nineaggravating factors relevant to sentencing. He described thesecond mitigating factor as follows [at para. 21]: \"[Theappellant] followed strict bail terms for a lengthy periodwithout any breaches.\"[81] Then, after addressing the applicable principles ofsentencing and some of the authorities pertinent to the offenceof Internet luring, the trial judge imposed a sentence of 18months' imprisonment, plus three years' probation, on theInternet luring charge. He noted that this sentence reflectedthe mid-point of the range of 12 months' to two years'imprisonment mentioned by this court in R. v. Jarvis, 2006 CanLII 27300 (ON CA), [2006]O.J. No. 3241, 211 C.C.C. (3d) 20 (C.A.), at para. 31, asapplicable to the offence of child luring. As the partiesacknowledged during oral argument, this court recently held inR. v. Woodward (2011), 107 O.R. (3d) 81, [2011] O.J. No. 4216,2011 ONCA 610 (CanLII), at para. 58, that to the extent that Jarvis maybe read as establishing an appropriate range of sentence forchild luring -- a construction of Jarvis that this court didnot accept in Woodward -- this range needs to be revisedupwards given the 2007 amendments to the Code, doubling themaximum punishment for luring from five years to ten years.[82] After referring to Jarvis, the trial judge stated, atpara. 32 [2011 ONSC 183 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 536 (S.C.J.)]:I have not given the maximum of the range due to the factthat the accused has no record and has taken active steps toobtain counselling and is at a low risk of reoffending. Theaccused has also been subject to strict bail conditions forthree and a half years without any breach.(Emphasis added)[83] The appellant argues that the above-quoted passage fromthe trial judge's sentencing reasons indicates that he tookaccount of the appellant's compliance with his bail terms as amitigating factor but that he failed to accord the restrictivenature and duration of the appellant's bail any mitigatingeffect.[84] I disagree. In my opinion, this is an inaccuratecharacterization of the sentencing reasons. There is no setformulaic language or magic phraseology for taking cognizanceof strict and lengthy bail terms as a mitigating factor onsentencing. Nor should there be. Downes and the cases thatfollowed it contain no suggestion of such a rigid andunrealistic approach to this issue. They do not require aprecise mathematical calculation of the credit to be given forpre-sentence bail. Nor do they mandate [page500] the manner inwhich a sentencing judge must consider restrictive bailconditions. They simply require that, in a proper case,mitigation effect should be given to pre-sentence bail. In thefinal analysis, the mitigating weight to be assigned to pre-sentence bail, if any, is a discretionary matter for thesentencing judge.[85] In this case, the trial judge expressly adverted to thelength of the appellant's pre-sentence bail (three times) andto the stringent nature of the terms of bail (also threetimes). Further, when explaining why he declined to impose asentence at the high end of what he understood to be theapplicable range for child luring, the trial judge specificallyreferenced the nature and duration of the appellant's bail, aswell as his compliance with it, as warranting a reduction insentence.[86] The appellant essentially contends that the trial judgeshould have said more in his sentencing reasons about theappellant's bail or phrased his consideration of this factordifferently. However, the trial judge was not required to doso. When the trial judge's sentencing reasons are read as awhole and in the context of the parties' positions on sentence,I think it indisputable that the appellant received mitigationcredit for the restrictive nature and duration of his pre-sentence bail. The trial judge made no error in principle inhis treatment of this issue.[87] Nor is the overall sentence imposed unfit. Thecircumstances of the appellant's luring of E.B. were serious.They included the pursuit of a vulnerable child, for sexualpurposes, over a sustained period (more than three and one-halfmonths), repeated pleas by the appellant for E.B. to expose herbreasts to him while he masturbated and exposed his genitalsvia webcam, the recording by the appellant of the images ofE.B. exposing her breasts, and a clandestine encounter in ahotel room (despite warnings from E.B.'s mother), where varioussexual acts short of intercourse were performed.[88] On the trial judge's findings, the appellant waspersistent and relentless in his pursuit of sexualgratification from E.B., and his conduct was consistent withgrooming E.B. As this court held in Woodward, at para. 43,grooming constitutes an aggravating feature in the offence ofluring. Woodward also holds, at para. 76, that in sentencingadult offenders for the exploitation of innocent children:While the effects of a conviction on the offender and theoffender's prospects for rehabilitation will always warrantconsideration, the objectives of denunciation, deterrence,and the need to separate sexual predators from society forsociety's well-being and the well-being of our children musttake precedence. [page501][89] Further, the appellant pleaded guilty to possession ofchild pornography, an aggravating feature in the context ofluring based on Jarvis, and was also found guilty of theadditional offences of sexual interference, indecent exposure,sexual assault and invitation to sexual touching. Theseoffences, even without the luring charge, call for asubstantial term of imprisonment.[90] The overall sentence imposed here was well within therange of sentences imposed for similar offences and similaroffenders. Indeed, in my opinion, it might well be viewed aslenient in all the circumstances.[91] I therefore conclude that the sentencing judge made noerror in principle and the overall sentence imposed wasentirely fit.VII. Disposition[92] For the reasons given, I would dismiss both theconviction and the sentence appeals.Appeal dismissed.Notes----------------Note 1: The appellant pleaded guilty to one count ofpossession of child pornography. Two other counts of possessionof child pornography were withdrawn at the request of theCrown.Note 2: In these reasons, I refer to those provisions of theCode in force at the time of the offences at issue in thiscase. Section 150.1(4) has since been amended to reflect theincreased age of 16 years for consent: Tackling Violent CrimeAct, S.C. 2008, c. 6, s. 54.----------------"}

He pled guilty in Provincial Court to two charges, one under s. 344(b) and the other under s. 733.1(1)(b) of the Criminal Code. The sentencing judge rejected a joint recommendation of imprisonment for terms totaling 33 months, and imposed a term of 45 months for the robbery and one of two months for breach of probation, the latter to be served concurrently.[2]Mr. Guignard applies for leave to appeal against the sentence for robbery. He contends that the sentencing judge committed reversible error in finding, without supporting evidence, that the robbery was premeditated and in rejecting the parties’ common submission. Counsel for the respondent was also counsel for the Crown at the sentencing hearing. Not surprisingly, he also takes issue with the sentencing judge’s rejection of the joint recommendation.[3]We allow the application for leave, but dismiss the appeal for the reasons that follow.I.The Factual Context[4]Shortly after midnight on July 23, 2004, Mr. Guignard attended at a bar in Campbellton where he passed the better part of an hour drinking beer, playing the coin machines and sitting at a table. On his way out, Mr. Guignard told the bartender that: “tonight’s your lucky night.” Within the hour, he was back, brandishing a knife and requiring that all the cash on hand be turned over to him. Fearing for her life, the bartender complied. As she was handing Mr. Guignard the money (approx. $1,200), he told her to “take a good look at my face”. He left after warning the bartender not to call the police for another ten minutes.[5]Information obtained in the robbery’s immediate aftermath quickly led police investigators to Mr. Guignard’s doorstep. However, they shied away from an arrest at that time because Mr. Guignard did not fit the description provided by the bartender. They subsequently discovered that this was so because Mr. Guignard had shaved his head upon his return home following the robbery, a short time before their attendance at his residence.[6]Most of the stolen money was never recovered.[7]The bar owner filed a victim impact statement in which he pointed out that his loss was not covered by insurance and he reminded the sentencing judge of the risk of physical and psychological harm to the bartender posed by Mr. Guignard’s actions. The bar owner went on to add that Mr. Guignard’s crime was hampering his attempts at recruiting new employees.[8]In the court below, Mr. Guignard admitted to the following record of criminal convictions:Place of OffenceDate of SentenceChargeSentenceSaint John, NB08/28/2002CC 342(3)Restitution - $1,900.00Probation – 2 yearsSuspended SentenceSaint John, NB08/28/2002CC 145(5)Probation – 1 yearSuspended SentenceSaint John, NB08/28/2002CC 463(c)Probation – 2 yearsSuspended SentenceBeresford, NB03/22/2004CC 355(b)(ii)Fine - $500.00; Surcharge -$0.00Saint John, NB03/24/2004CC 253(b)Fine - $1,000.00; Surcharge -$150.00Prohibition – 1 year (Operatinga motor vehicle/aircraft/vessel/railway)Saint John, NB03/24/2004CC 145(2)Provincialjail – 10 days[9]As noted, Mr. Guignard pled guilty and the Crown joined with the Defence in recommending a sentence of imprisonment for terms totaling 33 months.[10]The sentencing judge allowed a 2:1 credit (3 months) for time served (1.5 months) and, as noted, sentenced Mr. Guignard to imprisonment for 45 months on the robbery charge.[11]As mentioned, counsel for the respondent takes the position that Mr. Guignard’s complaints are well founded. He joins Mr. Guignard in urging this Court to substitute the sentence jointly proposed by the parties for the one imposed in the lower court. For the reasons that follow, we decline that invitation.II.Analysis and DecisionA.The Standard of Review[12]The applicable standard is articulated in R. v. LeBlanc (G.A.) (2003), 2003 NBCA 75 (CanLII), 264 N.B.R. (2d) 341 (C.A.) at para. 17:A number of recent decisions including, among others, R. v. H.S.L. (2000), 2000 NBCA 54 (CanLII), 231 N.B.R. (2d) 358; 597 A.P.R. 358 (C.A.), at para. 28, R. v. Parent (D.) (2001), 2001 NBCA 60 (CanLII), 236 N.B.R. (2d) 370; 611 A.P.R. 370 (C.A.), at para. 8, R. v. R.P. (2001), 2001 NBCA 115 (CanLII), 245 N.B.R. (2d) 179; 636 A.P.R. 179 (C.A.), at para. 11, R. v. Daigle (M.), [2002] N.B.R. (2d) (Supp.) No. 4 (C.A.), at para. 8, R. v. Kerton (R.E.) et al. (2002), 2002 NBCA 40 (CanLII), 250 N.B.R. (2d) 177; 650 A.P.R. 177 (C.A.), at para. 25, and R. v. Kuriya (B.), 2003 NBCA 63 (CanLII), [2003] N.B.J. No. 336; 261 N.B.R. (2d) 153; 685 A.P.R. 153 (C.A.), at paras. 20-21, stand for the proposition that intervention on appeal against sentence is inappropriate unless at least one of the following questions is answered affirmatively: (1) Is the sentence the result of an error of law? (2) Did the sentencing judge err in principle in the exercise of his or her discretion? (3) Is the sentence clearly unreasonable having regard to the fundamental purpose and objectives of sentencing (s. 718), as well as the principles enunciated in sections 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code?[13]In our view, none of those questions can be answered affirmatively in the case at bar.B.Premeditation[14]The sentencing judge found the robbery had been premeditated. Both Mr. Guignard and counsel for the Crown take issue with that finding, contending it is without evidentiary foundation. We do not share that view.[15]In our judgment, the primary facts set out above fully justify the inference that Mr. Guignard planned the robbery beforehand. It follows that the sentencing judge did not commit reversible error in making the impugned finding of premeditation.[16]Spur of the moment decisions to steal while armed with a weapon must be rare indeed. The uncontested facts of the present case argue with such compelling force in favor of premeditation that we are at a loss to understand the objection of counsel for the respondent to the sentencing judge’s finding on point.C.The Joint Recommendation[17]In R. v. LeBlanc (G.A.), at para. 23, the Court recognized that joint recommendations on sentence “provide important guidance and carry considerable weight.” Joint recommendations express the views of those charged with the primary responsibility of furthering the best interests of the accused and those of society as a whole during the sentencing process. As such, those recommendations, while not legally binding, deserve serious consideration and ought not to be disregarded lightly by sentencing judges.[18]In our view, a joint recommendation on sentence should be followed unless it is unreasonable. In that regard, we endorse the views of Fish, J.A. (as he then was) in R. v. Douglas (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 37 (Qc.C.A.) at paras. 42-43 and 51:Canadian appellate courts have expressed in different ways the standard for determining when trial judges may properly reject joint submissions on sentence accompanied by negotiated admissions of guilt.Whatever the language used, the standard is meant to be an exacting one. Appellate courts, increasingly in recent years, have stated time and again that trial judges should not reject jointly proposed sentences unless they are “unreasonable”, “contrary to the public interest”, “unfit”, or “would bring the administration of justice into disrepute”.[...]In my view, a reasonable joint submission cannot be said to “bring the administration of justice into disrepute”. An unreasonable joint submission, on the other hand, is surely “contrary to the public interest”. Accordingly, though it is purposively framed in striking and evocative terms, I do not believe that the Ontario standard departs substantially from the test of reasonableness articulated by other courts, including our own. [R. v. Proulx, [2001] Q.J. No. 1485 (QL) (Que. C.A.).] Their shared conceptual foundation is that the interests of justice are well served by the acceptance of a joint submission on sentence accompanied by a negotiated plea of guilty -- provided, of course, that the sentence jointly proposed falls within the acceptable range and the plea is warranted by the facts admitted.[19]In the case at bar, the sentencing judge concluded that the parties’ joint recommendation called for the imposition of an unreasonable sentence. He came to that view having regard to several aggravating circumstances, including the fact that Mr. Guignard’s actions were premeditated, that those actions placed the bartender’s life at risk, that most of the loot was not recovered, that Mr. Guignard was on probation at the time of the robbery and that his record of prior criminal offences points to a troubling disinclination to abide by the law.[20]The judge also concluded - rightly in our view - that those aggravating circumstances, viewed cumulatively, indicated that the recommendation in question strayed to an intolerable extent from the guidelines provided by this Court in a number of decisions dealing with the subject of fit sentences for robbery. These include R. v. Matthews (1983), 45 N.B.R. (2d) 265 (C.A.), R. v. Basque (G.) (1999), 1999 CanLII 9448 (NB CA), 211 N.B.R. (2d) 273 (C.A.) and R. v. Baldwin (M.) (2000), 2000 CanLII 20398 (NB CA), 232 N.B.R. (2d) 240 (C.A.). We point out that in Basque the term of imprisonment imposed in the first instance (2 years) was not challenged on appeal. That clearly emerges from paragraph 3 of the Court’s reasons for judgment. The only issue requiring adjudication in Basque was whether the 2-year term of imprisonment should be served in the community or in jail. We emphasize that the Court did not give its imprimatur to the term of imprisonment imposed in that case.[21]We are in full agreement with the reasons given by the sentencing judge to explain his decision not to follow the parties’ joint recommendation on sentence.III.Disposition[22]For the reasons outlined above, the appeal against sentence is dismissed. While that decision disposes of the matter before the Court, we think it appropriate to add the following.[23]Whenever an appeal against sentence is taken on the ground that the sentencing judge committed reversible error in not giving effect to a joint recommendation on sentence, we question whether counsel who concurred in the recommendation on behalf of the Crown should act as counsel for the Attorney-General on the application for leave to appeal and the appeal. Counsel for the Attorney-General needs to focus on the following issue: Did the sentencing judge commit reversible error in disregarding the joint recommendation?Assuming the sentencing judge applied the standard articulated in these reasons, that issue will be resolved by answering the following question: Did the sentencing judge commit reversible error in concluding that the sentence jointly proposed fell outside the acceptable range? When counsel for the Attorney-General on appeal is the very Crown counsel whose recommendation was discarded by the sentencing judge as unreasonable, it is unlikely that he or she will take a dispassionately objective view of the merits of the appeal against sentence.____________________________________J.

exceptional circumstances.2The appellant, at all relevant times, was a 22-year-old student from Ghana attending Brandon University.On December 4, 2000 he pled guilty to one count of possess weapon dangerous to the public peace, one count of uttering threats, and one of forcible confinement.On behalf of the appellant the Provincial Court was urged to consider a conditional discharge.Instead the judge imposed a conditional sentence of 12 months on each count to be served concurrently.The conditions of sentence were extensive and strict.3This is not the kind of sentence which would normally invite appellate intervention or, perhaps, even prompt an appeal.It is the special, almost bizarre, circumstances that led this court to the unanimous conclusion that the trial judge erred in saying:“It’s my view that a conditional discharge in any form is not available for a crime of this magnitude.It is contrary to the public interest.”4The appeal was allowed from the bench.A conditional discharge was ordered accompanied by a two-year probation order.The probation order was identical to that attached to the original conditional sentence.5Following are the brief written reasons which the court undertook to deliver.6On September 28, 1999 the appellant was living in the student residence at Brandon University.He came to this country under a policy endorsed by Brandon University and the government of Ghana.He had been in Canada for only three weeks.That day he received a devastating e-mail message from his home in Ghana advising him that ten of his friends, including relatives, had been killed.Although this news subsequently turned out to be false, it shattered the appellant’s emotions and caused him to feel personally guilty for what was alleged to have happened back home.He went to the student lounge where he began to drink excessively until he was very intoxicated.There is no suggestion that this was typical behaviour for him.7The appellant, at some point, attended to the room of a friend where he apparently planned to kill himself.In his impaired state he also decided that he wanted to say farewell to other persons whom he had come to know.8There is no point going into detail as to how the group of students ended up in one room or about every detail of what happened.What is important to know is that the appellant became angry and irrational.He has little recollection and offers no justification for what happened.9He refused to allow the complainants to leave.He continued to speak of killing himself and eventually picked up some knives which he held to his own chest and also made threats towards the female complainants.Fortunately, before anything more violent occurred, the police arrived and the appellant was taken to the Brandon General Hospital.10There is no doubt that the incident briefly described was terrifying or that it traumatized the complainants as they described in their victim impact statements.11Neither is there any denial that the appellant’s behaviour was completely out of character.He has no criminal record of any kind in Canada or in his homeland, and the many favourable letters of reference that were tendered to the court describe an intelligent, ambitious, socially well-adjusted young man with a promising future.The trial judge was generally aware of these mitigating factors.However, he did indicate at the beginning of the hearing that he had “looked over the documents” but “I can’t say that I’ve been over them carefully.I simply haven’t had the time.”Another mitigating factor of which the judge was aware but appears to have been emphasized more in this court was the effect of the entry of a conviction upon his immigration status.12Mr. Simmonds, counsel for the appellant, assured the court that his client had a student visa only, that he was definitely not a landed immigrant, and that immigration authorities had confirmed that if a conviction for an indictable offence is entered, there will be no option but to deport the appellant.The significance of the conditional discharge is that under sec. 730(3) of the Criminal Code it is stipulated that if a court orders that an offender be discharged, that offender shall be deemed not to have been convicted of the offence.The importance of this difference is abundantly clear.13In dealing with this sentence appeal we are, in fact, determining whether the appellant, with his fine past and promising future, and notwithstanding his genuine remorse, is going to have his prospects for a useful and successful future substantially curtailed.14We must, of course, do this without ignoring the seriousness of the offences which bring him before the Canadian courts.15There is no purpose to an extensive review of the authorities that were cited, nor do we ignore the respect to which a trial judge is entitled in the exercise of his discretion.Nonetheless, we believe that no more need be said than to express our view that the trial judge failed to take into account all of the circumstances pertaining to the appellant and that he imposed a sentence that was unduly harsh.__________________________ J.A.I

Ratushny of the Superior Court of Justice dated April 4, 2005.E N D O R S E M E N T[1]We are satisfied that the trial judge did not misapprehend the facts.However, in our view, the trial judge erred in principle in two respects.[2]First, the trial judge held that the appellant’s plea to manslaughter fully accounted for the mitigating effect of the appellant’s intoxication at the time of the offence.We agree with Ms. Wheeler and Mr. Goddard that this holding is inconsistent with the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Stone, 1999 CanLII 688 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290.[3]Second, the trial judge erred in failing to give adequate weight to the appellant’s aboriginal status in accordance with s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code and the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688 and R. v. Wells, 2000 SCC 10 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 207.Although the appellant, like many native offenders, does not reside on a reserve, the principles enunciated in those cases apply.See Gladue at paras. 90 and 91.The court is required to take judicial notice of the systemic and background factors and the approach to sentencing that is relevant to aboriginal offenders.See Gladue at para. 83.In any event, we note that the appellant’s background of verbal, physical and emotional abuse at the hands of his stepfather and his own early abuse of alcohol and drugs is consistent with the systemic conditions that have plagued the First Nations’ people.[4]Finally, the restorative approach need not take place within or be specific to the aboriginal community.See Gladue at para. 92.There is the kind of plan in place contemplated by Gladue that will assist the appellant with his treatment for substance abuse and to upgrade his education so that he may obtain employment.[5]While this was a very grave offence, the appellant, who was heavily intoxicated, was only a party to the offence and did not administer any of the fatal blows.The appellant has no prior record for crimes of violence and his longest prior sentence of imprisonment was four months in 1999.[6]Accordingly, we would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and reduce the sentence to fifteen months imprisonment.In addition to the credit of three years and nine months for pre-sentence custody this is an effective sentence of five years imprisonment.[7]The appellant will also be placed on probation for twelve months on the statutory terms and on condition that upon release he report within two working days to a probation officer at Brockville and thereafter as required for the purpose of facilitating his attendance at Brock Cottage and attendance at Algonquin College.The person releasing the appellant will comply with the provisions of s. 732.1(5) of the Criminal Code.Signed:“M.

Wilson, 2016 ONCA 888DATE: 20161123DOCKET: C62773Sharpe, van Rensburg and Pardu JJ.A.BETWEENHer Majesty the QueenRespondentandRichard WilsonAppellantMarianne Salih, for the appellantPhilippe Cowle, for the respondentHeard and released orally: November 21, 2016On appeal from the sentence imposed on May 12, 2016 by Justice P.B. Hambly of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without a jury.ENDORSEMENT[1]This is a sentence appeal. The appellant was convicted after a guilty plea of fraud over $5,000 when, as a bank employee, he disclosed personal financial information of bank clients to third party fraudsters, causing a loss of $500,000 to the bank and its exposure to civil liability of over $3 million. The appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years less a day and a DNA order was imposed.[2]The appellant seeks a conditional sentence of the same length. A conditional sentence is available because the offence was committed before the amendments to the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, removing that option for fraud over $5,000. In the alternative, he seeks a reduction of his sentence to 18 months.[3]The appellant also seeks to set aside the DNA order made by the sentencing judge.[4]The appellant makes three arguments on appeal. He also seeks to introduce fresh evidence on his appeal.[5]First, the appellant says that the sentencing judge, in refusing a conditional sentence, failed to give effect to mitigating factors. We disagree. The sentencing judge took into account the mitigating factors of the appellant’s age, his drug addiction at the time of the offence and his completion of a drug rehabilitation program before sentencing, the absence of a criminal record and the appellant’s strong support from his family and friends.[6]As the sentencing judge noted, the appellant pleaded guilty in the face of overwhelming evidence. His plea occurred after a preliminary inquiry and a voluntariness voir dire. In these circumstances, the guilty plea would not have been a significant mitigating factor. In any event, there is nothing in the reasons or sentence itself to suggest the guilty plea was ignored by the sentencing judge.[7]As for the suggestion that the appellant was entitled to a conditional sentence because he did not benefit from the fraud, in the initial investigation by his employer, the appellant claimed his fraud had been motivated by threats to his girlfriend’s safety, while he advised the author of the pre-sentence report that the fraud was to pay off his drug debts. The sentencing judge, based on his factual findings, rejected the appellant’s “girlfriend” story. In any event, he did not treat greed as an aggravating factor. Nevertheless, he accepted the role of the appellant’s drug addiction in the fraud and took that into account.[8]The primary sentencing objectives for this offence are general deterrence and denunciation. It is only when there are exceptional mitigating circumstances that a significant fraud with breach of trust would warrant a conditional sentence. No such circumstances existed here. Accordingly, we reject this ground of appeal.[9]Second, the appellant says the sentencing judge gave insufficient reasons to explain the sentence. His focus, however, is on the judge’s rejection of the “girlfriend” story.[10]The reasons for sentence were entirely sufficient and clear. There was no evidence to support what the appellant initially said to his employer, which was contradicted by his own account to the probation officer. The sentencing judge was entitled to regard the explanation as “preposterous”, having regard to the appellant’s inability to provide any information about the girlfriend’s current whereabouts. This ground of appeal is therefore rejected.[11]The fresh evidence confirms that the appellant has successfully completed a substance use program and a harm reduction workshop offered by Correctional Services, and has earned a high school level four credit. While the appellant is to be commended for pursuing these courses and continuing his efforts toward rehabilitation, they have no material effect on his sentence.[12]This was a large scale fraud that attracted a significant sentence. It had a serious financial impact on the bank and the theft of customer identities affected numerous bank clients. All relevant factors were taken into consideration in imposing a sentence of two years less a day in prison. The sentence reveals no errors. But for the mitigating factors, a penitentiary sentence would have been justified.[13]Finally, we would not interfere with the decision to impose a DNA order. This was within the discretion of the sentencing judge, who gave reasons for the order. Having rejected the defence contention that the appellant posed no risk of reoffending, the sentencing judge properly considered that the DNA order might well deter the appellant in the future and that DNA evidence could be used in his apprehension. There is no reason to interfere with this discretionary order.[14]For these reasons, leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal is dismissed.“Robert J. Sharpe J.A.”“K. van Rensburg J.A.”“G.

L.M., 2008 SCC 31 (CanLII): absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit.[14]The only matter relating to the facts that requires comment arises from the Appellant’s submission that the sentencing judge found or assumed that he had hit T. with the golf club hard enough for the head of the club to fly off.[15]At the sentencing hearing, Crown counsel initially read in as facts that the victim was awakened by the Appellant beating him with a golf club and that almost a week later the victim gave the police the head of a golf club that he claimed to have found in his room.The police believed the head to belong to the club the Appellant beat the victim with.[16]Defence counsel told the sentencing judge that the Appellant admitted that he hit the victim twice with the golf club, one more time with the handle and then with his hands.Crown counsel accepted those facts.However, even though it was not in the facts read in or agreed to, Crown counsel said in her submissions on sentence that the Appellant swung and hit the victim so hard with the golf club that the head of the club came off.Although the Appellant’s admission that he hit the victim with the golf club and then with the handle might lead to the inference that at some point during the beating the head had come off, to say that the head coming off was caused by the Appellant swinging the club and hitting the victim went well beyond the facts put before the sentencing judge.[17]The sentencing judge did not, however, take up Crown counsel’s suggestion that the Appellant hit the victim so hard that the head of the club came off.She stated that “whether some of the hits were with the golf club, some of the hits were with the handle, some of the hits were with your hands, it really does not make that much difference in the grand scheme of things”.There is no indication that the sentencing judge accepted that the Appellant had hit so hard with the club that the head came off or treated that as an aggravating factor.[18]The sentencing judge found that although the total sentence sought by the Crown was not outside the usual range, that might not be appropriate for a first offender.She considered whether a community based sentence would be appropriate, but ruled it out because absent any indication that the Appellant had brought himself under control, she was of the view that the community would be endangered.[19]The mitigating factors are the guilty plea, the lack of a criminal record and the Appellant’s relative youthfulness.[20]It is an aggravating factor that the Appellant attacked T. while he was in his own home, asleep.It is also an aggravating factor that after being released on a recognizance for the assault with a weapon and while awaiting trial, less than three months later the Appellant committed the second assault, which in itself involved two separate attacks on one individual.Neither this nor the earlier assault with a weapon was minor; both involved considerable violence. While the breaches of recognizance did not involve violence or threats, the breach involving C. was particularly blatant in that it was not brief contact.[21]Although there were some positive aspects to the pre-sentence report, the author of the report noted that while the Appellant took responsibility, he expressed no remorse for the assault with a weapon.There is no reference in the report to the second assault so it is unclear whether the author was aware of it.[22]The sentencing judge considered both the mitigating and the aggravating factors.She did not fail to consider anything relevant, nor did she overemphasize any factor.[23]Sentences for non-sexual assaults are very fact-specific.In this case, on balancing the seriousness of the offences and the mitigating and aggravating factors, a ten month term of incarceration is not outside the range of sentences for this type of violent behaviour.The term of probation imposed was appropriately intended to assist in the Appellant’s rehabilitation by including a clause for counselling and programs to address anger management.The sentence as a whole addresses rehabilitation as well as denunciation and deterrence.[24]The Appellant says that the sentence has had and will have a negative effect on some other aspects of his life, in particular his plans for a career in the military.It is clear to me from the Appellant’s very thorough submissions, that since being sentenced he has given a great deal of thought to his situation and the impact on his life of the offences he committed.That is to his credit.That being said, however, the information provided to the sentencing judge was less definite than the Appellant’s assertion on the appeal that he was in the process of entering the armed forces.The pre-sentence report indicates that although he took training in 2009, he declined the position he was offered with the military; his counsel’s submissions on sentence referred to a number of different employment options the Appellant was considering.The sentencing judge did not ignore the Appellant’s plans, as he submits, in that his plans were uncertain.[25]Even if the Appellant has decided since then that entering the military is the way to go, that is not a factor that can now affect the sentence that was imposed by the sentencing judge.It does not make the sentence unfit.Nor is the length of time before the Appellant might be granted a pardon an appropriate consideration.[26]In all the circumstances, the sentences imposed are not unfit and the appeal from sentence is therefore dismissed.V.A.

(N.W.)))Judgmentdelivered:(YoungPerson, Accused) Appellant)September 5,2008MONNIN J.A.1This is an appeal from a sentence imposed under the provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (the Act) following a plea of guilty to a charge of first degree murder.2The sentence imposed on the accused was the maximum sentence prescribed under the Act, namely one of ten years, of which the first six years were to be served in custody to be followed by four years to be served under supervision in the community.3The accused, who spent 238 days in custody prior to his plea and imposition of sentence, appeals on the basis that under the provisions of s. 38(3) of the Act, he should have received a credit for his pre-disposition detention and therefore the custody portion of his sentence should have been less than the six years imposed.That section reads:Factors to be considered(3) In determining a youth sentence, the youth justice court shall take into account.....(d) the time spent in detention by the young person as a result of the offence;.....4The plea and sentence came about as a result of a joint recommendation that the accused not be transferred to adult court and that a ten-year sentence be imposed.The joint recommendation, however, was unclear as to how that ten-year period was to be broken down.The Crown argued that notwithstanding the provisions of s. 38(3) of the Act, the sentence should be one of six years’ custody, whilst the accused argued that the time served should be deducted from that period.5In imposing his sentence, the sentencing judge said:The young offender has spent time in detention and that time should be acknowledged.I do so now but I do not give that time any extra credit.….I do not think that time in detention should result in less time in custody because of the circumstances of the offence and the consequences of the offence.6The sentence to be imposed for first degree murder is set out in s. 42(2)(q) and (r) of the Act.The section provides:Youth sentence(2) When a youth justice court finds a young person guilty of an offence and is imposing a youth sentence, the court shall, subject to this section, impose any one of the following sanctions or any number of them that are not inconsistent with each other and, if the offence is first degree murder or second degree murder within the meaning of section 231 of the Criminal Code, the court shall impose a sanction set out in paragraph (q) or subparagraph (r)(ii) or (iii) and may impose any other of the sanctions set out in this subsection that the court considers appropriate:.....(q) order the young person to serve a sentence not to exceed(i) in the case of first degree murder, ten years comprised of(A) a committal to custody, to be served continuously, for a period that must not, subject to subsection 104(1) (continuation of custody), exceed six years from the date of committal, and(B) a placement under conditional supervision to be served in the community in accordance with section 105, and.....(r) subject to subsection (7), make an intensive rehabilitative custody and supervision order in respect of the young person(i) that is for a specified period that must not exceed(A) two years from the date of committal, or(B) if the young person is found guilty of an offence for which the punishment provided by the Criminal Code or any other Act of Parliament is imprisonment for life, three years from the date of committal,and that orders the young person to be committed into a continuous period of intensive rehabilitative custody for the first portion of the sentence and, subject to subsection 104(1) (continuation of custody), to serve the remainder under conditional supervision in the community in accordance with section 105,(ii) that is for a specified period that must not exceed, in the case of first degree murder, ten years from the date of committal, comprising(A) a committal to intensive rehabilitative custody, to be served continuously, for a period that must not exceed six years from the date of committal, and(B) subject to subsection 104(1) (continuation of custody), a placement under conditional supervision to be served in the community in accordance with section 105, …7In arguing that he should have received a credit for time in custody, the accused relies on R. v. K.E.J.L., 2006 MBCA 120 (CanLII), 208 Man.R. (2d) 185, and R. v. K.C., 2007 MBCA 117 (CanLII), 220 Man.R. (2d) 191, two decisions from this court.As well, he relies on R. v. B. (T.) (2006), 2006 CanLII 4487 (ON CA), 78 O.R. (3d) 721 (C.A.), a decision referred to with approval in R. v. K.E.J.L., and a recent decision from the British Columbia Supreme Court, R. v. Van Buskirk, 2007 BCSC 1924 (CanLII), which also relied on R. v. B. (T.).8The Crown’s reply to the accused’s argument is that the consideration of the time in custody requirement under s. 38(3) of the Act is but one of the factors to be considered under all of the provisions of s. 38 and that such a requirement is to be given no preferred status over other sections of the Act.9Cases subsequent to those relied upon by the accused would seem to give credence to the Crown’s argument.10The most recent of those decisions is from the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. B. (D.), 2008 SCC 25 (CanLII), 231 C.C.C. (3d) 338.Although the case does not speak directly to the issue before us, there appears to be a tacit acceptance by all members of the court, whether in the majority or the minority, that a youth justice court judge may impose the maximum sentence even when the offender had already spent significant time in pre-sentence custody.The Supreme Court of Canada upheld the sentencing judge’s decision, which stated (at para. 14):You are to be the subject of an intensive rehabilitative custody and supervision order for a period of three years, and committed into a continuous period of intensive rehabilitative custody for a period of thirty months and serve the remainder of the sentence under conditional supervision in the community in accordance with s. 105 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.In my view the maximum period of a youth sentence is necessary to achieve the desired ends of the rehabilitation programme, and for that reason I have not given credit for the one year period of pre-trial custody.11It also appears that the Ontario Court of Appeal has altered its approach to this issue following its decision in R. v. B. (T.).In R. v. E.L. (2006), 2006 CanLII 12290 (ON CA), 210 O.A.C. 124, a 17-year-old offender pled guilty to first degree murder and to using a firearm during the commission of an indictable offence.Based on counsel’s joint recommendation, the youth justice court judge sentenced the accused to six years’ closed custody and two years’ community supervision on the murder charge and 14 months’ closed custody and seven months’ community supervision on the weapons charge.In imposing these sentences, the youth justice court judge gave the accused three months’ credit for the 17.5 months he spent in pre-sentence detention.On appeal, the accused argued that the youth justice court judge erred by failing to give him credit for all of the time he spent in pre-sentence detention.The court rejected that argument, saying (at paras. 9-10):….In our view, properly read, this court’s decision in T.B. confirms that s. 38(3)(d) obliges a youth justice court in all cases to take the time spent in detention by a young person as a result of the offence in issue into account in fashioning a sentence.This does not mean, however, that in taking such detention into account, the youth justice court does not have discretion to determine the appropriate credit to be given.T.B. recognizes that it is only in an exceptional case, such as this one, where a court should exercise that discretion to reduce the credit given below one to one.In light of the joint submission in this case and the extensive negotiations concerning the rehabilitative needs of the appellant, we are satisfied that the youth court justice made no error and that the sentence imposed is fit. ….12That same court reached a similar result in R. v. Ferriman, 2007 ONCA 710 (CanLII).In that case, the accused was found guilty of manslaughter.He was sentenced as an adult; the sentence imposed was two years less a day incarceration and three years of probation.The accused spent three years in pre-sentence detention.The accused sought to have his sentence reduced to one year in light of his lengthy pre-sentence detention.The court stated (at para. 8):Finally, we see no merit in the submission that the trial judge erred in failing to give enhanced credit for pre-trial custody.…. The trial judge looked at all the circumstances and fashioned a sentence that was appropriate, including allowing the appellant to remain in a provincial youth facility.13Most recently, the Ontario Court of Appeal again addressed this issue in R. v. D.W., 2008 ONCA 268 (CanLII).The case involved the offence of second degree murder.Because he thought he had to deduct the time the accused spent in pre-sentence detention, the sentencing judge chose to sentence the accused as an adult rather than as a youth.The Ontario Court of Appeal held that this was an error.The court stated (at paras. 2-3):In concluding that a youth sentence would not sufficiently hold the appellant accountable for his admittedly heinous offence, the trial judge determined that he was required to give the appellant full credit for the two and a half years he had already spent in pre-trial custody.The trial judge then concluded that a further eighteen months in custody would neither hold the appellant sufficiently accountable nor promote his rehabilitation.The trial judge’s approach was in error because although he was required to take pre-trial custody into account, he was not required to directly deduct the time spent in pre-trial custody.Instead, the trial judge had broad discretion to take pre-trial custody into account as a consideration in deciding whether the appellant would serve a youth or an adult sentence.14In the result, the court allowed the appeal, set aside the original sentence and instead imposed the maximum youth sentence for second degree murder, without any additional credit for the two-and-a-half years the accused spent in pre-sentence detention.15Another recent appellate judgment on this issue, consistent with this more recent trend in the Ontario jurisprudence, was rendered by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in R. v. L. (J.R.), 2007 NSCA 62 (CanLII), 221 C.C.C. (3d) 278.In that case, the accused pled guilty to several offences arising out of a violent home invasion.He was sentenced to six months’ deferred custody and 18 months’ probation.He also spent 16 days in pre-sentence detention.It was therefore argued that “since JRL served 16 days in pre-sentence custody a six month deferred custody order was not permitted.Pre-trial custody has to be taken into account and if it had been in this case, the maximum period of deferred custody was exceeded” (at para. 23).As further explained, the Crown argued that “since credit must be given for the 16 days spent on remand, the sentence was, in effect, six months and 16 days, which is illegal” (at para. 41).In reaching its decision, the court noted the contrast between R. v. B. (T.) and R. v. E.L.It chose not to follow R. v. B. (T.).Roscoe J.A. stated (at paras. 47-48):…. In my view, the time spent in pre-sentence detention can be “taken into account” without expressly giving specific credit for time served by deducting the number of days or some ratio of that number from the number of days of a custodial sentence.When the sentence imposed is not a custodial sentence to be served in an institution, taking the remand time into account does not necessarily have to result in a deduction in the length of sentence.It can be taken into account by reducing the type or severity of the sentence.Although the judge in this case erred in principle because he did not specifically take the remand period into account, given the brevity of the remand, it is not an error that should necessarily cause a change of disposition if the sentence is otherwise fit. …. To deduct the 16 days from the six month deferred custody portion of the sentence would make little sense at this point, now that it has been completely served.16Another decision that appears to follow the Ontario Court of Appeal’s more recent treatment of this issue is that of R. v. B. (L.A.), 2007 ONCJ 538 (CanLII).In that case, the 14-year-old accused pled guilty to second degree murder.The accused spent close to two years in pre-sentence detention.As noted, “both the Crown and defence jointly submit that should L.A.B. be sentenced as a youth, the sentence imposed should be the maximum sentence available for a youth found guilty of second degree murder in addition to pre-trial custody” (at para. 62).Watson J. held as follows (at para. 73):The maximum sentence of seven years is the most serious punishment provided by law for the offence of second degree murder committed by one who is to be treated as a youth.I have taken the time spent in pre-trial detention into consideration in determining the section 72 issue as a factor in my conclusion that the maximum youth sentence would be sufficient to hold L.A.B. accountable.… I need not take it into account again in determining the length of the youth sentence to be imposed.17There is one further area that merits consideration and that is from cases decided under the Criminal Code itself.In R. v. S. J. L., 2005 BCSC 177 (CanLII), Bouck J. held that “[t]he Criminal Code cases are helpful in deciding how Youth Court judges should determine whether the offender should get credit for their pre-trial detention and how a judge should calculate that credit” (at para. 48).Indeed the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. B. (T.) relied on R. v. Wust, 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455, and R. v. Fice, 2005 SCC 32 (CanLII), [2005] 1 S.C.R. 742 to reach their decision.One such recent case is that of R. v. Mathieu; R. v. St-Germain; R. v. Jin; R. v. Monière, 2008 SCC 21 (CanLII), 231 C.C.C. (3d) 1.18Fish J., writing for a unanimous court, set out the issue to be addressed in that appeal in these words (at para. 1):The question on which these four appeals turn is whether a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years is exactly that – a sentence of less than two years – within the meaning of the Criminal Code even where the judge would have imposed a penitentiary term but for the offender’s pre-sentence custody (sometimes referred to as “pre-trial custody”).19The court answered this question in the affirmative.In the four cases on appeal, the offenders had all spent significant amounts of time in pre-sentence custody.For this reason, the judges imposed custodial sentences of less than two years; but for the pre-sentence custody, the judges would all have imposed penitentiary terms.The issue was whether the judges were allowed to make the probation orders that they did.As Fish J. summarized, “[i]n short, I find that the term of imprisonment in each case is the term imposed by the judge at the time of sentence.The offender’s prior detention is merely one factor taken into account by the judge in determining that sentence” (at para. 6).Importantly, Fish J. characterized the court’s prior decisions in Wust and Fice as exceptions (at para. 7):Although it is possible, on an exceptional basis, to treat the time spent in pre-sentence custody as part of the term of imprisonment imposed at the time of sentence – in the context of a minimum sentence, for example, or of a conditional sentence – these are exceptions that prove the rule.As to minimum sentences, see R. v. Wust, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455, 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 129, 184 D.L.R. (4th) 385; regarding conditional sentences, see R. v. Fice, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 742, 2005 SCC 32 (CanLII), 196 C.C.C. (3d) 97, 252 D.L.R. (4th) 575.20Fish J. noted that “[i]n virtue of s. 719(4), a term of imprisonment commences ‘on the day on which the convicted person is arrested and taken into custody under the sentence’.….Pre-sentence custody can thus hardly form part of a sentence that has not yet commenced” (at para. 14).21And further (at para. 19):Manifestly, the words “imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years” used by Parliament in s. 731(1)(b) refer to the custodial term imposed at the time of sentence – the actual term of imprisonment imposed by the court after taking into account any time spent in pre-sentence custody.22It is therefore conceivable, in my view, that these recent comments by the Supreme Court of Canada also call into question the holding of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. B. (T.), which relied on both Wust and Fice.23On the basis of the cases to which I have referred, I am unable to conclude that the sentencing judge erred when he declined to grant the accused any credit for the time he served in pre-sentence detention.Those cases lead to the inescapable conclusion that a sentencing judge must consider the time spent in detention in determining an appropriate sentence – which he did – but that he is not bound to, especially in cases where the maximum sentence or near maximum sentence is imposed, give any credit to an accused for that time spent in detention – which is what the judge did in this case.24Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.J.A.I agree:C.J.M.I agree:J.A."}

Teed, Q.C. for the AppellantJohn A. Henheffer, Esq. for the RespondentBY THE COURTThe appeal against conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence is granted and the appeal against sentence is allowed. The following sentence is substituted for the sentence imposed by the trial Judge: the imposition of sentence is suspended, the appellant will be released on-the same conditions prescribed in the probation order, the forfeiture order is modified and the prohibition order is quashed.Hoyt, C.J.N.B., dissenting in part, would have dismissed the appeal against the sentence of imprisonment and would have upheld the prohibition order.ANGERS, J.A.The appellant pleaded guilty to the indictable offence of assault causing bodily harm. At a later date, he also admitted his guilt to the summary conviction offence of using a firearm without reasonable precautions for the safety of others. Following a sentence hearing on both convictions, the judge imposed the following sentences:-for the assault: 8 months incarceration, probation for three years with conditions that he report to a probation officer, refrain from being in possession of any firearm and to attend such clinics for alcohol rehabilitation as deemed advisable by the probation officer and finally, pursuant to s.100 of the Criminal Code, an order prohibiting him from possessing any firearm or ammunition for a term of ten years and an order confiscating three firearms including the one used in the commission of the offence.-at the same time, he imposed a concurrent sentence of 4 months imprisonment for the summary conviction offence. That sentence was reduced to time served by a Judge of the Court of Queen's Bench sitting on appeal.Mr. Coughlin appeals from the conviction and seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed for the indictable offence.On the appeal from conviction for the offence of assault causing bodily harm, counsel for Coughlin argued that the intermingling of an indictable offence and a summary[Page 2]conviction offence in the sentencing process rendered the conviction for assault invalid. Counsel did not point out any authorities in direct support of this proposition.The two guilty pleas occurred at different times. The convictions were validly entered. There was one sentence hearing but two different sentences. The trial judge distinguished between both offences and did not confuse them. I would dismiss the appeal from conviction.Leave to appeal sentence is sought on the following grounds:1.I was not given an opportunity to speak on sentence to both charges.2.The trial judge erred in speculating on matters not before him which unduly and improperly effected the sentence.3.There was no legal justification for an order in forfeiting all my guns.4.The trial judge failed to distinguish between the information with two (2) counts, one (1) of which was withdrawn and the new information.5.The trial judge failed to take into consideration the mitigating circumstances of:i.the accused being a cripple (i.e., one leg);ii.the son badly beating up his father;iii.the son had been told to leave his father's battery alone.I would grant leave to appeal sentence.[Page 3]The judge found there had been \"growing antagonism\" between the appellant and his 20 year old son. On the day of the offence, Mr. Coughlin, who has only one leg, saw his son removing a battery from his [the father's] car. When the son did not stop as demanded, Mr. Coughlin went in the house and returned with a shotgun. He fired a shot in the ground to scare his son away from the car. The son ignored the warning, and continued to remove the battery.Mr. Coughlin then approached his son and struck him in the face with the butt of the shotgun breaking some teeth and cutting the inside of his mouth. The son took the gun away from his father and broke it. He then struck his father in the face several times. The two are now reconciled, and the son has moved away from home. At the time of these incidents, Mr. Coughlin was under the influence of alcohol. The father paid $3,000 for treatment to his son's teeth.In the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the sentence of eight months is excessive. The trial judge failed to consider certain mitigating factors. Particularly, the fact that the dispute had been going on for a while between the father and the son. The son was younger and stronger. The father paid for the medical and dental repairs. Moreover, the Crown did not prove that the son owned the battery so that in effect a weaker and crippled father was attempting to protect his property from a rebellious son. Thus, the judge should have considered that the guilt resulted from the use of excessive force in a defensive way, rather than force from an aggressive act.In fact, if the son had not attempted to take the battery from his father's car, or had heeded the warning shot, there would have been no injury and no criminal act by the[Page 4]father. The same factor applies for the alcohol. It just happened that Mr. Coughlin was under the influence of liquor when his son decided to take the battery.In my opinion, a person who creates a situation by his criminal conduct cannot be heard to complain if the victim overreacts and uses excessive force against him. That is also a factor to be considered by the judge who imposes a sentence on the user of excessive force.The appellant was previously convicted of two summary conviction offences of impaired driving, and one offence against the Excise Act involving tobacco. The trial judge, correctly, made no comment other than that there was no previous record of violence.In addition, the judge made an order of prohibition pursuant to s.100 (1) of the Code, prohibiting Mr. Coughlin from possessing any firearms or ammunition for the minimum period of ten years. Such an order, before the section was amended, was mandatory. Now the judge must consider the factors provided in ss.(1.1) (1.2) and (1.3). In order to do this, he must give the accused an opportunity to establish some of these factors. That opportunity was not given in this case. The order of prohibition must be quashed as having been made without jurisdiction.This latter point was not raised in the Notice of Appeal, but because it goes to jurisdiction it is proper to consider it on appeal. See Salhany, Canadian Criminal Procedure 6th Ed. (Aurora: Canada Law Book, 1994) at 9-37. Moreover, the Crown presented arguments on the point. See also Thibodeau v. Clavet (1975), 11 N.B.R. (2d) 32 (N.B.C.A.).[Page 5]Since, in this case, there is already in the probation order an order of prohibition with respect to firearms, and considering the circumstances, I would not make any order pursuant to s.100.The last ground of appeal involves the Order forfeiting to the Crown three firearms owned by Mr. Coughlin. The Order was made pursuant to s.491(1) of the Criminal Code. That section authorizes forfeiture of a weapon determined by a court to have been used \"in the commission of an offence\". In this case, only one firearm was used in the commission of an offence, the 12 gauge shotgun.Accordingly, I would set aside the order of forfeiture as it applies to the two .22 rifles. They may be returned to Mr. Coughlin upon the expiration of the probation order or be turned over to a person lawfully entitled to have a firearm as directed by Mr. Coughlin.For these reasons, I would allow the appeal from sentence, set aside the sentence of imprisonment and direct that the imposition of sentence be suspended. I would maintain the three years probation order and the forfeiture order for the 12 gauge shotgun. I would quash the order pursuant to s.100 of the Code and set aside the part of the forfeiture order which deals with the two .22 rifles.[S]J.-C. ANGERS, J.A.I CONCUR:[S]PATRICK A. A. RYAN, J.A.HOYT, C.J.N.B.I have read the decision of Mr. Justice Angers and I agree with him that the appeal from conviction should be dismissed and that the appeal against the forfeiture Order made under the provisions of s.491 of the Criminal Code of Canada be allowed. I would not, however, allow the appeal against the sentence of eight months imprisonment imposed by Cain, P.C.J. for assault contrary to s.267(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.Mr. Coughlin, who was drinking at the time of this incident, became involved in a dispute with his son over an automobile battery. According to the uncontradicted statement of facts made by Crown counsel at the sentencing hearing, the dispute occurred in the yard of Mr. Coughlin's home. Mr. Coughlin went into his house where he obtained a 12 gauge shotgun. He returned to the yard with the gun. He then loaded the gun, pointed it at his son and fired a shot \"at the ground a few feet\" from where his son was standing. When this effort to scare his son failed, Mr. Coughlin struck his son on the side of his face with the butt of the shotgun, breaking several teeth and causing a laceration inside his son's mouth.This is Mr. Coughlin's first conviction for an offence involving violence. He had, however, been convicted for three other offences in the previous four years. Two of the offences, like this incident, involved alcohol. In my view, the sentence of eight months imposed by the sentencing Judge was well within the range for this offence in the circumstances that existed here. The Judge's finding that the assault was premeditated is supported by the uncontradicted facts related by Crown counsel. Mr. Coughlin left the dispute to get a shotgun, returned with it, loaded it, pointed it at his son and then fired it a few feet from his son. He then struck him in the face with the butt of the gun. However much Mr. Coughlin's judgment may have been clouded by alcohol, it appears that he[Page 2]had no difficulty in executing his plan. No matter how much he believed himself to be in the right about the automobile battery, he cannot take the law into his own hands.I would also uphold the Judge's Order made under s.100(1) of the Criminal Code. The Order prohibits Mr. Coughlin from possessing a firearm or ammunition for ten years. Parenthetically, I would note that this issue was not raised in either Mr. Coughlin's Notice of Appeal or Submission. If an offence involves violence for which ten years or more imprisonment may be imposed, a s.100(1) order is mandatory, unless the accused can satisfy the judge that he or she is within the exemption created by s.100(1.1) of the Code.During the sentencing hearing, Crown counsel drew s.100 to the Court's attention and, although it was unnecessary to do so as the prohibition is mandatory, he asked for a firearm prohibition. Mr. Coughlin was thus specifically put on notice that such an order could be made. In spite of that, neither Mr. Coughlin nor his counsel, when they spoke, attempted to satisfy the Court that Mr. Coughlin should be exempted. I agree with Mr. Justice Angers that before a firearm prohibition is imposed, the accused must have an opportunity to satisfy the court that he falls within the exemption created by s.100(1.1). But when an accused, as happened here, does not take that opportunity, he cannot later complain.For the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeal against sentence.[S]CHIEF JUSTICE OF NEW BRUNSWICK"}

MATTEODefendant______________________________________________________________________SENTENCE______________________________________________________________________Introduction[1]On September 7th 2017, defendant Lino P. Matteo was found guilty of having contravened the Securities Act, namely sections 196 and 197[1], and section 202[2] with reference to section 208. That judgment should be considered as if recited at length in the present sentence.[2]An investigation followed the bankruptcy, in 2006, of Mount Real Corporation (MRC), whose chief executive officer was the defendant at the relevant period of 2000 to 2005.[3]Although the defendant attested that MRC’s financial statements complied with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the evidence showed beyond any doubt that the financial situation of MRC during that period could not have been as published in any of its financial statements. A great number of investors were attracted to a formidable but false performance.[4]The fact that MRC was conducted in total disregard of the applicable GAAP resulted in liabilities of $135 million including the investors’ promissory notes. The investors’ proof of claims totalled $108 million.[5]Following an application for a class action settlement order[3], the settling defendants have contributed the aggregate sum of $43,236,431 intended to compensate the class action members for their loss.[6]Lino Matteo is not one of the settling defendants. It is now 12 years that Mr. Matteo is before different courts and it is not over.[7]His conviction and sentence in what was called the Cinar case are pending before the Quebec Court of Appeal[4] and the notice of appeal of my judgment rendered on September 7th 2017 was filed on November 3rd 2017 in the Superior Court.[8]On June 22nd 2016[5], defendant was sentenced to serve 7 years and 11 months following his conviction by a jury on one count of having defrauded Cinar Corporation, four counts of forgery and four of uttering forged documents. Except for the count of fraud, the counts for which he was found guilty by a jury cover the period of December 1st 1997 to December 31st 2000.[9]The issues addressed in the present instance span from 2000 to 2005. Unlike the case of R. c. Lacroix[6], where Vincent Lacroix faced penal and criminal charges stemming from the same facts, the penal accusations here stem from facts that are different from the Cinar case and the period is also different.[10]In the decision mentioned above, the Honourable Richard Wagner, now sitting on the Supreme Court of Canada, dismissed a Requête en res judicata et en arrêt des procédures, whereby Vincent Lacroix argued that his conviction of the penal accusations prevented a criminal trial on the same facts. Although the Tribunal was of the opinion that Lacroix had established a sufficient factual link with some of the penal charges and the criminal ones, he had not established a sufficient legal link between the two legislations, namely the Criminal Code and the Securities Act.[11]In rejecting Lacroix’s motion, Judge Wagner also concluded that in some circumstances, which existed in that case, the same behaviour based on the same facts could attract different infractions and accusations.[12]He upheld the criminal charges to which Vincent Lacroix pleaded guilty a month after the decision. He imposed on Lacroix a sentence of 13 years to be served consecutively to that of 5 years less a day pronounced by the Court of Appeal following Lacroix’s successful sentence appeal of the decision rendered on January 28th 2008 by my colleague the honourable Claude Leblond.[13]Invoking section 241 of the Quebec Code of penal procedure, the AMF is seeking a sentence of 5 years less a day, consecutive to the one imposed by the Superior Court[7] on June 22nd 2016 along with multiple fines totalling close to $5 million for the defendant Lino P. Matteo.[14]Defendant is of the opinion that section 241 does not apply since he is not in detention presently, having been released by the Court of Appeal pending his conviction appeal in the Cinar case.[15]In releasing the defendant on December 13th 2016, the Honourable Nicholas Kasirer of the Court of Appeal said “that the immediate enforceability of the appellant’s conviction and sentence can legitimately yield to the temporary suspension of the sentence while conviction is under review before this court”.[16]The sentence pronounced in June 2016 is therefore temporarily suspended, not annulled. I conclude that defendant was sentenced for offences committed before the ones for which he was found guilty in September 2017. The present sentence can therefore be consecutive.Defendant’s position on sentence[17]Defendant is of the opinion that the minimum fine applicable in the year 2000 on each and every count should suffice in view of the delays it took for the prosecution and the different courts to bring his cases to an end. He would have suffered great prejudice since he was not allowed to work in his field of accounting.[18]It is to be noted that if defendant obtained his Certified Management Accounting designation in 1988, he lost it in 2008 when he was barred from the CMA’s Order. He also pleads that his compliance with the bail conditions he was imposed in the fraud case of Cinar should be considered as well in the present sentence.[19]He makes a parallel with the sentence of Guy Drouin[8], whereby the latter, following a 14‑month jury trial preceded by 2 years of preliminary motions, was found guilty and received a conditional sentence of 6 months.[20]When the representations on sentence were made in the Drouin case, the Honourable Johanne St-Gelais raised the now well-known decision of the Supreme Court in Jordan, stating that the fact that the prosecution had decided to reunite, in the same trial, multiple chapters of the same investigation, had, as a consequence, that certain accuseds were kept in the same trial when they were concerned with only part of the investigation.[21]During weeks and months, they attended court during the presentation of evidence that did not concern them, to such an extent that they were authorized to be absent considering the impact that such a situation had on them.[22]Judge St-Gelais also took into consideration the fact that elements of the investigation, although relevant, did not justify the presentation of such voluminous evidence.[23]This is not at all the same situation here. On June 26th 2017, I dismissed a motion for a stay of proceedings due to unreasonable delays filed by Laurence Henry, a co‑defendant of Matteo, and Matteo himself. In my decision, I found that the AMF had tailored its different prosecutions stemming from the Mount Real shutdown. As well, I found that there was no other way to present the evidence against the administrators of MRC without having to go through the extensive forensic analysis the experts had made, which meant having to go through the immense documentary evidence gathered during the investigation.Analysis[24]Reading the decision of my colleague Claude Leblond[9], who sentenced Vincent Lacroix on January 28th 2008, I was appalled at the similarities between the two cases. Adopting a controlling management, Lacroix, who was the head of different societies in the securities field and had a key role in the management of 27 investment vehicles, deprived investors of $115 million. He blamed everyone but himself and argued he had a plan that would have permitted the investors to recuperate the lost funds.[25]Lino Matteo, who was at the top of the Mount Real group, comprised of 88 different societies, is still convinced that had it not been for the intervention of the provisional administrator named by the Minister of Finance following a decision of the Commission des valeurs mobilières du Québec (CVMQ), MRC could have survived.[26]Despite the fact that defendant Matteo acknowledged the liabilities of MRC in an amount of $135 million[10], to this day, he still claims that the provisional administrator turned a “manageable situation into a disaster”. Like Lacroix, he had a plan to save MRC. Unfortunately, it was rejected by the investors and by the Superior Court.[27]In one of the judgments rendered in the context of Mount Real’s bankruptcy, the Honourable Jean-Yves Lalonde of the Superior Court had this to say concerning MRC’s relaunching plan[11]:Malgré l’enchevêtrement corporatif complexe, un seul homme décidait de tout, Lino P. Matteo. Mount Real était la pierre angulaire et le siège de toutes les décisions. C’est elle qui avait la maîtrise de l’administration des biens de toutes ses filiales. Celles-ci ne peuvent aujourd’hui prétendre à leur autonomie et leur indépendance afin de soustraire de la faillite de Mount Real des biens sur lesquels elles n’ont jamais eu de pouvoir.Et plus important encore, dans le cas de Sterling Services, les bons de commande (Purchase Orders) ne furent que des conventions d’accommodation dont les signataires (Klein et Clément) ne connaissaient aucune modalité. Tout cela n’est que fumisterie, tromperie et manigance ourdie par des gens perfides et sans vergogne au mépris flagrant d’investisseurs, dont on a abusé de la confiance. Le droit du Québec n’accepte pas cette manière de faire des affaires.[28]Like Vincent Lacroix, defendant Matteo blames the prosecution and the experts who, according to him, failed to understand the business model and structure of MRC.[29]In my judgment, I said that what the witnesses described went beyond mere negligence or mismanagement. As in the Lacroix case, it contained all the elements of a premeditated and deliberate fraud in which Lino P. Matteo played a key role, showing total disregard not only for the applicable principles but for everyone who dared to slow down his ambitions. In that sense, his moral blameworthiness is at the highest level.[30]The example I cited in my judgment[12] concerning the MRAC transaction is only one amongst many examples of Lino Matteo’s ways. What his interlocutors in the Bahamas considered of utmost importance in order to conduct a transaction of this importance was, to Mr. Matteo, sheer ‘’stupidity’’ he did not have time to deal with.[31]And we have to conclude that he had no time to deal with the difficulties his employees had with the investors’ or the representatives’ concerns.[32]Laraine Lyttle was an employee of Mount Real. On May 4th 2005, she wrote an email[13] to Laurence Henry and Joseph Pettinichio which was forwarded to Lino Matteo for discussion. The subject was Cash flow. In capital letters, she writes PLEASE READ and then the following:As you are both aware we are unable to cover our redemptions. Now it has gotten to the point we cannot pay any interest owing or partial interest/redemptions for RIF payments. Frank Iacono has an investor, N.C.[14], who holds about 850,000.00 US and 1.35 M Canadian we are unable to pay his 6,500 US of interest for his April interest for the beginning of the month. B2B Service fee account is at rock bottom so if there are any purchases through them they will not be able to issue a cheque to us anyway. The whole situation is getting worse every day. I have worked years to have a good relationship with the reps now this is in jeopardy.And she concludes in capital letters PLEASE HELP.[33]Representatives[15] wrote about INTERESTS PAYMENTS due to their clients who had been waiting for months and who were expecting their money. One representative wrote she was fed up of playing a game of cat and mouse.[34]Another one writes[16] that after the maturity extension from March to June, it is time to reimburse the clients because we are out of excuses!!! so please let’s respect our deal. He wants answers and talking about his clients, he writes: Don’t wait they call the guy from La Presse!!![35]To this, Lino Matteo answers the following: You are smiling when you are saying this… right?If you have any issues, I think you should discuss with Laurence. The representative answers that he is not smiling at all.[36]In exhibit P-440 doc id 2674038, a June 2005 email addressed to Laurence Henry and cc’d to Lino P. Matteo, Laraine Lyttle writes : This situation is impossible how long will I have to tell reps and investors that the records are not accessible?[37]Exhibit P-440 doc id 2674042 shows that on August 24th 2005, Mrs. Lyttle wrote an email to Lino P. Matteo, which subject was HELP. An investor, Mr. S.[17], had been in her office and would not leave without speaking to someone. She explains that he holds close to $1 million in MRACS and he had an interest payment of $34,000 due on August 3rd 2005. She asks defendant to see him. Mr. Matteo’s answer was: Did you call Laurence?[38]She replies that the man has already spoken to Laurence, he is not happy with his conversation with him and she does not want to repeat what he said. On August 26th, defendant wrote that he would get an update from Laurence about this.[39]On August 29th at 10:14 A.M., Mrs. Lyttle writes to Mr. Matteo, who shares the same office as Mrs. Lyttle, that Mr. S. is back after having stayed for three hours the last time.[40]Here is Lino P. Matteo’s answer to the situation. If he is waiting quietly, go along with your work, if not ask him to leave and keep the door locked.[41]What is left to think from those examples, amongst many others, is that defendant, who self-portrayed himself as having a domineering authoritarian style and someone who wanted things to be done and to be done right, showed cowardliness, hiding behind others, putting on their shoulders the burden of explaining the unexplainable.[42]After having lied to investors who were lured to invest massively in MRC and other companies of the Mount Real group, he was locking the door in order to avoid having to answer questions, showing nothing else than contempt for everyone. How can someone ever think he could have any preoccupation for the investors?[43]I cannot find any mitigating factors on sentence. And again, to this day, defendant has shown no insight or sense of accountability. Only that he is sorry.[44]As was said in many decisions, if the absence of any criminal record is usually a mitigating factor, in the context of the Securities Act, it has less or no value at all. After all, any ordinary citizen would trust the person or company he invests his money with and would expect these people to have no criminal record.[45]All the aggravating factors considered in the Lacroix decision are present here:1)the exceptional degree of planification and complexity of the scheme, starting with the existence̶or shall I say the non-existence̶of all those companies, many of them empty shells used to inflate MRC’s balloon;2)the five‑year period during which the infractions were committed;3)the first-hand role of the defendant;4)the abuse of the trust and the manipulation that affected many people, not only investors;5)the amount of money involved and the large number of investors;6) The post-offence conduct,that is reflected in the judgment of the Honourable Jean-Yves Lalonde of the Superior Court, cited above, along with the fact of blaming the provisional administrator for a situation defendant is personally responsible for.[46]Although the following words of the Honourable Richard Wagner[18] were pronounced in sentencing Vincent Lacroix in a fraud case, they totally apply in the present situation:Il est vrai que Vincent Lacroix n’a pas été l’auteur de violence physique dans la perpétration de ses crimes. C’est d’ailleurs l’une des raisons pour lesquelles il a pu recouvrer sa liberté sous caution en attendant la tenue de ses procès.Cependant, même si la violence physique directe n’a pas accompagné ses crimes, le Tribunal est d’avis que ces derniers ont engendré beaucoup de violence morale aux victimes et à leur famille en raison du stress, de l’insécurité et de l’incertitude pour ceux et celles qui ont perdu le capital de leur vie qu’ils réservaient pour leur retraite.[47]The few testimonies I have heard from investors confirmed that. Some attended large parts of the trial. If revenge has no place in a court of law, I can only hope that today puts an end to a sad period of their lives.[48]Mtre Bordelais for Lino Matteo pleaded that the prosecution overcharged the accused and that two statements of offence would have sufficed: one for all the false information charges over the five-year period and one englobing all the counts of having aided to the distribution of securities without a prospectus during the same period.[49]With respect, I don’t think this would have been an accurate account of what the evidence revealed at trial.[50]In my judgment, I wrote that although the public financial information transmitted took multiple forms for a given year, I excluded the possibility of staying the proceedings on certain counts because each and every document, disseminated each and every year to the public, had the potential in itself to impact on any person with the will to invest, whatever the document consulted, whatever the year.[51]The same applies to all the counts concerning the distribution of securities without a prospectus. Each promissory note has a different date and involves the investment of a different person or different investments of the same person but at different times.[52]Therefore, the defendant is liable to the penalty applicable at the time indicated on each statement of offence. For counts 1 to 27, a minimum fine of $5,000. On counts 28 to 75 and 267 the minimum fine of $5,000 and the maximum penalty of 5 years less a day[19]. For counts 108 to 154, 156 to 163, 165 to 207, 209 to 212, 214 to 266, 268 to 305 and 308, the minimum fine of $5,000.[53]This is a case where the sentencing objectives of denunciation and deterrence of the defendant, but also of others who would be tempted to adopt the defendant’s way of doing business, should be prioritized.[54]The fact that the defendant could not work in his field of accounting for the past 10 years weighs less in view of the damage he caused. After having considered all the evidence, this can only be considered as an unavoidable consequence of his own actions if not a blessing for potential investors.[55]Mr. Matteo testified that in the last four years, he had a few consulting projects and also that he has worked as a soccer referee for the past 10 years, which had a therapeutic effect. His wife and sons support him and he still lives in his house. He testified that in 2005, his portfolio, which was 95% linked to MRC, was evaluated at $8 million.[56]The AMF agrees that the total fine that will be imposed on him is more symbolic than anything else. Apparently, Mr. Matteo would not have the means to pay such a fine. Then the same question lingers: Where did the investors’ money go?Although defendant testified on sentence that he never transferred any money offshore, the evidence clearly showed that this was done on a regular basis. Not only in the Bahamas and Barbados[20] but also in the United States[21].[57]Whether or not Mr. Matteo pays the fine, the effect of it plus the time he will serve in jail shall have a deterrent effect on any person wishing to build a little empire like Mr. Matteo thought he was building.[58]Exhibit S-5 is the Tableau de la poursuivante quant à la peine réclamée. For counts 1 to 27, the AMF is asking 4 times the minimum fine of $5,000. For counts 28 to 75 and 267, 2 times the minimum fine of $5,000 and an imprisonment of 5 years less one day to be served concurrently on each count. Finally, for counts 108 to 154 , 156 to 163, 165 to 207, 209 to 212, 214 to 266, 268 to 305 and 308, 4 times the minimum fine of $5,000.[59]It is certainly an exemplary sentence. Having heard this trial during many months, appreciating the whole of the evidence, the defendant’s first‑hand role and character, I am convinced that it is a fit and legitimate sentence that takes into consideration the sentencing objectives of denunciation and deterrence. It is also necessary to separate defendant from society in order to promote a sense of responsibility in him and acknowledgment of the harm he has done[22]. The fact that he is sorry does not right a wrong.[60]It should not to be forgotten also that other administrators of MRC are still awaiting trial.[61]It is without any hesitation that I endorse the recommendation of the AMF on sentence. Consequently, on counts 1 to 27, the defendant is sentenced to pay a fine of $20,000 on each count. On counts 28 to 75 and 267, he is sentenced to pay a fine of $10,000 on each count and to serve 5 years less one day concurrently on each count.[62]On the remaining counts 108 to 154, 156 to 163, 165 to 207, 209 to 212, 214 to 266, 268 to 305 and 308, the defendant is sentenced to pay a fine of $20,000 on each count.[63]The total sentence is therefore an imprisonment of 5 years less a day consecutive to any other sentence and a fine of $4,910,000.__________________________________HÉLÈNE MORIN, J.C.Q.Mtre Stéphane POULINMtre Mairi SPRINGATEMtre Amélie ROYCounsel for the Autoritédes marchés financiers (AMF)Mtre Sylvie BORDELAISAttorney for Lino P.Matteo[1]Having aided Mount Real Corporation (MRC) to present false and misleading information (75 counts).[2]Having aided subsidiaries of MRC to make distribution of securities without a prospectus (190 counts).[3]S-3.[4]500-10-006191-165.[5]S-1 and S-4.[6]2009 QCCS 4004 (CanLII).[7]The Right Honourable Pierre Labrie, J.C.S.[8]2016 QCCS 4933 (CanLII).[9]2008 QCCQ 234 (CanLII).[10]ExhibitP-611 D.[11]2007 QCCS 351 (CanLII).[12]Page 27, par. 207.[13]P-440 doc id 2674028.[14]The name is written in full in the email.[15]P-440-2674035.[16]P-440-2674036.[17]The name is written in full.[18]R. c.

G.H.,2010 YKTC 70Date:20100625Docket:09-00725ARegistry:WhitehorseIN THE TERRITORIAL COURT OFYUKONBefore:Her Honour Chief Judge RuddyREGINAv.G.H.Appearances:Ludovic GouaillierGordon CoffinCounselfor the CrownCounselfor the DefenceREASONS FOR SENTENCING[1]RUDDY C.J.T.C. (Oral):G.H. is before me for sentencing on a single count of assault with a weapon which arises in something of a domestic context.G.H. and A.L. have been in a relationship off and on for several years.A.L. has three children and G.H., I understand, has stood in the place of a father to those three children.However, in December of this past year, A.L. indicated that she wished them to take a break from the relationship.[2]On the particular evening in question, G.H., having dropped off the children with A.L.’s mother, happened to be passing her residence, noted an unknown vehicle there, and there were some indicators to him that someone was present with her in the residence.He became angry, broke into the residence, damaging a window and a door.He entered into the bedroom, where he found the complainant, P.S., and asked that he leave the residence.G.H. then, unfortunately, went to the kitchen, grabbed a knife and returned to the bedroom.It is my understanding through the pre-sentence report that this was a small steak knife.However, he confronted P.S..There was a struggle during which there was apparently an attempt to stab P.S., who was, fortunately, able to block the use of the knife.G.H. then head-butted him twice in the nose area, resulting in swelling and bleeding.No other injuries were reported and, in particular, the knife itself was not actually used in terms of cutting anyone.A.L. contacted the police and G.H. left the residence.[3]He comes before the Court with a prior criminal record.It is a record which is, in its entirety, related to G.H.’s significant history of drug addiction.It includes a number of drug-related offences and breaches, reflecting his difficulty in complying with conditions at times when he is actively using.This is, as the Crown pointed out, an offence which is serious enough that it could quite rightly attract a penitentiary term.[4]G.H., you need to understand that the potential for serious injury or worse, in this case, was pretty high.I know from the Pre-Sentence Report that you are aware of that and that you are concerned about what you have done and the impact that it has had on others.You have entered a guilty plea, which is indicative to me of remorse, as well.[5]I do have a joint submission before me from counsel suggesting that this matter be resolved by way of an 18 month conditional sentence followed by a two year probationary term.As I said, this is the type of offence for which one might otherwise be looking at a penitentiary term.In this case, obviously, counsel, as am I, are agreed that there are somewhat exceptional circumstances.[6]I have a great deal of information before me in the form of a very thorough and complete Pre-Sentence Report, as well as detailed letters from a number of individuals, including G.H.’s employer, A.L., his mother and his step-father, all of which speak quite frankly about G.H.’s history, background and his current circumstances.Of particular note to me, G.H., while having had a relatively stable early upbringing, appears to have developed significant problems with drugs in his teens, following the divorce of his parents.[7]Both he and A.L. have a history of struggling with drugs and coming into conflict with the law as a result.However, this is one of those cases in which they both appear to be doing extremely well right now in managing their addictions.G.H. spent some time in custody a couple of years ago with respect to a drug-related offence, but since shortly after his release he has maintained sobriety.He has been clean, and A.L. has as well, over two years, and it might even be more than that, I think, three years now, of being clean and sober.Both of them have made significant strides, but it is clear to me from the reports that doing so has not been without some struggles and glitches along the way as they continue to work through their issues individually and, to some extent, at least before this incident, together as well.[8]In considering what is being suggested here, one of the things that I think is crucial is that there has been a significant reduction in G.H.’s risk level as a result of the fact that he has stayed clean.I think his ability to maintain his sobriety is crucial to his not coming into conflict with the law in the future.I tend to agree with his mother’s comment that his ability to do so may well drop dramatically in a custodial situation, where he is with a number of individuals who struggle with similar addictions, and it is not unheard of that various substances do get smuggled into such facilities.So when I am balancing off the issues that need to be addressed here, in terms of denunciation and deterrence, as well as rehabilitation, I am satisfied that adopting the joint submission in allowing G.H. to serve his custodial term within the community is the best balance of all of those principles.[9]Case law is clear that a conditional sentence can meet the principles of denunciation and deterrence and, as I have said, in terms of G.H.’s rehabilitation, placement in the community with the support that he has from his family is pretty crucial to his continuing efforts to address his addiction issues.[10]That being said, I would adopt the joint submission of counsel.G.H., there will be a sentence of 18 months with respect to the single count that you have entered a plea to.You will, however, be entitled to serve that conditionally within the community.The terms and conditions of the conditional sentence will be as follows:1.That you keep the peace and be of good behaviour;2.Appear before the Court when required to do so by the Court;3.That you report to a Supervisor within two working days and thereafter when required by the Supervisor and in the manner directed by the Supervisor;4.That you remain within the Yukon Territory unless you have written permission from your Supervisor and notify your Supervisor in advance of any change of name, address and promptly notify your Supervisor of any change of employment or occupation;5.You are to reside as directed by your Supervisor; abide by the rules of the residence and not change your residence without the prior written permission of your Supervisor;[11]There does need to be a restrictive house arrest component, in my view, and I do note that I have also considered the fact that you have been on house arrest for a number of months in passing sentence.That is one of the other factors that I think weighs in favour of granting you a conditional sentence, but I am going to include the same condition that you have been on as part of your conditional sentence order, which will require you to:6.Abide by a curfew by remaining within your place of residence at all times except for the purposes of employment or except with the prior written permission of your Conditional Sentence Supervisor, such permission to be carried on your person.You must present yourself at the door or answer the telephone during reasonable hours for curfew checks; failure to do so will be a presumptive breach of this condition;You know from the past few months that they will be checking.7.You are also to abstain absolutely from the possession or consumption of alcohol and controlled drugs or substances except in accordance with a prescription given to you by a qualified medical practitioner.You are to provide a sample of your breath or urine for the purposes of analysis upon demand by a peace officer who has reason to believe that you may have failed to comply with this condition;[12]Mr. Coffin, any issues with providing a sample if there are reasonable grounds?[13]MR. COFFIN:No.[14]THE COURT:I recognize that you were not under the influence with respect to this offence but it is clear to me your risk factors go way up if you are.So I am satisfied you do need to continue to abstain.8.You are not to attend any bar, tavern, liquor store, off-sales or other commercial premises whose primary purpose is the sale of alcohol;9.You are to take such alcohol and/or drug assessment, counselling or programming as directed by your Supervisor.Attend and complete a residential treatment program if so directed by your Supervisor;10.You are to report to Offender Services to be assessed, and attend and complete any recommended programming as directed by your Supervisor;11.Take such other assessment, counselling and programming as directed by your Supervisor;12.You are to have no contact directly or indirectly or communication in any way with A.L., except with the prior written permission of your Supervisor in consultation with Victim Services and Family and Children Services;That is not so that you cannot have contact, it is so that contact can be monitored.I just want the Supervisor to have a handle on how things are going in terms of when and how you should have contact.So I am not putting that there to suggest that you do not have any contact, just so that it be monitored and somebody is keeping an eye on things.13.You are to have no contact directly or communication in any way with P.S.;Having had the discussion with respect to restitution, I am going to decline to make the order because that appears to have been resolved through other means.14.You are to participate in such educational or life skills programming as directed by your Supervisor;15.Make reasonable efforts to find and maintain suitable employment and provide your Supervisor with all necessary details concerning your efforts;16.You are to provide your Supervisor with consents to release information with regard to your participation in any programming, counselling, employment or educational activities that you have been directed to do pursuant to this conditional sentence order.[15]I have a question with respect to the last suggested condition, that being, essentially, the weapons condition.Would this not be a mandatory offence for the purposes of s. 109?[16]THE ACCUSED:I’ve already got a ten year.[17]THE COURT:There is already one?[18]THE ACCUSED:Yeah.[19]MR. GOUAILLIER:And I think you’re right, Your --[20]THE COURT:In which case, you may be looking at a lifetime ban.[21]MR. COFFIN:Yeah, that’s fine.[22]THE COURT:Okay.I think pursuant to s. 109, that is a requirement for this offence, and because you have a prior, it is going to be a lifetime ban.So in addition to the conditional sentence, there will be a lifetime prohibition pursuant tos. 109 that you not have in your possession any firearms, ammunition or explosive substances.[23]Any concerns on the conditional sentence conditions?[24]MR. GOUAILLIER:Yes, I have one thing, and, again, it’s not something I’ve discussed with A.L..On this monitored contact, I wonder if there’s a requirement - it’s in the interim release conditions - for monitored access to her residence.There is a not attend.So whether there’s any need for a not attend unless you have permission from the -- and I don’t know, perhaps that’s something A.L. may --[25]THE COURT: In this case, I think I am satisfied, based on the information in the report, that so long as the Supervisor is clued into what is going on and how both of them are doing, in allowing them to have contact, I think that is sufficient in these circumstances.Mr. Coffin, any concerns about the conditional sentence conditions?[26]MR. COFFIN:No.[27]THE COURT:Okay.So the conditional sentence is to be followed by a probationary term of two years which will be on the following terms and conditions:1.That you keep the peace and be of good behaviour;2.Appear before the Court when required to do so by the Court;3.Notify your Probation Officer in advance of any change of name or address and promptly notify the Probation Officer of any change of employment or occupation;4.Report to a Probation Officer immediately upon completion of your conditional sentence and thereafter when and in the manner directed by the Probation Officer;5.I am going to require that you abstain absolutely again, because of the risk factors, from the possession or consumption of alcohol and controlled drugs or substances except in accordance with a prescription given to you by a qualified medical practitioner;6.You are not to attend any bar, tavern, off-sales or other commercial premises whose primary purpose is the sale of alcohol;7.You are to take such alcohol and drug assessment, counselling or programming as directed by your Probation Officer;8.You are to report to Offender Services to be assessed, and attend and complete any recommended programming as directed by your Supervisor;9.Take such other assessment, counselling and programming as directed by your Supervisor;I am not going to include the no contact with A.L., with respect to the probationary term.I expect by the time you get to that, any other issues will have been long resolved.However, I will include it with respect to P.S..10.Have no contact directly or indirectly or communication in any way with P.S.;11.Participate in such educational or life skills programming as directed by your Supervisor;12.Make reasonable efforts to find and maintain suitable employment and provide your Supervisor with all necessary details concerning your efforts;13.Provide your Supervisor with consents to release information with regard to your participation in any programming, counselling, employment or educational activities you have been directed to do pursuant to this probation order.[28]So it is primarily just the programming on your probationary term, to continue what it is that you have already started working on.You are working right now, though?[29]THE ACCUSED:Yeah.[30]THE COURT:Okay.There is going to be a victim fine surcharge, then.I believe with the summary election it would be $50.[31]MR. GOUAILLIER:Yes.[32]THE COURT:How long does he need to pay that?[33]THE ACCUSED:Two weeks?[34]MR. COFFIN:Two weeks.[35]THE COURT:Okay.Two weeks time to pay.[36]MR. GOUAILLIER:And this is also a primary designated offence.[37]THE COURT:For DNA?[38]MR. GOUAILLIER:For DNA.[39]THE COURT:Okay.Then I will make the order.Mr. Coffin, any submissions?[40]MR. COFFIN:No.[41]THE COURT:Then I will make the order that you provide such samples of your blood as are necessary for DNA testing and banking.[42]The remaining counts?[43]MR. GOUAILLIER:It would be a stay of proceedings, Your Honour.[44]THE COURT:Okay.________________________________RUDDY C.J.T.C."}

FUERSTon October 15, 2010, at NEWMARKET, Ontario**********CHARGES:Possession of a Prohibited Device (x2)Possession of a Prohibited Device while ProhibitedSmuggling**********APPEARANCES:L. SaundersCounsel for the Provincial CrownN. PeelCounsel for Gordon YatesREASONS FOR SENTENCEFUERST, J. (Orally):[1]Gordon Yates pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of a prohibited device, specified respectively as a large capacity cartridge magazine and a handgun barrel less than 105 millimetres in length, knowing that he was not the holder of a licence to possess that device; one count of possession of those two prohibited devices while he was bound by a firearms prohibition order; and one count of smuggling firearms parts into Canada from Florida contrary to the Customs Act.The Circumstances of the Offences[2]In 2003 Mr. Yates moved to Canada from the United States, where he had lived for many years.He brought with him a number of firearms.[3]In 2004 Mr Yates was charged with several firearms offences.The charges were withdrawn when he agreed to and did enter into a firearms prohibition order on March 14, 2005.The order was for a period of four years.[4]On October 31, 2007, Canadian Border Services Agency (“CBSA”) officers intercepted a package mailed to Mr. Yates from the UnitedStates.Its contents were described as a “gun frame”.The package was put back into the mail for delivery.Mr. Yates picked up the package on November 6, 2007.[5]In mid-June 2008 CBSA officers intercepted another package mailed to Mr. Yates from the United States.It contained two pistol slides compatible with a Colt model 1911 type handgun.An investigation of Mr. Yates commenced.[6]On October 14, 2008, CBSA officers intercepted a third package that was mailed to Mr. Yates from the United States.Its contents were described as “machined upper parts” with a value of $75.They were parts for a Colt model 1911 type handgun.Only the frames were missing.[7]From the parts in the third package, OPP Senior Gunsmith Stuart Seki was able to build two complete slide assemblies for a Colt model 1911 type handgun.He took two rounds of 45 ACP ammunition, removed the propellant and projectile from each, and was able to chamber and discharge the primers in each assembly using a common hand tool to strike the firing pin.Each slide assembly met the Criminal Code definition of a “firearm”.Using a stripped Colt model 1911 type handgun frame that was not part of the package, Mr. Seki was able to build a complete firearm in six to seven minutes.He had enough parts left over to build a second complete firearm.[8]The police executed a search warrant at Mr. Yates’ home on November 7, 2008.They seized 10 frames, 17 slide assemblies, 6 lower receivers, 3 upper receivers, 20 handgun magazines, and 5 rifle magazines.[9]The police also seized two prohibited devices.The first, a large capacity magazine was found on a workbench in the garage.It appeared to be compatible with a Colt model AR-15 assault rifle.It had the capacity to hold 30 rounds of .223 calibre ammunition.The second prohibited device was found in a package inside Mr. Yates’ bedroom closet.The package, which had been sent from the United States, contained a handgun slide assembly having a .45 calibre short barrel less than 105 millimetres in length.[10]The prohibited devices were covered by the prohibition order that was still in existence.Further, Mr. Yates was not licensed to possess firearms.[11]Mr. Yates was cooperative with the police on his arrest.He told them that the October 14, 2008, package had been sent to him by his ex-wife, and that on his instructions she labelled it as containing “machined upper parts” with a value of $75.His involvement in the purposeful failure to properly identify the items constitutes smuggling under the Canada Customs Act.The Circumstances of Mr. Yates.[12]Mr. Yates is 45 years old.He has no prior criminal record.He is the father of four children with his ex-wife.He is in a common law relationship with the woman he plans to marry, who also has children.Two teenaged children and a young grandson live with them.His fiancée reports that he is a devoted parent and grandparent.[13]Mr. Yates has a grade 10 education.He lived in the UnitedStates for about 15 years, where he operated a flooring company and also worked for a short period as a private investigator.He has his own flooring business at which he works long hours.He employs one of his sons.He is the sole financial support of his family.[14]Mr. Yates is a volunteer fire fighter with the Severn Township Fire Department.He was recently promoted to captain, and put in charge of a shift of five other individuals.He is described as reliable, with good common sense and sound judgement.He also participates in various charitable fundraising activities in the community.[15]Mr. Yates remained out of custody following his arrest.Although the conditions of his release did not include onerous terms such as house arrest, there is no suggestion that he did not abide by them.[16]The pre-sentence reporter describes Mr. Yates as demonstrating strong family ties, and having strong ties to his employment and his community.She concluded that he recognizes the seriousness of his offences, accepts full responsibility for his actions, and demonstrates a willingness to make amends.The Positions of the Parties[17]On behalf of the Crown, Ms. Saunders seeks a jail term of four months on each count, all concurrent, a firearms prohibition order for 10 years, and forfeiture of the items seized.She emphasizes that Mr. Yates breached a court-imposed firearms prohibition order by possessing an over-capacity magazine and a short handgun barrel, for which even a gun collector would have no need.She points out that he obviously was assembling firearms parts at his house, which was occupied by teenaged children and a grandchild, and that those parts could have been stolen had his home been broken into.It is obvious that his keen interest in firearms has continued notwithstanding the imposition of a prohibition order.This is of concern, given the prevalence of firearms-related crimes in the community.Ms. Saunders submits that a suspended sentence and probation would fail to address the needs of deterrence.[18]On behalf of the defence, Mr. Peel reminds me that Mr. Yates has no previous criminal record.Mr. Yates knew that he was bound by a prohibition order and that he was not licensed to possess any of the items.He did not intend to assemble them, however, until the prohibition order expired and he had a licence.He thought that he could keep them in the meantime.Some of the items had to be machined.Mr. Peel suggests it is unlikely that anyone without expertise with firearms could put the parts together, and he emphasizes that no powder or bullets were found at the house such that there was a danger to the children or grandchild in the home.Mr. Yates was cooperative with the police and arranged for them to pick up another package that was en route at the point of his arrest.He is the sole support of his family, and he contributes to his community as a volunteer firefighter.He can comply with court orders.Mr. Peel seeks a suspended sentence and probation, with a term that Mr. Yates perform 200 hours of community service work with the fire department.He agrees that there must be a firearms prohibition order.He asks that the forfeiture order not take effect for three months so that Mr. Yates can transfer the parts to an FAC holder, because they have value.The Principles of Sentencing[19]The objectives of sentencing long recognized at common law have been codified in Section 718 of the Criminal Code.They are: the denunciation of unlawful conduct, deterrence both general and specific, the separation of the offender from society where necessary, rehabilitation, reparation for harm done to the victims or the community, and promotion of a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledgement of the harm done.[20]Section 718.1 provides that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.Section 718.2 provides that a sentence should be increased or decreased to account for any aggravating and mitigating circumstances.It sets out various aggravating factors, none of which apply in this case.It also requires that a sentence be similar to those imposed on similar offenders in similar circumstances, that the combined duration of consecutive sentences not be unduly long, that an offender not be deprived of liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate, and that all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances be considered.Aggravating and Mitigating Factors in this Case[21]The aggravating factors are that:1.Mr. Yates possessed not just one but twoprohibited devices;2.One of the prohibited devices was notsimply stored at his home, but was on aworkbench in the garage;3.He also possessed an extensive number offirearms parts.If not for his arrest,he would have had the parts necessary toassemble at least two complete firearms;4.He possessed the prohibited devices aswell as the parts knowing that he wasbound by a firearms prohibition order,to which he had consented;5.He possessed the prohibited devices aswell as the parts knowing that he wasnot licensed to possess the firearms;6.Neither the prohibited devices nor thefirearms parts found in his home weresecured in any way.They could havebeen stolen in the event of a break-inand distributed for illicit use.[22]In mitigation I consider that:1.Mr. Yates has no prior criminal record;2.He was cooperative with the police;3.He pleaded guilty, which is anexpression of remorse and willingness toaccept responsibility for his actions;4.He is a hard-working individual whoprovides for his family;5.He has strong family ties and enjoys asupportive relationship with hisfiancée;6.He contributes to his community as avolunteer firefighter and throughcharitable activities.Analysis[23]It is apparent that Mr. Yates has a long-standing fascination with firearms.While that in and of itself is not an offence, I agree with Ms. Saunders that it is a consideration in determining the nature of the sentence that will deter him, as well as other like-minded individuals, from acquiring and possessing firearms and related items while prohibited from doing so, and/or without the requisite licence.[24]It must be made clear to Mr. Yates and to others that the firearms provisions of the Criminal Code and court orders imposed pursuant to them are not mere guidelines to be ignored at will.They apply notwithstanding the legitimacy of an owner’s interest in firearms.This is a particularly important message to send in the interest of protection of the public.[25]I have given serious consideration to imposing a jail sentence as suggested by Ms. Saunders.I would have no hesitation in imposing a jail sentence if Mr. Yates were a repeat offender, a participant in an organized firearms importation scheme, or the subject of a negative pre-sentence report.He is none of these.Moreover, because he is before me as a first offender with positive employment, family and community ties, I must have regard to his rehabilitative prospects.These would not be advanced by a custodial sentence.[26]Notwithstanding that Mr. Yates breached a court-imposed order, he was cooperative with the police and has abided by the conditions of his release while awaiting disposition of the charges.I am satisfied that he now understands the necessity of abiding by court orders and that he would obey conditions of probation if he were permitted to remain out of custody.I am satisfied that a non-custodial sentence would meet the needs of general and specific deterrence, while encouraging his rehabilitation and underscoring his sense of responsibility for his offences.[27]Mr. Yates please stand.I sentence you on count 7 to a suspended sentence and a period of probation of 18 months.For the entire 18 months you will be bound by the statutory conditions of probation, and in addition the following conditions:1.Report immediately to a probationofficer, and thereafter as required;2.Perform 240 hours of community service work as directed by your probation officer including at the location identified by your probation officer, at the rate of not less than 20 hours a month commencing in November 2010;3.Not purchase, possess or carry any firearms or other items specified in section 109 of the Criminal Code or any parts of any such firearms or other such items;4.Not purchase, possess or carry any weapons except for the purpose of employment and/or while on duty as a volunteer firefighter.[28]I prohibit you from possessing any firearm, other than a prohibited firearm or restricted firearm, and any cross-bow, restricted weapon, ammunition and explosive substance for 10 years and any prohibited firearm, restricted firearm, prohibited weapon, prohibited device, and prohibited ammunition for life.[29]The sentence is concurrent on each of counts 8,9 and 11.[30]I order the immediate forfeiture of all items seized by the police.In the circumstances of these offences, it would be inappropriate to permit Mr. Yates to sell or give them to another person.[31]Mr. Yates, you should be aware that if you breach any condition of your probation, you may be bought back before me and re-sentenced to a period in jail.You may also be charged with the criminal offence of breach of probation.Do you understand?MR. YATES:Yes ma’am."}

HeroldDated the 17th day of June, 2015(Docket: 12-12-33, 08-13-147, and 12-13-20)MEMORANDUM OF JUDGMENT(NOTE:This document may have been edited for publication)I. OVERVIEW[1]The appellant was sent to prison following a finding that she had breached a Conditional Sentence Order [CSO], and was not given credit for the time during which the CSO was suspended.[2]The sentencing judge’s decision to remit the appellant to prison upon her breach of a CSO warrants appellate intervention; further, the appellant ought to have been granted some credit for the period of time during which the conditional sentence order was suspended.II. INTRODUCTION[3]The appellant appeals the sentencing judge’s decision to terminate her 18-month CSO and commit her to custody for the remaining five months. She submits that the sentencing judge erred in refusing her application to adjourn the CSO breach hearing and further erred in law by:1.failing to give meaningful or any consideration to any other sentencing option for breach of a CSO as set out in the Criminal Code of Canada, RSC 1985, c C-46 [Criminal Code], s 742.6(9) other than collapsing the order;2.failing to allow Defence Counsel any opportunity to make sentencing submissions concerning her personal circumstances and relevant Gladue[1] factors; and3.failing to consider the factors listed in Criminal Code s 742.6(17) before denying any credit for the period of time during which the CSO was suspended - 3 months and 17 days.[4]Appellant’s Counsel confined oral argument to the latter three grounds but did not abandon the complaint of refusing an adjournment.[5]This appeal is allowed. The appellant is granted 50 days’ credit for the 50 days remaining to be served under the CSO; consequently, the appellant has served her entire conditional sentence order.III. BACKGROUND[6]On January 21, 2014, the appellant was initially sentenced to an 18-month CSO for offences of uttering threats and two counts of breaching an undertaking by consuming alcohol. On February 28, 2015, the Crown alleged that she violated the CSO by failing to keep the peace and be of good behaviour, upon being charged with another uttering threats offence. The threats consisted of phone calls made to a hotel in Resolute Bay where a witness alleged that the appellant made two statements to the effect: “if I do not hear from my husband, I will come with a rifle and shoot up my way in and shoot at the police to get my kids back.” On March 1, 2015, the appellant was granted bail on the CSO breach allegation and the uttering threats offence. Accordingly, prior to the breach allegation, the appellant had successfully completed more than 13 months of her CSO, including 12 months of stringent conditions, including house arrest.[7]June 17, 2015, was the next regular circuit date in Resolute Bay. This date was the appellant’s first appearance on the CSO breach allegation.[8]The appellant sought to adjourn the CSO breach hearing for a further four months – to a date upon which the uttering threats charge could be set down for trial. The Crown opposed the adjournment, submitting that under s 742.6(3)(a) of the Criminal Code, a breach hearing must commence within 30 days of the date of the offender’s arrest, or as soon as practicable thereafter. Because more than three months had already passed since the appellant’s arrest, it was not reasonable to further delay the CSO breach hearing.[9]The adjournment request was refused, the Court expressing dismay that bail had been granted, and finding that a seven-month delay was not an adjournment for a “reasonable period” under s 742.6(3.3) of the Criminal Code.[10]The Crown submitted that the CSO should be collapsed. The appellant did not challenge the evidence, but through Defence Counsel, she submitted that the ultimate issue at trial on the uttering threats offence would be whether criminal intent could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, in light of her intoxication at the time of the offence.[11]On the requisite balance of probabilities, the presiding judge then found that the appellant had breached the CSO conditions. Without the benefit of further submissions, the presiding judge then decided that “[the appellant] is now going to have to return to custody to finish the conditional sentence. I see no other option.”[12]Defence Counsel nonetheless sought credit for the time during which the appellant had to wait for the Resolute Bay regular circuit date; urging the Court to “tighten” the conditions of the CSO, rather than collapse the entire order. Twice Defence Counsel attempted to provide details about the appellant’s personal circumstances; twice the hearing judge denied Defence Counsel permission to make those submissions. Relying upon his stated assumption that Gladue factors had been considered when the original CSO was imposed, the presiding judge reiterated that he saw no other option, but to remit the appellant to custody to finish the CSO.[13]On August 15, 2015, the appellant was released on bail pending appeal. Thus, between sentencing on June 17, 2015, and her interim release pending appeal on August 15, 2015, the appellant served 60 days in custody and earned 30 days of remission, for a total of 90 days served of the 140 days left on the CSO (Appellate Counsel for the appellant noted that the Crown had only initially asked for 105 days for the triggering offences). There are 50 days left to be served under the CSO.[14]The Crown respondent conceded that the sentencing judge erred in failing to consider any of the enumerated sentencing options under Criminal Code s 742.6(9), other than terminating the appellant’s CSO, and also erred in denying Defence Counsel the opportunity to make sentencing submissions. At the hearing of this appeal, the respondent further conceded that the sentencing judge should have specifically considered Gladue factors at the CSO breach hearing. Notwithstanding these concessions, the Crown submitted that collapsing the entire CSO was a fit sentence, and that no error was made in refusing the adjournment or denying any credit for the time period during which the CSO was suspended.IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW[15]Appellate intervention in a sentence decision is warranted where there has been a clear error of principle, a failure to properly consider, or an over-emphasis of, a relevant factor, or where the sentence imposed is demonstrably unfit (R v M(CA), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 SCR 500 at paras 89-90, 105 CCC (3d) 327; R v LM, 2008 SCC 31 (CanLII) at para 14, [2008] 2 SCR 163).V. ANALYSIS[16]The hearing judge committed four errors:1) failing to consider any enumerated option under Criminal Code s 742.6(9), other than terminating the CSO;2) failing to permit Defence Counsel to make sentencing submissions;3) failing to consider Gladue factors relevant to a fit sentence; and4) failing to grant any credit for the period of time during which the appellant’s CSO was suspended pre-hearing.[17]These errors allow this Court to consider this matter anew and resentence the appellant to a fit and proper sentence in consideration of all the relevant facts and sentencing principles. There was no error in refusing the adjournment.A. Refusing the adjournment request[18]A trial judge has discretion to grant or refuse an adjournment, reviewable on appeal only to determine whether the decision was “well-founded in law” (Barrette v The Queen, 1976 CanLII 180 (SCC), [1977] 2 SCR 121 at 125, 68 DLR (3d) 260). Under the conditional sentence regime of the Criminal Code, a breach hearing is to commence within 30 days following the offender’s arrest or as soon thereafter as practicable (Criminal Code s 742.6(3)). This timing is subject to a court’s discretion to grant adjournments “for a reasonable period” (Criminal Code s 742.6(3.3)). Until a determination is made as to whether or not a breach has occurred, the offender’s CSO is suspended (Criminal Code s 742.6(10)).[19]R v McIvor, 2008 SCC 11 (CanLII) at para 18, [2008] 1 SCR 285, confirmed Parliament’s intention that allegations of CSO violations are to be dealt with in a simplified and expedited process.[20]The hearing judge did not err in refusing to grant an adjournment - a delay of seven months is not a “reasonable period”.[21]The four errors can be dealt with under two main headings.(i). Terminating the CSO and committal to custody[22]The hearing judge was required to consider all of the options set out in Criminal Code s 742.6(9). Upon finding a CSO breach, a judge can:(a)take no action;(b)change the optional conditions;(c)suspend the conditional sentence order and direct(i)that the offender serve in custody a portion of the unexpired sentence, and(ii)that the conditional sentence order resume on the offender’s release from custody, either with or without changes to the optional conditions; or(d) terminate the conditional sentence order and direct that the offender be committed to custody until the expiration of the sentence.[23]In R v Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII) at para 39, [2000] 1 SCR 61, Chief Justice Lamer said that where an offender breaches a CSO condition without a reasonable excuse, “there should be a presumption that the offender serve the remainder in jail.” There is some debate in the jurisprudence as to whether these comments were obiter dicta.[24]For example, in R v Weir, 2000 ABPC 62 (CanLII) at paras 12-13, 263 AR 365 [Weir], Fradsham PCJ says:. . . I do not read R. v. Proulx, supra, as directing that any breach of a conditional sentence must result in the offender serving the rest of his or her sentence in custody. I say this for a number of reasons:(1) such a pronouncement would, in effect, repeal subsections (a), (b), and (c) of section 742.6(9) of the Criminal Code;(2) the Supreme Court of Canada spoke in terms of “a presumption” which indicates that such a result is not inevitable [which is more in keeping with the content of section 742.6(9)];(3) requiring an offender to serve the remaining portion of his or her sentence in custody is the maximum punishment possible (see: R. v. Proulx, supra, at p. 469), and it is illogical to conclude that all offenders should have imposed on them the maximum punishment permitted;(4) such an interpretation could result in a sentence being imposed which failed to comply with the purpose, objectives, and principles of sentencing set forth in sections 718 to718.2 of the Criminal Code.[25]In my view, if termination of the CSO complies with relevant sentencing principles it should be made; if not, then other options under Criminal Code s 742.6(9) must be considered.[26]R v Langley (TE), 2005 BCCA 478 (CanLII) at para 13, 216 BCAC 311, sets out various factors a court ought to consider in determining whether the presumption of termination should be applied in an individual case. These include:. . . the nature of the offence; the nature, circumstances, and timing of the breach; any subsequent criminal conduct and sentences for that conduct; changes in the plan for community supervision; the effect of termination on the appropriateness of the sentence for the original offence; and the offender’s previous criminal record . . . the list of factors [is not] closed (See also R v Beaulieu, 2015 MBCA 90 (CanLII) at para 20, 125 WCB (2d) 667 [Beaulieu]).[27]Another important consideration is the length and nature of the conditional sentence, in comparison to that which would have been appropriate had the sentence for the original offence been custodial (R v Talman, 2005 BCCA 279 (CanLII) at para 10, 213 BCAC 43; Weir, at para 18). Where a conditional sentence may be lengthier than a conventional jail sentence for a particular offence, an accused on a breach becomes vulnerable to serving more time in jail than would have been served for the original offence had custody been imposed in the first instance. Here, the Crown originally sought 105 days in custody for the original offences for which the CSO was imposed. In my view, this is a relevant consideration, together with time served, in assessing the options for breaching the CSO.[28]Nothing on the record suggests that the hearing judge considered any option but to terminate the CSO and commit the appellant to custody to serve out the remainder of the CSO. This is an error, compounded by failing to permit Defence Counsel to make sentencing submissions on the appellant’s background and circumstances.(ii). Matters relevant to sentencing[29]Sections 723, 726, and 726.1 of the Criminal Code provide that a court shall, prior to imposing sentence, ask whether an offender has anything to say, give both sides an opportunity to make submissions on relevant facts, and consider any relevant information placed before it, including the representations made by or on behalf of the prosecution or the offender. The record reveals that these statutory obligations were not respected.[30]Counsel should be afforded sufficient, and reasonable, latitude to make submissions relevant to their client’s circumstances, as those may bear upon sentence. A sentencing court ought to avoid the appearance of impatience about the content or quality of counsel submissions, and ought to avoid conveying a disinclination to allow counsel to be heard: “this strike[s] at the core of fundamental fairness in the sentencing process” (MacFarlane v R, 2014 NBCA 35 (CanLII) at para 25, 114 WCB (2d) 585; R v Irvine, 2010 ABCA 212 (CanLII) at para 10, 88 WCB (2d) 721).[31]Further, the record reflects no meaningful consideration of s 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code or the general or particular circumstances of the appellant’s aboriginal heritage. R v Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII) at paras 81-86, [2012] 1 SCR 433, makes clear that there is no discretion as to whether such factors are to be assessed on sentencing. The principles established in Gladue must be considered in every case involving an aboriginal offender. The appellant did not waive this requirement, nor did the sentencing court satisfy its duty by assuming that Gladue factors had been assessed at the imposition of the CSO.[32]The Addendum to the appellant’s factum makes plain that Gladue factors were a critical consideration that bore upon any sentencing decision in this matter.[33]Briefly, the appellant is now in her mid-40s, born and raised in Resolute Bay. After being sexually abused at school while a young child, she was fearful of school and ultimately quit in grade six. Sexual assaults also occurred in adulthood. She was also involved in abusive domestic relationships. She struggles with alcohol addiction and drug abuse, and has serious health issues including arthritis, depression, and a personality disorder. In addition, she suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car crash. She has been hospitalized for various mental health issues, including instances of attempted suicide.[34]The appellant and her husband have five children and three grandchildren – the three youngest children (ages 15, 10 and 4) live at home. The threats in breach of the CSO began as a domestic dispute in which the appellant was drunk, her husband became angry and punched her in the face. He was not charged, but removed from the home, with the children, to the local hotel. When her phone calls to the hotel were not put through to her husband, she eventually uttered the threats, fearful for her children’s well-being.[35]Despite this background, the appellant has made substantial and sustained personal efforts to avail herself of all available addiction and mental health rehabilitation in Resolute Bay, a small northern community which is vastly under-resourced in this regard. She runs a successful small business at the local airport, but the needs of her children and her work are barriers to her ability to travel to other communities to seek additional treatment and counselling.[36]It may be helpful to compare this case to the (unrelated) case of R v McDonald, 2015 ABCA 108 (CanLII) at para 27, 599 AR 300, dealing with an offender’s efforts at rehabilitation through a drug court system; the offender failed by re-offending. The Court there noted that “[t]he objective of rehabilitation still remains even where an offender’s lengthy criminal history, coupled with a durable addiction, means the hope of effective rehabilitation may be fading . . . .” In that case, the Crown had proposed that the entire potential sentence which had been shelved when the offender entered the drug court program should be imposed by reason of failure well into the process. At para 45 the Court added, in relation to breaching offenders, that: “[b]y signaling that society will not simply write them off because of a lack of success this time around, it reinforces in offenders the ultimate goals of the program.”[37]Here the sentencing judge opined that there was no alternative to collapsing the order. That is not necessarily so. In my view, had the foregoing factors been properly considered by the sentencing court, it would not have inevitably led to the conclusion that the only available option was terminating the CSO and committal to custody. The decision of the sentencing judge to terminate the order was therefore not reasonable.[38]Finally, in assessing whether any of the period of suspension between February 28 and June 17, 2015, should have been credited as time served under the CSO, the sentencing judge failed to refer to or consider any of the factors specifically set out in the legislation when such a determination is made (Criminal Code ss 742.6(16) and 742.6(17)). A sentencing court retains the discretionary power to apportion some or all of the suspended time back to the offender’s credit on the CSO, if it is determined that there are “exceptional” circumstances and it is “in the interests of justice.” As with any discretionary power, it must be exercised judiciously and in keeping within the parameters of the law.[39]The factors which must be considered in determining whether to exercise discretion to grant credit are set out in Criminal Code s 742.6(17), as follows:(a)the circumstances and seriousness of the breach;(b)whether not making the order would cause the offender undue hardship based on the offender’s personal circumstances; and(c)the period for which the offender was subject to conditions while running of the conditional sentence order was suspended and whether the offender complied with those conditions during that period.[40]While some of the circumstances of the breach were before the sentencing judge, and Defence Counsel was able to provide particulars as to the appellant’s strict compliance with the terms of the CSO during the suspension, the sentencing judge erroneously disallowed all submissions relevant to the issue of “undue hardship based on the offender’s personal circumstances.” Again, these circumstances would undoubtedly have entailed Gladue considerations.[41]Moreover, the record and the Addendum to the appellant’s factum indicate a significant collateral consequence to fully collapsing the appellant’s CSO and ordering her into custody. That is, her resulting separation from her three young children while in custody and uncertainty associated with their care. Defence Counsel submitted that the substitute caregiver, the grandmother, may not have the stamina to handle all three children. The Addendum includes confirmation by the local social worker that the appellant’s children “were devastated” and their mood change was noticeable while the appellant was incarcerated following the termination of her CSO.[42]A sentencing court may take into account collateral consequences of a sentence “as personal circumstances of the offender” and adjust the sentence accordingly, in keeping with the principles of proportionality and individualization (R v Pham, 2013 SCC 15 (CanLII) at paras 11-14, [2013] 1 SCR 739 [Pham]).[43]I echo R v Stanberry, 2015 QCCQ 1097 (CanLII) at paras 16-26, 18 CR (7th) 87, where the Court found that it was incumbent on the sentencing judge to consider whether the separation of the appellant from her children “…will entail what can only be described today as incalculable adverse effects both for the offender and her children. They are properly regarded, as the Court said in Pham, as “personal circumstances of the offender” (para 20)”.[44]In light of the Addendum information put before this Court, it appears that the adverse effects upon the children of a custodial sentence may have magnified the severity of the sentence imposed here. Not every circumstance, of course, will warrant an adjustment in sentence. Nonetheless, the sentencing judge ought to have allowed submissions, and considered this aspect. There is no legal principle of which I am aware that would preclude such consideration.[45]The appellant waited three months and 17 days for her CSO breach hearing; delay that was neither the fault of, nor consented to by, the appellant. Rather, the delay was institutional or systemic in nature, sufficient to constitute an “exceptional case” (R v Bright, 2009 ABCA 56 (CanLII) at para 11, 448 AR 387, Beaulieu, at paras 43-59). It seems that if more than three months’ delay to the first hearing date provided a basis for denying the appellant’s adjournment application, perhaps it ought equally to have been considered a relevant basis upon which to grant credit to the appellant. This balancing was not considered.[46]Very recently, R v Webster, 2016 ABCA 140 (CanLII) at para 6, [2016] AJ No 481 (QL), said that there must be a “principled reason to deny credit” for a period of institutional delay. Nothing in the record provides any reason as to why credit should not be granted.[47]The interests of justice warrant granting some credit for the period of suspension in this case, particularly where the appellant was fully compliant with the conditions of the CSO during that period. While failing to keep the peace and be of good behaviour by being charged with uttering a threat is serious conduct, as was admitted by the appellant, such conduct must be balanced against any undue hardship to the appellant and the fact that she abided by the conditions of the CSO and her bail conditions during the period of suspension, and that the period of suspension was lengthy.VI. CONCLUSION[48]For the reasons given, this appeal is allowed. Fifty days remain left to be served by the appellant under the CSO. The appellant shall receive credit for those 50 days, as time served when the appellant’s CSO was suspended prior to the breach hearing. Accordingly, the appellant has completed her CSO and has served her entire sentence.Appeal heard on May 9, 2016Memorandum filed at Iqaluit, NunavutThis 31st day of May, 2016______________________Schutz J.A.Appearances:B.

(ad hoc):[1]The appellant, Nicholas Prioriello, appeals his sentences on 32 convictions to which he pled guilty.Facts[2]The total length of the sentences was just short of 8 years in prison.He was given credit for pre-trial custody of nearly 2 years, leaving 6 years apportioned as follows:•Five years for each of the following offences, all to be served concurrently:•Possession of property obtained by crime over $5,000 (x2)•Failure to stop for a police officer•Dangerous driving•Impaired driving•Drive while disqualified•Breach of probation (x4)•One year for each of the following offences to be served, concurrently to one another, but consecutively to the above charges:•Break and enter and commit theft (non-dwelling house) (x19)•Possession of burglary tools (x3)[3]The offences occurred between October 17, 2008 and January 24, 2009.He broke into 24 commercial properties in Halton, Toronto, Peel and Durham.In excess of $55,000 was stolen and approximately $12,000 in damages caused.As part of his plea bargain arrangement, no convictions were registered on other counts.On January 23, 2009, he stole a van, drank a large quantity of alcohol and led police on a high speed chase on residential and commercial streets in West Toronto.During the chase, he drove into a police cruiser, causing an officer minor injuries and twice collided with snow banks.When the van broke down, he fled on foot.While being arrested he fought with police, resulting in an officer breaking his hand.[4]The appellant has a lengthy criminal record, including over 120 previous convictions.At the time of his arrest, he was banned for life from driving and was subject to two probation orders.[5]The Crown sought a total sentence of 5 to 6 years on the first group of offences and a consecutive 3 to 5 years on the second group, less the 2 year credit for pre-trial custody.The Crown’s range was therefore 8-11 years, less 2 years or 6 to 9 years.[6]The defence argued for a net upper reformatory sentence for all offences.As noted, the sentencing judge imposed a total sentence between those suggested by the two counsel.[7]The appellant argues the sentencing judge erred in arriving at the sentences imposed.She failed to give sufficient weight to his mental disorders, while overemphasizing specific deterrence and imposing a 5 year sentence for breach of probation which carries a maximum sentence of 2 years.The Appellant’s Background[8]The appellant was 42 years old when sentenced.He exhibited behavioural problems as a child and spent time at a secure training school for boys where he was physically and sexually abused.His sister was raped and murdered.As a young adult, he showed signs of schizophrenia, although it appears he has never been formally diagnosed.He became addicted to cocaine and began his extensive life of crime at an early age.His mental illnesses went untreated for many years until he began medication and psychological and psychiatric treatment programs in 2006.At the time of some of the offences, he had discontinued his medications, begun drinking alcohol and had deteriorated badly.As is often the case, the appellant did better when he adhered to his treatment programs.Discussion[9]The appellant argues that the sentences are excessive because the sentencing judge failed to take into account his mental illness.We do not accept this proposition.[10]The appellant appears never to have been formally diagnosed with schizophrenia.He tendered no medical evidence to the court.For purposes of this discussion, however, we are prepared to accept that he suffered from some form of mental illness.The sentencing judge was clearly sensitive to his illness as is evident in the following remarks:...What it really gets down to is that it is very difficult to punish someone with a harsh or at least a long sentence when one knows very well that there is an underlying mental illness.Being punished when you are ill is problematic.On the other hand, there are other considerations that have to be brought to bear and it is not as if his mental illness is not something that could not be managed, in fact was for a short period of time, and it is not as if his mental illness interfered with his basic cognitive abilities either....Turning to the issue of mental illness, his longstanding association with a psychiatrist and other supports in the community are set out in the PSR.It appears that he is someone who suffers from schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder, and also has seizures.I am not sure what the basis of it is, but there is some suggestion of nerve damage, and ADHD...[11]In order for a mental illness to be considered as a mitigating factor in sentencing, the offender must show a causal link between his illness and his criminal conduct, that is, the illness is an underlying reason for his aberrant conduct:R. v. Robinson, [1974] O.J. No. 585 (C.A.).[12]Further, there must be evidence that a lengthy sentence would have a severe negative effect on the offender such that it should be reduced on compassionate grounds.[13]The evidence before the sentencing judge did not support such a conclusion in this case.Some of his offences occurred before he discontinued his medications and some after.Neither of his psychologist or psychiatrist supported the theory of a causal link between his illness and his behaviour.Further, although his psychiatrist described him as “vulnerable”, there was no evidence that the negative impact of prison would reach the level required to warrant a reduced sentence.[15]The sentencing judge was very concerned about the proper dispositions of this matter; she adjourned the sentencing hearing twice to think further and to carefully consider the appropriate sentence, taking into account the needs of the appellant and of her obligation to protect society.[16]She said:...To be frank, I have been over and over the materials a few times, have come to a situation where I actually don’t agree with either party in terms of their submission.Through that process, I have moments of difficulty, I would confess, even agreeing with myself.What it really gets down to is that it is very difficult to punish someone with a harsh or at least a long sentence when one knows very well that there is an underlying mental illness.Being punished when you are ill is problematic.On the other hand, there are other considerations that have to be brought to bear and it is not as if his mental illness is not something that could not be managed, in fact was for a short period of time, and it is not as if his mental illness interfered with his basic cognitive abilities either.[17]The global sentence of 6 years, after the credit of 2 years, is a fit sentence in the circumstances of this case.The sentencing judge did not err in law.[18]We considered the fresh evidence that the appellant wished to tender about his current psychological condition and observe that it would not affect our decision.[19]The appeal is dismissed.RELEASED:“DOC”“FEB 03 2012”“O’Connor J.

Faria............................................................................for the CrownMr. J.L. Hill.......................................................................................................for Brian DempseyBovard J.:[1]This is an Application by Detective Brian Borg, a peace officer of the City of Toronto, under s.487.055 (1) of the Criminal Code for an Authorization to take bodily substances for forensic DNA analysis. Ms. S. Orlando and Ms. C. C. Faria appear for the Crown on the Application.Mr. J.L. Hill appears for Brian Dempsey, the subject of the Application.Disposition[2]After considering all of the evidence, the relevant law and the submissions of counsel, I find that the Applicant has satisfied all of the requirements of s. 487.055 (1), and that it is in the best interests of the administration of justice that pursuant to that section I authorize in Form 5.06 the taking, from Brian Dempsey, for the purposes of forensic DNA analysis, of any number of samples of bodily substances that is reasonably required for that purpose, by means of the investigative procedures described in subsection 487.06 (1).Background[3]On July 22, 1997 Mr. Justice Ferguson of the Ontario Court (General Division), as it then was, sentenced Brian Dempsey to eight years in the penitentiary for manslaughter.Mr. Dempsey’s warrant expiry date was July 21, 2005.However, it was extended by two days because Mr. Dempsey was released on statutory release on August 30, 2004 and this statutory release was suspended on September 4, 2004. He was not arrested until two days later, so he was at large without authorization for those two days, and consequently, his sentence was not running during those two days.Therefore, his warrant expiry date had to be extended by two days to July 23, 2005.[1] This Application was filed in the Ontario Court of Justice on July 22, 2005.Issues[4]The issues raised by defence counsel are the following.1. The Application is out of time by one day.2. The Application does not comply with the spirit of the substantive and proce-dural requirements of s. 487.055 and with the principles of fairness.3. The Crown did not prove that s. 487.055 is legitimate legislation.[5]The enabling legislation pursuant to which Detective Borg makes his Application is s.487.055 (1) of the Criminal Code. I will set out the subsections that are relevant to the Application before me.487.055(1) Offenders serving sentencesA provincial court judge may, on ex parte application made in Form 5.05, authorize in Form 5.06 the taking, for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis, of any number of samples of bodily substances that is reasonably required for that purpose, by means of the investigative procedures described in subsection 487.06(1), from a person who, before June 30, 2000,(e) had been convicted of manslaughter and, on the date of the application, is serving a sentence of imprisonment of at least two years for that offence.487.055(2) CertificateThe application shall be accompanied by a certificate referred to in paragraph 667(1)(a) that establishes that the person is a person referred to in subsection (1). The certificate may be received in evidence without giving the notice referred to in subsection 667(4).487.055(3.1) CriteriaIn deciding whether to grant an authorization under subsection (1), the court shall consider the person's criminal record, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission and the impact such an authorization would have on the privacy and security of the person and shall give reasons for its decision.(1) Is the Application out of time?(2) Is the Application deficient substantively or procedurally?[6]These two issues are so intertwined that I have to discuss them together. Defence counsel, Mr. Hill, pointed out that subsection 487.055 (1) (e) requires that Mr. Dempsey be “serving a sentence of imprisonment of at least two years” for his manslaughter conviction on the date that the Application is made. Mr. Dempsey was sentenced to eight years in prison on July 22, 1997.His warrant expiry date would be July 21, 2005. The Application was filed with the Court on July 22, 2005; therefore, the Crown is late by one day.[7]The evidence that Mr. Dempsey is “serving a sentence of at least two years” for his manslaughter conviction is a letter from, Leslie Milbury, which is exhibit 4 to Applicant’s Affidavit. The letter states:The sentence on Manslaughter originally ran from 22 Jul 97 to 21 Jul 05.However, Mr. Dempsey was released on statutory release on 30 Aug 04; the statutory release was suspended on 04 Sep 04; he was not arrested until two days later, i.e. 07 Sep 04. Consequently, the end date of 21 Jul 05 had to be adjusted to 23 Jul 05 to reflect those two days at large.[8]Mr. Hill concedes that if this letter is accepted as evidence, the Crown has satisfied all of the requirements of s. 487.055 (1) and the Application succeeds.However, he argues that it should not be accepted as evidence for the following reasons.1.It is not in the form of an Affidavit and it should be, because it would make the procedure fairer.2.Ms. Milbury should have provided an explanation of how the warrant expiry date was calculated, and the decision sheets of the Parole Board that suspended Mr. Dempsey’s statutory release should have been provided.3.Ms. Milbury does not refer to the fact that Mr. Dempsey’s criminal record shows that he was released on statutory release on November 20, 2002 and recommitted on February 25, 2003. She only mentions the statutory release and recommittal that occurred in August and September of 2004.[9]With regard to the first point, there is nothing in s. 487.055 (1) that requires that the information given by Ms. Milbury be in Affidavit form.And Mr. Hill did not provide any authority that would require it.Neither did he present any persuasive argument that it should be so.In R. v. Jackpine[2] Mr. Justice Doherty explained the nature of these Applications.In holding that notice should generally be given to the subject of the application, I do not mean to suggest that a proceeding under s. 487.055(1) should take on the trappings of a criminal trial. I see no place for the strict application of the rules of evidence, the assigning of burdens of proof or the re-litigation of factual or legal issues decided in previous proceedings involving the offender who is the subject of the application. A summary form of procedure would be appropriate as long as it would allow for the effective exercise of the discretion called for under the section, and would be responsive to the particular issues that arise on the specific application. I would think that in most cases the judge can rely on transcripts from prior proceedings, pre-sentence reports, victim impact statements and criminal records unless the subject of the application, having been given an opportunity to do so, can show cause why the material should not be relied on by the judge. The manner in which the subject of the application can challenge the Crown material should depend on the nature of the challenge and the nature of the material. I do not think that cross-examination will always be necessary to afford the requisite procedural fairness. Procedural matters will have to be worked out on a case-by-case basis. (Emphasis Added)[10]Jackpine stands for the proposition that these Applications should proceed under much less stringent evidentiary requirements than do trials.I cannot see any reason why in the case at bar the information that Ms. Milbury gave in her letter, which is an exhibit to the Applicant’s Affidavit in support of the Application, should be in Affidavit form.I cannot see how it would make the procedure fairer as argued by Mr. Hill. It is not her Application; it is Detective Borg’s.[11]With regard to the second point, Ms. Milbury did provide an explanation of how the warrant expiry date was calculated. She is the Regional Advisor for Sentence Management for the Correctional Service of Canada. Her qualifications to state what she did in her letter were not challenged by the defence, and there is nothing before me on which I could base a doubt about her competence to make the statements, or on which I could found a doubt about the calculation of Mr. Dempsey’s warrant expiry date.[12]Mr. Hill further argued that Ms. Milbury did not make reference to the fact that Mr. Dempsey’s criminal record (Exhibit 2 to Detective Borg’s Affidavit) shows that he was released on statutory release on November 20, 2002 and recommitted on February 25, 2003 for violating his release.Mr. Hill submitted that leaving this information out of her letter shows that she was “wrong”. However, there is nothing before me that makes this omission relevant to the calculation of his warrant expiry date on the manslaughter conviction, therefore, I conclude that it is of no consequence to the calculation that Ms. Milbury made.[13]Mr. Hill also urged me not to accept the CPIC print out of Mr. Dempsey’s criminal record as evidence.He analogized to a sentencing hearing where the accused person must admit the criminal record before it is considered by the sentencing judge.[14]He suggested that the Crown should be required to produce certified copies of all warrants of committal and attach them as exhibits to the Affidavit in support of the Application.First of all, this is not a sentencing hearing so Mr. Hill’s analogy is flawed.Secondly, as Dougherty J.A. stated in Jackpine (supra):…in most cases the judge can rely on transcripts from prior proceedings, pre-sentence reports, victim impact statements and criminal records unless the subject of the application, having been given an opportunity to do so, can show cause why the material should not be relied on by the judge. (Emphasis Added)[15]I cannot see any reason not to rely on the CPIC print out of Mr. Dempsey’s criminal record. In addition to the CPIC print out, Exhibit 1 of Detective Borg’s Affidavit is the Certificate Of Conviction Or Discharge of Mr. Dempsey’s conviction for manslaughter on July 22, 1997.Mr. Dempsey’s fingerprints accompany this document and a named fingerprint examiner certified that he was indeed convicted of that offence on that date.[16]The last point that Mr. Hill made regarding Ms. Milbury’s letter is that she, or the Applicant, should have provided the Parole Board’s decision sheets regarding the suspension of Mr. Dempsey’s statutory release.[17]He submits that in order for two days to be added to Mr. Dempsey’s manslaughter sentence, he would have had to appear before the Parole Board at a post suspension hearing. But then he said that it was unlikely that such a hearing would have taken place, because Mr. Dempsey was awaiting trial for possession of stolen property, for which he was convicted on September 15, 2004 and received a consecutive 15 month jail term.[18]He goes on to speculate that if the Parole Board cancelled the suspension, then the two extra days would not have been added to his manslaughter sentence.He states that in order to prove that the Application is within the statutory time limit prescribed in s. 487.055 (1), the Crown has to produce the decision sheets showing that they decided to revoke his statutory release before he was sentenced on the possession of stolen property charge.Because if the Parole Board revoked his statutory release, and the two days that he was at large were added to his manslaughter sentence after he was sentenced on the possession of stolen property charge, the two sentences would have merged. This is important because according to R. v. Carrignan (2003), 2003 CanLII 19233 (ON CA), 172 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (C.A.), for the purpose of s. 487.055 (1), consecutive sentences cannot be merged into one sentence for determining whether on the date of the Application Mr. Dempsey was serving the manslaughter sentence.[19]I find this submission confusing in that Mr. Hill is requesting decision sheets from a Parole Board hearing that he states probably did not take place.Even assuming, without finding, that the Crown should have produced the decision sheets, I do not know how the Crown can produce something that, according to the defence, more likely than not does not exist.Furthermore, there is no authority that says that the Crown is required to produce every single document that might be available to establish the criteria set out in s. 487.055(1).[20]If one document suffices, is not necessary to produce one or two additional documents that prove the same thing.In a different set of circumstances Mr. Hill’s argument could potentially have merit.But in the case before me, I find that his argument rests on the hypothetical and theoretical plane and, therefore, it has no specific application to the case before me.I find that Ms. Milbury’s letter more than serves to establish Mr. Dempsey’s warrant expiry date, especially in the absence of any tenable challenge to her statements. In terms of the evidentiary quality of Ms. Milbury’s letter, I find that it is greatly similar to a pre-sentence report or a victim impact statement, which are documents on which Jackpine (Supra) said I can rely.[21]Mr. Hill also argued that adding the time that elapsed between the issuance of the warrant of suspension of Mr. Dempsey’s statutory release and its execution to his warrant expiry date for the manslaughter sentence is an administrative act.And this should only be done after the Parole Board decides to revoke his statutory release.Until the Parole Board decides to revoke his statutory release it is not final that the two days he was at large before the warrant of suspension was executed should properly be added to his sentence, because pursuant to s.135 (11) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act[3], if the Board decides not to uphold the suspension, those two days will be credited to his sentence.This also conforms with s. 128 (1) of the Act which states that, “An offender who is released on…statutory release…continues, while entitled to be at large, to serve the sentence until its expiration according to law.”[22]He submitted that even after the Parole Board revokes an inmate’s statutory release, the adding of the time that the person was at large between the issuance of the warrant of suspension of a statutory release and its execution, is an administrative penalty more akin to a consecutive sentence than an alteration of the original sentence.On this point it seems to me that if a person is sentenced to a penitentiary sentence and receives a statutory release which is suspended and that suspension is upheld by the Parole Board, the time that the person spent at large illegally before being re-incarcerated cannot count against his or her sentence.Otherwise, if the person is at large for one year, for example, and then was caught, he or she would have cheated the administration of justice out of one year of the sentence, and the court’s sentence would have been frustrated to that extent.[23]As Ms. Faria, the Crown, argued, such a person was sentenced to a term in jail fixed by the judge. If the person is found to have been at large illegally, he or she has to make up that time in order that the judge’s sentence be completely purged.[24]Mr. Hill said that the Corrections and Conditional Release Act does not address this problem and that there is no authority on this point. In a case like the one before me, where there has been no conviction for unlawfully at large, and no proof that the Parole Board revoked the statutory release, the time spent out of custody between the issuance of the warrant of suspension of the statutory release and its execution, should not be added to the sentence.Therefore, the Application is out of time.[25]These are interesting arguments, but the Crown has produced a letter from the Regional Advisor for Sentence Management for the Correctional Service of Canada that states that Mr. Dempsey’s warrant expiry date was extended by two days because his statutory release was suspended and he was not arrested for two days.I find that prima facie this letter is credible and trustworthy and is sufficient to establish that Mr. Dempsey’s warrant expiry date for the manslaughter conviction was extended by the two days that he was at large between the issuance of the warrant of suspension of his statutory release and its execution.The defence did not cross-examine the Applicant on his Affidavit, nor did it call evidence to undermine Ms. Milbury’s statements. I find that Jackpine allows me to rely on evidence such as Ms. Milbury’s letter, “unless the subject of the application, having been given an opportunity to do so, can show cause why the material should not be relied on…”[26]I do not agree with the defence that Mr. Dempsey has to be found guilty of being unlawfully at large before the extension of his warrant expiry date would be legal. Mr. Hill did not give me any authority to support this argument and based on my reading of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act I cannot find any such requirement before an inmate’s statutory release is suspended and or revoked. Mr. Hill concedes that “ …in calculations of warrant expiry date, the Correctional Service of Canada routinely moves the warrant expiry date forward when the National Parole Board at a post suspension hearing revokes the conditional release of an offender by an amount equal to the full days between the signing of a warrant of suspension and the offender’s return to custody under that warrant. In Mr. Dempsey’s case that period is 2 days.” [4]He argues that there is not authority in the Criminal Code or in the Corrections and Conditional Release Act to do this.Therefore, it is an administrative act that has not been challenged.[27]I find that it is quite logical not to credit an inmate with time during which he or she was at liberty while his or her statutory release was suspended or revoked.The reasonableness of doing this is so obvious that there is no need for “authority” to justify it.[28]Contrary to Mr. Hill’s argument, the adding on of this time is not a presumption that he is guilty of the offence of being unlawfully at large, nor is it an “administrative extension” of the original sentence. It is simply the carrying out the sentence that Mr. Justice Ferguson passed on Mr. Dempsey by adding the two days to his warrant expiry date during which he was not legally at large.[29]It is telling that Mr. Hill does not contest the new warrant expiry date for Mr. Dempsey.Rather, he argues that the Crown should have produced the Parole Board’s decision sheets concerning its review of the suspension of his statutory release. This submission is premised on a contention that the Crown has to prove that the Board upheld the suspension and revoked his statutory release before I can find that the two extra days were properly added to his warrant expiry date. Mr. Hill argued forcefully that I not accept Ms. Milbury’s letter, however, in the absence of information, evidence, or arguments based on more than speculation and conjecture that undermine Ms. Milbury’s letter, I find that the Crown is entitled to rely on the letter to establish that Mr. Dempsey’s warrant expiry date was properly extended by the two days that he was at large without authorization between the issuance of the warrant of suspension of his statutory release and its execution.[30]I agree with Ms. Faria’s submission that in keeping with the spirit of Jackpine (Supra) these Applications should not be turned into trials. Innocence is not at stake and that is an important factor in why Mr. Justice Dougherty said that the proceedings under s. 487.055 (1) should not “take on the trappings of a criminal trial” and that there is “no place for the strict application of the rules of evidence [or] the assigning of burdens of proof…”, and that, “A summary form of procedure would be appropriate as long as it would allow for the effective exercise of the discretion called for under the section, and would be responsive to the particular issues that arise on the specific application.”[31]For the reasons stated above, I find that in the case before me the evidence that the Crown adduced is sufficient for me to effectively exercise the discretion called for under s. 487.055 (1) and to adequately respond to the issue of Mr. Dempsey’s proper warrant expiry date.The Crown did not prove that s. 487.055 is legitimate legislation.[32]Mr. Hill’s last argument is that s. 487.055 (1) is unconstitutional.He concedes that Jackpine decided that it is, and that I am bound by that decision.However, he makes the argument, as was done in Jackpine, to preserve his right to make this argument at a later date should the Supreme Court of Canada hold that it is unconstitutional.Evidently, the Supreme Court is going to decide the issue later this year.Therefore, being bound by Jackpine, I reject this argument.[33]I will not discuss the other requirements in s. 487.055 (1) because the defence concedes them.Disposition[34]After considering all of the evidence, the relevant law and the submissions of counsel, I find that the Applicant has satisfied all of the requirements of s. 487.055 (1), and that it is in the best interests of the administration of justice that pursuant to that section I authorize in Form 5.06 the taking, from Brian Dempsey, for the purposes of forensic DNA analysis, of any number of samples of bodily substances that is reasonably required for that purpose, by means of the investigative procedures described in subsection 487.06 (1).Released:October 17, 2005Signed: “Justice J.

G.APPELLANT / accusedv.HER MAJESTY THE QUEENRESPONDENT / prosecutrixJUDGMENT[1]On September 25, 2010, a jury convicted the appellant of 11 charges relating to various acts of conjugal and family violence. On January 5, 2011, the Superior Court, District of Montreal (the Honourable Claude Champagne), sentenced the appellant to a total of 30 months’ imprisonment (36 months less 3 months of detention between the verdict and sentencing, which were given double credit).[2]The appellant is appealing the convictions, and in this regard he obtained an extension of the deadline to appeal.[1] He now asks to be released from custody pending the outcome of the appeal proceedings.[3]This application is governed by paragraphs 679 (1)(a) and (3) Cr. C.:679. (1) A judge of the court of appeal may, in accordance with this section, release an appellant from custody pending the determination of his appeal if,(a) in the case of an appeal to the court of appeal against conviction, the appellant has given notice of appeal or, where leave is required, notice of his application for leave to appeal pursuant to section 678;…(3) In the case of an appeal referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (c), the judge of the court of appeal may order that the appellant be released pending the determination of his appeal if the appellant establishes that(a) the appeal or application for leave to appeal is not frivolous;(b) he will surrender himself into custody in accordance with the terms of the order; and(c) his detention is not necessary in the public interest.…[4]Are the criteria, which are cumulative, prescribed by this section met? The appellant has the burden of establishing that they are.[5]Is the appeal frivolous? As noted above, the appellant has obtained an extension of the deadline to appeal. This means that a judge of this Court has already ruled that the grounds of appeal are arguable, or serious if one prefers, in accordance with the standard set out in Lamontagne v. R., 1994 CanLII 6295 (QC CA), J.E. 95-28 (C.A.), which has since been applied consistently by this Court. That standard is analogous to the one applicable to release from custody pursuant to paragraph 679(3)(a) Cr. C. Commenting on this provision in Guité v. R., 2006 QCCA 905 (CanLII), [2006] R.J.Q. 2049 (C.A.), Doyon J.A. explained that:[translation][7]Moreover, the applicant is not required to prove that his grounds of appeal are well founded. It is sufficient for him to establish that the issues raised are arguable (Garneau v. R., 1997 CanLII 9947 (QC CA), REJB 1997-04154, (C.A.)), and he is not required to demonstrate that his grounds have a strong chance of success (R. v. S. (J.T.) (1996), 1996 ABCA 374 (CanLII), 4 C.R. (5th) 19 (Alta. C.A.)).[8]As Rochon J.A. noted in Duhamel v. R., 2002 CanLII 41275 (QC CA), REJB 2002-35700 (C.A.), it is inappropriate for the judge seized of such a motion to rule on the merits of the underlying case. That said, the judge must answer the question regarding the frivolousness of the appeal because that is one of the factors to consider. This does not, however, in any way bind the bench that will hear the appeal. Therefore, I need not rule on the actual strength of the grounds of appeal, which is the role of the judges seized of the appeal on its merits, but solely on the frivolousness of these grounds.[6]In the circumstances, it would be inconsistent to conclude now that the appellant’s grounds of appeal are frivolous, considering that a judge of this Court has already found them to be arguable.[7]The Crown asserts, however, that it is actually impossible to assess the grounds of appeal since the appellant did not join to his application the relevant passages of the trial transcripts, without which the grounds of appeal cannot be assessed. It asserts that this is particularly true with respect to the third ground as we do not know why the judge dismissed the objection and that, consequently, it is impossible to know whether the appellant has any reason to complain.[8]Further, according to the Crown, if these transcripts had been filed, they would not support what the appellant now asserts. In regard to the first ground (discussion between the judge and a prospective juror), the transcripts would show that the appellant now adopts a position contrary to that he took before the trial judge. With respect to the second ground, the transcripts would show that the appellant’s attorney declared that he was satisfied with the judge’s instructions to the jury and the manner in which the judge managed the incident that he now criticizes.[9]In regard to the final ground of appeal, the Crown asserts that it lacks sufficient detail to communicate the actual issue.[10]In the circumstances, these arguments are not convincing, and the Crown’s assertion goes too far. First of all, the grounds set out in the notice of appeal are sufficiently detailed to allow one to form a preliminary idea and appear serious on their face. While it is true that the appellant must demonstrate that his grounds of appeal are not frivolous and must include support for this with his application, he is not required to provide the equivalent of that which will be necessary to decide the appeal on its merits. Yet that seems to be what the Crown is insisting on here. Moreover, considering that the grounds of appeal were already found to be arguable at the stage of the extension of the deadline to appeal, the Crown could have supported its challenge more substantially by adding something to demonstrate the frivolousness of the grounds of appeal. What has been put forth in this regard is not sufficient.[11]The appeal appears arguable. The first criterion is thus met.[12]Will the appellant surrender himself into custody in accordance with the terms of the order of this Court, if applicable? This criterion is set out in paragraph 679(3)(b) Cr. C., and the Crown does not dispute that it is met. The appellant was released throughout the duration of the trial proceedings (approximately eighteen months) and was incarcerated only after the guilty verdict was rendered. He complied with the conditions imposed on him and surrendered when so ordered without attempting to escape justice. There is nothing to suggest that he would behave differently now or that there is a serious risk in this regard.[13]Is the detention of the appellant necessary in the public interest? According to Takri v. R., 2010 QCCA 1064 (CanLII), J.E. 2010-1060, this criterion [translation] “refers to both protection and safety of the public as well as public confidence in the administration of justice, having regard to the circumstances of the case (R. v. Rochon, 2008 QCCA 2142 (CanLII), 2008 QCCA 2142 (C.A.)”.[14]The Crown does not dispute that the first part of this criterion is met. The fact that the appellant was released without incident throughout the duration of the trial proceedings demonstrates that there is no threat, or at least no apparent threat, to the safety of the public, including that of the complainants. With respect to the complainants, it should be noted that the appellant’s release from custody, if ordered, will be subject to conditions that the appellant will be required to strictly observe and that are intended to protect them. It goes without saying that any deviation from these conditions would be sanctioned by the appellant’s immediate incarceration.[15]With respect to the second part of this criterion, however, the Crown claims that the appellant’s release from custody would likely undermine public confidence in the justice system in view of the seriousness and the number of offences of which the appellant has been convicted, as well as the aggravating factors listed in the sentencing decision. At this stage, the appellant no longer benefits from the presumption of innocence, and this should also be taken into consideration. Also to be considered is the fact that the Crown, which sought a seven-year prison sentence at trial, has been granted leave to appeal the sentence, which in its view is too lenient.[16]After careful consideration, the undersigned is not convinced by these arguments. Rather, it seems that an informed public, aware that the appeal is not frivolous and that the appellant will surrender himself into custody if so ordered, would accept the appellant’s release during the appeal proceedings. In Pearson v. R., J.E. 90-832 (C.A.), Fish J.A. stated that:An informed public, fully appreciative of the rules applicable under our system of justice, would in my respectful view endorse the interim release of the Appellant in this matter, bearing in mind that his appeal is on its face serious, that he appears likely to surrender if his appeal fails, certain to be unnecessarily punished if his appeal succeeds, and that it has not been contended that he will commit further offences if he is set free.[17]These words, written in 1990, remain true 21 years later and are particularly appropriate in this case. It is true that the crimes are inherently serious, but in the circumstances, this alone cannot justify keeping the appellant incarcerated during the appeal. As Doyon J.A. noted in Guité v. R., supra:[translation][6]In regard to the first, the crimes are serious, but the seriousness of the offence does not mean that the appellant must necessarily be incarcerated pending the outcome of the appeal. No offence, even the most serious, is excluded.[18]As noted above, at trial the Crown sought a seven-year prison sentence and requested that the appellant not be eligible for parole until after having served half of his sentence. The sentence imposed by the judge, however, in what appears to be a carefully thought-out decision, was 36 months, which provides an indication of the objective and subjective seriousness of the crimes from his perspective. Moreover, the judge explicitly refused to order that the appellant serve half of his sentence before being eligible for parole. The only indisputable element that we have in this case is that the trial judge presided the trial and heard the witnesses (the appellant did not testify), and the sentence that he imposed in full knowledge of the circumstances is presumed to be valid and just, which allows us to gauge the seriousness of the crimes at issue. That the Crown is appealing this sentence should not lead us to conclude that his release from custody should be refused. Moreover, the fact that crimes of conjugal and family violence are at issue is not a bar to release, as demonstrated by the abundant case law in this regard.[19]Other factors must also be considered. The appellant has an occupation (although he is not currently employed). If he is released, he will have a fixed address. Most of all, he did not breach the conditions of his release during the proceedings before the Superior Court.He does not engage in a lifestyle that could be qualified as criminal (although he does have a criminal record dating back to 1999 for having used a stolen credit card). He is certainly not an exemplary citizen, but the public will bear in mind that if his appeal is dismissed, he will serve his sentence. The same public will also bear in mind that if his appeal is allowed, he would have likely served a good part of this sentence unnecessarily.[20]The third criterion of paragraph 679(3) Cr. C., like the first two, is also met. The appellant should therefore be released from custody, subject however to certain conditions.[21]FOR THESE REASONS, THE UNDERSIGNED:[22]GRANTS the appellant’s application for release from custody;[23]ORDERS that the appellant be released from custody on the following conditions:-Keep the peace, be of good behaviour, and appear before the court when required;-Reside at ..., City of A, Quebec;-Not change addresses without the prior authorization of the Court or one of its judges;-Not leave the province of Quebec without the prior authorization of the Court or one of it judges;-Inform the Court in writing of the name and contact information of his employer, within ten (10) days of the date of finding a job;-Appear at the police station closest to his residence, once a week on Wednesday, to report and sign the register, starting on Wednesday, March 23, 2011;-Not be within a 100-metre radius of the domicile or workplace of S.

O. and the members of her immediate family, except in the context of the dispute between the parties in the Superior Court and, in such case, always in the presence of his attorney or the attorney of Ms. O., and except in accordance and into order to comply with the orders of the Superior Court in regard to custody of the children or visitation rights, as applicable;-Deposit his Canadian and Algerian passports with the registry of the trial court within 24 hours of his release from custody and not apply for another passport from any other authority whatsoever;-Formally abstain from possessing or carrying, in any capacity whatsoever, offensive or restricted weapons, or imitation weapons, including starter pistols and pellet guns, firearms, crossbows, prohibited weapons, restricted weapons, prohibited devices, ammunition, prohibited ammunition, explosive substances, knives (except in restaurants for a legitimate purpose), and bladed weapons;-On the eve of the hearing of the appeal by this Court, surrender himself by 6 p.m. at the latest to the Regional Reception Centre in Saint-Anne-des-Plaines (246 Montée-Gagnon, Saint-Anne-des-Plaines, Quebec). The Court will decide at the hearing what is to happen next in terms of release from custody, if applicable.[24]ORDERS that these undertakings be given before a justice of peace designated for this purpose before the appellant is released from custody.MARIE-FRANCE BICH, J.A.Mtre Denis PoitrasFor the appellantMtre Michel PennouCriminal and penalprosecutorFor the respondentDate of hearing:February 28, 2011[1]L.G. v.

Abrametz for the AppellantDavid Kim Jones for the CrownAppeal:From:Provincial CourtHeard:February 10, 2011Disposition:Allowed (orally)Written Reasons: February 16, 2011By:The Honourable Mr. Justice CaldwellIn Concurrence:The Honourable Madam Justice JacksonThe Honourable Madam Justice SmithCaldwell J.A.Introduction[1]The appellant appealed from his sentenced of eight months imprisonment, followed by 12 months probation, imposed following his plea of guilt to the offence of wilful obstruction of a public officer or peace officer in the execution of his duty, pursuant to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code.[2]At the appeal hearing, the appellant sought to adduce fresh evidence before this Court.We granted leave to adduce extracts from notes taken by the arresting police officer, Constable Bear of the Prince Albert Police Service, and evidence as to the appellant’s ongoing attendance at a post-secondary industrial mechanics course.[3]We allowed the appeal in brief oral reasons with these written reasons to follow.Background[4]The following paragraphs summarize the events underlying the conviction for obstruction.Where specific times are set forth, those times were drawn from the extracts of Constable Bear’s notes admitted into evidence before this Court.This information was not before the sentencing judge.[5]On February 17, 2008, a number of individuals attended a party in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, at which alcohol and some drugs were consumed.Between 5:00 a.m. and 5:30 a.m., the appellant, Cody Wiegers, Samantha Hodder, Chelsea Dagenais and one other individual left the party in the appellant’s truck.These individuals decided that Mr. Wiegers should drive as Mr. Wiegers was either the least intoxicated or the most sober of the group.Mr. Wiegers was 15 years old and did not possess a valid driver’s licence.[6]The roads were extremely icy that night and, as Mr. Wiegers drove down 22nd Street East in Prince Albert, he lost control of the vehicle and it rolled.Ms. Dagenais and Ms. Hodder were ejected from the vehicle in the course of the accident.Residents in the area noticed the accident and called for the police and an ambulance.[7]Before the police arrived, the appellant and Mr. Wiegers determined that the group should tell the police that the appellant was driving the vehicle. All of them agreed to this suggestion and, apparently, told the police that the appellant had been driving.[8]When the police arrived at approximately 5:44 a.m., the appellant identified himself as the driver.Constable Bear quickly noted that the appellant was exhibiting indicia of impairment and, at 6:04 a.m., demanded that he provide a breath sample.By 6:07 a.m., Constable Bear and the appellant were on their way to the police station so the appellant could provide a breath sample.The remaining four occupants of the vehicle were all taken to hospital to be examined for injuries.[9]At the police station, Constable Bear cautioned the appellant and, between 6:15 a.m. and 6:23 a.m., the appellant made several unsuccessful attempts to contact his lawyer.At approximately 6:23 a.m., the appellant, when asked if he had any questions for Constable Bear, said: “Why am I here?”Constable Bear reminded the appellant that he was to provide samples of his breath.At this point, the appellant recanted from his statement that he had been driving.When reminded of what he had told Constable Bear at the scene of the accident, the appellant said: “Well, I lied up there.”[10]At 6:25 a.m., another constable spoke with the appellant about providing breath samples.The police subsequently obtained breath samples indicating that the appellant had 160 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood – or twice the legal limit.[11]Although lucid at the scene, Ms. Hodder had suffered a number of fractured ribs, one of which had punctured a lung and resulted in significant blood loss.Ms. Hodder passed away from her injuries shortly after arriving at the hospital.She was 16 years of age.[12]When the police became aware of Ms. Hodder’s death, they re-warned the appellant on the charge of impaired driving causing death.At this point, the appellant again told the police that he had not been driving at the time of the accident.However, given that the statements from the passengers all indicated that the appellant had been the driver, the police were sceptical of the appellant’s second attempt to recant from his earlier statement.[13]By the time the police acted on the new information that Mr. Wiegers had been driving, they were not allowed to make a breath demand upon Mr. Wiegers as the three hour window to do so had elapsed.While the police did obtain new witness statements and a warrant for any bodily substances that may have been taken from Mr. Wiegers at the hospital, the evidence obtained was insufficient to show intoxication or impairment on his part.The police did not obtain a warned statement from Mr. Wiegers.[14]Approximately two years later, the police charged the appellant with obstruction.Analysis[15]The Supreme Court of Canada concisely summarized the principles of appellate review of sentence decisions in R. v. L.M., 2008 SCC 31 (CanLII), [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163:[14]... [A]ppellate courts must show great deference in reviewing decisions of trial judges where appeals against sentence are concerned. An appellate court may not vary a sentence simply because it would have ordered a different one. The court must be ‘convinced it is not fit’, that is, ‘that ...the sentence [is] clearly unreasonable’ (R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, at para. 46, quoted in R. v. McDonnell, 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at para. 15). This Court also made the following comment in R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 90:...absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary [page 173] a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit.[15]Owing to the profoundly contextual nature of the sentencing process, in which the trier of fact has broad discretion, the standard of review to be applied by an appellate court is one based on deference. The sentencing judge has ‘served on the front lines of our criminal justice system’ and possesses unique qualifications in terms of experience and the ability to assess the submissions of the Crown and the offender (M. (C.A.), at para. 91).[16]The appellant’s crime was that of wilful obstruction pursuant to s. 129(a) of the Criminal Code, which reads:129. Offences relating to public or peace officerEvery one who(a)resists or wilfully obstructs a public officer or peace officer in the execution of his duty or any person lawfully acting in aid of such an officer,…is guilty of(d)an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or(e)an offence punishable on summary conviction.[17]A sentence should be proportionate to the seriousness of the crime committed.Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code also mandates that the sentencing judge give the degree of responsibility of the offender equal consideration.In applying the standard of review in this appeal, we were of the view that the sentencing judge committed errors of principle that led to a mischaracterization of the seriousness of the offence committed by the appellant and, thus, to a mischaracterization of the moral culpability of the appellant.These errors in principle warranted appellate intervention.[18]First, the sentencing judge failed to consider a relevant factor – the nature of the appellant’s offence.The facts of this case are peculiar.The appellant did not lie to the police to avoid criminal liability, as is usually the case under s. 129(a).In this case, the appellant had no criminal liability to avoid.Here, the appellant lied to the police in a futile attempt to preserve the insurance on his vehicle (See Transcript, at p. 12-13).However, aside from insurance fraud, the effect of the appellant’s lie was that he temporarily assumed responsibility for having driven the vehicle, and he appears not to have appreciated the legal ramifications of that assumption of responsibility. This peculiarity complicates the determination of an appropriate sentence for the appellant.Sentences for obstruction are generally imposed contemporaneously with sentences for the primary offences (from which the accused had sought to avoid criminal liability by obstructing the police) and are either said to run concurrent or form part of a global sentence.In that respect, a concurrent or global sentence of incarceration on a conviction for obstruction does not further the sentencing principles of denunciation and deterrence beyond the primary offences and, accordingly, the case law is of little assistance.Here, obstruction is the only offence and an appropriate sentence must, of itself, fit the circumstances within the fundamental purpose and the principles of sentencing.[19]Second, the sentencing judge overemphasized two relevant factors – the seriousness of the offence and appellant’s moral culpability.This second error stems from the sentencing judge’s misapprehensions as to the evidence and the improper tying of the appellant’s offence to the death of Ms. Hodder.[20]Although entirely inadvertent, the sentencing judge was under the misapprehension that the appellant only recanted from his statement that he was the driver upon being charged with impaired driving causing death (see the Transcript, at p. 6).The Crown acknowledged before us that the appellant in fact recanted from his statement before the police became aware of Ms. Hodder’s death and before the police had re-warned and charged him with impaired driving causing her death.Constable Bear’s notes, admitted as fresh evidence in this appeal, substantiate this fact.However, through no fault of his own, the sentencing judge had a different understanding of the facts and one that could serve to inappropriately inflate the appellant’s moral culpability for the offence.[21]Similarly, by tying the appellant’s offence to the death of Ms. Hodder, the sentencing judge improperly determined the seriousness of that offence, and inflated the appellant’s moral culpability, on the basis of the impact of Ms. Hodder’s death on her family.The sentencing judge may have fallen into this error by being misdirected to the victim impact statements submitted in this case.These victim impact statements were inappropriate as Ms. Hodder’s death, and the overwhelming loss suffered by Ms. Hodder’s family as a result, did not arise from the commission of the appellant’s offence (see s. 722(1)).[22]The characterization of Ms. Hodder as the victim of the appellant’s offence is fundamentally flawed and served to overemphasize the seriousness of the offence.The determination of the “seriousness” of the appellant’s crime must be tied to the offence of obstruction, not the traffic accident that served to precipitate the offence, nor its consequences.At the time he committed his offence (by lying to the police) he could not have known that Ms. Hodder was fatally injured.Her death and its consequences cannot be properly factored into the gravity of his conduct for the purposes of determining the seriousness of his offence or his moral blameworthiness.In other words, the sentencing judge improperly magnified the gravity of the unlawful act committed by the appellant by focusing on the death of Ms. Hodder and impact of her death on her family and, thereby, also inflated the appellant’s moral culpability.[23]Third, the sentencing judge incorrectly assumed that the appellant was at fault for Mr. Wiegers escaping criminal liability for impaired driving causing death.The following is found at pp. 10-13 of the transcript:THE COURT:Thank you very much.Well, you can remain standing, please.I’m going to – I’m not going to adjourn sentencing in this matter.I’ll simply sentence him today at this point.Certainly, it’s a very useful thing for the courts, as well as for those in attendance and the family and relatives to hear what you have to say, most particularly because Wiegers obviously does not feel the same way.Cody Wiegers – that’s his first name, isn’t it, Cody?MR. SCOTT:Yes, it is, Your Honour.THE COURT:-- has appeared in front of me almost monthly for a long time in the last number of months.He continues to commit criminal offences and continues to be under the eye of the police.I can only hope for the family that some day he is going to feel like you and will take responsibility for what he did, so that – so that the – our system of justice can be – can be complied with and he can face his – what he needs to face.There is, of course, no statute of limitations in Canadian law for this kind of offence and though – so Mr. Wiegers can run, but it remains to be seen how long he can hide – he can hide, but it remains to be seen how long it will take before he is charged with this particular offence.When I sentenced Chelsea Dagenais, I was – is her name Chelsea Dagenais?Yes.MR. SCOTTThat is correct.THE COURT:I was – I know the Crown wished – wanted there to be a jail sentence in that situation as well, but it was a conditional sentence and I was a bit taken aback by that because here’s this young woman lying on the ice and snow next to Ms. Hodder who died later on in the hospital, with you and Ferris – you and Wiegers convincing everybody that the best thing to do would be to pretend that you were driving.She, of course, was lying dazed on the ground, on the ice just as was Hodder.And I didn’t feel in those circumstances there should be a sentence of jail.Your situation is different, as I think you – as I think you realize, just based on what you’ve told me.Not only because you have a criminal record, but also because you know, it’s clear that for – I guess for the reasons you said in – in your statements – or your conditional – in the pre-sentence report, that you felt somehow insurance was going to come into effect here.Well, of course, it would. No one has insurance when you operate a vehicle while you’re impaired, whether it’s you or anybody else, whether it’s your or anybody else’s vehicle.But more than that, it was a, you know, plot hatched by the two of you to try to –MR. FERRIS:I take full responsibility for doing that.I wanted to get insurance on my truck.THE COURT:-- I see, all right.Well, yeah, you’ve, no doubt, learned that that wasn’t the case.MR. FERRIS: -- I was drunk and unable to decide (inaudible).THE COURT:Good, all right.And, of course, the – it was agreed to by the – the young driver who was probably just as happy not to be charged with impaired driving causing, at that point, bodily harm and later causing death.So, anyway, yeah, I think that – and this is the kind of offence if – if – that goes way beyond just giving a false name, of course, so which is another type of obstruction.This – this developed, as you know, into an investigation in which went the wrong way and by the time it was turned around, it was too late to get the kind of evidence that courts require because there has to be proof beyond a reasonable doubt.We can’t just charge somebody because we think he might be guilty and we think we might be able to prove it.It has to be beyond a reasonable doubt and you of course, admitted your part in this and thus saved – saved us – saved the system from having to go to the expense and time of having to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.[emphasis added.][24]The Crown’s recitation of the relevant facts at the sentencing hearing was as follows (Transcript, pp. 6-7):MR. SCOTT:… This [the delay in determining who was driving] deflected somewhat their investigation of what truly happened at – at this point in time.They attempted other statements and suffice it to say that the statements are somewhat vague as to what was observed with respect to Mr. Wiegers prior to – prior to this collision or rolling of the – of the vehicle.As a result, the members were unable to get a warned statement from him.He would have been – his – mother attended and – and was present with him at the hospital.The members indicate that the time limit for them to have made the demand had – had past and that the witness statements were – were such that they weren’t able to pursue that.There were attempts further in the investigation.There was a warrant that was done, for any bodily substances that may have been taken from Mr. Wiegers at the – at the hospital.The only thing that could be located was a urine sample at that point in time.It was sent to lab.It indicated amounts of alcohol and various drugs; however, because it was a urine sample, they were unable to extrapolate it back to a blood sample.My understanding of the lab reports that came about was that in order for a urine sample to have been of any use to the lab, they would require a – knowing when the bladder was – was emptied last, what the consumption was, and – and so that direction went – nowhere as well.The officers who attended the scene with the accident reconstruction, they advised that the road condition was such that they even had trouble standing on the road, so they were unable to give any kind of indication as to what speed the vehicle was travelling when it – when it rolled on this occasion as – as well.[25]On the fresh evidence available on appeal, we know the appellant recanted his statement just over half an hour after he made it.He recanted again a few minutes later and apparently still within an hour or so of the accident.The police accepted his new story subsequent to Ms. Hodder’s death, but while the other passengers remained at the hospital and the police obtained new statements from them; albeit, the three-hour window to make a breath demand on Mr. Wiegers had elapsed.[26]From the Crown’s comments at sentencing, we infer that the witnesses did not suggest any impairment or dangerous driving on the part of Mr. Wiegers.Furthermore, the prosecutor noted that the road conditions were such that accident reconstruction officers experienced difficulties standing on the road could not determine what speed the vehicle had been travelling.On the whole, there was no evidence before the sentencing judge or before us to indicate that Mr. Wiegers was, in fact, impaired at the time of the accident or that his manner of driving was in any way remarkable.Similarly, there was no evidence to suggest that the other passengers would have given damning statements if Mr. Wiegers had been the focus of the police investigation from the start or even an hour earlier, or that a breath sample from Mr. Wiegers would have indicated blood alcohol content in excess of the legal limit.There was no evidentiary basis upon which to draw the inference that Mr. Wiegers would have been charged with a criminal offence, but for the appellant’s lie. Therefore, by concluding that Mr. Wiegers had escaped criminal liability for the accident by reason of the appellant’s offence, the sentencing judge again improperly magnified the gravity of the appellant’s unlawful act and further inflated his moral culpability.[27]The appellant was 20 years old at the time of the accident, and is now 23 years of age.At the time of this offence, the appellant had a criminal record for offences committed while he was subject to the Youth Criminal Justice Act; but those earlier convictions stemmed from a single spate of criminality in 2004.At the time of sentencing, we understand the appellant had two additional convictions for impaired driving and assault, but we have few details and these subsequent convictions did not play a large role in the Crown’s submissions before us.The pre-sentence report indicates that the appellant has had addictions issues, but has taken steps to resolve his issues with alcohol and drugs.The appellant is employed in his community.The appellant has also started post-secondary education and, based on the fresh evidence admitted in this Court, is successfully pursuing this education.In sum, in the 32 months between the time of the accident and his sentencing, the appellant had taken some steps backwards, but for the most part had successfully advanced his life toward becoming a productive member of society.These factors were either not put to or not taken into account by the sentencing judge.[28]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code provides that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.Sentencing judges are owed deference and latitude in crafting individualized sentences that reflect the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender; but where, as here, a sentencing judge misapprehends both the gravity of the offence and the moral culpability of the offender, the sentencing judge commits reviewable error that warrants appellate intervention.We therefore granted leave, allowed the appeal and set aside the sentence imposed in this case.[29]In determining the fit and proper sentence in this case, we considered the possibility of a conditional sentencing order pursuant to s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code:742.1 Imposing of conditional sentenceIf a person is convicted of an offence, other than a serious personal injury offence as defined in section 752, a terrorism offence or a criminal organization offence prosecuted by way of indictment for which the maximum term of imprisonment is ten years or more or an offence punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, and the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years and is satisfied that the service of the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2, the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender's behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the offender's compliance with the conditions imposed under section 742.3.[30]By its language, s. 742.1 contains four prerequisites to imposing a conditional sentence; all of which were satisfied on the facts of this case:(i)The appellant has been convicted of obstruction which is not a serious personal injury, terrorism or criminal organization offence nor an offence punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment.(ii)Under s. 129, obstruction is punishable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.(iii)The appellant did not commit a violent offence here and there is no suggestion that the appellant would pose a danger to the safety of his community if he were to serve a sentence in the community.(iv)The appellant’s service of a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing, namely to denounce unlawful conduct (s. 718(a)), to deter the appellant and others from committing offences (s. 718(b)), to assist in rehabilitating the appellant (s. 718(d)), to achieve proportionality with the gravity of the offence and the degree of the appellant’s responsibility (s. 718.1), and to ensure that the restrictive sanctions imposed on the appellant are reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances (s. 718.2(d) and (e)).The appellant is a young man with a short criminal record, who has since become a productive member of society, and who will benefit from continued employment and from remaining in his educational program.The appellant made progress in his life during the two years between the date of his offence and the date he was charged with that offence, and that progress continues.He has acknowledged and accepted his moral culpability in the circumstances.Therefore, having regard to the factors set forth in R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, we were of the view that this was an appropriate case for a conditional sentencing order.[31]However, while a conditional sentence is a rehabilitative form of sentence, it is essential that the conditions imposed are severe enough to represent denunciation of the offence and to act as a deterrent to others.In R. v. Proulx (at para. 36), Lamer C.J.C. adopted the words of Vancise J.A. of this Court, in dissent in R. v. McDonald (1997), 1997 CanLII 9710 (SK CA), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 418 (at p. 443), where Vancise J.A. said that conditional sentences were designed to “permit the accused to avoid imprisonment, but not to avoid punishment.”Given its punitive purpose, breach of a conditional sentence order should be punished more severely than a breach of a probation order, which has a rehabilitative purpose.In Proulx, Lamer C.J.C. wrote:[39]… [W]here an offender breaches a condition without reasonable excuse, there should be a presumption that the offender serve the remainder of his or her sentence in jail.This constant threat of incarceration will help ensure that the offender complies with the conditions imposed: see R. v. Brady (1998), 1998 ABCA 7 (CanLII), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 504 (Alta. C.A.); J.V. Roberts, “Conditional Sentencing: Sword of Damocles or Pandora’s Box?” (1997), 2 Can. Crim. L. Rev. 183.It also assists in distinguishing the conditional sentence from probation by making the consequences of a breach of condition more severe.[32]In general, as a sentence, a conditional sentence should be severe enough to contribute to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by achieving the sentencing objectives of denouncing the offender’s unlawful conduct and acting as a deterrence to others while at the same time respecting Parliament’s objective of addressing the overuse of incarceration as a sanction.While a conditional sentence is only a partial restriction on liberty when compared to a term of imprisonment, a sentence of imprisonment is subject to reduction through parole, whereas a conditional sentence of equal duration is not.With this context, a sentencing judge should not be too quick to discount the value of a conditional sentence as an option in cases where public safety does not require imprisonment.[33]While we are agreed that incarceration is warranted in this case, the circumstances are such that a conditional sentence is an appropriate and fit sentence; provided, however, that the duration of the sentence and the conditions imposed constitute a significant restriction on the appellant’s liberty and, thereby, serve to denounce the appellant’s crime and to act as a deterrent to the appellant and to those inclined to break the law.[34]Given the foregoing factors and considerations, we concluded that a fit and proper sentence in this case would be a conditional sentence of eight months incarceration to be served in the community on and subject to the mandatory conditions set forth in s. 742.3(1) and the following optional conditions imposed pursuant to s. 742.3(2):1.You must not possess and must abstain from the consumption of alcohol, other intoxicating substances and drugs, except in accordance with a medical prescription.You shall not enter any premises licensed to sell alcohol or alcoholic beverages.You shall submit to alcohol and drug testing, as and whenever directed to do so by the court, a peace officer or your supervisor.2.You must reside only at 47 – 1600 Muzzy Drive, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, and may move from this residence only upon your receipt in advance of written permission to do so from your supervisor. You must remain continuously in your residence under house arrest and, except as otherwise provided in this Order, you shall not leave your residence except to:a.attend at court;b.report in person to your supervisor;c.attend at your place of employment;d.attend an educational program approved by your supervisor;e.perform community service as required by this Order;f.attend counselling or assessment programs as directed by your supervisor; org.receive medical or dental treatment with prior written permission from your supervisor;or as may be otherwise permitted by this Order or by the court or your supervisor in writing.When permitted to leave your residence, you must travel promptly and directly from your residence to the place that you are attending court, working, receiving education, performing community service, receiving counselling or assessment services, or receiving medical or dental treatment, and, after satisfying the purpose for your attendance at that place, you must return promptly and directly to your residence, in each case without any intermediate stops or interruptions in your travel to and from your residence.3.You must promptly present yourself at the door of your residence if and whenever a peace officer or your supervisor attends to verify that you are complying with this Order.You must answer all telephone calls from peace officers and your supervisor during the times you are required to remain in your residence and must not do anything that would prevent a peace officer or your supervisor from verifying, by means of a telephone call, that you are within your residence.4.You must perform 50 hours of community service, as approved by your supervisor, over the period of this Order.5.You shall attend at and cooperate in alcohol- or substance-abuse counselling or assessment programs as may be directed by your supervisor.If you are directed to attend a program at a residential treatment facility, you shall not provide any cause for your removal from the program or the facility.6.You shall immediately advise any peace officer with whom you have dealings that you are subject to a conditional sentence order.You must carry a copy of this Order, and any written permission to leave your residence, with you at all times.You must, upon demand, present this Order and any written permissions from your supervisor to any peace officer or other individual responsible for the enforcement of this Order. You shall, upon demand, permit any peace officer to search (with or without reasonable grounds or a search warrant) your person or any vehicle you own, have registered in your name or are found operating.[35]As required pursuant to s. 742.3(3)(b), we explained the substance of ss. 742.3(1), 742.4 and 742.6 to the appellant while he was before us in court. The appellant acknowledged that he understood the order and our explanations.[36]We hereby direct counsel for the appellant to provide the appellant with a copy of his conditional sentence order and to explain to him the procedure for applying under s. 742.4 for a change to the optional conditions of his conditional sentence order."}

The victim is her daughter.[2]For a complete understanding of the relationship between the victim and her mother, the atmosphere in their family and the events surrounding the offence, the Court refers to its judgment on verdict.[3]Before the offence, relations between the victim and Mrs Kaleki were always good.[4]In the days preceding the offence, for the first time in her young life, the victim went to nightclubs. She stayed out two nights in a row. Because of her past, Mrs Kaleki is a worrier. She was concerned about the safety of her daughter. The first night, Mrs Kaleki called her daughter on numerous occasions. She went to the victim’s friend’s domicile to look for her daughter. She even went with her husband to the police station to report her daughter missing. On the second night, her husband made up a story that their daughter went out with his permission in order to calm Mrs Kaleki. His story did not appease Mrs Kaleki.[5]When her daughter came home early in the morning, Mrs Kaleki asked her husband to be alone with their daughter.[6]Mrs Kaleki used a cleaver, wounded the victim on the nape of her neck and then struck again. The victim was seriously injured. As the victim tried to leave the family home, Mrs Kaleki tried to choke her.The victim[7]The victim was nineteen years old when the offence was committed.[8]In 2010, she signed a victim impact statement[1]. She also testified on sentence.[9]She suffered injuries which required surgery. Tendons of her right hand were cut. Stitches were needed for a wound behind her right ear. She was hospitalized for eleven days. For a certain period of time, she suffered from a partial disability of her hand and received two or three sessions of physiotherapy treatments. For a certain time also, she suffered from anxiety. She is now completely healed, physically and mentally.[10]The victim got married during the proceedings. Mrs Kaleki organized the wedding. The victim is not with her husband anymore. She was welcomed back by her parents who helped her through this situation. She moved back to her parents’ domicile. She is now living with Mrs Kaleki.[11]Her parents encouraged her to pursue her education. She has now secured full time employment.[12]In her testimony, the victim says that her mother, although she does not show any memory of the event, is sorry for what happened and shows remorse. Her mother is the sweetest person she knows.Her mother has always respected her bail conditions. She has never witnessed any violent or aggressive behaviour from her mother since the event. She feels absolutely no fear of her. Her mother is not a danger to anyone. She loves her mother. Their relationship is even better today than it was before the event.[13]The victim also gives her opinion on sentence: her mother does not deserve to go to jail. The victim adds that she is devastated thinking that her mother could go to prison. She is the rock of the family. Nobody can take her place. Her youngest sister, who is eleven years old, would be heartbroken if their mother were to be sentenced to jail.[14]The victim also says that she did not press charges against her mother and did not receive any pressure to testify.The accused[15]Mrs Kaleki is forty-four years old. At the time of the event, she was thirty-eight years old.[16]She has been married to Mr Ebrahim Ebrahimi for twenty-seven years. They have four daughters. The victim is the eldest.[17]She does not work outside the house. She takes care of the children and the household. She is a devoted mother.[18]She has no previous convictions.[19]She was arrested on the premises on June 13, 2010. She was released under conditions on August 19, 2010. She was kept in custody for sixty-seven days.[20]There is no evidence of any failure to comply with the bail conditions.[21]Mrs Kaleki’s sister and brother wrote letters[2] vouching for her good character as a human being and a mother.[22]A close friend of Mrs Kaleki tells the Court that Mrs Kaleki is a loving and caring person, well respected in the community. She is also a good mother. Mrs Kaleki helped her to establish herself in Montréal when she arrived thirteen years ago. Mrs Kaleki looked after her son, even after the event.[23]Mr Ebrahimi testifies again on sentence. Mrs Kaleki runs their house. Three of their children are still living with their parents. Two are adults. The youngest has a very close relationship with her mother. She worries a lot about what could happen to her mother.[24]Mr Ebrahimi is still looking for answers concerning the event. The woman he saw on that day is not his wife as he knows her. Without any doubt, Mr Ebrahimi feels that his wife does not represent a danger to anyone.[25]In June 2010, the Director of Youth Protection became involved in the situation of the three other children of the family. After Mrs Kaleki’s release on bail, the Director arranged and supervised the visitation between these children and Mrs Kaleki. On August 21, 2010, the Director decided that, given the evolution of the family situation and the assessment of the children’s needs, the children were not in danger and that youth protection services were no longer necessary[3].POSITION OF THE PARTIES[26]The prosecution seeks a period of incarceration of ten years.[27]The defence submits that a suspended sentence would be appropriate given the particular circumstances of this case.THE LAW[28]The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect society and to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society[4].[29]This purpose is met by the imposition of just sanctions that reflect the sentencing objectives: denunciation, general and specific deterrence, separation of offenders from society, rehabilitation, reparation, promotion of a sense of responsibility in the offender and acknowledgment of the harm caused to the victim and to the community[5].[30]A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender[6].[31]A court that imposes a sentence shall take into consideration the relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender[7].[32]A sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances[8].[33]Proportionality is determined both on an individual basis, that is, in relation to the accused and to the offence committed by the accused, and by comparison with sentences imposed for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. Individualization and parity of sentences must be reconciled for a sentence to be proportionate[9].[34]Proportionality requires that a sentence not exceed what is just and appropriate, given the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the gravity of the offence. In this sense, the principle serves a limiting or restraining function. It also seeks to ensure that offenders are held responsible for their actions and that the sentence properly reflects and condemns their role in the offence and the harm they caused. The two perspectives on proportionality thus converge in a sentence that both speaks out against the offence and punishes the offender no more than is necessary[10].[35]General ranges of sentences for particular offences encourage greater consistency between sentencing decisions in accordance with the principle of parity.But these ranges are guidelines rather than hard and fast rules. A judge can order a sentence outside the range as long as it is in accordance with the principles and objectives of sentencing[11].[36]The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a highly individualized exercise that goes beyond a purely mathematical calculation. It involves a variety of factors that are difficult to define with precision. Everything depends on the gravity of the offence, the offender’s degree of responsibility and the specific circumstances of each case[12].[37]The offence of attempt to commit murder is amongst the most serious offences. Every person who attempts to commit murder is liable to imprisonment for life[13].[38]In Roy v. R.[14], the Quebec Court of Appeal studied the range of sentences for the offence of attempt to commit murder in the context of domestic violence. Their study outlines three categories :1-sentences ofless than seven years, mostly varying from four to six years, in cases in which rehabilitation is foreseeable or circumstances such as a guilty plea, no prior convictions or less severe consequences are present[15];2- sentences from eight to fourteen years in cases in which there is the use of firearms, previous violence, psychological problems, particular brutality or serious consequences;3- sentences over fifteen years in cases where aggravating circumstances are present such as repetitive violence, previous threats, harassment, planning, extreme brutality, absence of remorse or risk of re-offence.[39]In R. v. Martin[16], the Court of Appeal discussed a range of sentences for attempted murder offences varying from eighteen months to eight years. Even in cases concerning accused with serious mental problems, the sentence should not be lower than one year[17].ANALYSIS[40]Mrs Kaleki is a beloved woman and a devoted mother. The offence is totally out of character.[41]The assault on the victim was violent. Her father, most probably, saved her life.[42]We can find explanations for Mrs Kaleki’s behaviour in the testimony of Dr Watts, particularly in the following extracts:- it’s explained by the context of her upset and distress at being confronted with her daughter […] who’s (sic)behaviors had escalated in a very short period of time […].- […] her husband was upset and she had never seen him this upset and she kept a lot of these difficulties from him […].- in a sense that it’s consistent with an anger motive. It’s consistent with a boiling over, a frustration at the situation […].[18][43]These explanations are consistent with Mrs Kaleki’s statement to Mr Bertand after her arrest[19]:Detective-Sergeant Alex Bertrand:Okay, I think … I think that something snapped. And, you know, that’s why I asked you some questions regarding your values and all that, because I want to understand, because I frankly have a hard time understanding all this. I have all my opinions, you know … you know … is it that, you know, something snapped and you lost control?Johra Kaleki:Yes, I did.[44]Mrs Kaleki’s intention was to kill the victim. Consequently, her moral blameworthiness is significant.Mitigating circumstances[45]Amongst the mitigating circumstances are the facts that Mrs Kaleki has the support of her family, has no previous convictions, has no history of violence, has not committed another offence since and that the risk of re-offence is almost non existent.[46]The offender's remorse and regret clearly are mitigating factors[20]. Mrs Kalekihad expressed regret to the victim and shown remorse.[47]Compliance with bail conditions for a certain period of time prior to sentence may constitute a mitigating circumstance[21]. Mrs Kaleki was arrested on the premises following the assault on June 13, 2010, some five years and eight months ago. She was released on bail on August 19, 2010. Since that day, she has been required to comply with conditions set forth in an undertaking. During that period, she was unable to visit members of her family in Saudi Arabia and a close friend in the United States.She was not able to visit another of her daughters who has also lived in the United States since her marriage in September 2015. During the same period, her contacts with her children were supervised, although the conditions were modified over time to be less demanding.This should be taken into account.[48]Although publicity is an ordinary occurrence in our justice system and for the offender being stigmatized is an inevitable feature of the criminal justice process, adverse publicity can be a mitigating factor[22]. Media articles concerning the case were produced[23]. Many refer to an “honour crime”. Mr Ebrahimi testified concerning the impact on his family of being associated with such a crime. Obviously, a mother attacking her daughter with a cleaver will catch public attention. It is difficult to evaluate the impact of such a label, but we can assume that there was some negative effect on Mrs Kaleki and her family.[49]The victim is now living with her mother at the family residence. She says that their relationship has never been better. She forgives her mother and asks for clemency.An adult victim's act of forgiveness is a relevant mitigating factor[24]. However, in any case in which a victim argues for a lesser sentence, the Court must be alert to the possibility that the victim is being pressured by the accused or others to take such a position, and this is a particular concern where the victim is a member of the accused’s family[25].In the present case, no such pressure seems to exist.[50]Nevertheless, considering that sentencing an accused has a societal purpose which goes beyond the victim and the accused, the opinion of the victim on sentence does not discharge the Court from the responsibility of determining the appropriate sentence[26].Aggravating circumstances[51]The fact that the victim is Mrs Kaleki’s daughter[27] and the use of a weapon, more than once, are aggravating circumstances.[52]The assault was not premeditated but it was not a spontaneous reaction on the spur of the moment:Mrs Kaleki went upstairs to get the knife, she hid it under her t-shirt, she asked her husband to leave them alone and she closed the door. She then abused her position of trust by kissing her daughter and asking her to fall asleep[28]. Even after being stopped by her husband, she chased the victim and tried to choke her.[53]The fact that, without the father’s intervention, the injuries suffered by the victim would probably have been more serious[29] cannot be considered as an aggravating circumstance.Conclusions[54]The prosecution insists on two cases to support its position: R. v. Postma[30] and R. v. Nabavi[31].[55]In Postma, the physical, emotional and psychological impacts on the victim were devastating to all aspects of her life, the accused discarded incriminating evidence and there was no evidence to properly assess the ongoing risk the accused posed to the public. Mrs Kaleki’s daughter is now completely healed and Mrs Kaleki poses no risk to the public. More significantly, the victim and Mrs Kaleki are now living together.[56]In Nabavi, the attack was premeditated, the victim suffered extremely serious injuries with lasting consequences, the victim and her daughter suffered serious psychological harm. The consequences in this case are not comparable to the present case.[57]The defence insists on Mrs Kaleki’s amnesia and her altered state of mind at the moment of the offence. On those issues, this Court refers to the judgment on verdict: the brain was then recording and Mrs Kaleki was not suffering from any mental illness.Mrs Kaleki’s state of mind at the time was similar to frustration, anger and rage. Still, it was totally out of character. This rage impaired her judgment.[58]The defence refers to decisions concerning the offence of manslaughter. The relevancy of these decisions is limited since, in these cases, the accused has no intent to kill contrary to the offence of attempt to commit murder. The level of the offender’s moral blameworthiness is not the same. Mr Justice Lamer of the Supreme Court of Canada wrote in R. v. Logan[32]:The stigma associated with a conviction for attempted murder is the same as it is for murder. Such a conviction reveals that although no death ensued from the actions of the accused, the intent to kill was still present in his or her mind. The attempted murderer is no less a killer than a murderer: he may be lucky — the ambulance arrived early, or some other fortuitous circumstance — but he still has the same killer instinct. Secondly, while a conviction for attempted murder does not automatically result in a life sentence, the offence is punishable by life and the usual penalty is very severe.[59]The severity of a sentence depends not only on the seriousness of the crime’s consequences, but also on the moral blameworthiness of the offender[33].[60]Without ignoring the other objectives, denunciation and deterrence are paramount in cases of attempted murder.[61]In R. v. C.A.M., the Supreme Court of Canada said about denunciation:The objective of denunciation mandates that a sentence should also communicate society's condemnation of that particular offender's conduct. In short, a sentence with a denunciatory element represents a symbolic, collective statement that the offender's conduct should be punished for encroaching on our society's basic code of values as enshrined within our substantive criminal law.[34][62]Specific deterrence may notbe necessary to prevent Mrs Kaleki from re-offending,but general deterrence, using sentencing to send a message to discourage others from offending,is relevant.[63]While it is normal for trial judges to consider sentences other than imprisonment in appropriate cases, in the present case, as in all cases in which general or specific deterrence and denunciation must be emphasized, the courts have very few options other than imprisonment for meeting these objectives, which are essential to the maintenance of a just, peaceful and law‑abiding society[35].[64]Even where a term of imprisonment is necessary, it should be the lightest possible sanction in the circumstances.[65]A term of imprisonment will unfortunately deprive the younger daughter of her mother. This is not exceptional. Fortunately this young girl can count on the support of her father and two adult sisters who are living with her.[66]In R. v. Boutin[36], the Quebec Court of Appeal varied, from nine years to five years, the sentence of the accused who pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted murder. The accused had served four months of pre-sentence custody. Suffering from alcoholism, jealousy and depression, the accused stabbed his wife who intented to divorce him. The physical intervention of the accused’s teenager saved the life of the victim. After the tragedy, the accused behaved well and improved his attitude. Since the accused seemed determined to succeed in his rehabilitation, the severity of the sentence imposed by the trial judge would have discouraged him in his efforts.[67]Considering the gravity of the offence, all the circumstances, including the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and the fact that Mrs Kaleki poses little or no risk to society, a sentence of three years is appropriate.[68]The time spent in pre-sentence custody, sixty-seven days, should be taken into account[37].A credit of one hundred days is accorded to Mrs Kaleki[38].For these reasons, the Court :CONDEMNS Mrs Johra Kaleki to imprisonment for a term of two years and two hundred sixty-five days;PROHIBITS Mrs Kaleki from possessing any prohibited firearm, restricted firearm, prohibited weapon, prohibited device, prohibited ammunition for life and from possessing any other firearm, crossbow, restricted weapon, ammunition and explosive substance for a period of ten years after her release from imprisonment;AUTHORIZES the taking of the number of samples of bodily substances that is reasonably required for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis from Mrs Kaleki;DISPENSESMrs Kaleki from paying the victim surcharge.__________________________________Yves Paradis, J.C.Q.Me Anne GauvinFor the prosecutionMe Isabel J.

Heath, for the Respondent)Respondent))- and -)))DAMIAN FERRIE)))Mr. Richard Posner, for the Appellant)Appellant))))HEARD:March 21, 2005Bracebridge, ONREASONS FOR JUDGMENTSHAUGHNESSY, RSJ.[1]The Appellant, Damian Ferrie appeals against the sentence imposed by Mr. Justice Evans on January 27, 2003.The Appellant plead guilty to three charges under the Controlled Drugs and Substance Act.He was convicted of possession of ecstasy, psilocybin and marihuana contrary to ss. 4 (1) and 4 (5) of the Act.[2]The Crown consents to the appeal against conviction with respect to possession of marihuana and accordingly, an acquittal will be substituted in relation to the charge of possession of marihuana and the sentence quashed on that charge.[3]The sentencing judge imposed a fine of $1,000 and the appellant was further ordered to pay the victim fine surcharge in the amount of $100.[4]The Appellant appeals against the sentence imposed by the Trial Judge.The issues on this appeal are:(i)Was the sentence imposed by Evans J. unreasonable in that it was harsh and excessive?(ii)Did the Trial Judge fail to give adequate Reasons for his decision?[5]In the circumstances detailed above, the appellant maintains that the Trial Judge errored and he failed to give any adequate Reasons why a conditional discharge was inappropriate.BACKGROUND INFORMATION[6]On August 3, 2002, the Appellant was visiting friends in Barrie.The Appellant and a number of other individuals traveled in the Appellant’s vehicle to the town of Gravenhurst.The car was parked in the parking lot of Camp Shalom, a children’s summer camp.[7]The Appellant was aware that there was marihuana and psilocybin in his car and he was also aware that there were ecstasy tablets wrapped in tin foil located in the vehicle.Police Officers attended at the scene and eventually arrested the Appellant.[8]The Appellant has no criminal record and he entered a plea to all 3 charges on January 7, 2003, which was at a relatively early point of time.[9]At the sentencing hearing, defense counsel submitted that the accused should receive a conditional discharge.TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS FOR SENTENCE[10]The Trial Judge, in his Reasons for Sentence indicates that he “gave very serious consideration to the discharge provisions of the Criminal Code”.The Trial Judge goes on to state that while it may be in the best interests of this offender to grant a conditional discharge, nevertheless, he was not persuaded that it “would be in the public interest in all these circumstances to grant a discharge”.The Trial Judge then stated that with respect to the possession of ecstasy there would be a fine in the amount of $400 and a victim fine surcharge in the amount of $40.On the possession of the psilocybin, there was also a fine of $400 and a victim fine surcharge of $40.The possession of marihuana also attracted a fine.POSITION OF THE DEFENSE ON THIS APPEAL[11]Counsel for the Appellant submits that the offender should receive a conditional discharge.It is submitted that the Appellant has experienced shame and remorse for his involvement in this offense.It is further submitted that Appellant’s good character and the fact that he had no prior criminal record are factors favouring a conditional discharge.Further, counsel submits that there was an absence of any maliciousness on the part of the Appellant in the commission of the offence.If anything, it is suggested that the Appellant demonstrated a series of poor judgment calls in relation to these offences.[12]It is further submitted by the Defense that a conditional discharge was an appropriate disposition which the Sentencing Judge ought to have imposed by reason of the implications that a criminal conviction has on the career of the Appellant.Counsel for the Appellant states that the Appellant is a registered massage therapist and in order to practice in that profession, he is obligated under the Massage Therapy Act, 1991, Ontario Regulation 864/93, Amended to O. Reg. 473/99 to report any convictions.Therefore, it is the position of the Appellant that alternative measurers were available to the Court that would have the same effect of denouncing unlawful conduct, but would not be unduly harsh.[13]The Appellant further submits that the Reasons for Sentence of the Trial Judge are insufficient and do not amount to a reasoned decision as they fail to address the most important issues raised by the defense.ANALYSIS[14]At the outset, it is apparent that the issues raised on this appeal (with the exception of the adequacy of the Reasons for Sentencing of the Trial Judge), are the very same matters that were argued before the Trial Judge.[15]Further, in the course of submissions, defense counsel cited supporting case law and referred specifically to numerous cases where a conditional discharge was determined to be an appropriate disposition, (including R. v. Balaski, [1995] O.J. No. 3937; R. v. Caffrey, [1988], O.J. No. 1609; R. v. Schulhauser, 45 W.C.B. (2d) 331; R. v. Hayes, [1999] O.J. 938).[16]I find that the Trial Judge in his Reasons for Sentencing “gave very serious consideration” to the defense submission for a conditional discharge.The Trial Judge nevertheless rejected this proposed disposition because on balance, it would not be in the “public interest”.The Statement of Facts which the offender agreed are substantially correct detail that:(a)The accused was the operator of a motor vehicle which was parked in a parking lot of a children’s camp near the Town of Gravenhurst in mid-summer when the camp was fully operational;(b)The summer camp personnel notified the Ontario Provincial Police that a number of young people were observed to be drinking in a vehicle;(c)The police attended at the parking lot and observed that the parked vehicle had its windows down and open beer cans were observed in the car.The police officers opened the centre console apparently to locate registration particulars for the vehicle.In the console, there were observed two baggies.The first baggy held 2.7 grams of psilocybin (also known as magic mushrooms).The second bag had 1 gram of marihuana.[17]The police then conducted a search of the surrounding area.They located 7 young people on a cliff that overlooks Lake Muskoka.The accused apparently left the other individuals andmade an attempt to flee the area.In the course of doing so, the Appellant was observed by Ontario Provincial Police Officers to be attempting to discard a package.This package was recovered and it consisted of 4 tablets (1.1 grams) of what is commonly referred to as Ecstasy.[18]Accordingly, there are a number of aggravating factors, including the place of the commission of this offense, combined with the reality that both ecstasy and psilocybin are very dangerous drugs that can result in death or serious physical or emotional harm to users.[19]I find that there is ample justification for imposing a fine and a resulting criminal record when weighing the interest of the accused and the interest of the community.It is apparent from the Reasons of the Sentencing Judge that the principle of denunciation could not be achieved without the imposition of a fine and a criminal record.[20]The issue here is not whether the Summary Conviction Appeal Judge would impose a different sentence, but whether the Trial Judge errored in the circumstances.I find that the facts and circumstances of the incident and the resulting sentence do not demonstrate any error in fact or law on the part of the Sentencing Judge.The impact that a conviction may have on the career of the Appellant is a factor that was presented to the Sentencing Judge for his consideration.The Judge indicated that he carefully considered the request for a conditional discharge, however, he rejected the submission.There were sufficient reasons for rejecting a conditional discharge having regard to the public interest.It cannot be said that the sentence imposed by the Sentencing Judge was outside the accepted parameters for this type of offense.WERE THE REASONS OF THE SENTENCING JUDGE ADEQUATE?[21]Admittedly, it would have been preferable if the Sentencing Judge had provided detailed Reasons for the sentence imposed with reference to the principles of sentencing as detailed in the Criminal Code.[22]In Regina v. Sheppard 2002 SCC 26 (CanLII), [2002], 1 S.C.R. 869, the Supreme Court of Canada states that the delivery of reasoned decisions is inherent in the Trial Judge’s role.Accordingly, an accused should not be left in doubt about why a conviction has been entered and a sentence imposed.However, the Supreme Court states that the statutory right of appeal is directed at the result rather than at the reason for the result.Accordingly, not every failure or deficiency in the reasons will provide a ground of appeal.Mr. Justice Binnie in R. v. Sheppard (para 25) details a functional test that must be applied in reviewing the Reasons for Judgment.If deficiencies in the Reasons do not, in a particular case, foreclose meaningful appellate review, but allow for its full exercise, the deficiency will not justify intervention under s. 686 of the Criminal Code.That provision limits the power of the appellate court to intervene to situations where it is of the opinion that (i) the verdict is unreasonable, (ii) the judgment is vitiated by an error of law and it cannot be said that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred or (iii) on any ground where there has been a miscarriage of justice.[23]As Justice Binnie stated in R. v. Sheppard, the appellate court is “not given the power to intervene simply because it thinks that the trial court did a poor job of expressing itself” (para 26).Therefore, the Trial Judge’s duty is satisfied by Reasons that are sufficient to serve the purpose for which the duty is imposed, namely, a decision which, having regard to the circumstances of the case, is reasonably intelligible to the litigants and provides the basis for meaningful appellate review.[24]Finally, I take particular note of Justice Binnie’s comments in relation to “error of law” cases where he states (para 46)…..the duty to give reasons, where it exists, arises out of the circumstances of a particular case.Where it is plain from the record why an accused has been convicted or acquitted, and the absence or inadequacy of reasons provides no significant impediment to the exercise of a right of appeal, the appeal court will not on that account intervene.On the other hand, where the path taken by the trial judge through confused or conflicting evidence is not at all apparent, or there are difficult issues of law that need to be confronted, but which the trial judge has circumnavigated without explanation, or where….there are conflicting theories for why the trial judge might have decided as he or she did, at least some of which would clearly constitutereversible error, the appeal court may in some cases consider itself unable to give effect to the statutory right of appeal.In such a case, one or other of the parties may question the correctness of the result, but will wrongly have been deprived by the absence or inadequacy of reasons of the opportunity to have the trial verdict properly scrutinized on appeal.In such a case, even if the record discloses evidence that on one view could support a reasonable verdict, the deficiencies in the reasons may amount to an error of law and justify appellate intervention.It will be for the appeal court to determine whether, in a particular case the deficiency in the reasons precludes it from properly carrying out its appellate function.[25]I find in the present case that there were two proposed dispositions for the offender.The Crown sought a fine (with a resulting criminal record) and the defense sought a conditional discharge.The reasons indicate that the Sentencing Judge considered a conditional discharge, but ultimately rejected it as an appropriate disposition.The record before the Court indicates that the same arguments presented on this Appeal were also advanced before the Sentencing Judge.While the reasons of the Sentencing Judge might be described as minimal at best, nevertheless, it is plain from the record why the accused was given the sentence and the absence or inadequacy of the Reasons do not provide any significant impediment to the exercise of a meaningful appellate review.I find that the sentence imposed is reasonable and there was no error at law and there are no grounds to suggest that there has been a miscarriage of justice.[26]Further, while the Reasons of the Sentencing Judge may be characterized as scant, nevertheless, the Reasons, in the circumstances of this case, as disclosed in the record leaves no doubt why the sentence was imposed.Further, while counsel for the Appellant has referred to a number of decisions where a conditional discharge was imposed, nevertheless, it cannot be said that the sentence imposed in this matter was unreasonable, an error at law, or is a miscarriage of justice.Due deference must be given to the Sentencing Judge in the circumstances.[27]Accordingly, this Appeal is dismissed.___________________________SHAUGHNESSY RSJ.Released:April 14, 2005"}

Armstrong and Juriansz JJ.A.April 23, 2012Criminal law -- Sentencing -- Long-term offenders -- Breach of long-term supervision order -- Pre-trial custody -- Accused sentenced to three years' imprisonment on two breaches of long- term supervision order (\"LTSO\") -- Judge intending to credit accused 1.5 days' credit for pre-sentence incarceration but calculation error resulting in accused receiving 228 days less credit than judge intended to -- Accused having served entire custodial period of sentence seeking reduction of LTSO reduced by 228 days -- Appeal dismissed -- LTSO ran during pre-sentence custody for breaches of order and appropriate that less credit being given for pre-sentence custody while LTSO in effect -- Sentence actually imposed being fit -- Appeal dismissed.The accused was convicted in 2003 of sexual assault and other offences. He was designated as a long-term offender and was sentenced to five years' incarceration. A seven-year long-term supervision order (\"LTSO\") was imposed. In 2010, the accused was convicted of two counts of breaching his LTSO. The sentencing judge sentenced him to two years' imprisonment for the first breach and one-year consecutive for the second breach. The sentencing judge intended to give the accused a credit of 1.5 days for each day in pre-sentence custody. Due to a calculation error, the accused was granted a credit of 228 days less than he otherwise would have received. The accused appealed. He was now out of custody and sought to have the 228 days applied to reduce the length of his LTSO.Held, the appeal should be dismissed.Despite the sentencing judge's factual mistake in granting the accused less credit for pre-sentence custody than he apparently intended to, the sentence actually imposed was fit. The sentencing judge noted that the accused had never completed any of the treatment programs he had started, that he did not take supervision seriously and that the risk to the public remained high. The time a long-term offender spends in pre- sentence custody cannot be regarded as \"dead time\", as the LTSO continues to run until conviction. The rationale for a seven-year LTSO was not undermined by the sentencing judge's calculation error.APPEAL by the accused from the sentence imposed by Turnbull J. of the Superior Court of Justice on March 1, 2011. [page169] Cases referred toR. v. Ipeelee, [2012] S.C.J. No. 13, 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII), 428 N.R. 1,2012EXP-1208, J.E. 2012-661, 288 O.A.C. 224, EYB 2012-204040,varg (2009), 99 O.R.

Statutes referred to Corrections and Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20, s.135(2) [as am.] Julie Santarossa, for appellant.Nadia Thomas, for respondent.The judgment of the court was delivered by[1] JURIANSZ J.A.: -- In June 2004, the appellant wasdesignated as a long-term offender (\"LTO\") and sentenced to along-term supervision order (\"LTSO\"). The order was, at thetime of sentencing, anticipated to continue to April 28, 2013.He appeals his sentence, relying on an error made by thesentencing judge in calculating his credit for pre-sentencecustody. As he was released from imprisonment on September 26,2011 on statutory release, he seeks to reduce the duration ofthe LTSO.[2] On August 23, 2010, the appellant was convicted of twocounts of breaching his LTSO. On March 1, 2011, he wassentenced to two years' imprisonment for the first breach andto one year in custody for the second breach, to be servedconsecutively. The sentencing judge stated he would be givencredit of 1.5 days for each day in \"pre-trial\" custody andcalculated that credit to be 781 days premised on the 521-dayperiod between the date of his arrest, April 28, 2009, andOctober 21, 2010. The selection of October 21, 2010 is notexplained. The appellant was convicted on August 23, 2010 andsentenced on March 1, 2011. In his reasons, the sentencingjudge stated that the appellant was found guilty on October 1,2010, but the indictment reflects that a new pre-sentencereport was ordered on that date. The appellant did not appearin court on October 21, 2010.[3] The parties agree that the sentencing judge intended togive the appellant 1.5-to-1 credit for his pre-sentencecustody. His pre-sentence custody amounts to 673 days,beginning with his arrest on April 28, 2009 and ending on March1, 2011, when he was sentenced. The proper credit calculated atthe rate of 1.5-to-1 would amount to a credit of 1,009 days.Thus, the sentencing judge granted the appellant 228 days(about 7[cents] months) less credit than he might haveotherwise received.[4] Relying on this error, the appellant, who is now out ofcustody, seeks to have the credit the judge intended to givehim applied to reduce the length of the LTSO that he iscurrently serving. If his sentence is reduced, the appellant'sLTSO, which was suspended while he served his sentence, wouldrecommence earlier and expire earlier.[5] I would grant leave to appeal his sentence, but dismissthe appeal. Notwithstanding the sentencing judge's error, Iwould not disturb the sentence he imposed. The sentenceactually imposed was fit. [page170][6] The appellant was convicted on December 1, 2003 of twocounts of sexual assault on victims he had rendered unconsciouswith a stupefying drug, one count of administering a stupefyingdrug with intent to commit sexual assault and one count ofunlawful possession of property. The offences occurred between1999 and 2003 in North Bay and involved three differentvictims. He drugged the three victims with drinks referred toas \"paralyzers\". He had sexual intercourse with the first andsecond victims after drugging them. The second victim was thewife of a friend. He drugged her while she was at work. Thethird victim was his downstairs neighbour. She had no clearmemory of the events until admitted to hospital. He had drilledholes in her apartment so he could observe her in her bedroom.For these offences, the appellant was sentenced to five years'incarceration less pre-trial custody at a 2-for-1 ratio andmade subject to a long-term supervision order for a period ofseven years following his release.[7] The long-term supervision order began to run on November9, 2005, when the appellant was released to a community carecentre, and was initially anticipated to end seven years later,on November 8, 2012. However, as the sentencing judge noted, heimmediately embarked on a course of infractions.[8] On December 1, 2005, a suspension warrant was issued andexecuted when he was found to be accessing pornography andescort service websites as well as chat rooms. The NationalParole Board of Canada issued a reprimand on January 27, 2006and returned him to the community care centre on January 30,2006.[9] Less than two months later, on March 20, 2006, a secondsuspension warrant was issued and executed when the appellantwas alleged to have had contact with another resident'sgirlfriend. He was returned to the community care centre onApril 19, 2006.[10] On May 8, 2006, the third suspension warrant was issuedand executed because the appellant was found to have violatedthe condition that he have no contact with females withoutprior authorization from his parole supervisor. He was againreleased to community care on August 15, 2006.[11] The fourth suspension warrant was issued and executed onSeptember 26, 2006, when he failed to provide detailed billingfor his cellphone charges. As well, he had failed to discloseto his parole supervisor that he had been on a trip to NorthBay in the presence of a 17-year-old female and had rented ahotel room for her. He was charged with breaching his long-termsupervision order on November 23, 2007. [page171][12] He was sentenced for that breach on July 2, 2008. Hereceived a sentence of four years' incarceration less creditfor 644 days of pre-trial custody at a ratio of 2-to-1.[13] He was released on statutory release on October 23, 2008and reached his warrant expiry on December 20, 2008, when hislong-term supervision order recommenced with a condition thathe reside at a community care centre.[14] Shortly after, on February 2, 2009, a fifth suspensionwarrant was issued and executed when the appellant was found inpossession of a computer capable of accessing the Internet anda CD containing pornographic images of young women. On April28, 2009, he was charged with the two counts of breaching hisLTSO in this case.[15] In his reasons, the sentencing judge noted that theappellant had never completed any of the treatment programs hehad started and that the risk he posed to the public remained\"high\". He did not take supervision seriously and blamedothers continuously for his circumstances and did not acceptresponsibility for his actions.[16] The appellant's effective sentence on these two countswas ten and one-half months' incarceration, given the 781 daysof credit he received. As noted, he was released six and one-half months later on September 26, 2011. His LTSO, which wassuspended during his sentence, recommenced at his warrantexpiry on January 12, 2012. If his appeal is successful, itwould end some seven and one-half months earlier than it iscurrently set to expire.[17] I agree with the Crown's submission that it should bekept in mind that the time a long-term offender spends in pre-sentence custody cannot be regarded as \"dead time\", as theLTSO continues to run until conviction. As Justice Masse put itin R. v. Nelson, [2007] O.J. No. 5704, 2007 Carswell 9456(C.J.), at paras. 30-31:[A]lthough the long-term supervision order is interruptedwhile an offender serves a sentence, it continues to rununtil such time as sentence is actually pronounced. It wouldbe an anomalous result for an offender to receive both acredit towards his long-term supervision order for pre-sentence custody as well as an enhanced credit towardssentence. That could not have been the intention ofParliament.[18] The issue has been considered by this court in oneprevious case, R. v. Ipeelee (2009), 2009 ONCA 892 (CanLII), 99 O.R. (3d) 419, [2009]O.J. No. 5402 (C.A.), at para. 10 (appeal allowed on othergrounds [2012] S.C.J. No. 13, 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII)), where the courtsaid: [page172]Did the sentencing judge err by refusing enhanced credit?The sentencing judge refused to give the appellant enhancedcredit for the six months he spent in pre-sentence custody.In the circumstance of this case, I see no error. As thesentencing judge noted, the time under the long-termsupervision order continues to run while the offender is inpre-sentence custody for breach of a condition of the order.Moreover, the lack of credit for time served towards earlyrelease, a factor usually cited as a reason for enhancedcredit, is less relevant here as the appellant is unlikely tobe granted early release.[19] One goal of an LTSO to rehabilitate offenders andreintegrate them into the community by supervising them afterthey are released from imprisonment. If the offender is incustody awaiting trial on charges of breaching the LTSO,nothing can be accomplished towards reintegrating the offenderinto the community. Some rehabilitation is possible becauselong-term offenders, unlike other accused persons, can betransferred to a federal penitentiary with treatment programmesavailable while awaiting sentence (s. 135(2), Corrections andConditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20, as amended). Thelack of access to such programs is considered a rationale forenhanced credit for time in pre-trial custody. In this case, itis not clear why the appellant was not transferred to a federalpenitentiary.[20] Here, the appellant has spent a total of 1,337 days (664days on his first breach and 673 days on the breaches in thiscase) in custody while his LTSO continued to run. That periodamounts to more than one-half of the original seven-year periodthe LTSO was intended to apply.[21] I recognize that the awarding of credit for pre-sentencecustody is a matter within the discretion of the sentencingjudge. Here, despite the sentencing judge's factual mistake ingranting the appellant less credit for pre-sentence custodythan it seems he intended to, I would not disturb the sentenceactually imposed. The sentence actually imposed was fit for theoffences considering the circumstances of the appellant, andthe rationale for a LTSO for a period of seven years is notundermined by the sentencing judge's calculation error. Theconsiderations I have discussed point towards less credit forpre-trial custody while a LTSO is in effect than in othercases.[22] I would grant leave to appeal [the] sentence but dismissthe appeal.Appeal dismissed."}

ScaravelliHeard:October 29, 2013, in Pictou, Nova ScotiaOral Decision:December 11, 2013Counsel:Patrick Young, for the CrownStephen Robertson, for the DefenceBy the Court (Orally):[1]Michael Brannan appears for sentencing following a guilty plea to a charge of break and enter and theft contrary to s. 348(1)b of the Criminal Code.[2]On November 30, 2007, while the victim was away from home, the offender entered her dwelling house through an unlocked back door.Items stolen from the house included: a digital camera, a DVD player, power drill, and jewellery.The offender also stole a gun cabinet attached to the wall containing six rifles.The offender broke into an outside shed and stole a table saw.The victim estimated the value of stolen property to be approximately $10,000.[3]I have reviewed the pre-sentence report.I have also reviewed correspondence from his parole officer and employer.Mr. Brannan is currently 30 years of age.He has been in a common-law relationship for the past three years.He and his spouse are raising three children.Mr. Brannan works regular part-time as a dishwasher at a local restaurant.He admits to regular use of marijuana to deal with anxiety and stress.[4]The offender has one conviction for break, enter and theft as a young offender in 1999.The offender’s criminal record also indicates convictions for four counts of break and enters in 2011.As the current offence occurred in 2007, he would be considered a first time adult offender for the purposes of sentencing.[5]Although no victim impact statement was provided to The Court, the crown advises the victim subsequently installed a security system, obtained a dog and eventually moved out of the home as a result of the break and enter.[6]In determining the appropriate sentence, I must consider the purpose and principles of sentencing as set out in s. 718 to s. 718.2 of the Criminal Code.The Courts have consistently confirmed that the principles of deterrence and denunciation are of prime importance in cases of this nature, in particular, break and enter into dwelling homes.The sentence must also be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the responsibility of the offender.Aggravating and mitigating circumstances are to be considered by The Court.I am also required to consider the rehabilitation of the offender.A sentence should be in a range imposed on similar offences and similar circumstances.[7]Mitigating factors are the offender entered an early guilty plea.He is gainfully employed in a part-time position and, at the time of the offence, was a first time adult offender.Aggravating factors are the break and enter was planned and committed for profit.The value of the property stolen was high and included firearms.The offender denied involvement in the offence in a statement given to police in 2012.[8]The defence submits a conditional sentence is a proper sentence in this case.The offence predates the amendments to the Criminal Code which disallow the imposition of a conditional sentence order for the offence of break and enter.[9]The crown referring to the benchmark of three years of imprisonment as prescribed by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal, recommends a sentence of imprisonment of between two and three years.[10]Section 742.1 of the Criminal Code authorizes The Court to make an order for a conditional sentence when the offender is sentenced to imprisonment of less than two years.The conditional sentence can be imposed where The Court is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in s. 718 to s. 718.2.An offender serving a sentence in the community is subject to conditions set out in s. 742.3.In R. v. Proulx 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 SCR 61, the Supreme Court of Canada details a procedure to be followed by a judge considering a conditional sentence.At the first stage, the judge must be satisfied that the appropriate sentence is a custodial one of less than two years.Secondly, The Court must be satisfied that having the offender serve the sentence in the community would not endanger its safety.If so, The Court considers whether a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing as set out in s. 718 to s. 718.2.[11]Under s. 348(1)(d) of the Code the offence of break and enter into a dwelling house carries a maximum term of life imprisonment, while a break and enter into other premises involves a lower maximum penalty of 10 years.The statutory maximum reflects the extreme seriousness with which Parliament regards the offence of home invasion.It is a crime that violates the sanctity of the home and its occupants.In this regard, our Court of Appeal has repeatedly stated that a single break and enter offence attracts a benchmark sentence of three years.R. v. Zang [1986] NSJ 207; R. v. McAllister, (2008) NSSA 103.This benchmark can be offset one way or another according to mitigating or aggravating circumstances.In R. v. Adams, (2010) NSCA 42, Bateman J. stated:[42] . . . the absence of a prior record might warrant a reduction from the benchmark to two years.[12]Defence counsel referred The Court to a number of cases predating R. v. Zang where more lenient sentences have been imposed.For recent cases, the defence cited R. v. Perrin,(2012) NSCA 85 and R. v. Best [2012], NSJ 175, (NSCA) 34.In R. v. Perrin the 21 year old accused participated in break and enter and theft of copper piping and speakers from a cottage.He gave police a full confession and showed police items he had taken.He had a prior criminal record and was serving a conditional sentence at the time of the offence.The Court of Appeal upheld the sentence of 30 days imprisonment and 18 months’ probation in addition to his requirement to serve the remaining 34 days of his conditional sentence.In describing the “short sharp” sentence as lenient, The Court found that the sentencing judge did not err in principle.In R. v. Best the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from sentence of 90 days intermittent plus two years’ probation for an offence of break and enter and aggravated assault, however, The Court found the sentencing judge erred in principle by not emphasising denunciation and deterrence.Although the sentence was demonstrably unfit, The Court found it was not in the interest of justice to re-incarcerate the offender following completion of his sentence and portion of his probation without incident[13]In the present case the offender shoulders a high degree of responsibility.His level of intrusion into the home was extensive in that he stole the items from various rooms and levels in the house.A vehicle was backed to the outside shed where a table saw was loaded and removed indicating that an extended period of time was involved.A crowbar was found outside the dwelling.The Court is of the view that in order to adequately address the need for denunciation and deterrence, a penitentiary sentence is necessary in this case.This excludes the consideration of the possibility of a conditional sentence.I am also mindful that the offender has a heightened prospect for rehabilitation.He is only 30 years of age, in a stable marriage relationship, and has obtained regular employment.He would have been 24 years of age at the time of the offence.In my view the circumstances warrant a reduction from the bench mark of three years.[14]It is the sentence of The Court that Mr. Brannan serve two years in a federal institution."}

Nuttall)))Mr. DouglasGrace and Ms. Anya Shahabi, for the Accused)Accused))))HEARD:February 9, 2017REASONS FOR SENTENCEConlan J.I.Introduction[1]What sentence should be imposed on a first-time offender who has been found guilty of three counts of simple possession of three different controlled substances, one of them being a sizeable quantity of cocaine?[2]That is the question to be decided.[3]Mr. Druin Nuttall was tried before me, without a jury, in Owen Sound in December 2016.[4]In written Reasons for Judgment reported at 2016 ONSC 7777 (CanLII), I found Mr. Nuttall not guilty of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking but guilty of the lesser and included offence of simple possession of cocaine, guilty of simple possession of methamphetamine, and guilty of simple possession of codeine.[5]The sentencing hearing was held in Owen Sound on today’s date, February 9, 2017.II.The Facts[6]The following summary of the facts is taken from paragraphs 5 through 11 of the Reasons for Judgment.An Overview of the Facts[5]In the evening on October 15, 2015, after a few months of police investigation, Mr. Nuttall was stopped by the police while driving northbound on Highway 10, in Grey County (just north of the village of Markdale).He was the only occupant of the car, which vehicle was owned by his girlfriend.[6]The accused was arrested for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.[7]The authorities believed that Mr. Nuttall was picking up cocaine in the Toronto area and transporting it to Owen Sound for the purpose of trafficking in it.[8]After the arrest at the roadside, Mr. Nuttall was then searched by the police and found to be in possession of, among other things, $440.00 in cash (twenty-two $20.00 bills).[9]The car was also searched by the police.Inside a backpack was found 29.4 grams of cocaine.Three cellular telephones were also seized by the police.[10]The police then searched the accused’s residence, which he shared with others.They seized some items with cocaine residue on them, other things believed to be indicative of drug trafficking (like a digital scale, for example), and a half-full bottle of liquid codeine.[11]The police also searched the electronic devices that had been seized at the roadside.Photographs were taken of text messages that were on one of those cellular telephones.[7]The methamphetamine was a very small quantity found on a digital scale in the offender’s bedroom.[8]The codeine was a half-full bottle of liquid found in the offender’s bedroom.[9]In terms of why the Court acquitted Mr. Nuttall on the cocaine charge as laid, I set out here paragraphs 60 through 63 of the Reasons for Judgment.[60]On the totality of the evidence adduced at trial, including a consideration of the absence of evidence, I am more than just suspicious, especially given the text messages.I would go as far as to say that I think that Mr. Nuttall was probably dealing cocaine and was likely intending to do the same with what was discovered in his backpack.[61]But I am just not sure of that.[62]An intention to traffic is certainly one reasonable inference to be drawn from the proven facts, however, particularly given the accused’s statement and the absence of evidence summarized above, other reasonable inferences to be drawn are that Mr. Nuttall is a heavy marihuana user, a heavy cocaine user, is involved with other buddies in a marihuana lounge (which involvement takes him to and from Toronto regularly), and is generally someone immersed in the drug subculture but whose purpose for possessing the cocaine in the backpack was not to traffic in it.[63]]Accordingly, a finding of guilt on the lesser and included offence of simple possession of cocaine is the appropriate result.III.The Offender[10]Mr. Nuttall is currently 37 years old.He has no prior criminal record.He is not employed and is in receipt of disability benefits.He has obeyed rather strict bail conditions, including house arrest later amended to a daily curfew, since October 2015.He has two children, ages 1 and 14 years.Tragically, the mother of the teenager died not long ago.[11]The Crown concedes that Mr. Nuttall was cooperative with the police.For example, he readily confessed to ownership of the items found within the motor vehicle.[12]The Court has received letters from Mr. Nuttall’s mother, his father, and his girlfriend.Those letters speak highly of the offender and indicate that he appears to have changed his life and abstained from illegal narcotics since the time of his arrest.The letters also speak about the importance of Mr. Nuttall in the lives of his two children, his partner and his parents, but especially his teenage daughter who is struggling to cope with the loss of her mother.Finally, the letters confirm that the offender is remorseful for his actions and committed to his rehabilitation from what is described as a serious addiction to drugs.IV.The Positions of the Parties[13]The Crown requests the following sentence:6 to 8 months in custody, in totality.[14]The Defence requests a suspended sentence and probation for 12 months.[15]Both sides agree that a conditional sentence order is statutorily available to Mr. Nuttall.And both sides agree that the Court could impose what is commonly referred to as a blended sentence, for example, jail on the cocaine conviction and a conditional sentence order or probation on the other two matters.V.AnalysisThe Legal Parameters[16]There are no minimum penalties for any of the three offences.[17]The maximum penalty for each is imprisonment for seven (7) years.The Basic Legal Principles on Sentencing[18]Sentencing is a highly discretionary and individualized process.[19]I must have regard to the principles of sentencing outlined in section 718 of the Criminal Code of Canada – denunciation, specific and general deterrence, the need to separate certain offenders from society, rehabilitation, restorative justice and the promotion of responsibility in offenders.[20]Because of the nature of these offences and the personal circumstances of this offender, there is some tension between what would otherwise be the paramount sentencing principles.On the one hand, for these types of offences, denunciation and general deterrence are key.On the other hand, for a first offender, rehabilitation and specific deterrence are important.[21]Any sentence imposed must be proportionate to the gravity of the offences and the degree of responsibility of the offender – section 718.1.[22]These are serious offences, particularly the cocaine.[23]Mr. Nuttall should not be deprived of his liberty if less appropriate sanctions are appropriate in the circumstances – subsection 718.2(d).I should consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances – subsection 718.2(e).[24]Any custodial sentence imposed on a first offender ought to be as short as reasonably possible in the circumstances.Further, it ought to be tailored to the accused rather than solely for the purpose of general deterrence.The Aggravating and Mitigating Factors[25]In my view, the major aggravating factors here are (i) the sizeable quantity of cocaine and (ii) the fact that Mr. Nuttall was in possession of not just one but three illegal substances, at least two of which (the cocaine and the methamphetamine) are real scourges on our society.[26]The main mitigating factors are (i) the lack of any prior criminal history and (ii) the offender’s cooperation with the police.The Jurisprudence[27]No two cases are ever the same.Sentencing decisions can always be distinguished on their facts.[28]Of the cases filed by both sides, the two that are most relevant are Her Majesty the Queen v. Chad Lake, an unreported decision of Justice Seppi of the Superior Court of Justice in Brampton made on January 13, 2004 (relied upon by the Crown), and R. v. Day, 2011 ONSC 1148 (CanLII), a decision of Justice Thorburn (relied upon by the Defence).[29]In Lake, supra, after a trial, the offender was acquitted of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking but found guilty of simple possession of 12 grams of crack cocaine.Mr. Lake was in his early twenties at the time of the offence.He had no prior criminal record.He was employed.He had four young children.There was cogent evidence that he was a drug addict.He was on bail at the time of his arrest.Justice Seppi sentenced Mr. Lake to 6 months in jail to be followed by 6 months of probation.A conditional sentence order was considered but declined.[30]In Day, supra, the offender was found guilty after a trial of several offences including simple possession of 27.37 grams of cocaine.Mr. Day was in his late twenties at the time of sentencing.He had no prior criminal record.He was employed.He had no children and lived with his girlfriend.He used drugs but described himself as a non-addict.Justice Thorburn imposed a conditional sentence order of 2 years less 1 day in length, globally, on all convictions.What is a fit Sentence for Mr. Nuttall?[31]In my view, it is difficult to reconcile the two decisions referred to above.They are simply illustrative of what both counsel submitted to the Court today – there is a very wide range of sentences available on these offences.[32]I think that one of the chief distinguishing factors between Mr. Lake and Mr. Day is the degree to which the latter rehabilitated himself after his arrest.Mr. Day had “done everything one could have asked him”, including completing school, maintaining good employment, and fostering healthier relationships (see paragraph 24 of the reported decision).[33]I see Mr. Nuttall’s situation, overall, as more similar to that of Mr. Lake than that of Mr. Day.I simply do not have the same degree of evidence before me, and neither did Justice Seppi, that was placed before Justice Thorburn and which caused that Court to conclude that any length of time in jail would amount to a serious setback to the offender’s recovery (see paragraph 25 of the decision of Thorburn J.).[34]I reach the same conclusion as that of the Court in the Lake, supra decision; a conditional sentence order is not sufficient in these circumstances to meet the objectives of sentencing, particularly denunciation and general deterrence.[35]For possessing a cocktail of illegal narcotics, including nearly 30 grams of cocaine, Mr. Nuttall must be sentenced to some time in a correctional facility.[36]It necessarily follows that I reject the Defence request for probation on its own.I was impressed with the submissions of Defence counsel, however, such a sentence in my view, for this offender on these facts, would be inadequate.[37]Six months in jail, however, is too long for Mr. Nuttall.Unlike Mr. Lake, Mr. Nuttall was not on bail at the time of his arrest, and that factor was identified by Seppi J. as a major aggravating one.[38]Further, Mr. Nuttall appears to have a closer relationship with his children than Mr. Lake did.Certainly, it is relatively unique that Mr. Nuttall finds himself being sentenced when his daughter has recently lost her mother and he has an infant child at home.[39]As well, there is no indication that Mr. Lake cooperated with the police to the degree that Mr. Nuttall did.[40]A relatively short jail sentence for Mr. Nuttall will suffice, to be followed by probation.[41]I contemplated having a conditional sentence order follow the time in jail, however, I have concluded that the same end can be accomplished through probation.VI.Conclusion[42]The sentence of the Court is as follows.[43]On the simple possession of cocaine, a conviction is registered, and Mr. Nuttall is sentenced to 90 days in custody.[44]On the other two matters, the simple possession of methamphetamine and the simple possession of codeine, suspended sentences are imposed and Mr. Nuttall is placed on one probation order for 12 months.All of the statutory terms apply.In addition, Mr. Nuttall shall report to probation;he shall attend for any counselling or treatment recommended and not leave that program without permission from the supervisor;he shall sign any releases of information demanded of him to monitor compliance with counselling or treatment;he shall abstain from non-prescription drugs;and he shall obey a curfew of 11:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., daily, except for medical or dental emergencies for him or one of his children or his girlfriend and except for other times as approved in writing in advance by the supervisor.[45]The curfew condition is being imposed for two reasons.First, to provide some teeth to the probation order such that it adds something to the denunciatory and deterrent effect of the overall sentence but still respects the importance of rehabilitation.Second, I am not aware of anything that will cause that term to unduly prejudice the offender or his family.[46]The mandatory victim fine surcharges are imposed on all three matters, with 12 months to pay upon Mr. Nuttall’s release from custody.___________________________Conlan J.Released:February 9, 2017CITATION: Her Majesty the Queen v.

(the victim named in the Indictment) and Mr. M.K.1.[2]At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing I made findings of fact and heard submissions as to sentence.On January 19, 2017, I imposed sentence on Mr. M.K.1 and gave oral reasons.R v M.K.1, 2017 NWTSC 11 (CanLII).I indicated at the time that I would file Supplemental Reasons to explain my findings of credibility and address other issues that arose during the hearing.These are those Reasons.II)PROCEDURAL HISTORY[3]The events leading to the charge occurred in the early morning hours of April 26, 2015.M.K. made her complaint to the police that evening.[4]Mr. M.K.1 was charged and had a number of appearances before the Territorial Court.He initially elected to have a jury trial and to have a preliminary hearing.He later waived the preliminary hearing and re-elected to be tried by a judge of this Court, without a jury.[5]On December 4, 2015, Mr. M.K.1's counsel at the time, Michael Martin, wrote to the Court indicating that Mr. M.K.1 wished to plead guilty to this charge and another unrelated sexual assault charge.An appearance was arranged in Yellowknife for that purpose.[6]On December 14, 2015 Mr. M.K.1 entered guilty pleas to the two charges.At the time the guilty pleas were entered, Mr. Martin confirmed that the pleas were voluntary, fully informed and met all the requirements set out at section 606(1.1) of the Criminal Code.[7]The sentencing hearing for both matters was scheduled to proceed on April 18, 2016.It was scheduled to proceed in Inuvik, at Mr. M.K.1's request.There was no indication, at that point, that any of the Crown's allegations would be disputed.[8]The sentencing hearing, as it turned out, did not proceed on that date.Mr. Martin arranged to have Mr. M.K.1 appear before the Court in Yellowknife ahead of the hearing date.On April 13, 2016, Mr. M.K.1's matters were spoken to in Yellowknife.Mr. Martin told the Court that Mr. M.K.1 was asking to be represented by a different lawyer.Mr. Martin asked to be removed as counsel of record and this request was granted.Mr. Martin told the Court that he understood that Jay Bran, another defence counsel, might be taking over as Mr. M.K.1's counsel.[9]Mr. Bran was present in the courtroom and confirmed that he would be taking over the legal representation of Mr. M.K.1.He also indicated that Mr. M.K.1 might bring an application to have the guilty pleas struck.Crown and Defence agreed that the April 18, 2016 sentencing hearing in Inuvik should be cancelled to give counsel the time needed to obtain instructions and determine what the next steps should be.[10]Counsel eventually confirmed that there would be an application to withdraw the guilty plea with respect to the charge involving M.K.[11]The application to strike the guilty plea proceeded on August 8, 2016.It was dismissed on August 23, 2016.R v M.K.1, 2017 NWTSC 4 (CanLII).[12]On a subsequent appearance, counsel advised that the facts would be disputed at the sentencing hearing and that viva voce evidence would have to be called.The hearing was scheduled to proceed in Inuvik commencing on January 17, 2017.III)EVIDENCE ADDUCED AT THE SENTENCING HEARING[13]At the start of the sentencing hearing, no specifics were provided as to what aspects of the Crown's allegations were in dispute.At the conclusion of the evidence, it was apparent that there were a number of things with which Mr. M.K.1 did not actually take issue.[14]At the time of these events, M.K. lived in U[…].In April 2015 she went to Inuvik for a visit and stayed at the M.K.1 residence.M.K.'s aunt is Mr. M.K.1’s common law spouse of many years.M.K. considered Mr. M.K.1 to be her uncle.[15]On the evening of April 25, 2015, M.K., Mr. M.K.1 and his spouse spent the evening socializing, first at the house and later at the Trapper's Bar.They consumed beer throughout the evening.Everyone had a good time.There was no evidence of anyone having become grossly intoxicated.[16]They stayed at the bar until closing time and then returned home.A short time after their return, everyone went to bed.Mr. M.K.1 and his wife went to their room and M.K. went to her room.[17]It was undisputed that some time after this, Mr. M.K.1 came out of his room, went into M.K.'s room, and had sexual intercourse with her. The central issues at the hearing were how this sexual contact came to happen, and whether it was consensual.I now turn to the evidence relating more specifically to those issues.1.M.K.'s evidence[18]M.K. testified that after they returned from the bar she passed out in her room.She woke up to Mr. M.K.1 on top of her, having sexual intercourse with her.She tried to push him off but he was too heavy.She did not want him to do this and kept telling him to leave but he just \"kept going\".She did not remember if he touched her anywhere else on her body.All she remembered Mr. M.K.1 saying to her during this was \"you're so tight nobody fuck you, you're so tight nobody fuck you\".[19]When he was done, he got off her.She curled up and went to sleep.The next morning she left the house.She went walking around for a while.During the day she returned to the M.K.1 residence a number of times.The last time she was there she started feeling \"uneasy and yukky\" and left.She went to see her friend Diane and told her about what happened.She then went to the hospital to visit some relatives.While she was at the hospital, she reported the matter to the police.[20]M.K. did not remember how much she had to drink that night but said she remembered the evening up until when she went to bed and passed out, and then waking up to Mr. M.K.1 on top of her.[21]She said she tried to push Mr. M.K.1 off for a while and eventually gave up.She was not sure how long she tried to push him off.She acknowledged that she did not hit him or kick at him.[22]She acknowledged that she did not scream or call out for help while Mr. M.K.1 was on top of her, even though she knew her aunt was in a room across the hall.On Cross-Examination, it was suggested to her that the reason she did not scream for help was because she was consenting to what was happening.She denied this.[23]M.K. acknowledged that she returned to the M.K.1 residence a number of times during the day despite what had happened.She also acknowledged that throughout the day, she saw various people.She agreed with the suggestion, put to her on Cross-Examination, that there was nothing stopping her from telling those people what happened to her.[24]M.K. testified during her Examination-in-Chief that she went to bed fully clothed, and that when she woke up the clothes on the lower half of her body had been removed.She also said that she went to the bathroom before going to bed.In Cross-Examination she was asked if it was possible that, after she went to the bathroom, she did not put her underwear and leggings back on before going to bed.Defence counsel put a few questions to her about this topic:Q. Is it possible after you [went to the bathroom] you simply didn’t put your clothes back on from the waist down and you went to bed only with your top on?A. No, I don’t remember that.Q. So by not remembering it is possible that when you went to the bathroom and you took off your leggings and your underwear to use the washroom to urinate it’s possible that you came back to bed without wearing that clothes from your waist down, right?A. Oh God.Excerpt of the Sentencing Hearing (Evidence of M.K.), p.34 lines 15-25.[25]M.K. was becoming very upset and emotional at this point.I asked her if she understood the question.She said she did.I repeated counsel's question, asking whether it was possible that she did not put her clothes back on after going to the bathroom.M.K. answered “It could be possible”.[26]At the very end of the Cross-Examination, it was suggested to M.K. that when Mr. M.K.1 came into her room, she invited him on to the bed to have sex with her.She answered \"I don't, I don't recall that\".2.Mr. M.K.1's evidence[27]Mr. M.K.1 testified that a few minutes after he retired to his bedroom with his spouse, he came back out because he needed to use the bathroom.[28]Before going back to his room, he peeked into M.K.'s room.She was lying on the mattress on the floor, naked from the waist down.As soon as he peeked in she lifted both her legs up in the air towards her head; she opened her legs, exposing her genitals to him.He took this as an invitation to have sex.He took off his shorts and began having intercourse with her.He was positioned in front of her, on his knees, holding her legs.He was not lying on top of her.She did not try to push him away.[29]There was no verbal exchange between him and M.K. before, during, or after the sex.M.K. appeared to enjoy what was happening. She made the kinds of noises people normally make when they are having consensual sex.[30]After he was done he stood up to put his shorts back on.She turned around and positioned herself on her hands and knees with her buttocks towards him.He left the room and went to sleep on the couch.IV)ANALYSIS[31]My findings of fact were, obviously, driven by my assessment of the credibility and the reliability of the evidence of these two witnesses.Before I explain those findings, I want to briefly address the legal framework that applies in these circumstances.1.Legal framework[32]Crown and Defence disagreed about many things at this hearing, including aspects of the legal framework that governed it.One thing they did agree about was that this was a very unusual sentencing hearing.[33]A sentencing hearing is not a trial.A guilty plea, in law, constitutes an admission of the essential elements of the offence.It relieves the Crown of its evidentiary burden to prove those elements.An accused who has pleaded guilty no longer benefits from the presumption of innocence.R v Duong, 2006 BCCA 325 (CanLII).[34]Because of this, the rules of evidence, at a sentencing hearing, are more relaxed than they are at trial.The Court has a broad discretion in deciding what information will be relied on and how that information will be presented to the Court:723 (1) Before determining the sentence, a court shall give the prosecutor and the offender an opportunity to make submissions with respect to any facts relevant to the sentence to be imposed.(2) The court shall hear any relevant evidence presented by the prosecutor or the offender.(3) The court may, on its own motion, after hearing argument from the prosecutor and the offender, require the production of evidence that would assist it in determining the appropriate sentence.(4) Where it is necessary in the interests of justice, the court may, after consulting the parties, compel the appearance of any person who is a compellable witness to assist the court in determining the appropriate sentence.(5) Hearsay evidence is admissible at sentencing proceedings, but the court may, if the court considers it to be in the interests of justice, compel a person to testify where the person(a) has personal knowledge of the matter;(b) is reasonably available; and(c) is a compellable witness.724 (1) In determining a sentence, a court may accept as proved any information disclosed at the trial or at the sentencing proceedings and any facts agreed on by the prosecutor and the offender.(…)Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, ss. 723 and 724(1).[35]When a fact is in dispute, the burden to prove that fact is on the party wishing to rely on it.The burden of proof that generally applies is proof on a balance of probabilities.However, any aggravating fact that the Crown wants to rely on and is disputed, and any past conviction that is disputed, must be proven by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt.Criminal Code, supra, Subsection 724(3).[36]What was unusual about this case was that the key disputed facts were not aggravating facts; they were the facts making out essential elements of the offence (M.K.’s lack of consent and Mr. M.K.1's knowledge of her lack of consent).[37]This gave rise to the issue of what standard of proof I should apply in making factual findings.Not surprisingly, that issue is not addressed in the sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code because a sentencing hearing is not supposed to be about proof of the elements of the offence.[38]I understood the Crown to be arguing that because of the guilty plea, the standard of proof that I should apply was something less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.The Crown did not refer to any cases in support of this position.In the alternative, the Crown argued that the guilty plea should give rise to an adverse inference against Mr. M.K.1.No case was referred to in support of this position either.[39]Mr. M.K.1's counsel argued that the standard of proof should be proof beyond a reasonable doubt.Again, I was not referred to any case in support of that position.[40]Considering that, even at the sentencing stage, the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is the one that applies to disputed aggravating facts and disputed criminal convictions, I find it difficult to conceive how a lower standard could apply to facts that are at the heart of an essential element of the offence.[41]With respect to the issue of adverse inference, I want to make it clear that in this case, I would have rejected Mr. M.K.1's evidence irrespective of his guilty plea.My reasons for that are outlined below at Paragraphs 44 to 68.[42]That being said, I agree with the Crown that it would have been open to me to draw an adverse inference against Mr. M.K.1’s credibility under these circumstances.I will return to that issue later in these Reasons.But first, I will explain why I came to the conclusions I did in my assessment of the credibility and reliability of the testimonies of M.K. and of Mr. M.K.1.2.Assessment of credibility[43]In assessing the evidence, I have taken into account, among other things, the inconsistencies in the evidence, the plausibility of the witnesses' accounts of events and the demeanour of the witnesses.I have exercised caution in my consideration of demeanour, acknowledging that findings of credibility should never be based on that factor alone.[44]I rejected Mr. M.K.1's evidence for a number of reasons including: the implausibility of his narrative; subtle - and sometimes not so subtle - shifts in his evidence during Cross-Examination; and, generally speaking, his manner of responding to questions when he was challenged on certain aspects of his testimony.[45]On the whole, I found Mr. M.K.1's evidence about his interaction with M.K. self-serving, implausible and unreliable.I did not believe his version of how the sexual contact between him and M.K. unfolded, and his evidence did not raise any doubt in my mind.[46]Inconsistencies in the evidence are to be expected, especially when someone testifies about events that occurred a long time ago.Not all inconsistencies mean that someone is being dishonest or does not remember the events.Inconsistencies may well arise from innocent mistakes.[47]But other times, inconsistencies, even about minor points, may indicate that the witness is making things up, is exaggerating, is attempting to tailor the evidence to suit his or her particular needs, and is getting caught in lies.I found some of the inconsistencies and shifts in Mr. M.K.1’s evidence did not arise from innocent mistakes.[48]In some instances, it seemed that when Mr. M.K.1 was challenged on Cross-Examination about something, he added more and more details to bolster his evidence.And as he did, contradictions emerged and his evidence became weaker.[49]Some of this happened when he was being questioned about relatively innocuous topics.For example, Mr. M.K.1 was asked a series of questions in Cross-Examination about the effect that drinking alcohol had on his perceptions that night:Q. And would you agree with me that your perception is a little different if you’re sober as opposed to after having five to seven drinks?A. Doesn’t make any effect to me about how much beer I had because I’m, I’m a heavy drinker. I can drink beer all night.Q. You can drink beer all night?A. Yeah.Q. So the amount of beer that you had that night didn’t affect you at all?A. Not that much.Q. What did it do to you?A. Just made me want to dance on the dance floor.Q. And was that something you would do if you were sober?A. Yeah. I would do that if I was sober, dance a few times, yeah.Q. And what did you do differently - -A. Nothing differentExcerpt of Sentencing Hearing (Evidence of M.K.1), p.32 line 9 to p. 33, line 4.[50]The questions put to Mr. M.K.1 were clear and pertained to a simple topic. He seemed very reluctant to admit that the alcohol he consumed had any effect on him that night.When he did, he was careful to minimize the impact that alcohol had on him.He vacillated between the alcohol having had no effect at all, to it having had only a little effect, eventually going back to saying it had no effect at all.[51]Something similar happened when he was pressed about why he knew that his daughter was not home when they returned from the bar:Q. And was S.’s door closed or open?A. S.’s door was open because she was not home.Q. How do you know she was not home?A. Because her shoes and parka were not there when we arrive and there was nobody in the house.Q. Did you ever look in her room?A. Yeah. I know when she’s home. She always have her runners there and her jacket hanged up in the porch.Q. Did you see her?Did you look in her room?A. Yeah. She was not in her room when we arrived.Q. Did you look in the room?A. Yes, I did.Q. And when did you look in the room?A. When I was upstairs.Q. When was that?A. Like I said, when I went upstairs you could see her room. When we go to the bathroom it’s open and she’s not in her room.Q. Okay. Which time because you went upstairs twice you told us now - -A. Yeah. The first time. The first time I went upstairs you could see her room when we go to the bathroom or into our room.You could see her room open and nobody was in there.Q. Did you look inside?A. No.You can see inside the room there. She was not home.Q. But you didn’t look inside?A. No, I looked inside.I could see inside. You could see the whole room in there but there was nobody inside the room.Excerpt of Sentencing Hearing (Evidence of M.K.1), p.40 line 17 to p.41 line 21.[52]On this topic Mr. M.K.1 was consistent that his daughter was not home.But again, his reasons for being sure about that fact shifted and evolved as he was pressed on the issue.Initially he said he knew she was not home because her shoes and clothes were not in the porch.As the questioning went on he eventually said that he looked into her room and saw that she was not there.If that is the case, it seems strange that this was not the first answer he gave when he was asked how he knew she was not home.[53]Another example was in Mr. M.K.1's answers when it was suggested to him that he is much larger than M.K.He seemed reluctant to acknowledge even that.In his initial answer he agreed he is larger than M.K. now, but specified that he gained a lot of weight since being in custody.When the Crown pressed the issue and asked him about his weight back in April 2015, he said he weighed about 195 pounds.He eventually conceded that even back in April 2015, M.K. was much smaller than him.It seems clear that at all relevant times, Mr. M.K.1 was much larger than M.K.His reluctance to simply acknowledge that the first time he was asked struck me as odd.[54]These examples relate to topics that were not crucial to the determination of the most important areas of dispute at the sentencing hearing.But they are examples of how Mr. M.K.1 came across on Cross-Examination, and how he reacted when he perceived his account of events was being challenged.[55]In addition, there were points in his Cross-Examination where Mr. M.K.1 appeared to be grasping at straws.In denying that M.K. tried to push him off, he added that if she had tried to push him he would have had bruises on him, and that the police did not have any photographs showing bruises to his body.I found this evidence somewhat peculiar.The force that M.K. described using was not the type of the force that could reasonably be expected to leave bruises on her assailant.[56]Mr. M.K.1 also seemed to remember a lot of innocuous details about the evening, and in particular what happened when they returned to the house.He described in detail his spouse going to their bedroom; his spouse going to the bathroom; M.K. going to the bathroom; and himself going to the bathroom, all of this over a period of about fifteen minutes.He was adamant he remembered who went where and in what order.[57]When he was asked on Cross-Examination how he knew where people went, he said that from the living room area, he could tell, by the sound, when people were going inside the bathroom and when they were going inside a bedroom.And he seemed quite sure about who went where when.[58]In the context of this case, nothing turns on who went to the bathroom or bedrooms or in what order.But I found the progression of Mr. M.K.1's evidence, as he perceived that some of his assertions were being challenged, very telling.As more questions were being asked, he claimed to be very sure about these innocuous details, and offered additional reasons for why he was so sure about these things.[59]Mr. M.K.1’s counsel made the point in submissions that Mr. M.K.1’s testimony was precise.I found that it was in fact a little too precise, especially about things that were minor details of an evening that had been, up to that point, uneventful.I found the level of detail in his recollection surprising and suspicious.[60]Those are all examples of things that, taken individually, may not have much of an impact on my assessment of Mr. M.K.1's credibility.But cumulatively, they suggested to me that Mr. M.K.1 was tailoring his evidence, trying to make it better and more persuasive, instead of simply recounting events that he actually remembered.[61]Quite apart from my concerns about those somewhat peripheral aspects of his evidence, there were problems in his evidence on topics much more directly connected to the facts in issue.In particular, there were serious problems with his account of his interaction with M.K. when he went into her bedroom.[62]In his Examination in Chief, when he was describing peeking into M.K.’s room after he came out of the bathroom, Mr. M.K.1's counsel asked him whether he made eye contact with M.K.Mr. M.K.1’s answer was “I can’t remember but I think I did”.[63]When he was confronted on Cross-Examination about the lack of verbal communication between them before the sexual activity started, Mr. M.K.1 acknowledged there was no verbal communication, but he was insistent that their communication took place through their eye contact.He referred four times to eye contact having been the way they communicated after he peeked in her room.This is a major inconsistency on a central topic: Mr. M.K.1 went from \"not remembering\" and \"thinking\" they had eye contact to being very firm that they made eye contact and that was how they communicated.[64]Mr. M.K.1 was also somewhat inconsistent in his evidence about how exactly he came to be in the room.He alternated between saying he \"peeked\" into the room and saying he \"walked\" into the room.His counsel argued that perhaps Mr. M.K.1 was using those words interchangeably and that to him, they mean the same thing.[65]I accept that this could be the case, especially considering that English is not Mr. M.K.1's first language.But Mr. M.K.1 himself did not say he was using the words interchangeably.When pressed, he maintained that he peeked into the room.When reminded he had earlier said that he walked into the room, he did not say that he was using the two words interchangeably or that they meant the same thing to him.Instead he became defensive and accused Crown counsel of putting words in his mouth:Q. I’m going to suggest to you that you in fact went in the room and took her clothes off, took her underwear and pants off. What do you say to that?A. No, I don’t agree with that.When I walked into the room she had no pants on and no panties on.She was laying on the bed and he put her legs up in the air.Q. Well, that’s something interesting you just told us there. You said when you walked into the room. I thought you peeked in?A. Yeah. That’s what I mean. I peeked in.Q. Peeked in or walked in?A. Peeked in.Q. You just told me you walked in - -A. You’re just putting words in my mouth. I said I peeked in.Q. Those in fact are your words sir. So did you walk into the room - -A. I peeked in. Yeah. I peaked in the room there.Q. And do you think you did this or do you know - -A. No, I know I did.Excerpt of Sentencing Hearing (Evidence of M.K.1), p.49 line 25 to p.50, line 19.[66]Finally, I found Mr. M.K.1’s version of events implausible.M.K. is his niece.She was staying with Mr. M.K.1 and his wife.The three of them had spent a normal evening socializing together.No one was grossly intoxicated.According to Mr. M.K.1’s version, he looked into her room and, without any conversation or preliminaries whatsoever, after a moment of eye contact, she got into this very provocative pose, lifting both her legs up and showing him her genitals, to invite him, her uncle, to have sex with her, with her aunt across the hallway.More than that, after he was putting his shorts back on afterwards, she changed positions and adopted another provocative pose, presumably to invite him to continue.[67]I find Mr. M.K.1’s description of these events implausible and bordering on the grotesque.This is especially so when I consider M.K.'s evidence, and how she appeared and reacted when answering questions about what happened.Although the specific gestures attributed to her by Mr. M.K.1 were not put to her on Cross-Examination and she did not have an opportunity to respond to those specifics, her reactions to the suggestion that she consented to this appeared to me to be genuine shock.[68]A witness’ evidence must not be assessed in isolation.It must be assessed in the context of all of the evidence.In this case, my assessment that Mr. M.K.1’s evidence was not credible or reliable was bolstered by my assessment of M.K.’s testimony, which I found very compelling.[69]M.K. evidence’s was not perfect. There were things that she did not remember.On a few points, counsel referred her to the statement she gave to police and after having refreshed her memory, she confirmed certain details that she had not remembered at first.But none of those differences pertained to what happened in the bedroom.The areas where there were inconsistencies were for the most part peripheral and of little significance.[70]For example, in her statement to police, she said that when she returned to the M.K.1 residence the day after she was assaulted, everyone was sleeping.In Cross-Examination she was asked how she knew this.She answered that she saw Mr. M.K.1 sleeping on the couch.For the others, she acknowledged that she did not go into their rooms and did not actually see them sleeping.[71]Mr. M.K.1's counsel suggested on Cross-Examination that on this point, M.K. was not being truthful when she spoke to police.In my view that is making way too much of this aspect of her statement and of her trial testimony.There is no indication that she was asked, during the statement, if she actually checked the rooms and saw her aunt or her cousin asleep.My interpretation of the evidence is that she assumed that everyone was asleep because she did not see anyone up in the house. That is not an unreasonable assumption to make.I do not find this aspect of the evidence has any impact on M.K.'s credibility or the reliability of her evidence on other points.[72]Similarly, when M.K. was cross-examined about returning to the M.K.1 house the following morning, Defence counsel suggested that her luggage was still at the other house where she initially planned to stay during her visit to Inuvik.She answered that her luggage was at the M.K.1 house, because she had taken it there once it was decided she would not be at the other house.M.K. acknowledged that she did not mention the move of her luggage in her statement to police.Again, there is no evidence that she was asked about this during her statement so I find this aspect of the evidence of no significance.[73]It was suggested to M.K. that she saw various people that day, and that she could have told someone about this before she told her friend Diane.She agreed that there were others she could have told.I do not find the timing of the disclosure significant in this case, and I draw no adverse inference from it.[74]Although the doctrine of recent complaint has been abolished for many years, it perhaps bears repeating that our law now recognizes that this aspect of the law of sexual assault, as many others, was rooted in myths and stereotypes about how \"true victims\" of sexual assault victims would necessarily react.The abrogation of the doctrine of recent complaint and clear pronouncements by the Supreme Court of Canada make it clear that under our law, delayed disclosure does not in and of itself make a sexual assault complainant less credible.There are, of course, circumstances where the timing of disclosure may be relevant to the assessment of a complainant's credibility.But on its own, it means nothing.As we routinely tell juries, there is no rule in life or in law about how a sexual assault victim or a victim of trauma will react.R v D.(D.), 2000 SCC 43 (CanLII), para 65.[75]I also want to address the issue of M.K.'s motive to fabricate.The theory advanced by Defence was that M.K. falsely accused Mr. M.K.1 of having sexually assaulted her as a form of \"pre-emptive strike\" to ensure that she would not get into trouble with her aunt if she found out that M.K. and Mr. M.K.1 had sexual contact that night.[76]The problem with that theory is that there is no evidentiary basis for it.There is no evidence whatsoever that M.K.'s aunt found out, or was going to find out, about what happened.If M.K.'s goal was to protect her relationship with her aunt, accusing her uncle of sexual assault would not be the way to achieve it.Under the circumstances, I found Mr. M.K.1's position about M.K.'s motive to fabricate speculative and illogical.[77]I conclude that far from suggesting a motive to fabricate, M.K.'s relationship with her aunt actually bolsters her credibility.M.K. stood to lose a lot by making this complaint.The fact that she did despite the risks that it would destroy her relationship with her aunt supports the notion that something serious did in fact happen to her.[78]M.K.'s demeanour during her testimony is also consistent with something serious and traumatic having happened to her.I observed her during her testimony.The Inuvik courtroom is not large and the witness box is a few feet away from where the judge sits.The emotion that M.K. showed during her evidence, in particular when she was describing the act of intercourse, appeared very genuine to me.In addition to crying, there were points where she was shaking; on two or three occasions she heaved and it appeared that she would vomit.I find it difficult to believe that she was faking this.Her reactions and emotions did not appear to me to be fabricated, which they would necessarily have to be if she had an enjoyable and consensual sexual encounter with Mr. M.K.1 and was lying when she was describing it as having been forced on her.[79]I also note that although she became quite emotionally upset at times during her evidence, M.K. was not argumentative or defensive in her testimony.She readily acknowledged when she did not remember something.When she was asked to review her statement to police she acknowledged what she said in the statement.She made no attempt to justify or rationalize differences between her testimony and her statement.[80]Counsel suggested to M.K. at several points during Cross-Examination that she wanted to have sex with Mr. M.K.1.She maintained she was forced.She was not shaken on this point.[81]In deciding that M.K.'s evidence on lack of consent was not shaken on Cross-Examination, I considered carefully her answer to the last question on Cross-Examination, referred to above at Paragraph 26.I do not find that, in her answer to that last question, M.K. resiled from her earlier answers that she did not want to have sex with Mr. M.K.1.Something was suggested to her and she answered she did not recall that.She did not agree with the suggestion.That is consistent with her overall version of events that the sexual contact was non-consensual.On the whole, I found that M.K. was unshaken in her assertion that she did not consent to the sexual contact with Mr. M.K.1.[82]M.K. acknowledged that she did not kick or scream during the sexual assault.She said she tried to push him off but was not strong enough and eventually gave up.This makes sense given their differences in size.I also do not find it difficult to understand that she did not scream, under the circumstances.Again, the suggestion that anyone being sexually assaulted would react by kicking and screaming is based on the stereotypical assumption that everyone undergoing a traumatic event will necessarily react in the same way.[83]Defence counsel pointed out that there were several things that M.K. did not remember.I do not find this surprising given the passage of time.As I mentioned in my analysis of Mr. M.K.1’s evidence, under the circumstances, I find his level of precision far more suspect than M.K.’s inability to recall things like what day of the week she arrived in Inuvik; what kind of top she was wearing when she went to bed; whether Mr. M.K.1 touched her anywhere else on her body, or with another part of his body, while she was being subjected to forced intercourse; how much she had to drink that night.[84]Defence counsel noted that the Crown did not call any other witnesses, that there was no corroboration of M.K.’s version, no forensic evidence, and no evidence of her demeanour when she disclosed these events to her friend Diane or when she gave her statement to police.[85]Corroboration is not required in law.In some cases the absence of confirmatory evidence may give rise to a reasonable doubt.But I do not find this to be the case here.M.K.'s evidence was strong enough and compelling enough to satisfy me beyond a reasonable doubt that things unfolded as she described.[86]In summary, I found M.K.’s evidence convincing and compelling.I concluded that Mr. M.K.1 had forced sexual intercourse with her that night in the manner that she described, and that he knew she was not consenting.[87]However, as I said in my oral ruling, I was left with a reasonable doubt about whether M.K. went to sleep wearing clothes on the lower part of her body.M.K. conceded on Cross-Examination that it was possible that she did not put her leggings and underwear back on after she went to the bathroom before going to sleep.To the extent that the removal of her clothing by Mr. M.K.1 could be characterized as an aggravating fact, I concluded that this fact had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.3.Additional Comments[88]I will now briefly return to some of the other issues that arose during the hearing.[89]As noted above at Paragraph 33, in law, a guilty plea constitutes the admission, by the accused, of the essential elements of the offence.It relieves the Crown from the burden of proving them.It is a serious step that has meaningful consequences.[90]It is precisely because of the importance of that step that Section 606(1.1) of the Criminal Code requires the Court to satisfy itself of certain things before accepting a guilty plea.The Court must satisfy itself that the plea is voluntary, and that the person offering it fully understands its consequences.Specifically, the Court has to be satisfied that the person offering the plea understands that the plea is admission of the essential elements of the offence. Criminal Code, s. 606(1.1)(b)(i).[91]Denying an essential element of the offence at the sentencing hearing stage means resiling from the formal admission that the guilty plea represents.That contradiction can give rise to an adverse inference, particularly when there is no explanation for it.Mr. M.K.1 offered no such explanation in his testimony at the sentencing hearing.[92]Moreover, several months ago, Mr. M.K.1 applied to have his guilty plea struck and testified on that application.In that testimony, he did not give any indication that he was not admitting an essential element of the offence.The basis for his application was that he was confused at the time he entered his plea because he was grieving.He confirmed in that testimony that his plea was fully informed and that he understood its consequences.R v M.K.1, supra, pp. 8 to 13.[93]It is well established in law that not having intended to admit an essential element of the offence or having a defence to the charge are among the grounds that can be raised when applying to strike a guilty plea.Adgey v The Queen 1973 CanLII 37 (SCC), [1975] 2 S.C.R. 426; R v. K(S) 1995 CanLII 8926 (ON CA), [1995] O.J. No.1627 (Ont. CA).Given this, one would expect that a person attempting to have a guilty plea struck and who claims to have a defence to the charge would put this forward as part of the grounds for the application to strike the plea.[94]While there may be some strategic reasons not to reveal the particulars of the defence at that stage, it seems to me that there are also very real risks in holding back.[95]The first is that if the application to strike the plea fails, as it did in this case, protestations of innocence made for the first time at the sentencing hearing stage may be viewed with more skepticism than might otherwise be the case.[96]The second risk is that not putting the best case forward at the time of the application to strike the plea can be expected to reduce the chances of success of that application.And if the application fails, the person charged faces a sentencing hearing, not a trial.As already noted, a sentencing hearing does not contemplate the same procedural and evidentiary safeguards that a trial does.Sections 723 and 724 of the Criminal Code make that very clear.At a sentencing hearing, the presiding judge has considerable discretion to decide what information can be relied on and in what form it can be presented.In this case the Crown did not attempt to rely on the relaxed rules of evidence.It did not seek to present information to the Court otherwise than by in-Court testimony.But it could have.And it would have been within the Court’s discretion to accept evidence presented through other means.[97]Finally, at the hearing,I invited submissions from counsel about what should happen if I concluded that an essential element of the offence had not been proven to the requisite degree.In answer to that question, counsel referred to various possibilities in their submissions (that the matter could be remitted to trial, that a judicial stay of proceedings could be entered, that an acquittal could be entered).But the submissions on this point were not particularly detailed and no one referred me to any caselaw.As it turned out, given my findings of fact, the issue did not arise. I think it is better left to be decided in a case where it actually arises, and with the benefit of full submissions from counsel.V)CONCLUSION[98]These were my reasons for concluding that Mr. M.K.1 sexually assaulted M.K. in the manner that she described in her testimony. Crown and Defence agreed that on the basis of that version of events, this was a major sexual assault within themeaning of R v Arcand, 2010 ABCA 363 (CanLII) and R v A.J.P.J., 2011 NWTCA 2 (CanLII).In sentencing Mr. M.K.1, I followed the principles outlined in those cases.L.A.

Kellway.................................................................................................................for the CrownP. Abraham..........................................................................................counsel for the accused D.P.BORENSTEIN J.:[1]On August 8, 2008, 17-year-old D.P. was in a car with his two cousins, D.B. and M.B.. They were going to meet Brian Navarro. D.B. arranged to sell $1,000.00 worth of marijuana to Mr. Navarro. In reality, this was a set up to rob Mr. Navarro. D.B. and M.B. were in the front seats and D.P. was in the back with a sawed-off shotgun.[2]Mr. Navarro and two of his friends pulled up in their car to meet D.B.. M.B. got in the back seat next to D.P., and Brian Navarro got into the front passenger seat next to D.B.. As Navarro was looking at the marijuana, D.P. pulled out the sawed-off shotgun and robbed Mr. Navarro of almost a thousand dollars. Mr. Navarro returned to his car. M.B. and D.B. and D.P. drove off. Navarro drove after them. M.B. and D.B. fled and got into an accident and began to run. The police were on scene and caught D.P.. They retrieved the marijuana and the sawed-off shotgun. The shotgun was real but was unloaded. A sawed-off shotgun is a prohibited weapon.[3]This robbery occurred eight days before D.P. turned 18. D.B., his cousin, had turned 18 about two months before the robbery. M.B. was 27 and, according to the Crown, did not really participate in the robbery. It was D.B. who knew Brian Navarro and it was D.P. who used the sawed-off shotgun to commit this robbery.[4]18-year-old D.B. pled guilty to the robbery, use of prohibited weapon and possession for the purpose of trafficking.There is a five-year minimum sentence for robbery with a prohibited firearm. D.B., who was just 18 and had no prior record, received a sentence of five years and 45 days for the robbery charge and a concurrent sentence of six months for the possession for the purpose of trafficking charge for a total sentence of 5 years and 45 days.[5]Mr. D.P. set his case down for trial. On the trial date, with the witnesses present, he changed his mind and pled guilty to robbery while armed with a sawed-off .12 gauge shotgun, possession of that same firearm without being the holder of a licence, and careless transporting of that firearm.[6]D.P. had been in custody for two weeks prior to his release on bail. He was under house arrest but was allowed out for counselling. He had a prior criminal record for dangerous driving from 2007, for which he received probation.Impact of offence on the victim[7]Mr. Navarro provided a victim-impact statement. It is quite understated in my view. He is 30 years old and feels less safe as a result of this offence. He knew the accused D.B. and felt safe knowing that D.B. was in custody. I point out that it was D.P. who had the gun.One can only imagine how terrifying it would be to be in a car when someone pulls out a sawed-off shotgun to rob you. It is conceded by the defence that anyone robbed in these circumstances would be terrified.[8]This guilty plea came very late in the process – on the trial date. The victim had to come to Court to face the person who pulled a gun on him. It was only when the case was about to proceed that the guilty plea was entered. The matter was adjourned for sentencing. Then, the defence was not prepared to accept the victim impact statement due to an obvious typographical error. As a result, the victim was told he had to come to Court to testify as to the impact of the crime. He came to Court to testify and it was only then that the defence accepted the victim-impact statement without the need for the victim to testify.Crown and Defence sentencing positions[9]The Crown seeks a designation that this was a serious violent offence. They seek an 18-month sentence comprised of 12 months’ closed custody followed by six months’ community supervision, followed by probation, as well as a DNA order and a 10-year weapons prohibition pursuant to section. 51(1). Finally, the Crown seeks an order that the shotgun and the marijuana be destroyed.[10]The defence seeks a deferred custody and supervision order. They resist the SVO designation. If I designate this as a Serious Violent offence, then deferred custody is not a legally available sentence.[11]It is clear from both the Crown and defence submissions that both counsel believe some form of custodial sentence is warranted in this case. This was a violent offence.Background of D.P.[12]Almost all of the information I learned about D.P. came directly from the pre-sentence report and therefore I will review it extensively.[13]D.P. is now 19 years old. He was just eight days away from turning 18 when he committed this serious offence with his cousins. D.P. and his older sister lived with their grandparents in Mississauga next door to their parents.[14]D.P.’s grandfather was in a wheelchair and D.P. helped him manage. His grandfather died in 2007 and that was traumatic for D.P.. It was shortly after his death that D.P. committed the dangerous driving offence on his record, which he describes as joy riding to the author of the pre-sentence report.[15]About a month before the robbery, D.P.’s father lost his job and his parents moved in with their grandmother. D.P. helps care for his mother who has multiple sclerosis.[16]According to the pre-sentence report, D.P. came from a household with strict rules and D.P. followed those rules and was never in a fight. His family describe him as compassionate, helpful and respectful.[17]D.P. was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder at age 6 and was given Ritalin until Grade 7 or 8. He had difficulties in school with reading comprehension. As a result, he changed high schools several times but was able to successfully complete Grade 12. Due to the fact that he was on a career path rather than the academic stream, he earned a Certificate as opposed to a high school diploma. He told the author of the pre-sentence that his marks were generally in the 60’s and 70’s. Like much of the pre-sentence report, the author seems to rely exclusively on D.P.’s self-reporting or that of his parents and that holds true with respect to how D.P. did in school. D.P. apparently wants to obtain his full high school diploma and has an interest in the hospitality industry.[18]D.P. worked part time on occasion in 2007 and 2008.[19]The author of the pre-sentence report writes of D.P.’s talents in sports and states that D.P. is well liked in his community and often helps neighbours.[20]As for D.P.’s role in this offence, the author of the pre-sentence report writes as follows:D.P. expresses appreciation that this offence occurred just prior to his 18th birthday. He takes responsibility for his actions, as an accessory, as a party to the offence and does not justify or excuse his behaviour. D.P. feels hurt and betrayed by his two cousins whom he feels led him into his current behaviour. D.P. was also saddened by the fact that he was in detention during his last birthday and never got a birthday cake.[21]The author notes that D.P.’s parents feel the house arrest has been enough of a lesson to D.P. and he now just wants to move on with his life.[22]D.P.’s mother believes that counselling would help D.P. reintegrate into the community after a year of house arrest and to help him deal with his feelings of disappointment at being let down by his cousins. The author writes that D.P. is “adamant” that he does not want counselling because he feels there is a stigma attached to counselling.[23]The author is supportive of D.P.’s interest in the hospitality industry due do his good manners and friendliness.[24]The author makes reference to various community programs that she thinks may benefit D.P., including a five-session victim-impact awareness program that is available to young people who do not pose a risk to the community. Elizabeth Fry offers a cognitive skills program to help young people learn about the choices they make and their consequences. There is a tutoring service that can help people with learning disabilities and employment resource centre that can help people find jobs.[25]The author of the pre-sentence report concludes by stating that both the current offence as well as the previous one took place after family trauma. She notes that D.P. is described as well liked by his family and that the offence was out of character. She concludes that D.P. is amenable to community service and that his“… manners and personality would make him a good candidate to help at community special events. Community service would address reparation to the community and would be meaningful to the youth. This writer therefore respectfully submits that a community sentence would be sufficient to hold the youth accountable for his actions”.[26]This is a positive pre-sentence report to be sure. D.P. impressed the author, particularly with his manners and his personality. On the other hand, it is obvious that she relied almost exclusively on the self-reporting of D.P. and his parents. It does not appear that she looked at records from school to verify any information. While it is a positive pre-sentence report and will be treated as such, the overall report strikes me as too reliant on self reporting. Moreover, the comments about D.P. taking full responsibility for his crime are somewhat at odds with his own comments referred to in the report. The report seems to gloss over obvious areas of concern.[27]I have not been provided with any real explanation as to what led D.P. to participate in this crime, other than stress. Perhaps more importantly, I have not been provided with any insight as to what, if anything, D.P. has learned over the last two years. He has not enrolled in any counselling despite his bail containing an exception to house arrest for the purpose of counselling. Although he has not re-offended and has complied with his house arrest, which is commendable, there is little else before me to help me understand what led D.P. to commit this offence or what may assist him in moving forward in life in a positive way.[28]I have also heard from D.P. directly and he impresses me as remorseful, despite the plea on the trial date and the refusal to accept the victim-impact statement without hearing from the victim and then the agreement to its contents once the case was adjourned and the victim re-attended.[29]The defence argues he is young, remorseful and ripe for rehabilitation and has the support of his family and his community.[30]Since his release, he has made one appointment for counselling. Even though his bail had him under house arrest unless he was in counselling, he did not seek or participate in counselling. When asked why, his lawyer explained that the family did not think he was allowed out for counselling. I reject that as an explanation. The bail is clear. They were represented by counsel. There is no valid reason before me.Mitigating and aggravating factors[31]In brief, the main aggravating factor is the nature and circumstances of this offence. Three men lured the victim into a car and pulled out a sawed-off shotgun to rob him. While, fortunately, the gun was not loaded, the victim would not have known that and the matter would naturally be terrifying. Carrying a sawed-off shotgun and using it in the way it was used is at the high end of criminal activity. That it was committed by three men in concert makes it worse.[32]The 18-year-old cousin, who did not brandish the gun, and did not have a criminal record, received a sentence of over five years. The five year minimum for an adult reflects Parliament’s view of the extremely serious nature of this crime.[33]By way of mitigation, there is D.P.'s’s age. Although he has a record, it is, relatively speaking, minor. He pled guilty. Pleas of guilt not only spare the victim from testifying and save Court time, they are usually a demonstration of remorse. In this case, D.P. was arrested on scene. The gun was still there. He pled guilty on the trial date. These facts lessen the remorse that might be inferred from a guilty plea.It came on the trial date on an obviously very strong Crown case where the accused was arrested on the scene. Nonetheless, it is still an expression of some remorse. Further, I heard from D.P. himself and I do accept that he is remorseful.[34]His family is supportive and loving and that bodes well for his future and operates positively in this case as does the pre-sentence report. He has been on house arrest and he will be given credit for that. He complied with his bail and that is positive, although he has not sought to do anything productive since his release.Serious Violent Offence Designation[35]The Crown submits that this is a serious violent offence and I should designate it as such pursuant to section 42 (9) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.The onus is on the Crown to establish that this is an SVO beyond a reasonable doubt.[36]The defence submits that it is not a serious violent offence. In the alternative, even if it is, I should exercise my discretion not to designate it as a SVO for doing so would preclude a sentence of deferred custody which the defence submits is appropriate.[37]Both counsel agree that I have a discretion to not designate the offence an SVO even if it would qualify as such.[38]The primary effect of an SVO designation in this case would be to render unavailable a deferred custody and supervision sentence.If I designate this as an SVO, then deferred custody is not a legally available sentence.[39]Section 2 of the YCJA defines a serious violent offence as “an offence in the commission of which a young person causes or attempts to cause serious bodily harm”.Serious bodily harm is not defined in the YCJA; however, s. 2(2) provides that words used in the YCJA carry the same meaning as in the Criminal Code unless otherwise provided.[40]The Supreme Court in R. v. McCraw (1991) defined “serious bodily harm” as “any hurt or injury, whether physical or psychological, that interferes in a substantial way with the physical or psychological integrity, health or well-being of the complainant”.[41]In R. v. C.D. (2005), the Supreme Court adopted that same definition for the purposes of defining “serious violent offence” in s. 2(1) of the YCJA , holding that there was “no reason why this definition of ‘serious bodily harm’ should not also be used for purposes of the YCJA, and, in particular, for purposes of the definition of ‘serious violent offence’ that is found in s. 2(1) of the Act”.[42]Accordingly, a serious violent offence under the YCJA is an offence in the commission of which a young person causes or attempts to cause serious bodily harm – meaning, any hurt or injury, whether physical or psychological, that interferes in a substantial way with the physical or psychological integrity, health or well-being of the complainant.[43]In my view, this was a serious violent offence. While it is true that no physical harm was caused or intended, I have no doubt that pulling a sawed-off shotgun on someone in a car for the purpose of robbing him was an act intended to terrify and to threaten and is an attempt to cause serious psychological harm. The defence concedes that any victim would be terrified having a shotgun pulled on them anywhere, including in the close confines of a car. That was the precise intention: cause the victim to believe he may be killed so that he would turn over his money.The fact that the victim-impact statement downplays the harm does not detract from the accused’s intention.[44]This was a serious violent offence. I will designate it as such. The pre-mediated nature of this crime, the bringing of a sawed-off shotgun into a car, the luring of the victim into the car to be robbed, surrounded by three people, brandishing a sawed-off shotgun, were all acts meant to threaten to cause harm or death to the victim lest he comply. That the accused’s actions would terrify any victim is conceded and was foreseeable. That was the point of producing the gun. The only reason suggested by the defence to exercise my discretion not to declare this crime an SVO is that it would render a deferred custody and supervision order unavailable. It is not clear to me that that is an appropriate consideration. It is somewhat circular and would entirely nullify Parliament’s direction that deferred custody is unavailable with respect to serious violent offences. In any event, the other factors relating to the nature of this offence outweigh that consideration. I will designate this offence an SVO. Accordingly, a deferred custody and supervision order is unavailable. In my view, even if it were available, it would not be an appropriate sentence in this case.[45]What is the appropriate sentence bearing in mind the principles of sentencing in the YCJA?[46]Just because custody is an available sentence does not necessarily mean that it is required or appropriate. Sentencing under the YCJA is significantly different than sentencing under the Criminal Code. The purpose of sentencing is to hold the young person accountable for the offence by imposing just sanctions that have meaningful consequences to the young person that promote his rehabilitation and reintegration into society. The focus of sentencing is to protect society through an attempt to rehabilitate and reintegrate the youth back into the community. The sentence must be the least-restrictive sentence capable of achieving the purpose of sentencing and must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the offender’s degree of responsibility.Deterrence – be it specific or general – are not considerations on sentencing under the YCJA though that may still be an effect of a just sentence. To quote the 2009 decision of R. v. K.L. by our Court of Appeal, “at bottom, [the] sentence must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the degree of [the young person’s] responsibility”.[47]Mr. D.P. is now 19 years old. He committed this offence eight days before his 18th birthday. Had he committed it just about one week later, he would have faced a minimum five-year sentence as his cousin did.It is ironic that two boys who grew up together and who are, for all intents and purposes, the same age, and who committed this offence together, with the accused being the one who brandished the gun – facing such disparate sentences. It is unfair. Is parity something that I can consider under the YCJA? I am expressly required to consider parity in relation to other young persons. But what about his cousin D.B.?[48]In the 2008 decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Wobbes, O.J. 2999, an adult offender argued on appeal that his sentence should be reduced due to the lesser sentence imposed on a young person who had committed the offence with him. The court rejected that argument holding that the sentencing regime under the YCJA was completely different than under the Criminal Code, notably, that deterrence was not a consideration and that the YCJA placed mandatory restrictions on the use of custody.[49]This case approaches parity from the opposite end from the Wobbes case but the principle is the same. Parity with an adult is not a consideration. Nonetheless, the five-year minimum for this offence for an adult does reflect how seriously Parliament considers this crime and is relevant to the overall proportionality assessment of a just sentence.[50]The Crown has submitted a variety of cases where custodial sentences have been imposed upon young people who commit robberies with guns.[51]The 2009 Ontario Court of Appeal decision in R. v. J.S., O.J. No. 812, in particularly instructive. In that case, J.S. and another youth wore masks and robbed a lone storekeeper in a convenience store. J.S. threatened the storekeeper with an imitation handgun. His accomplice was armed with a knife. The sentencing judge sentenced J.S. to 12 months’ probation and declined to make a DNA Order. On appeal, the Court found the sentence was unfit and failed to recognize the seriousness of the offence and failed to properly address the requirement that J.S. be held accountable for his actions and that meaningful consequences flow from the sentence. The Court of Appeal held that, ordinarily, such offences would attract a significant custodial sentence, even for a youth. However, in light of what the Court of Appeal called J.S’s “exceptional” rehabilitative progress, they imposed a deferred custody and supervision order.[52]There are similarities and differences between the J.S. case and D.P.’s. Obviously a storekeeper is a different and more vulnerable victim than in our case but the basic principles in J.S. still apply.In this case, I agree with the Crown that not breaching one’s bail, while commendable, is not exceptional progress. Where is the progress, or insight, or counselling or anything in this case. There is a complete absence of information as to what D.P. has done over the last two years. There is no plan proposed. There is nothing demonstrating insight or progress.[53]Clearly, a custodial sentence is available pursuant to section 39(1)(a) and is warranted. It is a violent offence. In fact, the submissions of both counsel revolve around a custodial sentence, the defence just submits that deferred or open custody would be sufficient in the circumstances.[54]This sentence must be the least restrictive sentence possible but must also be proportional to the seriousness of the offence and must hold D.P. accountable for his crime.[55]Having considered all of the above and the personal circumstances of D.P., and trying to impose the least restrictive sentence available that would hold D.P. accountable, it is my view that a 12 month custody and supervision order is appropriate in this case to be followed by probation. That means, he will be in custody for eight months followed by four months of community supervision.[56]In my view, open custody would be more appropriate in this case than closed custody. The first eight months of the sentence will be served in open custody followed by four months of community supervision. I do not see the need or the benefit of placing D.P. in closed custody. I am also taking into account the fact that he has already been on house arrest for almost two years without incident. Following the custody and supervision portion of his sentence, D.P. will be placed on probation for one year. He is to report to a youth officer. He will be subject to the mandatory terms of probation. In addition, he will take and participate in any counselling that may be recommended to him by his youth worker and he is to sign all releases to enable his youth worker to monitor his compliance with this term. He will not possess any weapons as defined by the Criminal Code. He will have no contact with the victim or with D.B. or M.B.. He will attend school or seek and maintain employment and provide proof to his youth worker.[57]He will be subject to a 10-year weapons prohibition and there will be an Order destroying the marijuana and the shotgun in this case. There will be an order that he provide a sample of his DNA.[58]Finally, I am concerned about the potential application of section 93 of the YCJA, which permits the Provincial Director to transfer Mr. D.P. from open custody to an adult facility upon turning 20. Accordingly, I invite D.P. to bring an application for a sentencing review prior to his 20th birthday. If he is doing well, that would enable me to consider a variation of the sentence and the Provincial Director’s views.Released:March 9, 2010Signed: “Justice Borenstein”"}

C-46)Porter, P.C.J.Introduction[1]These are the reasons for sentence for offences of having possession of child pornography [Criminal Code s. 163.1(4)] and also of having used a computer system to communicate with a person under the age of 18 years for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an offence [Criminal Code s. 172.1(1)(a)]. Both charges were prosecuted summarily.[2]The full particulars of the commission of the offences at Bar have been reported, at R. v. Brown, [2015] N.J. No. 402 (P.C.), and so need not be reproduced here. In brief, over the span of several weeks, the accused used a series of text messages to persuade a young teenaged girl to take photographs of herself, and to send them to him. When he was arrested on an unrelated matter, his cell phone was examined, and found to contain these pictures.[3]Counsel agree that the 2012 amendments to the statutory provisions require that the accused be sentenced between a minimum of 90 days, and a maximum of 18 months in custody.The positions of the parties on the custodial part of the sentence[4]The parties took very different positions on sentence. The Crown suggested a sentence of a year, while the accused said a minimum sentence of 90 days, concurrent, would be a reasonable disposition. Given the disparity, it will be useful here to briefly summarize the arguments made in support of the respective positions.[5]For the Crown, Mr. Patten cited Criminal Code s. 718.01, R. v. Rice, 2012 CarswellNfld 479 (P.C.), and R. v. Keeping, [2013] N.J. No. 336 (P.C.). Let me discuss these in that order.[6]S. 718.01 of the Criminal Code provides as follows:718.01 When a court imposes a sentence for an offence that involved the abuse of a person under the age of eighteen years, it shall give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence of such conduct.[7]The victim of the child pornography in this case was 13 years old when the communication with the accused started, and she had her 14th birthday a few weeks after that. It follows that s. 718.01 applies.[8]In R. v. Rice, 2012 CarswellNfld 479 (P.C.), a 37 year old man had established a relationship witha 16-year-old boy through a video game and then pursued other contact by social media and cell phone. The accused had exchanged erotica with complainant and gave him nude pictures of a young boy before asking for pictures from him. The accused pleaded guilty to internet luring, possession of child pornography and distributing child pornography. The trial judge sentenced the accused to a global sentence of 22 months, including one year for distribution of child pornography to be served concurrently and four months for possession of child pornography, and gave credit of 88 days for time served.[9]There are a several things to note about R. v. Keeping, [2013] N.J. No. 336 (P.C.). First, it was arguably a more serious offence than the matter at Bar, because the naked photographs of the victim in that case had been put on the internet by the accused. Second, it was a matter where there was a joint submission for a shorter sentence than now being sought by the Crown. Third, the joint submission was rejected, and, fourth, the decision rejecting the joint submission was overturned on appeal to the Summary Conviction Appeal Court: see R. v. Keeping, [2014] N.J. No. 381 (SCTD).[10]As a result, the trial level decision in Keeping has limited utility, other than to point to the position of the Crown, i.e., that a minimum sentence was appropriate in a case of a small number of child pornography pictures. The end result, after the summary conviction appeal court decision, was a sentence of 118 days, being made up of 14 days imprisonment for possession of child pornography; 14 days consecutive for a second count of possession; and 90 days consecutive for distribution.[11]The Crown took the position that a sentence of 7 to 8 months would be appropriate for the “luring” offence, and that a consecutive sentence, of 4 to 5 months, was appropriate for the possession charge. These sentences ought to be made consecutive, with the result being a range of sentence of between 11 to 13 months in custody.[12]For the accused, Mr. Evans, Q.C., pointed out the fact that the victim was not the origin of the police file, in that the police had found the photographs on the cell phone while reviewing it for evidence in relation to a drug offence. Further, said counsel for the accused, the accused had not made the photographs. The victim had made them, and had sent them to the accused. I hasten to add here that she did this after persistent demands for the photographs made by the accused.[13]Mr. Evans, Q.C., pointed out that all of this happened two years ago, and that a lot of changes had been made by the accused. The pre-sentence report was exceptionally positive, he said, and clearly set out how the accused had turned his life around. The accused had been living a criminal lifestyle, selling drugs to supplement his fishing income, when he had committed these offences. Now, two years later, the accused was the group leader in a local chapter of Narcotics Anonymous. While he is not working at present, he does expect to return to work in the fishery later this year.[14]Counsel for the accused pointed to the fact that the accused had been caught with drugs in February, 2014, and had been sentenced, in July 2014, for that offence. Since the photographs had been made and transmitted to him between December 2013 and February 2014, the present offences were actually his first offences, and so he ought to be sentenced as a first offender.[15]Counsel for the accused also took the position that these two offences were committed simultaneously, and therefore amounted to a single “criminal adventure”, as that term is used in R. v. Crocker, 1991 No.172 (NL CA). As a result, the appropriate sentence should be two concurrent terms of 90 days in custody.[16]When the Criminal Code s. 726 allocution was put to the accused, he said that he was sorry, and that he would like to apologize to the victim. He also said that he has changed his life.Analysis[17]Objectively, in getting these photographs and storing them on his cell phone, the accused was not committing as serious an offence as the offences committed by Keeping, because Keeping had put the photographs of his victim on the internet. Further, the Supreme Court, Trial Division, endorsed a minimum sentence for the offences committed by Keeping. In that context, it is difficult to understand the change in the position taken by the Crown.[18]Furthermore, the Supreme Court, Trial Division has already accepted that the accused at Bar has made significant positive changes to his life. On July 30, 2015, the accused was sentenced by the Supreme Court for his role in causing a disturbance, as part of a melee in Marystown on June 4, 2014. That decision is reported at R. v. Brown, [2015] N.J. No. 261 (SCTD).[19]The antecedents of the accused, with both date of offence and date of conviction, are set out in a chart at paragraph 8 of that decision. All of the offences were committed in February, 2014, i.e., after the commission of the offences at Bar. The mitigating factors, which are also relevant to this matter, are set out in paragraph 13 of that decision, and include the following:He is still a young man, and \"technically\" a first offender.He graduated high school, acquired a trade and has worked in the fishing industry for the last five years.He is an industrious worker and his fishing employer values his services.He is a member of both Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous and is committed to abstaining from alcohol and drug use.His parents support him and they are committed to his welfare but condemn his criminal behavior.He complied with past court orders requiring supervision, he introduced meaningful changes to his lifestyle since he was arrested in June 2014 and he remains open to any interventions that may be required in the future.[20]Given the sentence in Keeping, and taking into account the successful efforts made by the accused to rehabilitate himself, the position advocated by counsel for the accused is endorsed. Accordingly, the sentence for each offence is 90 days in custody.[21]The offences were committed together, and are so closely intertwined that they amount to a single criminal adventure. As a result, the sentences will be served concurrently.Ancillary orders[22]Counsel agree that there are ancillary orders, as follows:1)SOIRA order for ten years, based on Ss. 490.011(1)(a)(viii) and 490.013(2)(a) of the Criminal Code;2)DNA order, as a result of s. 487.04(a) of the Criminal Code;3)Forfeiture of the cell phone containing the photographs, pursuant to s. 164.2 of the Criminal Code; and4)Probation.[23]Before setting out the probation conditions, the issue of the s. 161 order requires discussion. Crown counsel requested a s. 161 order. It is not mandatory in this case. The accused at Bar has never met the victim of his crimes. While it is possible that they could meet inadvertently, keeping him away from her does not require a s. 161 order. That can be achieved through the provisions of a probation order. There is no reason to believe that it is necessary to prohibit the accused from going to parks or swimming pools in order to protect the public. Since I am not persuaded that a s.161 order is necessary, it is not ordered.[24]S. 731.1 of the Criminal Code requires that before making a probation order, the court shall consider whether section 109 or 110 is applicable. There is no reason to make any order prohibiting the accused from possession of firearms, ammunition, or explosive substances.[25]Following his release from custody, the accused will be on probation for two years. The probation conditions include the following1.keep the peace and be of good behaviour;2.advise the court or the probation officer of any change of name, address or occupation;3.abstain from communicating, directly or indirectly, with the victim;4.report to a probation officer within two working days after release from custody, and thereafter, when required by the probation officer and in the manner directed by the probation officer;5.attend any counselling recommended by the probation officer.Conclusion[26]The accused persuaded a young teen to take nude pictures of herself and to send them electronically. The pictures were discovered when the police searched his cell phone incidental to his arrest for drug offences. There was no evidence that the photographs had been distributed, put on the internet, or even shown to anyone else.[27]At the time of the commission of these offences, the accused was a first offender. The pre-sentence report was exceptionally positive, and it was clear that the accused had already made significant progress in his rehabilitation.[28]As a result, the minimum sentences were imposed, as well as a number of ancillary orders.Porter, P.C.J."}

Stilman, for the AccusedAccused)))HEARD:January11th and February 22nd, 2017REASONS FOR SENTENCELeMay J.[1]After a six day jury trial, Mr. Hesam Bayrami-Asl was convicted of one count of importing opium contrary to the Controlled Substances Act. The conviction stems from the fact that, on June 4th, 2014, the Offender entered Canada through Pearson International Airport with approximately 3.9 kilograms of opium hidden in the false bottoms of two suitcases.[2]I am required to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence.Facts[3]The Offender was born in Iran, but has lived in Canada since 1991.He has moved back and forth between Canada and Iran regularly starting in 2010, as he was responsible for running the family business after his father passed away.[4]The Offender travelled from Toronto to Turkey on May 31st, 2014, arriving in Istanbul on June 1st, 2014.He purchased his ticket for cash at the airport.He spent three nights at a hotel in Istanbul, and met up with a woman that he knew, Sanaz Poursiamak.He testified that the purpose of this trip was to consider exploring a clothing business, although he did not provide a lot of details about this business.[5]Ms. Poursiamak did not testify in this trial.She had been known to the Offender from the time he dated her sister for six months back in 2009. The Offender became a friend of one of Ms. Poursiamak’s cousins, but had no contact with Ms. Poursiamak between 2009 and 2013. There was an incident in 2013 where Ms. Poursiamak was detained at Pearson because there was opium in an amount for personal use in her possession. The Offender was aware that Ms. Poursiamak was an opium user.[6]The Offender was also aware that Ms. Poursiamak owned a spa in Canada, and had been exporting beauty products into Iran.As a result of this export business, Ms. Poursiamak had been generating large amounts of currency in small bills that she needed to move to Canada. The Offender testified that there were restrictions on what currency could be taken out of Iran and, as a result, Ms. Poursiamak could not move this currency openly.[7]When they met up in Turkey, Ms. Poursiamak provided the Offender with two suitcases. Both contained sealed packages that were placed in false bottoms of the suitcases. The Offender testified that he believed he was transporting $80,000.00 in currency that had been generated by Ms. Poursiamak’s spa business in Iran from Turkey to Canada.[8]The Offender testified that he was to be paid $15,000.00 plus expenses to bring this $80,000.00 in currency across the border, and that he was certain it was currency because he inspected the sealed packages and they were firm, much like currency would be if it was in a package.The Offender was aware that the penalty for bringing in more than $10,000.00 in currency was a fine, and the potential confiscation of the money.[9]The Offender flew into Pearson Airport on June 4th, 2014 on the same flight as Ms. Poursiamak.He went through his initial screening at customs with Officer Matthew Schrock. Officer Schrock determined that Mr. Asl should attend a secondary inspection, and marked his customs declaration card accordingly.The Offender then went downstairs to the baggage carousel and had a conversation with Ms. Poursiamak.He then went to the washroom, encountered Officer Schrock there, and went to secondary inspection.[10]In the secondary inspection area, Officer Schrock emptied the Offender’s suitcases, which included both his clothing and Ms. Poursiamak’s clothing.He noticed an anomaly in the suitcases, and had them x-rayed. Officer Schrock then punctured the packaging and tested it, confirming that it was opium.[11]The weight of the opium was 3.9047 kilograms.The evidence established that the opium had a street value at the kilogram level of $88,000.00, at the ounce level of $111,000.00 and at the gram level of $117,000.00.[12]As is clear from the foregoing, the Offender testified.The jury’s verdict makes it clear that they rejected the Offender’s evidence, and it did not leave them in a state of reasonable doubt.The Offender[13]The Offender was born in Tehran, Iran and is currently 43 years old.He lived in Turkey for a period of time, and came to Canada in 1991. He is a Canadian citizen.He has two sisters, one older and one younger.His parents were married until his father’s passing in 2010.His father owned a construction company.[14]The Offender became responsible for managing the construction company when his father passed away in 2010, and has been travelling back and forth between Iran and Canada on a regular basis as a result of his responsibilities to the business.[15]The Offender has a good relationship with his mother, and with both of his sisters. The Offender is married, and his wife, who is from Iran, is a medical student who is working towards completion of her medical exams so that she can obtain her medical licence in Ontario.[16]The Offender is not a user of opium or of other drugs, and has no addiction issues that I was made aware of.Mitigating Factors[17]The mitigating factors in this case are:a)The Offender is a mature first-time Offender.b)The Offender has a supportive family network, and has been a productive member of the community.Aggravating Factors[18]The aggravating factors in this case are more complex. One of the key factors that the Crown argues is aggravating is the role that the Offender played in this importation scheme.Specifically, the Crown argues that the Offender was not a mere courier, but a principal in this scheme.[19]The Defence, on the other hand, argues that the accused was a courier, and was simply willfully blind to what he was importing into the country. The question of whether the Offender was a mere courier or a principal in the operation is related to, but distinct from, the question of whether he actually knew what the substance was, or whether he was a willfully blind courier.[20]Part of the defence’s argument was that, since the jury was instructed on willful blindness, I am required to adopt the interpretation of the jury’s verdict that is most favourable to the Offender.As a result, the defence argues that I should simply find that the accused was a willfully blind courier (with no additional knowledge of the importation scheme), and should sentence him on that basis.[21]I reject this argument. In doing so, I note the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in R. v. Ferguson (2008 SCC 6 (CanLII)). In that decision, McLachlin C.J.C. states (at paragraphs 16 to 18):[16] This poses a difficulty in a case such as this, since, unlike a judge sitting alone, who has a duty to give reasons, the jury gives only its ultimate verdict.The sentencing judge therefore must do his or her best to determine the facts necessary for sentencing from the issues before the jury and from the jury’s verdict. This may not require the sentencing judge to arrive at a complete theory of the facts; the sentencing judge is required to make only those factual determinations necessary for deciding the appropriate sentence in the case at hand.[17] Two principles govern the sentencing judge in this endeavour. First, the sentencing judge “is bound by the express and implied factual implications of the jury’s verdict”:R. v. Brown, 1991 CanLII 73 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 518, p. 523. The sentencing judge “shall accept as proven all facts, express or implied, that are essential to the jury’s verdict of guilty” (Criminal Code , s. 724(2) (a)), and must not accept as fact any evidence consistent only with a verdict rejected by the jury: Brown; R. v. Braun (1995), 95C.C.C. (3d) 443 (Man. C.A.).[18] Second, when the factual implications of the jury’s verdict are ambiguous, the sentencing judge should not attempt to follow the logical process of the jury, but should come to his or her own independent determination of the relevant facts: Brown; R. v. Fiqia (1994), 1994 ABCA 402 (CanLII), 162 A.R. 117 (C.A.).In so doing, the sentencing judge “may find any other relevant fact that was disclosed by evidence at the trial to be proven”[22]Given this direction from the Supreme Court, and the differences in the arguments of the parties, I must resolve both the question of whether the accused had actual knowledge, and whether the accused was a mere courier, or was more principally involved in the importation scheme. If he did not have actual knowledge, then it is more likely than not he was just a courier.[23]Part of my instruction to the jury on willful blindness made it clear that wilful blindness is imputed knowledge, and that it is deliberate ignorance.[24]There is not a great deal of difference, if any, between the sentence for someone who is wilfully blind and someone who has actual knowledge.Indeed, in R. v. Sidhu (2009 ONCA 81 (CanLII)), the Court of Appeal stated (at paragraph 17) that wilful blindness, rather than actual knowledge, was not a mitigating circumstance.[25]However, given that the Offender is arguing that he was both wilfully blind and a courier, I must resolve the issue of whether he had actual knowledge in order to address the question of whether he was solely a courier in this case.If the offender was wilfully blind, then he can only be a courier.However, if he had actual knowledge he could be either a courier or a principal.[26]I find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the Offender actually knew that there was opium in the packages, rather than being willfully blind.I reach this conclusion for the following reasons:a)The amount of money ($15,000.00 plus expenses) that the Offender claims he was being paid to bring $80,000.00 of currency into Canada does not fit with the risks associated with currency smuggling, which the accused himself acknowledged were at most a small fine and the confiscation of the money, which was not his.b)The explanation of smuggling currency itself makes no logical sense.It is simply unbelievable that the Offender would be paid nearly 20 percent of the value of the currency to bring it in person when it could have been transferred electronically from a Bank in Turkey. It must be remembered that, although Iran has restrictions on transferring U.S. dollars out of the country, the accused acknowledged that Turkey does not have such restrictions.c)The accused was well aware that Ms. Poursiamak was an opium user and had been caught at the border with opium in her possession before.[27]Based on the foregoing, I find beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender knew he was smuggling opium into the country rather than cash.[28]This brings me to the question of whether the Offender was a courier, or had a more principal role in the importation scheme.This issue was considered in detail by Hill J. in R. v. Holder (1998 CanLII 14962 (ON SC), [1998] O.J. No. 5102).In that decision, Hill J. stated (at paragraphs 34 and 35):[34] It is not apparent from the verdict of the jury as to whether Ms. Holder was a courier or a principal acting on her own behalf.This is an issue which frequently arises in cases involving unlawful importation of a narcotic or a controlled drug or substance.If indeed the offender is a courier, it is seen uniformly as being a mitigating circumstance in sentencing.In these circumstances, the accused is viewed as a lesser player in the organization, an employee, a “runner”, or a “mule”.A principal on the other hand, is one who is a more active participant, more substantially involved, likely to receive more profit and certainly more intricately involved in domestic sub-distribution of the narcotic or controlled substance.[35] As stated in R v. Bishop (April 24, 1998), Hill J. (Ont. Gen. Div.)(unreported) at pages 4-5, the appropriate starting reference point is that a convicted importer is a principal.This is a presumption that can be rebutted by an accused individual.The facts relating to the circumstances of the importation are, of course, peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused.The presumption that the accused is acting on her own can be rebutted by proof, on a balance of probabilities, pursuant to s.724(3)(d) of the Criminal Code.[29]The accused must demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that he was a mere courier in this case.I reject that argument.Indeed, the preponderance of the evidence favours the conclusion that the accused was a principal in this case:a.He travelled to Turkey for a number of days prior to bringing the opium back, and had no good explanation for his trip there.He explained that it was to look at establishing a business, but could not provide relevant details.As a result, this fact suggests that he was going to Turkey as part of an importation scheme.b.On his own evidence at trial, he had communication with Ms. Poursiamak in the airport in Toronto prior to being detained by customs.However, he denied knowing Ms. Poursiamak when questioned by customs the night of his arrest.These facts also suggests that he was involved in the importation scheme as a principal, and that it was a joint venture with Ms. Poursiamak.c.I reject the Offender’s evidence that he was paid money to bring this package into Canada, regardless of whether he knew it was opium or currency.The Offender’s explanation in this regard is not believable.In particular, I note that the Offender claimed to have been paid $15,000.00 plus expenses to import these packages.This amount is approximately twenty percent of the value of the Opium at the kilogram level.I reject this explanation.Instead, the Opium was being imported for his own gain.d.While far from determinative, for many couriers it is readily apparent that they could not be a principal as they have no access to funds as well as obvious financial need that acts as a motivator.In this case, the opposite is true. The Offender had access to funds, including the funds to purchase a ticket to Turkey on short notice, and I heard no evidence of financial need on his part.[30]In the circumstances, therefore, I am of the view that the accused was a principal in this importation scheme, and he is not entitled to the mitigation of sentence that would be provided to a courier.[31]The other aggravating factors in this case are:a)The amount of opium that was imported, being nearly 4 kilograms.b)The fact that the importation was for commercial gain.Purposes and Principles of Sentencing[32]The statutory principles and purposes of sentencing are set out in section 718 of the Criminal Code and section 10 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.In light of the fact that the accused was a principal who knowingly imported these drugs into the country, the principles of general deterrence and denunciation should be emphasized.[33]There are relatively few cases on the sentencing ranges for the importation of opium. I was referred to case law by both the Crown and the Defence. The Defence also relied on some of the Crown’s cases in argument.[34]The Defence referred me to three British Columbia cases, R v. Aghabeigi (2004 BCCA 263 (CanLII)), R v. Pirouz (2009 BCCA 51 (CanLII)) and R. v. Henareh (2015 BCSC 2455 (CanLII)).On reviewing these cases, each of them is distinguishable from the case at bar.[35]Aghabeigi concerned the importation of approximately 9.6 kilograms of opium in the lining of two suitcases. Ms. Aghabeigi was suffering from major depression, fibromyalgia and arrhythmia at the time of the offence. She also developed type 2 diabetes between the time of the offence and the date of sentencing.The Crown sought a sentence of six to seven years.Ms. Aghabeigi was given a sentence of three years. The British Columbia Court of Appeal found that the sentence in this case was “lenient”. I entirely agree with that characterization.Further, the sentence was lenient because of Ms. Aghabeigi’s personal medical circumstances, which is a factor that does not apply here.[36]Pirouz concerned the importation of 3.144 kilograms of opium, as well as the possession of an additional 2.263 kilograms. Mr. Pirouz was given a conditional sentence of two years less a day.In upholding the sentence, the Court of Appeal noted that the authorities, while limited in number, supported a range of sentence of between three and five years. However, the unique personal circumstances of Mr. Pirouz’s case (which included having been imprisoned in Iran, and suffering PTSD as a result), justified a departure from the range.Again, these mitigating factors are not present in the Offender’s case.[37]Henareh concerned the importation of 14 kilograms of opium.In this case, the Court found that this was a commercial enterprise and that Mr. Henareh’s involvement was more than a one-time event.While Mr. Henareh was not found to be in partnership with the main importer, it was a business relationship and Mr. Henareh had knowledge of the opium importation scheme.Mr. Henareh was given three years for these offences. A number of Ontario cases were distinguished, in part, on “the different sentencing regime in Ontario” (see paragraph 93).[38]This brings me to the Ontario cases.I start with R. v. Abolmolouk ((1987) 23 O.A.C. 144 (C.A.)).In that case, the Court of Appeal considered the range of sentence for the importation of 805 grams of opium. This case arose immediately after the Supreme Court’s decision in R. v. Smith (1987) 1987 CanLII 64 (SCC), 75 N.R. 321, which struck down the mandatory minimum sentence of 7 years under section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.In that case, the Court of Appeal found that a sentence of four years for a first time importer was appropriate.[39]More recently, in R. v. Rashidi-Alavije (2007 ONCA 712 (CanLII)), the Court of Appeal affirmed a sentence of five and a half years for a courier who brought 6 kilograms of opium into Canada.Mr. Rashidi-Alavije had no criminal record.[40]Then there is the decision in R. v. Bokark (2008 ONCJ 378 (CanLII)).In that case, the accused was a first time Offender who had imported 13 kilograms of opium.The Court found that the accused was involved in both the importation of the opium, and in possession for the purposes of trafficking the opium. In those circumstances, a sentence of nine and a half years was imposed.Bokark clearly involves a more serious offence than the one in this case.[41]This brings me to the decision in R. v. Rajaei-Mehrabadi (2016 ONSC 3362 (CanLII)). In that case, the Court was dealing with a case where the Offender had imported 6.45 kilograms of opium, which is more than was imported by the Offender in this case. Taking into account, inter alia, the fact that the accused had anxiety and depression, and that he had been on social assistance, Dawson J. stated (at paragraphs 23 to 25 ):[23] Based on my review of the cases, and relying in particular on the factual information cited at paras. 6 and 7 of Abolmolouk, I agree that the range of sentence for the importation of multiple kilograms of opium for commercial drug trafficking is three to seven years. I would also adopt the British Columbia Court of Appeal’s description of a three year sentence for the importation of over nine kilograms in Aghabeigi as lenient.[24] In my view, the quantity involved in the importation and whether the accused is addicted or a user, are of critical importance. If the evidence supports a finding of commercial trafficking on a significant scale a midrange penitentiary sentence will usually be required in order to deter and denounce the importation of an addictive substance. It is well known that addictions can lead to many other social costs and often to the commission of other crimes. However, the fact that opium is not as addictive as some of the other hard drugs and has a smaller market, are relevant factors affecting the determination of an appropriate range of sentence.[25] I would add that were there any evidence that the opium imported in this case was being used to make morphine or heroin the range of sentence would extend considerably higher than seven years.[42]In the circumstances, this case is relatively similar to the one that is before me.The distinguishing features are the fact that Dawson J. found that the accused in his case was a courier, and had a history of anxiety and depression.Dawson J. was also dealing with the importation of 6.45 kilograms of opium, which is more than was imported in this case.[43]Dawson J. imposed a sentence of four and a half years.In my view, given the fact that the Offender was a principal, and imported multiple kilograms of opium, I am of the view that the sentence should be slightly longer than the sentence in Rajaei-Mehrabadi.The Sentence to be Imposed[44]Based on the foregoing, and based on the Offender’s role in this importation, I find that a fit and proper sentence is five years.[45]There will also be a weapons and firearms prohibition order pursuant to s. 109 of the Criminal Code. To the extent such order is discretionary it will be for ten (10) years.[46]Both counsel agree that the minimum victim surcharge fine of $200.00 should be imposed in this case, and I so order.[47]In addition, there will be a DNA Order under s.487.051(3)(b) of the Criminal Code and a forfeiture Order.___________________________LEMAY JReleased:April 3, 2017CITATION: R v.

Kienapple, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, counts two to seven in the indictment, being the five counts of theft over and one count of possession of property obtained by crime under $5,000, were conditionally stayed.[2]The findings of guilt relate to the theft by Mr. Simoes of vehicles from Halton Honda on or about November 28, 2009.The Circumstances of the Offender.[3]A pre-sentence report was prepared in contemplation of sentencing which provides some insight and background regarding Mr. Simoes’ personal circumstances. However, I note that Mr. Simoes did not provide the author of the report with any collateral sources.[4]Mr. Simoes is 32 years old and was born in Toronto.He is the youngest of three children.His mother and two brothers have left Canada to reside in Lisbon, Portugal.[5]Mr. Simoes was raised by his parents until they separated when he was ten years old.He recalls a violent home environment and states that he endured physical abuse from both his parents. His father committed suicide when Mr. Simoes was 15 years of age.[6]Mr.Simoes completed grade eight and obtained some grade nine credits.He has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder.[7]Mr. Simoes has worked sporadically as a labourer doing construction and landscaping work.[8]Mr. Simoes denies having any alcohol or drug issues.However, as noted in the pre-sentence report, the Ministry of Community, Safety and Correctional Services’ files indicate that he had admitted to excessive drinking on occasion and that excessive alcohol consumption has been a contributing factor in “several incidents”.[9]Mr. Simoes has a history of convictions dating back to 1993 in youth court.His first conviction in adult court was on July 9, 1997, when he was convicted of possession under and sentenced to 45 days incarceration.Since that date he has been convicted on 18 occasions.The adult convictions include possession of property obtained by crime, theft over, possession of break-in tools, and dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm.[10]According to the pre-sentence report, the Ministry of Community, Safety and Correctional Services’ records do not indicate successful completion of community supervision and Mr. Simoes advised the author of the report that he does not wish to have probation imposed as part of his sentence.[11]The author of the pre-sentence report reached the following conclusion:CPIC and Ministry records indicate that efforts to curb the reoffending that the subject appears to habitually be involved in, by imposing terms of incarceration appears to have failed. It is of a concern to this writer that the subject will return to his serious offending behaviour, posing serious danger to the society if he returns to the community. It appears that the subject may benefit from a highly structured setting due to his stated request that he not have a community disposition.Position of the Crown[12]Crown counsel submits that a global sentence in the range of 6 to 8 years is appropriate in the circumstances of this case.[13]In support of his position, the Crown submits that Mr. Simoes has embraced a life of crime as evidenced by his record and that periods of probation have not been successful given his previous convictions for breach of probation orders.[14]The Crown submits that the level of moral culpability for these offences is high given his related record and the level of planning involved in the break and enter.The Crown notes that this was a crime involving high value inventory and that there was no recovery. He categorizes the crime as an “enterprise crime”.[15]Turning to the principles of sentencing, the Crown submits that the need for general and specific deterrence is high.Further, he submits that given Mr. Simoes’ past failures with community-based sentences and the danger he poses to society, that the need for separation from society is evident.The Crown submits that Mr. Simoes is not interested in rehabilitation or having a positive connection to society or even having any pro-social relationships, as evidenced by the lack of collateral sources found in the pre-sentence report.He notes as well that Mr. Simoes has no ability to pay restitution and submits that there is a need to promote a sense of responsibility in the circumstances of this case.[16]The Crown concedes that the trial was abbreviated because the defence agreed to certain facts and that this is a mitigating factor.[17]The Crown submits that Mr. Simoes’ sentence in June of 2005 for driving while disqualified, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, obstruct peace officer, possession of property obtained by crime over $5,000 and failure to comply with a probation order was the equivalent of approximately 2 years and 3 months.Further, he submits that Mr. Simoes’ sentence in April of 2009 for dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm, driving while disqualified, possession of property obtained by crime under $5,000 and break enter and commit was the equivalent of approximately 3.9 years.The Crown argues that it is clear from the accused’s record that after the April 2009 charges he went out and began accumulating further charges related to serious crimes.[18]The Crown has advised that on or about June 1, 2011 Mr. Simoes pleaded guilty in court in Orangeville to charges of break and enter and possession of stolen property over, possession of stolen property under and obstruct. He received a global sentence of 315 days pre-trial custody on a two for one basis, so that sentence shows as 630 days in jail.[19]The Crown calculates that for the purposes of this sentencing Mr. Simoes has pre-trial custody of 419 days, which includes 32 days of two-for-one time.With respect to enhanced pre-trial credit, the Crown submits that Mr. Simoes would never have obtained bail given his criminal record and the fact that he has no family available to him to act as a surety.He also submitted that there is no evidence that Mr. Simoes would take advantage of programs available to him had he not been in a remand centre.[20]The Crown also submitted that it is appropriate to reduce any sentence by the 315 days referred to above on the principle of totality.Thus it is the Crown’s position that the global sentence be reduced by 734 days.Position of the Defence[21]Defence counsel submits that the appropriate sentence is three years of incarceration less a total of 928 days which equates to an additional 167 days of custody. The 928 figure includes 380 days pre-trial custody at the rate 1.5 for 1, 16 days pre-trial custody at a rate of 2 for 1 rate and the 315 day reduction on the principle of totality.[22]In support of her submission for enhanced pre-trial credit, counsel notes that Mr. Simoes has spent long periods of time in pre-trial custody over the last number of years.She relies on the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in R. v. Monje, 2011 ONCA 1 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 1, for the proposition that pre-trial custody is the most punitive form of custody.She also relies on R. v. Johnson, 2011 ONCJ 77 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 822 wherein Justice Melvyn Green noted that remand centres do not have the same level of educational counselling, treatment, training and educational programs as prisons.Counsel submits that Mr. Simoes should be given credit for 1½ days for each day in pre-trial custody, excluding the 315 days deducted pursuant to the totality principle.[23]Counsel also points to Mr. Simoes’ background, including his violent home life as a child and his father’s suicide when he was 15 years old, as a relevant factor for consideration.She notes that he has no family support in the country.[24]She submits that Mr. Simoes is in a cycle of offences but there has been no increase in terms of the level of violence in the offences.It is her position that when Mr. Simoes’ record is reviewed, it is clear that he is being charged with similar offences over and over again and that it is in the public interest to see him rehabilitated.[25]The defence relies on the case of R. v. Alves, [2008] O.J. No. 2597 (ON S.C.) wherein Justice Newbould sentenced an offender who had a record of 65 convictions beginning at age 16 to 3½ years less pre-trial custody for a break and enter and theft at a residential property.Counsel notes that courts have traditionally imposed longer sentences in circumstances where a break and enter has occurred at a residence rather than at a commercial establishment as is the case here.[26]The Ontario Court of Appeal decision in R. v. Desjardins, [2007] O.J. No. 1775 (Ont. C.A.) is also relied upon.In that case, the Court reduced a sentence for break and enter from 4 years to 3 years.[27]The defence cites the decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v. Dieter, [2007] ABCA No. 152.In that case, the appellant had 22 convictions, 19 which were for property-related offences, and 7 of those involved break and enters.The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 4 years consecutive.The Court of Appeal found that 4 years was an unfit sentence having regard to the nature of the offence, the accused’s early guilty plea and the totality principle.They substituted a sentence of 3 years consecutive.[28]Counsel submits that while step-up sentences may be appropriate, the sentence cannot be disproportionate to the seriousness of the offence.Analysis[29]The general principles of sentencing were summarized by Justice Trafford in R. v. Palantzas, [2009] O.J. No. 3682, as follows:Under s. 718 of the Code, the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing a just sanction.Any such sanction must, looking at the case as a whole, be the result of a fair and balanced consideration of the need to:•denounce the unlawful conduct;•deter the offender, and others, from committing such an offence;•separate the offender from society, where necessary;•assist in the rehabilitation of the offender;•provide reparation for harm done to \"victims\", or the community;and•provide a sense of responsibility in the offender, while acknowledging the harm done to the \"victims\" and the community.Section 718.1 of the Code requires the sentence to be proportionate to the offence and the degree of the offender's responsibility.An offender is not to be deprived of his liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances of the case.All available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances must be considered for all offenders.It is to be emphasized that these principles of sentencing do not include a principle of revenge.Offenders are not incarcerated for the purpose of establishing an equivalence between the loss of the victim, or victims, and the sanction imposed by the Court.Rather, the Court is required to recognize the inherent worth and dignity of the offender and, having balanced the principles provided by the Code, determine a fit sentence in the circumstances of the case.This is the Canadian tradition, a tradition that enjoys a long and respected history in Canada and other free and democratic societies like it throughout the world.[30]I accept that the cooperation by the defence in abbreviating the trial is a mitigating factor which I should take into account.[31]Defence counsel provided a case law brief but recognized in her submissions to me that none of the cases submitted was on all fours with this case. The Crown did not provide any cases.[32]I believe that defence counsel’s reliance on Desjardin is misplaced.In that case, the Court of Appeal noted that the sentencing judge indicated that he was prepared to sentence the appellant to “a little more time on top” of pre-trial custody.However, the sentencing judge went on to impose a four year sentence on the ground that the appellant had recruited his 14 year old daughter and her boyfriend in the crime.The Court of Appeal held that that factor alone could not properly lead to a three year increase in sentence.In the case at bar, there is no single factor which I am relying upon in determining the appropriate sentence.[33]In Dieter, one of the grounds relied on by the Alberta Court of Appeal was the nature of the crime.In that case, the appellant had thrown a rock through a window of a hair salon and stole approximately $2,500 in merchandise.In the present case, we are dealing with a much more sophisticated crime where Mr. Simoes engaged in a very well planned theft of several motor vehicles.Therefore, I find that the facts of the Dieter case are distinguishable from the circumstances of this case.[34]In Alves the sentence for a repeat offender charged with break and enter and theft at a residential property was 3½ years, plus one year each for breach of a probation order and breach of recognizance.The latter two sentences were concurrent with each other but consecutive with the break and enter sentence.Therefore, the total sentence was 4½ years.[35]The Alves case is distinguishable from the present case.In Alves, the offender’s longest previous sentence was 14 months in custody.In the present case, the longest sentence was effectively almost 4 years in length and it seemingly had no impact on Mr. Simoes’ continuing criminal behaviour.[36]Considering Mr. Simoes’ criminal record, I am very concerned by the fact that even with increasing sentences, he does not appear to be able to avoid a life of habitual crime.[37]I am also troubled by the very negative pre-sentence report which makes clear that Mr. Simoes has no interest in being the subject of community supervision.[38]In the circumstances, I conclude that the most appropriate sentence is one which removes Mr. Simoes from society. I believe that a penitentiary sentence is required as a specific deterrent to Mr. Simoes to prevent him from committing further offences.[39]Both counsel made reference to the “jump principle” which was considered by Justice Spies inR v. Smickle [2008] O.J. No. 2231:[63]I must also consider an issue concerning what is referred to as the “jump principle”. That principle suggests that there should not be too great an increase in subsequent sentences imposed on an offender over a previous sentence imposed on the same offender. In this case, Mr. Smickle’s last sentence was his longest; an effective sentence of ten months after two for one credit for five months time served.[64]Mr. Band argued that the jump principle is particularly applicable in this case given Mr. Smickle’s young age, the nature of his prior convictions and the type of sentences he has previously received.He argued that Ms. Stanton cannot rely on the 2007 conviction as an aggravating factor as Mr. Smickle was sentenced while he was incarcerated on the convictions before me.In other words, he had no opportunity to learn from that sentence.He took the position that I should, therefore, consider his longest sentence to be a sentence of 45 days, which was imposed for the 2004 drug convictions, not ten months.[65]Ms. Stanton argued that the jump principle was not applicable because of the severity and nature of the offences, the high need for deterrence to be addressed, the fact that protection of the public is paramount, and that the possibility of rehabilitation was not present.[66]In J.G., Mr. Justice Nordheimer decided that the jump principle did not apply where the longest previous sentence was 22 months, because the convictions before him were more serious than the earlier conduct, there was no likelihood of rehabilitation and a sentence of even double the longest previous sentence would fail to achieve the sentencing objectives of deterrence and denunciation[40]I accept the Crown’s position that if Mr. Simoes received the then standard credit of 2 for 1 for pre-trial custody credit in the April 2009 sentence it was effectively almost 4 years in length.I do not believe that a substantial penitentiary sentence would violate the “jump principle”.Even if the April 2009 sentence was less than 4 years, in my view the jump principle is not applicable because of the need for deterrence in this case.[41]The sentence proposed by defence counsel does not adequately reflect the serious nature of the enterprise crime which was committed and the fact that Mr. Simoes has been seemingly unable to refrain from engaging in criminal behaviour.[42]Notwithstanding the foregoing, I believe that the range proposed by the Crown of 6 to 8 years is too high. I note that it is unsupported by any case law and I decline to accept it as appropriate in the circumstances.[43]Considering all the circumstances of the case, I find that a fit sentence with respect to count 1 – Break Enter and Commit – is 5 years incarceration and I sentence Mr. Simoes accordingly.[44]I turn now to the submission of the defence that Mr. Simoes should be granted enhanced credit for pre-trial custody of 1.5 days per day served of pre-trial custody.The Truth in Sentencing Act fundamentally altered the consideration of pre-trial custody for sentencing purposes. It did away with 2 for 1 pre-trial custody credit and made 1 for 1 credit the norm. At the same time, it preserved the right of sentencing judges to award enhanced credit of 1.5 for 1 where the circumstances warrant (see R v. Abubeker, 2011 ONCJ 337 at paragraph 14 and R. v. Morris, 2011 ONSC 5206 (CanLII) at paragraph 33).[45]In my view, it is not sufficient for the defence, as they have done in this case, to point to the lack of facilities in remand centres or to argue that pre-trial custody is effectively “dead time” because time spent in pre-sentencing custody does not count in calculating eligibility for parole. These were the very justifications for the 2 for 1 practice which was eliminated by the Truth in Sentencing Act. Parliament must be presumed to have been cognizant of these arguments and issues when it enacted legislation to make 1 for 1 pre-trial custody credit the norm (see Morris at paragraph 33 and R v. Stephenson, 2011 ONCJ 484 (CanLII) at paragraphs 31 to 32.)[46]In order for a court to find that the circumstances warrant enhanced pre-trial credit there must be something specific to the circumstances of the particular accused which would justify departing from the ordinary rule. There is nothing in circumstances of this case which leads me to conclude that 1.5 for 1 credit is appropriate. There is no evidence before me that Mr. Simoes’ experience in pre-trial custody is any different than other person in pre-trial custody.[47]I also agree with the submission of the Crown that there is no suggestion that Mr. Simoes would have been able to obtain bail had he sought to do so, and further that there is no evidence before me that Mr. Simoes has any interest in taking advantage of any rehabilitation opportunities.[48]I decline to order enhanced credit of 1.5 for 1 and find that the appropriate credit is 1 for 1. Mr. Simoes will be given 2 for 1 credit for the 16 days referred to above.[49]I reduce the 5 year sentence of incarceration by 419 days for pre-trial custody and by 315 days in keeping with the totality principle.The total reduction is 734 days. The net result is a sentence of 1,091 days of further custody on count 1 in a federal penitentiary.[50]On the remaining counts I find that the following are fit sentences and I sentence Mr. Simoes as follows:Count 8 – Obstruct Peace Officer – 18 months incarceration; andCount 9 – Possession of Break-In Instruments – 18 months incarceration.[51]The sentences on counts 8 and 9 are concurrent with each other and with the sentence on count 1.[52]The Crown sought a DNA order and that request was not opposed by Mr. Simoes. An order will go pursuant to section 487.051 of the Criminal Code that Mr. Simoes provide a DNA sample for the DNA databank.[53]The defence did also not oppose a non communication order pursuant to section 743.21 of the Criminal Code that Mr. Simoes not communicate with Andrew Cabral.That order will go.HOURIGAN J.Released: January 25, 2012CITATION: R. v.

H.8 (“H.T.A.”).These seven guilty pleas were entered on November 23, 2006, in Toronto.One of these offences emanated from the Niagara Falls jurisdiction but Kang had that charge transferred to Toronto so that he could resolve all his H.T.A. charges at the same time.Four of Kang’s seven offences that I convicted him on were for driving a motor vehicle while his driver’s license had been under suspension contrary to s. 53(1).The H.T.A. specifically provides for imprisonment up to a maximum of six months as a possible sentence for an offender with a second driving while under suspension conviction in a five-year period.The prosecution had informed Kang on November 23 that it was seeking a custodial term as a sentence.The sentencing hearing was then adjourned to January 31, 2007, in order that a pre-sentence report (“P.S.R.”) for the offender could be prepared.A six-page P.S.R. dated January 25, 2007 (Exhibit #3), was prepared by a probation officer and provided to both the prosecution and the defendant’s counsel.[2]In the sentencing hearing, the prosecution argued that an intermittent custodial sentence of 30 to 45 days, performing community service of 200 to 250 hours and a prohibition against driving should be imposed on Kang because of the nature of the present offences and for Kang’s lengthy record of driving convictions.Kang’s driving record, which he has compiled in a relative short period between January 3, 2003 and July 27, 2004 (Exhibit #1), is comprised of 16 convictions under the H.T.A., which include three previous convictions for driving while under suspension. On the other hand, counsel for Kang argued that a custodial sentence should not be imposed on Kang, since the sentencing objectives of specific and general deterrence and rehabilitation could be met with sentencing Kang to a period of probation, to community service of 50 to 100 hours, to counseling with his doctor and to a prohibition against driving for a specific period and a condition not to attend any casinos.Kang’s counsel also submits that the probation officer who prepared the P.S.R. recommended these sanctions instead of a custodial sentence and that Kang would be a suitable candidate for community supervision.[3]I reserved judgment on sentence at that time and adjourned the matter to March 22, 2007, for my decision.Kang failed to make a personal appearance on March 22 and on May 7, 2007, for sentencing.His counsel appeared on those two days on his behalf and requested adjournments, indicating that he was out of the country.I then adjourned the matter to August 13, 2007.These, therefore, are my reasons for sentence:2.THE OFFENCES[4]The seven guilty pleas made by Kang were for committing the following offences:(i)On the 7th day of August 2005, at 2:35 p.m., did commit the offence of being the driver of vehicle with Ontario License Plate number ATXE 428 on northtbound Islington Avenue in the City of Toronto of speeding 86 k.p.h. in a 50 k.p.h. zone, contrary to s. 128 of the H.T.A.(ii)On the 7th day of August 2005, at 2:35 p.m., did commit the offence of being the driver of vehicle with Ontario License Plate number ATXE 428 on northtbound IslingtonAvenue in the City of Toronto while driver’s licence was suspended, contrary to s. 53(1) of the H.T.A.(iii)On the 5th day of October 2005, at 9:40 p.m., did commit the offence of being the driver of vehicle with Ontario License Plate number ATXE 428 on eastbound Queen Elizabeth Way at RoyalYork Road in the City of Toronto of speeding 140 k.p.h. in a 100 k.p.h. zone, contrary to s. 128 of the H.T.A.(iv)On the 5th day of October 2005, at 9:40 p.m., did commit the offence of being the driver of vehicle with Ontario License Plate number ATXE 428 on eastbound QueenElizabeth Way at Royal York Road in the City of Toronto while driver’s licence was suspended, contrary to s. 53(1) of the H.T.A.(v)On the 14th day of November 2005, at Highway 420 and Stanley Avenue in NiagaraFalls did commit the offence of being the driver of Acura vehicle with Ontario License Plate number ATXE 428 while driver’s licence was suspended, contrary to s. 53(1) of the H.T.A.(vi)On the 18th day of December 2005, at 11:50 p.m., did commit the offence of being the driver of vehicle with Ontario License Plate number AXXL 191 of failing to stop for a red light on Adelaide Street West at Duncan Street in the City of Toronto, contrary to s. 144(18) of the H.T.A.(vii)On the 18th day of December 2005, at 11:50 p.m., did commit the offence of being the driver of vehicle with Ontario License Plate number AXXL 191 on AdelaideStreet West at Duncan Street in the City of Toronto while driver’s licence was suspended, contrary to s. 53(1) of the H.T.A.3.BACKGROUND OF KIHWAN KANG[5]Kihwan Kang was born on April 3, 1982, in Korea.He emigrated toCanada at the age of 13 years with his family.He is a permanent resident of Canada.His father runs a very successful lumber trade business and primarily resides in Korea.His mother resides in Canada as a homemaker.However, Kang’s counsel indicated that Kang’s father’s business has burned down and has lost the business since the December immediately preceding the sentencing hearing held on January 31, 2007.However, there is no documentary evidence presented to the court that verifies this.Kang also supposedly married a Korean visa student named Jinok Park on January 6, 2007, in a civil wedding, just weeks before the sentencing hearing was held.His new wife is presently in Korea.There is also no documentation presented to the court that verifies that this marriage has occurred.[6]The P.S.R. indicates that Kang is not presently employed but that he had at one time operated his own computer and technology company.His counsel submits that Kang is still trying to start another business that sets up websites.Again, there is no documentation that supports his present efforts to start another business, although counsel indicated she would provide such documentation, if available, to the court before March 22, 2007.For the P.S.R., the probation officer interviewed Kang’s uncle, who lives in Canada, and summarized what Kang’s uncle said about Kang in the P.S.R.Kang’s uncle did not describe Kang in a very flattering light.Kang is portrayed by his uncle as someone who is not a very industrious or dependable, nor is he very mature or responsible in his actions.Furthermore, the probation officer indicated that Kang’s uncle had described Kang as living a privileged life where he drives fast cars and spends all his time gambling at casinos.This lifestyle, as suggested by Kang’s uncle, is made possible by his parents in Korea who send money to him to support him.The uncle also paints Kang as a playboy living on the money his parents send him.[7]The probation officer also writes in the P.S.R. that:Mr. Chong described the subject’s parents as law-abiding, peaceful and loving however he was of the opinion that they “spoiled” the subject with endless amounts of spending money and material goods (for example buying him expensive luxury cars).He is of the opinion that the subject now lacks the appropriate motivation to pursue education /employment as he is aware that his parents are very wealthy and will continue to provide for him.[8]The P.S.R. also indicates that Kang had also been enrolled in a prestigious private school in Canada, but was expelled from that school.His uncle also indicated that he believed that Kang was irresponsible in marrying someone without first introducing the woman to his family.[9]In addition, Kang has a criminal record related to domestic assault on a girlfriend.He was convicted of assaulting a girlfriend on February 10, 2003.He received a suspended sentence (with 12 days pre-sentence custody) and 6 months probation with a condition to attend the PARS (Partner Assault Response) program.In addition, the P.S.R. indicates that Kang had only attended a few classes of the program and was discharged from the program because of the issue with his attendance.However, psychiatric counseling was later substituted as an alternative to the PARS program.The P.S.R. also indicates that Kang had been attending this counselling since March 9, 2006, every two to three weeks, but had missed several appointments with his doctor in the fall of 2006.4.KIHWAN KANG’S DRIVING RECORD[10]Since

FOR REGULATORY OFFENCES IN ONTARIO[11]Penalties that are imposed for committing provincial or regulatory offences in Ontario are primarily in the form of fines.Custodial sentences are rare, but nevertheless are available as a penal sanction.The Provincial Offences Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33 (“P.O.A.”), which governs regulatory, provincial offences or public welfare offences in Ontario provides for a general penalty regime according to the type of the proceeding, where the charging statute does not contain a penalty section.Thus, offences are divided into two regimes under the P.O.A. with corresponding penalty provisions: Part 1 offences and Part III offences (Part II offences refer specifically to parking infractions).A provincial statute in Ontario that contains its own penalty section is not limited by the penalties provided for in the P.O.A., unless the charge is commenced under Part I of the P.O.A., then it is limited to the imposition of a fine only that does not exceed $500.[12]In addition, the P.O.A. provides for other rules for sentencing offenders convicted of regulatory offences in Ontario.Hence, for an offender sentenced at the same time to multiple terms of imprisonment for different offences, the rule under s. 64 of the P.O.A. requires that the offender serve those custodial sentences consecutively unless the court orders those sentences to be served concurrently:64.Where a person is subject to more than one term of imprisonment at the same time, the terms shall be served consecutively except in so far as the court has ordered a term to be served concurrently with any other term of imprisonment.(a)Penalty under the POA for Part I offences[13]Part I offences are for relatively minor regulatory offences and are commenced by a certificate of offence being issued by an enforcement officer, where the only penalty that can be imposed by a court is in the form of a fine up to a maximum of $500 or the maximum fine provided for in the charging statute, whichever is the lesser.Imprisonment or probation is not available as a sanction for a Part I offence.The fines provided for Part I offences are also part of the “set fine” regime that comprises of specific fines that are considered to be out-of-court settlements, in which a defendant can avoid a trial by paying the set fine on the certificate of offence.The penalty regime for Part I offences is set out in s. 12(1) of the P.O.A.:12(1)Where the penalty prescribed for an offence includes a fine of more than $500 or imprisonment and a proceeding is commenced under this Part, the provision for fine or imprisonment does not apply and in lieu thereof the offence is punishable by a fine of not more than the maximum fine prescribed for the offence or $500, whichever is the lesser.(b)Penalty under the POA for Part III offences[14]On the other hand, Part III offences are considered to be more serious regulatory offences that are commenced by an information sworn out by an enforcement officer and have a penalty regime that include higher fines, probation and imprisonment.Imprisonment however can only be imposed if the specific charging statute provides for it as a sanction or penalty upon conviction, since the general penalty section for Part III offences under s. 61 of the P.O.A. does not provide for imprisonment, but only provides for fines up to a maximum of $5,000.However, if the charging statute has its own penalty section then the general penalty section under s. 61 of the P.O.A. does not apply:General penalty61.Except where otherwise expressly provided by law, every person who is convicted of an offence is liable to a fine of not more than $5,000.(c)Other sanctions available under the POA for Part III offences[15]The P.O.A. also provides for probation as a sanction under s. 72 and s. 73 for a term that does not exceed two years, but only for Part III offences:Probation order72(1)Where a defendant is convicted of an offence in a proceeding commenced by information, the court may, having regard to the age, character and background of the defendant, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission,(a)suspend the passing of sentence and direct that the defendant comply with the conditions prescribed in a probation order;(b)in addition to fining the defendant or sentencing the defendant to imprisonment, whether in default of payment of a fine or otherwise, direct that the defendant comply with the conditions prescribed in a probation order; or(c)where it imposes a sentence of imprisonment on the defendant, whether in default of payment of a fine or otherwise, that does not exceed ninety days, order that the sentence be served intermittently at such times as are specified in the order and direct that the defendant, at all times when he or she is not in confinement pursuant to such order, comply with the conditions prescribed in a probation order.Statutory conditions of order72(2)A probation order shall be deemed to contain the conditions that,(a)the defendant not commit the same or any related or similar offence, or any offence under a statute of Canada or Ontario or any other province of Canada that is punishable by imprisonment;(b)the defendant appear before the court as and when required; and(c)the defendant notify the court of any change in the defendant’s address.Conditions imposed by court72(3)In addition to the conditions set out in subsection (2), the court may prescribe as a condition in a probation order,(a)that the defendant satisfy any compensation or restitution that is required or authorized by an Act;(b)with the consent of the defendant and where the conviction is of an offence that is punishable by imprisonment, that the defendant perform a community service as set out in the order;(c)where the conviction is of an offence punishable by imprisonment, such other conditions relating to the circumstances of the offence and of the defendant that contributed to the commission of the offence as the court considers appropriate to prevent similar unlawful conduct or to contribute to the rehabilitation of the defendant; or(d)where considered necessary for the purpose of implementing the conditions of the probation order, that the defendant report to a responsible person designated by the court and, in addition, where the circumstances warrant it, that the defendant be under the supervision of the person to whom he or she is required to report.Form of order72(4)A probation order shall be in the prescribed form and the court shall specify therein the period for which it is to remain in force, which shall not be for more than two years from the date when the order takes effect.…Regulations for community service orders72(6) The Lieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations governing restitution, compensation and community service orders, including their terms and conditions.…When order comes into force73(1)A probation order comes into force,(a)on the date on which the order is made; or(b)where the defendant is sentenced to imprisonment other than a sentence to be served intermittently, upon the expiration of that sentence.Continuation in force73(2)Subject to section 75, where a defendant who is bound by a probation order is convicted of an offence or is imprisoned in default of payment of a fine, the order continues in force except in so far as the sentence or imprisonment renders it impossible for the defendant to comply for the time being with the order.[16]The P.O.A. also provides for performing community service as part of a probation order under s. 72(3)(b), if the defendant consents to such a sanction and the offence is punishable by imprisonment:72(3)In addition to the conditions set out in subsection (2), the court may prescribe as a condition in a probation order,…(b)with the consent of the defendant and where the conviction is of an offence that is punishable by imprisonment, that the defendant perform a community service as set out in the order; …(d)Penalties Under The Highway Traffic Act[17]However, where the charging statute contains its own penalty section, such as the H.T.A., I will not need to rely on the penalty sections of the P.O.A.However, because Kang has been convicted of Part III offences I may imposea period of probation, if appropriate, on Kang and will need, therefore, to rely on the probation provisions contained in ss. 72 and 73 of the P.O.A.[18]Penalties available under the H.T.A. are generally in the category of fines, but imprisonment is nevertheless available to a sentencing court for special offences.The H.T.A. has a general penalty regime set out in s. 214(1) that is restricted to a range of fines of not less than $60 but not more than $500:General penalty214(1)Every person who contravenes this Act or any regulation is guilty of an offence and on conviction, where a penalty for the contravention is not otherwise provided for herein, is liable to a fine of not less than $60 and not more than $500.(i)Special Penalty Section in H.T.A. For The Office Of Driving While Under Suspension[19]A conviction for a driving while under suspension offence under s. 53(1) of the H.T.A. is one of those special offences that is not governed by the general penalty section set out in s. 214(1) of the H.T.A..Section 53(1)(b) provides for a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months, in addition to a minimum fine of $2,000 to a maximum fine of $5000 for a second conviction of driving while under suspension.Therefore, Kang is subject to being sentenced to a period of incarceration, because his present four convictions for driving while under suspension would be his second conviction within five years and would fall within the sanction contained in s. 53(1)(b).According to Kang’s driving record, his last conviction of his three previous convictions for driving while under suspension occurred on July 16, 2004, which is within the five-year period of the present four convictions of driving while under suspension as prescribed under s. 53(2):Driving while driver’s licence suspended53(1)Every person who drives a motor vehicle or street car on a highway while his or her driver’s licence is suspended under an Act of the Legislature or a regulation made thereunder is guilty of an offence and on conviction is liable,(a)for a first offence, to a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000; and(b)for each subsequent offence, to a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more than $5,000, or to imprisonment for a term of not more than six months, or to both.…Subsequent offence53(2)Where a person who has previously been convicted of an offence under subsection (1) is convicted of the same offence within five years after the date of the previous conviction, the offence for which he or she is last convicted shall be deemed to be a subsequent offence for the purpose of clause (1)(b).[20]Section 53(1)(b) demonstrates this offence’s gravity and the provincial legislators’ concern with individuals repeatedly driving motor vehicles while their licences are under suspension by specifically providing for imprisonment as a penal sanction, in contrast to the imposition of fines as the general sanction for traffic offences, and is also an indication that imprisonment would be a suitable penalty for committing the same offence more than once in the last five years.In addition, by specifically providing for a sanction of imprisonment, especially when general penalties under the P.O.A. and the H.T.A. only provide for the imposition of fines, is also indicative that imprisoning an offender on being convicted of driving while under suspension for the second time within a five-year period would not be unusual or inappropriate.(ii)Automatic License Suspension[21]Section 53(3) of the H.T.A. also provides for the offender’s driver license to be automatically suspended for a period of six months upon conviction and that suspension commences to run only after any other suspension already in place is completed:Licence suspended53(3)The driver’s licence of a person who is convicted of an offence under subsection (1) or (1.1) is thereupon suspended for a period of six months in addition to any other period for which the licence is suspended, and consecutively thereto.[22]In Kang’s case, he would therefore automatically receive four six-month licence suspensions to run consecutively for the four drive while under suspension convictions, which means this period of suspension would ultimately last for a period of two years during which he would not be eligible to drive a motor vehicle in Ontario.6.USE OF PRE-SENTENCE REPORT IN THE SENTENCING OF REGULATORY OFFENDERS[23]The use of a pre-sentence report (P.S.R.) is provided for under s. 56(1) of the P.O.A.:Pre-sentence report56(1)Where a defendant is convicted of an offence in a proceeding commenced by information, the court may direct a probation officer to prepare and file with the court a report in writing relating to the defendant for the purpose of assisting the court in imposing sentence.[24]Kang’s counsel did not object to the contents of the P.S.R. that portrayed Kang negatively.Thus, if there is no objection to the negative information within the P.S.R. then a sentencing court may properly take into account negative information about the offender to which no objection was taken, including his drug use, gambling, and lack of remorse, so as to relate the offences to the individual: R. v. Riley, (1996) 1996 CanLII 5615 (NS CA), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 278, 150 N.S.R. (2d) 390, [1996] N.S.J. No. 183 (QL) (N.S.C.A.).[25]The purpose of a pre-sentence report is to supply to the court a picture of the offender as a person in society.A probation officer’s recommendation for community supervision only means that he is not unsuitable for community supervision.The probation officer in developing their recommendation does not take into account deterrence and other sentencing objectives that a sentencing court has to consider in finding a fit and suitable sentence for the offender.The probation officer does not determine the appropriate sentence, but prepares a report to assist the sentencing court assess the offender’s background, maturity, bahaviour, attitude and willingness to make amends and to better able the court to view the offender as a person with individual characteristics.[26]Although Kang’s counsel submits that the probation officer recommended community supervision, counseling and a prohibition against driving as a sanction, I would not interpret the probation officer’s assessment in those terms.Instead, I would take it that the probation officer only concluded that sentencing Kang to community supervision would not be inappropriate, in light of his background and personal circumstances.In addition, a probation officer does not have the mandate to consider factors, which a sentencing court would consider at arriving at a fit sentence, such as general and specific deterrence and denunciation for the offence committed.[27]The function of a P.S.R. is explained in R. v. Bartkow (1978), 24 N.S.R. (2d) 518, at para. 10, where the Nova Scotia Supreme Court concluded that a P.S.R. should be confined to portraying the background, family, education, employment record, physical and mental health, associates, social activities, potential and motivation of the person and that its function is not to tell the court what sentence should be imposed [emphasis is mine below].I wish those who prepare such reports would realize that it is no part of their job to give any information, whether inculpatory or exculpatory, respecting offences which the accused committed, especially ones for which he has not been convicted. Their function is to supply a picture of the accused as a person in society - his background, family, education, employment record, his physical and mental health, his associates and social activities, and his potentialities and motivations. Their function is not to supply evidence of criminal offences or details of a criminal record or to tell the court what sentence should be imposed.7.IMPRISONMENT AS A SANCTION FOR REGULATORY OFFENCES[28]Imprisonment is regarded as the sanction of last resort, but it is still available for use in deterring others from committing similar offences.This sentencing principle of imprisonment as a last resort has been recently codified in the Criminal Code under s. 718.2(d).In addition, Clayton Ruby in his tome entitled, \"Sentencing (2ed)\", at page 284-285 succinctly summarized the function of custodial sentences, which I find is very applicable to the present case [emphasis is mine below]:Nevertheless there are offences and offenders for whom there is no other alternative consistent with the judicial responsibility to protect the public.Thus, when one examines the factors determining the imposition of imprisonment, one should bear in mind that imprisonment acts almost entirely as punishment and contains little if any reformative aspect.There is a general conviction, perceivable over the years and increasing in strength, that custodial sentences ought to be imposed only as a last resort and where all other measures either have failed or cannot reasonably be expected to succeed.In addition, custodial sentences are necessary where the offences itself is so serious that no other measure will adequately express the condemnation which society directs at the crime, or where the element of deterrence to others demands a sentence of imprisonment.[29]In R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc. (1991), 1991 CanLII 39 (SCC), 67 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at para. 218-220, the Supreme Court of Canada considered the rationale for the use of imprisonment as a sanction for regulatory offences and concluded that imprisonment must be available for regulatory schemes to encourage compliance and effective enforcement of regulatory measures [emphasis is mine below]:The ultimate question is whether the imposition of imprisonment on the basis of strict liability comports with the principles of fundamental justice.For the reasons set out earlier concerning the underlying rationale of regulatory offences, I am of the opinion that it does.Regulatory schemes can only be effective if they provide for significant penalties in the event of their breach.Indeed, although it may be rare that imprisonment is sought, it must be available as a sanction if there is to be effective enforcement of the regulatory measure.Nor is the imposition of imprisonment unreasonable in light of the danger that can accrue to the public from breaches of regulatory statutes.The spectre of tragedy evoked by such names as Thalidomide, Bhopal, Chernobyl and the Exxon Valdez can leave no doubt as to the potential human and environmental devastation which can result from the violation of regulatory measures.Strong sanctions including imprisonment are vital to the prevention of similar catastrophes.The potential for serious harm flowing from the breach of regulatory measures is too great for it to be said that imprisonment can never be imposed as a sanction.I would only add that, in those circumstances where the imposition of imprisonment would be grossly disproportionate to the offence committed, the accused person would have a compelling claim under s. 12 of the Charter. However, the fact that it is possible to imagine instances where the use of imprisonment would be inappropriate should not be used to justify the conclusion that imprisonment can never be imposed in respect of strict liability offences. Imprisonment must be available to governments as a sanction if the power to regulate is to be effective.[30]Accordingly, a sentence of imprisonment for an offender contravening a regulatory offence is an appropriate sanction for achieving certain sentencing objectives, especially when there is potential for that offender, based on their history of unlawful conduct, to cause substantial harm to the public.8.LICENSING AND PRIVILEGE TO DRIVE[31]Driving is a privilege; it is not a God-given nor a constitutional right.This principle has been confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Galaske v. O'Donnell, 1994 CanLII 128 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 670, [1994] S.C.J. No. 28 (QL) (S.C.C.) at para. 26:The driving of a motor vehicle is neither a God-given nor a constitutional right.It is a licensed activity that is subject to a number of conditions, including the demonstration of a minimum standard of skill and knowledge pertaining to driving.Obligations and responsibilities flow from the right to drive.[32]Section 31 of the H.T.A. also reaffirms the principle that driving is a privilege:31.The purpose of this Part is to protect the public by ensuring that,(a)the privilege of driving on a highway is granted to, and retained by, only those persons who demonstrate that they are likely to drive safely; and(b)full driving privileges are granted to novice and probationary drivers only after they acquire experience and develop or improve safe driving skills in controlled conditions.[33]I also find that Kang’s behaviour and repeated actions of continuing to drive a motor vehicle, when he was aware that his driver’s licence had been suspended, is nothing less than absolute disregard for the law.It is also an indication that he treats driving as a right and not as a privilege.Therefore, in Kang’s case, the sentencing objectives of specific deterrence and denunciation are foremost considerations in determining a fit sentence.9.POTENTIAL HARM THAT UNLICENSED DRIVERS POSE TO THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC[34]In R. v. Ladouceur, 1990 CanLII 108 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1257, [1990] S.C.J. No. 53 (QL) (S.C.C.) at paras. 43, 46 and 47, the Supreme Court of Canada concluded that proper laws and regulations are necessary to regulate the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on public roads and to prevent or lessen the carnage on highways and that unlicensed and uninsured drivers have a marked propensity for being involved in serious motor vehicle accidents:It shows that between 1980 and 1984, the number of accidents reported in Ontario came within the range of 182,000 to almost 200,000.These accidents resulted in the death of well over 1000 persons, as well as injuries to more than 90,000 others, in each of these years.In 1984 alone, the amount of estimated property damage reached close to $500 million (Ontario Motor Vehicle Accident Facts:1980, 1981, 1982, 1983 [page1280] and 1984).These excerpts highlight the potential for killing, for injury and for material destruction which is associated with the operation of automobiles.It is fitting that governmental action be taken to prevent or at least to lessen this carnage on our highways.Proper laws and regulations are necessary to regulate the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on public thoroughfares.…In addition, significant weight must be given to the statistical evidence that demonstrates a positive correlation between unlicensed driving and an increased risk of serious highway accidents.In 1984, for example, there were 330,000 reported automobile accidents in Ontario, 1500 of which resulted in fatalities.Of the total of 330,000, over 6,000 (roughly 2 percent) involved unlicensed drivers.However, in what I consider a truly astounding figure, of the 1,500 fatal accidents, over 100 (or roughly 7 percent) involved unlicensed drivers.In other words, in accidents involving licensed drivers, the probability of fatalities was 214 to 1, while for unlicensed drivers the same probability was 59 to 1.The same type of comparison for insured and uninsured vehicles involved in fatal accidents yielded results which were almost as marked.To drive without proper insurance increases the chances of involvement in fatal accidents from 212 to 1 to 83 to 1 (Ontario Motor Vehicle Accident Facts:1984).The statistics for 1982 and 1983 reveal a comparable pattern.The only method of ensuring that the brakes and seat belts are operational is by stopping and checking vehicles.Of even greater importance is to determine if a driver is licensed and insured.Once again this can only be done by stopping vehicles.The unlicensed driver is a statistically proven menace on the highways.Moreover, such a driver has demonstrated a contempt for the law and an irresponsible attitude as well as a marked propensity to being involved in serious accidents.All users of the highways have an interest in seeing that unlicensed drivers are apprehended and removed from the highway.As well, society as a whole has an interest in reducing the cost of medical, hospital and rehabilitation services which must be provided to accident victims and in minimizing the emotional damage suffered by the victims' families.Surely the preventive medication of requiring drivers to stop provided by s. 189a(1) is preferable to the incurable terminal tragedy represented by the fatal accident victim and the permanently disabled victim.Surely it must be better to permit the random stop and prevent the accident [page1282] than to deny the right to stop and repeatedly confirm the sad statistics at the morgue and hospital.The majority reasons of United States Supreme Court in Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648 (1979), finding random stops unconstitutional, were specifically rejected in Hufsky. However, the position on this issue was well put by Rehnquist J. (as he then was) in his dissenting reasons, at p. 666:The State's primary interest ... is in traffic safety, not in apprehending unlicensed motorists for the sake of apprehending unlicensed motorists.The whole point of enforcing motor vehicle safety regulations is to remove from the road the unlicensed driver before he demonstrates why he is unlicensed.The [majority of the United States Supreme] Court would apparently prefer that the State check licenses and vehicle registrations as the wreckage is being towed away.10.APPLYING SENTENCING OBJECTIVES AND PRINCIPLES TO THE OFFENDER AND HIS CIRCUMSTANCES[35]To arrive at an appropriate sentence for Kang, I must adhere to Lamer C.J.C.’s guidance in R. v. M.(C.A.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 (S.C.C.) at p. 370, where he wrote that the principal duty of a sentencing judge is to apply the established principles of sentencing in determining a just and appropriate sentence which reflects the gravity of the offence committed and the moral blameworthiness of the offender:the overarching duty of a sentencing judge is to draw upon all the legitimate principles of sentencing to determine a ``just and appropriate'' sentence which reflects the gravity of the offence committed and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.[36]In addition, the Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Cotton Felts Ltd. (1982), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 287, at p. 295, established deterrence as the paramount consideration for deciding a fit sentence for a public welfare or regulatory offence.Hence, as a sentencing objective, deterrence furthers the aim of public welfare legislation to protect the physical, economic and social welfare of the public, which is essential for the proper functioning of society [emphasis is mine below]:deterrence is not to be taken only in its usual negative connotation of achieving compliance by threat of punishment. Recently my brother Zuber in R. v. Ramdass, a judgment pronounced on November 17, 1982 [since reported 2 C.C.C. (3d) 247], referred to deterrence in a more positive aspect. There he was dealing with a driving offence and he quoted an earlier unreported decision of this court in R. v. Roussy, unreported, released December 15, 1977 [summarized 2 W.C.B. 72], where the court stated:But in a crime of this type the deterrent quality of the sentence must be given paramount consideration, and here I am using the term deterrent in its widest sense. A sentence by emphasizing community disapproval of an act, and branding it as reprehensible has a moral or educative effect, and thereby affects the attitude of the public. One then hopes that a person with an attitude thus conditioned to regard conduct as reprehensible will not likely commit such an act.This aspect of deterrence is particularly applicable to public welfare offences where it is essential for the proper functioning of our society for citizens at large to expect that basic rules are established and enforced to protect the physical, economic and social welfare of the public.[37]Furthermore, not only must the sanction used to achieve particular goals of sentencing be just, the sentencing process itself must also enjoy the acceptance and respect of the community at large: R. v. Sweeney (1992), 1992 CanLII 4030 (BC CA), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 82, 11 C.R. (4th) 1 (B.C.C.A.), at p. 96 of 71 C.C.C. (3d) 82:That purpose is achieved if the imposition of legal sanctions discourages both convicted offenders from re-offending and those who have yet to offend from doing so at all. Overlying and influencing the ability of the legal sanction or sentencing process to achieve this purpose, however, is the extent to which that process enjoys the acceptance and respect of the community at large.[38]I must also adhere to the principle of parity, which requires a sentencing court to impose a sentence that is similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.This traditional principle of sentencing has been codified in s. 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code and adopted for regulatory offences in R. v. Kirk (No. 1), [2005] O.J. No. 3316 (QL), 2005 ONCJ 352 (O.C.J.) (CanLII), at para. 16.[39]Therefore, a fit sentence should be proportional to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender: R. v. M(C.A.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 (S.C.C.).(a) Submissions for Kang on penalty[40]Kang’s counsel submits that the P.S.R. is more meaningful for its conclusion and the recommendation by the probation officer that Kang is suitable for community supervision.His counsel also argues that Kang has recognized that his behaviour was inappropriate by pleading guilty.As to his gambling problem, Kang’s counsel submits that Kang needs counseling to address the problem.It is also submitted by Kang’s counsel that a significant amount of community service would assist in his rehabilitation.[41]Kang’s counsel also submits that Kang’s mother has indicated that she will no longer support Kang financially and that Kang’s father had business burned down since December and has also lost the business.[42]Kang’s counsel also argues that Kang getting married is not a factor in his past behaviour.It was also suggested that Kang needs more counselling to address his immaturity and behaviour.[43]Counsel also submits that Kang was not driving his own car, but used his mother’s car when apprehended by the police and charged for the last offence.In addition, Kang’s counsel submits that Kang has lost all his money that he derived from his own business and now has no money and no car.However, Kang does reside by himself in his own apartment, even though not gainfully employed.(b)Submissions by prosecution on penalty[44]On the principle of parity, the prosecution argues that it would not be unusual for someone with seven convictions for driving while under suspension to receive a sentence of imprisonment of four to five months.(c)Deterrence, renunciation, rehabilitation[45]Kang’s guilty plea to all his outstanding charges under the H.T.A. is virtually the only mitigating factor that I could consider in determining a fit sentence.I will treat his admission to the wrongful conduct as a sign of remorse.Ergo, except for his guilty plea to all the charges, Kang’s lengthy driving record over a relative short period and three previous convictions for driving while under suspension would have subjected him to a higher range of penalties, unless he would have been able to otherwise demonstrate that there is the existence of special circumstances or other mitigating factors.[46]As for his personal circumstances, Kang is not gainfully employed nor is there an indication of a legitimate business being operated by Kang that could be harmed by imposing a custodial sentence.His counsel’s submissions indicated that he was trying to set up another website business similar to one that he use to own and operate, but I have no evidence that it is off and running.It is also submitted that he is recently married but that his new wife is still in Korea.Hopefully, this rite of passage and new stage in his life will make Kang more mature and responsible.On the negative side, his background indicates that he is someone who had or is still living a life of privilege and a jet-set lifestyle where his parents who own a factory in Korea support him and paid for his lifestyle.However, his counsel now submits that Kang has lost all his money and that his mother will no longer pay for his lifestyle.[47]Regardless of his father’s apparent misfortune, I agree with the prosecution that for the particular circumstances surrounding the offences that were committed and his driving record and his background, a custodial sentence would not be inappropriate, despite his new outlook on life.[48]The fact that Kang’s lengthy driving record has been compiled over a relatively short period, coupled with his inability to comply with the rules of the road and his flagrant disregard for the law by repeatedly committing the offence of driving while under suspension on four occasions within a five-month period in 2005, makes him fall within that category reserved for the worst offender, where the highest sanctions that could be imposed would not be an unreasonable sentence.His four apprehensions by the police for driving while under suspension were relatively close to each other and showed deliberate and intentional transgressions of Ontario’s traffic laws.He has certainly and repeatedly abused his driving privilege in Ontario.His driving behaviour and unlawful conduct have also put him into that category described by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Ladouceur, 1990 CanLII 108 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1257, [1990] S.C.J. No. 53 (QL), of unlicensed and uninsured drivers, who have a propensity for being involved in very serious motor vehicle accidents.His previous driving record of 16 convictions in less than two years plus the seven convictions in the present case show that he is a serious risk to other drivers using Ontario highways.Therefore, the correct approach to protect the public from drivers such as Kang is to impose strong sanctions that address general and specific deterrence and denunciation.Accordingly, in Kang’s case a period of incarceration would be an appropriate sentence.[49]In light of the objectives of sentencing, a period of incarceration would be the least restrictive sanction that I could impose, considering Kang’s age, character and background that would achieve the relevant sentencing goals of rehabilitation, general and specific deterrence, separation of offenders, denunciation, making reparations and promoting a sense of responsibility in the offender.[50]In addition, a period of probation is also a sanction that can be used to achieve certain sentencing objectives that is specific to Kang and the circumstances surrounding the offences committed.A term of probation would be appropriate to address Kang’s need for rehabilitation and specific deterrence.[51]Therefore, in considering these factors and the need for deterrence, rehabilitation, promoting responsibility in the offender and for denunciation, this case requires a sanction that is more than just probation with conditions of community service, counselling and a prohibition against driving or attending casinos.Imposing a custodial sentence, significant fines and a period of probation would meet the sentencing objectives for this particular offender and the circumstances surrounding the offences committed.[52]In considering the principle of totality and the appropriate length of imprisonment, I have weighed his guilty pleas, the circumstances surrounding the offences and the background of the offender with the relevant sentencing objectives.Therefore, the appropriate sentence for three of the four driving while under suspension convictions will be a custodial sentence.For the driving while under suspension conviction for August 7, 2005, I will not impose a custodial sentence but will instead impose a fine of $2000 with no period of probation.However, for the driving while under suspension conviction for October 5, 2005, I have determined that the appropriate sanction is a custodial sentence of 10 days of imprisonment with a fine of $2500 and with no period of probation.For the driving while under suspension conviction of November 14, 2005, I have also determined that the appropriate sanction is a custodial sentence of 15 days of imprisonment with no fine and with no period of probation.For the driving while under suspension conviction of December 18, 2005, I have also determined that the appropriate sanction is a custodial sentence of 20 days of imprisonment with no fine, but with a period of probation of two years.[53]In considering the principle of totality and whether these three custodial sentences should be served concurrently, I have decided that the circumstances of this particular defendant warrant that these three custodial sentences be served consecutively as required under s. 64 of the P.O.A.In addition, I find that there are no special circumstances or reasons that would warrant that these three custodial sentences be served concurrently.[54]In addition, I am imposing fines totaling $5232 for all seven convictions, of which $4500 is for the four driving while under suspension convictions.I do not find it necessary to impose a prohibition against driving, since he automatically receives a period of suspension of his driving privileges for a period totalling two years under s. 53(3) of the H.T.A. upon conviction for the four driving while under suspension offences.[55]Although community service was suggested by both the prosecution and the defence as a sanction for rehabilitative purposes, I have instead determined that the objectives of specific deterrence for this particular offender and for the particular circumstances of the seven offences and his past driving record required a custodial sentence, a period of probation and significant fines.These sanctions would still send the appropriate message of denunciation and deterrence to others and to Kang about not driving while his driver’s licence is suspended.Incarcerating Kang will also achieve the objective of specifically deterring him from abusing his driving privileges in Ontario.[56]For a different offender, community service might have been the appropriate sanction to achieve these sentencing objectives.Furthermore, since Kang will be serving a custodial sentence, which is already the most severe penalty I could impose on Kang, imposing additional hours of community service would be excessive and against the principle of totality.Moreover, community service would be more appropriate for someone unlike Kang, where incarceration would severely disrupt family relations or employment or be harmful to the offender’s health or who had less of a driving record.[57]In addition, ordering him to attend counseling and to not attend casinos is not appropriate in this case, as his original counselling with his doctor was part of his domestic assault conviction charge and his attendance at casinos have little bearing on or contributed to his offences of driving while under suspension.11.DISPOSITION[58]Therefore, after considering the relevant factors, the circumstances of the offender, the fit and proper sentences for Kang, who is guilty of committing seven offences under the Highway Traffic Act are the following:(i) Speeding 86 k.p.h. in a 50 k.p.h. zone on August 7, 2005Upon conviction for this speeding offence of August 7, 2005, I am directed under s. 128(14)(c) of the H.T.A. to impose a fine of $252.The offender has 6 months to pay this fine.(ii) Driving while under suspension on August 7, 2005For this conviction of driving while under suspension of August 7, 2005, I sentence Kihwan Kang to pay a fine of $2000 with 12 months to pay this fine.(iii) Speeding 140 k.p.h. in a 100 k.p.h. zone on October 5, 2005Upon conviction for this speeding offence of October 5, 2005, I am directed under s. 128(14)(c) of the H.T.A. to impose a fine of $280.The offender has 6 months to pay this fine.(iv) Driving while under suspension on October 5, 2005For this conviction of driving while under suspension of October 5, 2005, I sentence Kihwan Kang to serve a period of imprisonment for 10 days to be served consecutively and to pay a fine of $2500 with 12 months to pay this fine.(v) Driving while under suspension on November 14, 2005 (Niagara)For this conviction of driving while under suspension of November 14, 2005, I sentence Kihwan Kang to serve a period of imprisonment for 15 days to be served consecutively.(vi) Failing to stop for a red light on December 18, 2005For this failing to stop for a red light conviction, I sentence Kihwan Kang to a fine of $200 with 6 months to pay the fine.(vii) Driving while under suspension on December 18, 2005For this conviction of driving while under suspension of December 18, 2005, I sentence Kihwan Kang to serve a period of imprisonment for 20 days to be served consecutively and upon completion a term of probation for two years with conditions.CONDITIONS OF PROBATION[59]I impose the following conditions in Kihwan Kang’s probation order, which I consider reasonable, appropriate and adequate to meet any concerns about Kihwan Kang committing similar offences under the Highway Traffic Act.Also, these conditions would adequately protect the public and assist in his rehabilitation:(a)The probation order will commence on the day following the completion of the custodial sentences.It will be for a period of two years with the following conditions:(1)The Offender shall not commit the same offence or any related or similar offence, or any offence under a statute of Canada or Ontario or any other province of Canada that is punishable by imprisonment.(2)The Offender shall appear before the court as and when required.(3)The Offender shall notify the court of any change in the Offender’s address.Dated at the City of Toronto on August 13, 2007.____________________________QUONJ.P.Ontario Court of Justice"}

Cornell of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without a jury, on June 12, 2013 and the sentence imposed by Justice Cornell on October 4, 2013.Cronk J.A.:[1]On October 6, 2011, after a police investigation into suspected drug trafficking in the City of Sudbury, the appellant Jahvar Marshall and two other individuals – Raymond Khan and Catherine Gagan – were arrested and jointly charged with possession of a loaded prohibited firearm.At the time, all three individuals were enmeshed in the world of drugs.[2]Police surveillance established that the appellant and Khan, Gagan and others were at Gagan’s Sudbury apartment on October 6, 2011.Information provided by a confidential informant and police surveillance at the apartment suggested that the apartment was the site of ongoing drug deals.The appellant and Khan were both arrested during the course of the afternoon and early evening.At approximately 8:00 p.m., the police executed a search warrant for the apartment and discovered the gun in a black Lacoste bag in a closet near the back door of the apartment.Gagan and another individual, who were in the apartment, were then arrested.[3]Photographs of Khan holding the gun were found on Khan’s cell phone following his arrest.However, Khan claimed that the gun belonged to the appellant.He said that, before his arrest, the appellant had given him the gun while they were at a shopping mall together.Khan took photographs of himself, holding the gun, with his cell phone.Khan said that he did so because it was “cool”.Khan maintained that, after the photographs were taken, he returned the gun to the appellant and never saw it again.[4]Gagan also disavowed any knowledge or possession of the gun.[5]Following negotiations with the Crown, Khan pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of possessing a prohibited weapon on October 6, 2011, in the City of Sudbury, while he was prohibited from doing so.This was the same day that the appellant was alleged to have possessed the same gun.Khan received a sentence of 90 days’ in jail – a significantly lower sentence than that faced by him on the original charge of possession of a loaded prohibited firearm.[6]No DNA or fingerprint evidence connected the appellant to the gun.The Crown’s case against the appellant rested primarily on the evidence of Khan and Gagan, both of whom testified for the Crown.Their evidence linked the appellant to possession of the black Lacoste bag on October 6, 2011 and on prior occasions, and to possession of the gun.[7]The appellant testified.He acknowledged ownership of the black Lacoste bag but denied any knowledge of the gun.The trial judge rejected his evidence and accepted the Crown’s evidence as credible and reliable.[8]The trial judge convicted the appellant of possession of a loaded prohibited firearm and sentenced him to three and one-half years’ imprisonment, less credit for 18 months’ pre-sentence custody.On the same day, the appellant was also sentenced to one year in jail for an unrelated conviction for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking, consecutive to his sentence on the firearm offence, and to 60 days’ imprisonment for two counts of breach of his recognizance of bail, concurrent to the other sentences imposed.In total, the appellant received a sentence of 36 months in jail, after 18 months’ credit for pre-sentence custody.A DNA and various other ancillary orders were also made.[9]The appellant appeals from his conviction and sentence on his firearm conviction.A.Conviction Appeal[10]The appellant raises three grounds of appeal in support of his conviction appeal.(1)Credibility Assessments – Crown Witnesses[11]The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in his assessment of Gagan’s credibility by failing to apply a proper Vetrovec caution to her testimony: Vetrovec v. The Queen, 1982 CanLII 20 (SCC), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811.In particular, the trial judge erred by failing to appreciate that Gagan, like Khan, had a motive to lie because she was also charged with possession of a loaded prohibited firearm.Gagan, therefore, had an incentive to distance herself from any knowledge of the gun, in order to gain advantage in respect of her own outstanding charge.[12]I would reject this ground of appeal.[13]The trial judge recognized that Khan had a “significant incentive to assist the Crown in return for a substantially reduced sentence.”He made no mention of such an incentive on Gagan’s part.[14]However, the trial judge was aware that the charge against Gagan remained outstanding at the time of the appellant’s trial.Further, in contrast to Khan, there was no evidence of any plea arrangements between Gagan and the Crown or of any prospect for more lenient treatment of her by the Crown if she agreed to testify for the Crown at the appellant’s trial.The trial judge was also alert to Gagan’s limited prior criminal record.[15]The trial judge’s reasons confirm that he appreciated that Vetrovec considerations applied to both Khan and Gagan’s evidence.He stated that: “[w]hen considering the evidence of Khan and Gagan, I am mindful of the concerns that were expressed in R. v. Vetrovec.”[16]The trial judge was not obliged to expressly advert to all the reasons warranting a cautious evaluative approach to Gagan’s credibility.There is no requirement in a judge-alone trial, like this one, that the trial judge address Vetrovec concerns in the same manner as he or she would in instructing a jury.A Vetrovec caution is intended to alert a jury to the dangers of relying on the evidence of ‘unsavoury’ witnesses.Trial judges are well aware of these dangers.[17]In this case, the trial judge expressly instructed himself to assess Gagan’s evidence in accordance with Vetrovec principles.In light of this explicit caution, I see no reason to conclude that, in assessing Gagan’s credibility, the trial judge then lost sight of Gagan’s potential self-interest or other possible frailties in her evidence.[18]The trial judge found that Gagan’s evidence was credible and reliable, for reasons that are supported by the evidentiary record.His credibility-based findings regarding her testimony attract considerable deference from this court.I see no basis for appellate interference with them.[19]The appellant also maintains that the trial judge erred by finding that aspects of Khan and Gagan’s evidence were confirmatory.[20]I disagree.[21]The trial judge made no finding that Khan and Gagan’s evidence was entirely confirmatory.Instead, he found that:The evidence of Khan and Gagan with respect to collateral issues such as the presence of other individuals and the chronology of events was largely consistent.In all important aspects, the evidence offered by Gagan and Khan tended to confirm and support the evidence offered by the other.[Emphasis added.][22]These findings were open to the trial judge on the evidentiary record.Gagan testified that the appellant had expressed concerns, as a drug dealer, about his personal safety and need for protection.Khan also said that the appellant was concerned about his safety.This evidence was not peripheral.It bore directly on the appellant’s motive for acquiring a gun and bringing it into Gagan’s home, a location from which he admittedly sold drugs on the day in question and on prior occasions.On the evidence, it was also a venue from which various third parties came and went with apparent ease.[23]Khan and Gagan also testified about the appellant’s connection to the Lacoste bag where the gun was discovered.Khan claimed that the appellant was carrying the bag on October 6, 2011 and that he had seen the appellant use the bag on many earlier occasions.Gagan testified to similar effect.She said that the appellant had the Lacoste bag with him when he attended at her apartment on October 6, 2011 and that he “always” carried it with him.[24]This evidence was probative of the identity of the owner of the Lacoste bag and whether the appellant was in possession of it on the day in question.It also undercut the appellant’s claim at trial that, although he had the bag with him at Gagan’s apartment on October 6, 2011, he had simply left it there, for no apparent reason and without any settled intention of returning to Gagan’s apartment to retrieve it, when he and his girlfriend left the apartment for lunch.[25]The appellant maintains that there were two significant discrepancies between Khan and Gagan’s evidence.First, he submits that, based on Gagan’s description of the timing of her discussion with the appellant about his self-protection concerns, the appellant had the gun for less than one month prior to his arrest.Khan, however, suggested that the appellant had the gun for at least several months.[26]It was open to the trial judge to attach little weight to this discrepancy.Neither witness purported to know when the appellant had acquired a gun.Khan was uncertain of the exact time when the appellant showed him the gun.Gagan testified merely to her own belief that the appellant had not yet acquired a gun when they discussed his personal safety concerns.Further, the appellant did not tell her whether he had actually purchased a gun.[27]The second alleged discrepancy stressed by the appellant concerns Khan and Gagan’s differing versions of when and how frequently they had met prior to the day of their arrests.Nothing material turns on this issue.Any inconsistency between Khan and Gagan’s testimony on this issue did not detract from their evidence that the appellant was selling drugs from Gagan’s apartment, that he owned the Lacoste bag, and that he was concerned for his safety.(2)Alleged Misapprehension of Evidence[28]The appellant’s second ground of appeal concerns the trial judge’s treatment of the evidence of Khan’s plea of guilty to the charge of possession of a prohibited weapon on October 6, 2011, in the City of Sudbury, while he was prohibited from doing so.The appellant submits that the trial judge misapprehended this evidence by failing to appreciate that Khan’s plea to this offence constituted a prior inconsistent statement.It was, the appellant says, an admission by Khan that he was in possession of the gun on October 6, 2011, the same day that the appellant was found to be in possession of the same gun, in contrast to Khan’s denial at the appellant’s trial of possession of the gun on that day.[29]Again, I disagree.[30]In pleading to the lesser charge of possession of a prohibited weapon while he was prohibited from doing so, Khan admitted the essential elements of that offence, as particularized by the Crown.These particulars included the date and place of possession of the prohibited weapon – October 6, 2011, in the City of Sudbury.[31]However, no transcript of Khan’s plea proceeding or any details of the statement of facts on which Khan entered his plea were tendered as evidence at the appellant’s trial.Nor was Khan cross-examined on the details of what transpired at his plea proceeding.Instead, he was asked only whether he had pleaded guilty to the charge in question, as framed in the indictment against him.He replied in the affirmative.No cross-examination of Khan took place regarding whether he understood the significance of the date on his indictment, whether he accepted that the offence to which he was pleading took place on October 6, 2011, or as to any of the events at the plea proceeding.[32]This gap in the evidence is critical to this ground of appeal.The issue at the appellant’s trial in relation to Khan’s prior plea was whether that plea had any significance to the assessment of Khan’s credibility in light of his denial, at the appellant’s trial, of possession of the handgun found in the Lacoste bag.In the absence of the transcript of Khan’s plea proceeding and any cross-examination of him concerning that proceeding, the significance of his prior plea was left entirely undeveloped.In that undeveloped state, the fact of the plea was uninformative regarding Khan’s credibility.[33]There are many reasons why an accused may elect to plead guilty to a pending charge.On the evidentiary record before the trial judge, Khan’s reasons for doing so are unknown.Moreover, the transcript of Khan’s plea proceeding or further cross-examination of him regarding the events at his plea proceeding may have provided an explanation for the date of his admitted possession of the gun.They may also have disclosed an amendment to the particulars set out in the indictment against Khan.The record before the trial judge, however, was entirely silent on these issues.So is the record on appeal.[34]It was incumbent on the appellant, as the person seeking to rely on an asserted prior inconsistent statement by Khan, to establish that the statement in question was, in fact, a prior inconsistent statement.In the circumstances here, the appellant failed to do so.[35]The trial judge was aware of Khan’s guilty plea.On the state of the record before him, I can find no fault in his failure to treat Khan’s guilty plea as a prior inconsistent statement capable of detracting from Khan’s credibility.In the absence of further evidence on the issue, the trial judge was entitled to conclude that Khan’s guilty plea related to his possession of the gun at the time of his cell phone photographs, and not possession of the gun at Gagan’s apartment on October 6, 2011.[36]In my opinion, this ground of appeal fails.(3)Alleged Uneven Level of Scrutiny[37]Finally, the appellant submitted in his factum that the trial judge erred by applying a harsher level of scrutiny to the appellant’s evidence than that applied to the Crown’s witnesses.[38]The appellant did not press this submission in oral argument at the appeal hearing.In my view, this was prudent.While it is an error to subject defence evidence at a criminal trial to a stricter standard of scrutiny than that applied to the prosecution’s evidence, this court has repeatedly emphasized that it is difficult to make this argument successfully.For example, in R. v. Howe (2005), 2005 CanLII 253 (ON CA), 192 C.C.C. (3d) 480 (Ont. C.A.), Doherty J.A. explained, at para. 59:It is not enough to show that a different trial judge could have reached a different credibility assessment, or that the trial judge failed to say something that he could have in assessing the respective credibility of the [Crown’s witnesses] and the accused, or that he failed to expressly set out legal principles relevant to that credibility assessment.To succeed in this kind of argument, the appellant must point to something in the reasons of the trial judge or perhaps elsewhere in the record that make it clear that the trial judge had applied different standards in assessing the evidence of the appellant and the [Crown’s witnesses].[39]More recently, this court observed in R. v. Aird, 2013 ONCA 447 (CanLII), 307 O.A.C. 183, at para. 39:The “different standards of scrutiny” argument is a difficult argument to succeed on in an appellate court.It is difficult for two related reasons: credibility findings are the province of the trial judge and attract a very high degree of deference on appeal; and appellate courts invariably view this argument with skepticism, seeing it as a veiled invitation to reassess the trial judge’s credibility determinations.[40]In this case, the trial judge’s reasons reveal that he reviewed the core aspects of the appellant’s account of events, as well as the manner in which he testified and the import of the discrepancies, inconsistencies and contradictions that emerged in his testimony, in the context of the evidence as a whole.He noted the appellant’s attempts to minimize his culpability and his failure to testify in a forthright manner.The trial judge concluded that, in several instances, the appellant appeared to have been untruthful in his evidence.He provided cogent reasons for rejecting the appellant’s evidence and accepting that of the Crown’s witnesses.[41]The trial judge’s credibility assessments were squarely within his domain.As I have said, his credibility findings attract considerable deference from this court.I see no basis upon which to conclude that his evaluation of the appellant’s evidence was less than even-handed or disproportionately rigorous.(4)Disposition of Conviction Appeal[42]For the reasons given, I would dismiss the conviction appeal.B.Sentence Appeal(1)Fitness of Sentence[43]At the time of sentencing, the Supreme Court’s decision in R. v. Nur, 2015 SCC 15 (CanLII), 385 D.L.R. (4th) 1 had not been released.In Nur, the Supreme Court struck down, as unconstitutional, the three-year mandatory minimum sentence for the offence of possession of a loaded restricted firearm, as provided for in s. 95 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.There is no dispute that, in light of Nur, this court is entitled to review the three and one-half years’ sentence of imprisonment imposed on the appellant.[44]The appellant submits that, absent a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, a sentence of three and one-half years in jail is demonstrably unfit in this case.He contends that given his youth at the time of sentencing (23 years old), his lack of a criminal record, his candour at trial in acknowledging his involvement in the drug trade, and his positive rehabilitative prospects, a sentence of between two and one-half to three years in jail is appropriate.[45]The appellant further submits that a sentence in the range he proposes would meet the sentencing goals of deterrence and denunciation, while giving proper effect to the parity principle and the considerations held by this court to govern the sentencing of a youthful first offender: see R. v. Borde (2003), 2003 CanLII 4187 (ON CA), 63 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.).[46]I would not accept these submissions.[47]In R. v. Nur, 2013 ONCA 677 (CanLII), 117 O.R. (3d) 401, at para. 206, this court held that, the s. 95 statutory mandatory minimum aside, offenders who engage in s. 95 offences at the “true crime end of the s. 95 spectrum of offences” should continue to receive exemplary sentences that emphasize deterrence and denunciation.Nur provides, at para. 206, that: “[i]ndividuals who have loaded, restricted or prohibited firearms that they have no business possessing anywhere or at any time, and who are engaged in criminal conduct or conduct that poses a danger to others” will still attract such sentences, regardless of the constitutionality of the three-year minimum penalty.[48]The appellant falls within this category of offenders.By the appellant’s own admission, he was present in Sudbury at Gagan’s apartment on October 6, 2011 for the express purpose of trafficking in drugs.He sold at least 15 grams of cocaine that day.He was in possession of a prohibited loaded handgun at a location where drug deals were occurring, several individuals were present in addition to Khan and Gagan, and the potential for violence was high.On the trial judge’s findings, the appellant then left the loaded handgun in his Lacoste bag at Gagan’s apartment, while he and his girlfriend went out for lunch.[49]There can be no doubt that this type of crime, in the circumstances described above, is an offence at the “true crime” end of the s. 95 spectrum of offences described by this court in Nur.Denunciation, deterrence and protection of the public are unquestionably the paramount principles of sentencing implicated for such a crime.[50]Additional aggravating factors are also in play.The appellant’s pre-sentence report indicates that he “seems to minimize and rationalize” his weapons offence and that he sees no “need to make changes in his life nor is he open to counselling”.Further, while on bail for the predicate offence, he was arrested for and eventually pleaded guilty to one count of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking (60 grams of cocaine having a street value of approximately $5,000 to $6,000), and two counts of breach of his recognizance of bail.It was for these additional offences that the appellant was also sentenced at his sentencing hearing on his firearm conviction.[51]I agree with the Crown’s submission that the appellant’s commission of a serious drug-related offence while on bail for his weapons offence, coupled with his negative pre-sentence report, strongly undercut any claim that the sentence imposed will “crush” the appellant’s prospects for rehabilitation.[52]Nor, in my view, does the sentence imposed offend the Borde first offender sentencing principle or parity considerations.[53]The trial judge considered the appellant’s youthfulness.While the sentence imposed would be the appellant’s first penitentiary sentence, his crime was serious and committed in the course of his commission of other admitted drug-related crimes.Although the courts should impose the shortest possible sentence in cases involving a youthful first time offender, the sentence must be consistent with the relevant sentencing principles, including proportionality to the gravity of the offence.As I have already said, the appellant’s offence was on the true crime end of the s. 95 spectrum.A sentence of three and one-half years is fit in the circumstances.[54]Further, any comparison to Khan’s sentence following his guilty plea for possession of a prohibited weapon is inapt.Khan was convicted of a different offence and testified for the Crown at the appellant’s trial.Importantly, as before the trial judge, the full factors taken into account on Khan’s sentencing are unknown on the record before this court.And, as the Crown emphasizes, disparate sentences, even for the same offence, do not violate the parity principle so long as they are justified in all the circumstances.[55]I note that in Nur, both this court and the Supreme Court upheld a sentence of 40 months in prison for a 19-year old first offender who had pleaded guilty at trial and was found to have had good rehabilitative prospects.[56]Finally, the sentence imposed is well within the range of sentences upheld by this court for weapons offences committed in association with drug crimes.The statutory mandatory minimum sentence aside, I regard the appellant’s three and one-half year sentence of imprisonment for his firearm conviction as entirely fit.(2)Disposition of Sentence Appeal[57]Accordingly, for the reasons given, I would grant leave to appeal sentence and dismiss the sentence appeal.Released:“EAC”“E.A.

A sentence of 5 years consecutive to the sentence that was imposed on July 4, 2000 is substituted for the concurrent sentence of 3 1/2 years imposed by the sentencing judge.LARLEE, J.A.[1]This is a sentence appeal. On February 18, 1998, the Respondent, J.F., committed an aggravated assault on L.F.. He pleaded guilty to this offence and the trial judge sentenced him to three and one half years concurrent to another sentence he had received for an aggravated sexual assault.[2]The Crown appeals the sentence and submits that the trial judge committed several errors entitling this Court to intervene. It submits that the sentence imposed should not be concurrent to the other sentence because there is no nexus between the two crimes. Secondly that although the offender is an aboriginal and s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 should be considered, the seriousness of the crime merits an increased sentence. And finally it submits that the sentence imposed in the circumstances is demonstrably unfit. At the hearing we granted leave to appeal, allowed the appeal and substituted a sentence of 5 years to be served consecutively for the three and one half-year concurrent sentence that the trial judge imposed.These are the reasons in support of that decision.[3]On February 18, 1998, the Respondent, J.F. and the victim L.F., two friends both of whom are aboriginal, were drinking together and as a result were heavily intoxicated. While traveling with others, their vehicle got stuck in the mud in a wooded area. BothJ.F. and the victim decided to leave on foot to get help. While walking on the roadway J.F., without provocation, spontaneously attacked L.F. with a knife. The victim is significantly bigger than J.F. and can defend himself in normal circumstances, but in this case, he was unable to do so because he was taken totally by surprise by the attack. J.F. stabbed L.F. in the facial area causing multiple injuries the most serious of which was to the inner portion of the left eye.After the attack, and while bleeding profusely, L.F. was able to go to a third party's residence to seek help. He knocked on the door and then collapsed on the floor. Dr. LaPierre, who was the physician on-call at the Moncton City Hospital, described L.F.' injuries as follows:He suffered multiple facial lacerations including lacerations to his left upper lid, his ocular globe as well as his left cheek area. He was found to have a full thickness corneal and sclera laceration extending from the 10'[sic] clock median down approximately 22 mm into the sclera (the eye itself).[4]A retina specialist performed two major surgeries because of the retinal damage. At the time of the sentence, more than two years after the attack, his prognosis had not yet been determined and he could require further surgery. L.F. lost 60-70% of his eyesight in the left eye without chance of further improvement with the prognosis of possible complete loss of eyesight in the eye.[5]The other offence for which J.F. was sentenced, which is relevant to this appeal, is one that occurred after the assault on L.F. but before he was sentenced for it.On July 4, 2000, J.F. was sentenced to a period of incarceration of two years for an aggravated sexual assault he committed on his common law spouse. That offence occurred on June 10, 2000 when J.F. whipped his spouse repeatedly with a belt compelling her against her will to perform fellatio on him. Also on July 4, 2000, J.F. was further sentenced to two months in jail to be served concurrently for having breached his undertaking to the Court to keep the peace and be of good behavior.[6]Then on December 4, 2000, the Respondent pleaded guilty to the offence under appeal and the sentencing judge imposed on him a period of incarceration of three and a half years. The Court ordered that the sentence be served concurrently to any time he was serving.[7]Intervention by this Court is justified in this case because the sentencing judge erred in imposing a concurrent sentence when there was no temporal nexus between the two offences that J.F. committed. He committed two separate offences against two entirely different victims and the events occurred two years apart. The fact that there was no nexus between the two offences has a bearing on the question of the totality of the sentence. It is not appropriate to impose a concurrent sentence under these circumstances. (See R. v. Johnson (D.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 4835 (NB CA), 182 N.B.R. (2d) 373 (C.A.) and R.P. Nadin-Davis, Sentencing in Canada (Toronto: Carswell, 1982) at 396.)[8]In arriving at the sentence that he imposed the sentencing judge did take into consideration s. 718.2(e) of the Code and the case of R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688. However he went on to say that R. v. Wells, 2000 SCC 10 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 207 was of no assistance because s. 742 had no application in this case. I am of the opinion that the cases of Gladue and Wells have to be considered together when sentencing aboriginal people who have committed crimes of this nature. They are pertinent in this case not only because the offender is an aboriginal, but also because they comment on aboriginal offenders who have committed serious offences.[9]In R. v. Gladue, Cory and Iacobucci JJ. pointed out in paragraph 13 of a summary of the decision at para. 93:It is unreasonable to assume that aboriginal peoples do not believe in the importance of traditional sentencing goals such as deterrence, denunciation, and separation, where warranted. In this context, generally, the more serious and violent the crime, the more likely it will be as a practical matter that the terms of imprisonment will be the same for similar offences and offenders, whether the offender is aboriginal or non-aboriginal.[10]In R. v. Wells, supra, Iacobucci J. further clarifies that which was said in Gladue at para. 40:However, the scope of s. 718.2(e), as it applies to all offenders, restricts the adoption of alternatives to incarceration to those sanctions that are \"reasonable in the circumstances\".Again, as was expressly stated in Gladue, the Court in no way intended to suggest that as a general rule, the greatest weight is to be given to principles of restorative justice, and less weight accorded to goals such as denunciation and deterrence.Indeed, such a general rule would contradict the individual or case-by-case nature of the sentencing process, which proceeds on the basis of inquiring whether, given the particular facts of the offence, the offender, the victim and the community, the sentence is fit in the circumstances.[11]In R. v. Pangman, 2001 MBCA 64 (CanLII) and [2001] M.J. No. 217 (C.A.), online: QL (MJ), Justice Steel reiterates that for serious offences aboriginal offenders will be treated like other offenders:[para. 43] While no categories of offences are exempt from consideration, courts have recognized that, depending on the circumstances, sentences for serious offences may well not be ameliorated by the principles arising from R. v. Gladue. There are some serious offences and some offenders for which and for whom separation, denunciation and deterrence are fundamentally relevant (R. v. Gladue at para. 78).This point is also made in R. v. Sackanay(2000), 2000 CanLII 1840 (ON CA), 47 O.R. (3d) 612 (C.A.) at para. 11:Admittedly, both Gladue and the later Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. Wells, [[2000] 1 S.C.R. 207, 2000 SCC 10 (CanLII)] acknowledge that sentences should not be automatically reduced for aboriginal offenders, and that for more serious and violent offences sentences are likely to be similar whether the offender is aboriginal or not.[12]As Justice Iacobucci points out in Wells the sentencing process is based on an individual or case by case approach. The nature of the offence, and the circumstances of the offender, the victim and the community must be balanced. The application of s. 718.2(e) is one factor to be taken into consideration in this global consideration of the principles of sentencing.[13]The crime for which J.F. was sentenced was a violent unprovoked stabbing on a friend who was unable to defend himself. In his victim impact statement, L.F. stated that at first he wanted to seek revenge for the attack, but then decided to leave it to the justice system to deal with him.[14]The Respondent is 23 years of age. He is the father of three children and has the support of a common-law wife. According to the sentencing judge he is enrolled in programs in prison to help him deal with his alcohol dependency and propensity for violence. He is following upgrading courses and courses on skills apprenticeship and carpentry work. Tempered with that the offender in this case has a youth record. I set it out here for reference:Date of OffencePlace ofDate ofChargeSentenceOffenceSentenceYouth countRichibuctoJuly 29, 1991264.1(1)(a)Probation 1 yearCCCYouth courtRichibuctoMarch 2,86(1)(a)I month secure custody each charge consecutive1994CCC x 2and probation two years and prohibited firearmsand 87 CCCammunitionorexpl. substances for five years.September 10,March 22,430 CCCConditional Discharge - 919981999monthsJuly 12, 1999July 13, 1999733.1 CCCFine $0.00; Surcharge $35.00; Probation - 5months (super.); Suspended SentenceMay 07, 2000Big Cove, NBJuly 04, 2000266(a) CCCJail - 9 months concurrent to any othersentence presently being servedMay 07, 2000Big Cove, NBJuly 04, 2000145(3)(a)CCCJail - 2 months concurrent to any othersentence presently being servedJune 10, 2000Big Cove, NBJuly 04, 2000272 CCCJail - 2 years145(3)(a)Jail - 2 months concurrent to any otherCCCsentence presently being served[15]This record can be used to show a violent course of conduct and the propensity J.F. has for violence. It also can be considered with respect to the possibility of his rehabilitation.[16]Because of the viciousness of the attack and the propensity of J.F. to commit violent acts, I am of the view that he must be treated as other offenders for this same type of crime. Compared to sentences other offenders have received for serious crimes, most notably aggravated assault, the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge here was demonstrably unfit. The goals of denunciation and deterrence cannot be sacrificed to the principle of restorative justice. This offender must be separated from society for a long period of time. Section 718.2 of the Code insists that a Court that imposes a sentence shall take into account the principle that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offences committed in similar circumstances. For that purpose reference can be made to a number of recent decisions of this Court. See R. v. Gallant (S.F.) (1992), 1992 CanLII 4079 (NB CA), 126 N.B.R. (2d) 421 (N.B.C.A.), R. v. Wu (M.F.) (1994), 1994 CanLII 6468 (NB CA), 145 N.B.R. (2d) 107 (N.B.C.A.), R. v. Canney (R.H.) (1995), 1995 CanLII 6994 (NB CA), 163 N.B.R. (2d) 161 (N.B.C.A.), and R. v. Joyce (K.R.) (1998), 1998 CanLII 12216 (NB CA), 203 N.B.R. (2d) 1 (N.B.C.A.).[17]The trial judge considered three decisions of this Court R. v. Nash-Levy (B.M.) (1998), 1998 CanLII 12230 (NB CA), 207 N.B.R. (2d) 45, R. v. Zinck (T.R.) (1999), 209 N.B.R. (2d) 257 and R. v. Cormier (D.) (1999), 1999 CanLII 13118 (NB CA), 209 N.B.R. (2d) 289 that deal with the imposition of the half-time eligibility parole rule pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code. At para. 16 Cormier sets out the factors to be considered before a judge orders that the portion of the sentence that must be served before an offender may be released on full parole is on half of the sentence:[...] What is required is for the Crown prosecutor to persuade the sentencing judge that the criteria set out in the section have been satisfied by the facts of the case. Parliament has set out the criteria for delay of parole in the section.These criteria are the denunciation by society of the offences or that it is necessary in order to achieve an objective of general or specific deterrence.Factors which must be taken into account, once the sentencing judge determines that any of these criteria are met, include the circumstances of the commission of the offence, and the character and circumstances of the accused, which may include, pursuant to s. 743.6(2) of the Code, a consideration of the offender's prospects for rehabilitation.These are the factors, which according to the section, are to be taken into account; it is not for sentencing judges to improvise except in the most unusual circumstances.[18]In this case the sentencing judge was persuaded because of the possibility of the rehabilitation of the Respondent not to invoke the section. He obviously reasoned in this case that the application of the section was not necessary to achieve the objective of general and specific deterrence. In so doing he made no error.[19]For these reasons leave is granted to appeal sentence and the appeal is allowed. A sentence of 5 years consecutive to the sentence that was imposed on July 4, 2000 is substituted for the concurrent sentence of 3 1/2 years imposed by the sentencing judge._____________________________MARGARET E.L.

J.(SENTENCE)INTRODUCTION:[1]On March 1, 2015, Mr. White pushed his spouse.The police were contacted.They spoke to Mrs. White.Mrs. White told the police that she did not want a charge laid. The police told Mrs. White they had a “zero tolerance” policy and Mr. White was charged with the offence of assault, contrary to section 266 of the Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985.[2]The Crown proceeded with the charge and Mr. White pleaded guilty to the offence.The Crown proceeded by way of summary conviction.[3]At the sentence hearing, Crown counsel indicated that Mrs. White had been in contact with the Crown’s office and had requested that the charge against her husband be withdrawn.Ms. Dwyer indicated that Mrs. White had indicated that she has been married to Mr. White for twenty-nine years and this was the first time such an incident had occurred.Ms. Dwyer also indicated that Mrs. White told the Crown’s office that she wished to have contact with her husband.[4]The Crown recommended that a conditional discharge with twelve months of probation be imposed. I accepted this recommendation and imposed the sentence requested. These are my reasons for having done so.THE PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[5]In R. v. Knott, 2012 SCC 42 (CanLII), it was held that \"the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code are meant to take into account the correctional imperative of sentence individualization.\"[6]Section 718 of the Criminal Code states that the fundamental purpose of sentencing \"is to contribute...to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society.\"This is to be achieved by imposing sentences which have, among other objectives, the objectives of:-separating offenders from society, where necessary;-denouncing unlawful conduct;-general deterrence;-rehabilitation; and-the promoting of a \"sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and the community.\"[7]Section 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code states that \"a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.\"[8]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code states that any sentence imposed must be \"proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\"In R. v. Cluney, 2013 NLCA 46 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal, at paragraph 16, indicated that the “principle of proportionality applies to sentencing for all criminal offences…The appropriate range of sentence is related to the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.”[9]Section 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code indicates that a \"sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender.\"In R. v. Briand, 2010 NLCA 67 (CanLII), [2010] N.J. No. 339 (C.A.), the Court of Appeal stressed the importance of considering an offender's personal circumstances in applying section 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code.[10]Section 718.2(d) states that \"an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances\" and section 718.2(e) states that \"all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.\"[11]In R. v. Berner, 2013 BCCA 188 (CanLII), the British Columbia Court of Appeal noted that broadly “speaking, a sentencing judge looks to the conduct and culpability of the offender and punishes the offender for that conduct through the application of the principles and objectives of deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation and proportionality.”THE CRIMINAL CODE’S DISCHARGE PROVISION[12]The Court's authority to grant an offender a discharge is found in section 730(1) of the Criminal Code.It states as follows:Where an accused, other than an organization, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence, other than an offence for which a minimum punishment is prescribed by law or an offence punishable by imprisonment for fourteen years or for life, the court before which the accused appears may, if it considers it to be in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of convicting the accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged absolutely or on the conditions prescribed in a probation order made under subsection 731(2).[13]Thus, this provision allows the Court to refrain from entering a conviction, despite proof that an offence has been committed, if it is satisfied that two prerequisites exist.The Court must be satisfied that a discharge is (1) in the best interests of the offender; and (2) not contrary to the public interest.[14]In R. v. Elsharawy, (1997), 1997 CanLII 14708 (NL CA), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 565 (N.L.C.A.), the Court of Appeal indicated that the first factor \"presupposes that the accused is a person of good character, usually without previous conviction or discharge\" and the second factor \"involves a consideration of the principle of general deterrence with attention being paid to the gravity of the offence, its incidence in the community, public attitudes towards it and public confidence in the effective enforcement of the criminal law\" (at paragraph 3).[15]In R. v. Edmunds, 2012 NLCA 26 (CanLII), [2012] N.J. No. 177 (C.A.), the accused pleaded guilty to one count of breach of trust by a public officer and two counts of theft. The offender, who was employed as a correctional officer, stole monies from two prisoners. The sentencing judge imposed a conditional discharge with twenty-four months of probation.The Crown appealed from the sentence imposed.[16]The Crown’s appeal from sentence was dismissed. The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal concluded that “the Crown has not pointed the Court to any binding or persuasive authorities that would suggest that a conditional discharge was a demonstrably unfit and clearly unreasonable sentence in these circumstances.”The Court of Appeal noted, at paragraph 20, that in “some circumstances, evidence of particular effects on the offender will be required if the offender is relying on such factors.However, a sentencing judge may take judicial notice of the fact that a criminal conviction will have a negative impact on a person's future, whether related to employment opportunities, travel, and so forth.”[17]In Edmunds, the Court of Appeal, at paragraph 22, indicated that the evidence presented at the sentence hearing showed that the offender’s “mental illness contributed to his commission of the offence.”The Court of Appeal concluded that as a result “the usefulness and appropriateness of specific deterrence is much reduced and the Court may properly place greater emphasis on rehabilitation.”[18]In R. v. House, [2012] N.J. No. 219 (C.A.), the accused was convicted of the offences of assault and unlawfully being in a dwelling house.In concluding that a conditional discharge was warranted for both offences, the Court of Appeal indicated that the accused is \"a promising young man who, in his twenties, is still maturing and developing the basis for a productive life including employment and relationship opportunities and decisions\" (at paragraph 24):As discussed in Elsharawy, in an assessment of whether a conditional discharge is in the best interests of Mr. House, the first condition presupposes that the accused is a person of good character, ordinarily with no previous criminal conviction or discharge. Based on the above, this supposition is satisfied in this case. As to the need for personal deterrence or rehabilitation, I note that Mr. House was on release, with conditions, on a Promise to Appear prior to his trial, and that he obtained judicial interim release, again with conditions, pending determination of his appeal. He has been compliant with the terms of release, particularly the requirement to keep the peace and be of good behaviour, for almost four years. Given the nature of the offence and Mr. House's conduct since the offences were committed, personal deterrence and rehabilitation are not matters of concern. Finally, regarding adverse repercussions from a criminal conviction, Mr. House is a promising young man who, in his twenties, is still maturing and developing the basis for a productive life including employment and relationship opportunities and decisions. A criminal record, where such is unnecessary for purposes of protection of the public, may result in roadblocks in terms of this development. Such a result is to be avoided provided Mr. House is otherwise a proper candidate for a conditional discharge.SENTENCING PRECEDENTS[19]In R. v. Fong, [2011] N.J. No. 66 (P.C.), the accused assaulted his spouse by striking her with the back of his hand. I endorsed a joint submission and imposed an absolute discharge.[20]In R. v. Wimbleton, [2011] N.J. No. 73 (P.C.), the accused assaulted his spouse by grabbing her by the back of her neck.I endorsed a joint submission and imposed a conditional discharge.[21]In R. v. Brushett, [2015] N.J.

Lee........................................................................................................................for the CrownD. Embry.........................................................................for the accused Vinothan SriranganathanROBERTSON, J.:[1]The accused has entered pleas of guilt to three charges –1)Mischief Under $5000 by interference with the lawful use of an ATM2)Possession of the Forgery Device, i.e. a skimmer device and3)Possession of a credit card obtained by crime, a bank card not in his own name[2]The facts are simple.The accused and another individual were observed manipulating an ATM.Their activities were reported to police who determined that a skimmer device and a pin hole camera had been installed on the ATM.Video surveillance captured the installation and subsequent investigation located the accused’s fingerprints on the ATM and the card reader or skimmer. The skimmer device and pin hole camera are designed to steal debit card data and record the Personal Identification Numbers (PIN) of legitimate bank customers, the purpose of which is to subsequently gain access to their accounts and/or to use the data to purchase items.[3]The accused was arrested in the vicinity of the ATM.A search incident to arrest revealed that the accused was in possession of a credit card, not in his name and which subsequent investigation, determined was obtained by crime.[4]The accused is 26, has no criminal record and spent 2 days in pre-trial custody.[5]The crown seeks a suspended sentence and 12 months probation on terms.[6]The defence seeks a conditional discharge.It agrees with the appropriateness of the probationary period with the same terms as submitted by the crown.[7]Following submissions I asked counsel to provide me with case law to support their respective positions.I did so as I felt that neither sentence was within the appropriate range but wished to give counsel the opportunity to support their respective positions.[8]On December 23, 2011 I received casebooks from both counsel and heard further submissions on sentence.[9]Both counsel submitted that there were few cases which are directly relevant to the circumstances of this case as most reported decisions regarding installation of skimming devices, of which there are few, dealt with broader schemes involving more ATMs, often resulting in significant financial loss to the financial institutions involved. The cases nevertheless are helpful in identifying the potential impact of such crimes on victims of hacked accounts and on the banking system in general.[10]Although every case turns on its own facts, no case provided, which admittedly were generally more serious, resulted in either a conditional discharge or a suspended sentence; all cases resulted in incarceration – to be served in an institution or in the community, through a conditional sentence.[11]On January 26, I determined that the victim of this offence had not be notified of their right to provide a Victim Impact Statement and so the matter was further adjourned to allow the crown to inquiry as to whether the victim wished to do so.I have today received that statement which has been made an exhibit.[12]Having reviewed the cases provided as well as others referred to in those cases, having received the original and subsequent submissions of counsel as to sentence, and having reviewed the Victim Impact Statement, I do not agree that either a conditional discharge or a suspended sentence is an appropriate sentence.[13]The following is my reasons.[14]Any sentence starts with a consideration of the mitigating and aggravating factors.[15]The mitigating factors are:a)The accused has plead guilty.The defence notified the crown in advance of the trial date and the witnesses were not required to attend court.In addition to a sign of remorse, the guilty plea has saved the witnesses of the necessity of coming to court.b)The accused is 26.He is youthful, although not a youth.He is a local truck driver.He is a refugee claimant seeking to bring his mother and brother from Sri Lanka.c)The accused is a first offender, having no criminal record.d)Only a single installation was involved.Although the crown submits material found in the accused’s automobile would suggest a larger or more extensive involvement, the offence is the accused’s involvement in the installation and monitoring of a single installation.e)The accused served 2 days in pre-trial custody before obtaining bail.[16]The aggravating factors are:a)This is a sophisticated crime involving the installation of a device to record data and personal information of banking customers.These devices are not readily available and can only be acquired through one’s association with illegitimate sources that have the resources to acquire the professionally manufactured devices designed specifically to replicate the colour, texture and appearance of the ATMs of specific banks.By replicating the legitimate appearance of the individual bank’s equipment, customers are unaware of their victimization until their accounts have already been depleted.b)The accused involvement in the criminal activity is pre-planned.To have become involved, the accused would have had to have met with those higher up on the chain to be entrusted with the skimmer and pin hole camera, to have received instructions on its installation and instruction on monitoring the ATM’s activity before re-attending to remove the device once the data is recorded.The common pattern in these cases is to install the skimmer device and then monitor from a location nearby, the ATM’s use for a period of time, before returning to collect the data and remove the device for future use.Consistent with that pattern, Mr. Sriranganathan was observed attending at the ATM on three occasions, was seen loitering in the area of the ATM after the device was installed and had on him when arrested, a credit card, provided to him to use to test the device.The accused did not spontaneously come upon his criminal activity.c)Although the accused was not the mastermind of the scheme or likely even an individual very high up in the organization, by agreeing to become involved, he was nevertheless knowingly joining in a criminal enterprise with others, was aware of the objective of the broader group and was aware or should have been aware of the potential devastating effects of their activities.He was in essence, knowingly, a member of a criminal organization.d)The prevalence of this type of crime is increasing.This was a common theme of all of the cases I was referred to by both the crown and the defence. In the Victim Impact Statement of Interac Association, the exponential growth of debit card fraud resulting from skimming is demonstrated in the increasing loss due to this activity.In 2003 the loss was $44 million with 29,000 debit cards exploited.The loss has continued to increase despite industry safeguards.In 2010 the loss due to skimming had grown to $119 million with over 205,000 debit cards exploited.e)Although in this case, the devices installed malfunctioned and were seized by police before any loss could occur, the potential for loss was very significant - to those customers whose cards would have been skimmed, to the bank specifically and to the integrity of the banking system in general.First there is the primary victim, those whose cards have been skimmed.They will suffer both the inconvenience of the fact their cards will not work and the embarrassment that their cards cannot be used to pay for goods and services.If their accounts have been accessed and funds taken, there will be a delay to replace those funds while the bank conducts an investigation, during which the cardholders may be unable to meet basic living requirements, such as paying their rent or mortgage payments.Then there is the secondary victim, the individual bank, which must investigate the loss and ultimately, reimburse the cardholder for the fraudulently obtained funds.The final victim is the attack on the integrity of the banking system in general.f)The attack on the banking system is perhaps most important.The crime has a direct impact on the public’s faith in the security of the electronic banking system, a system which relies heavily on the customer’s use of ATMs.In R. v. Slade [2006] N.S.J. 445 (N.S.S.C.), Justice MacDonald of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court commented on this aspect:“In my view, this type of offence goes right to the reliance the average member of the public has in its electronic banking system.The ability of this type of activity to throw havoc into our banking system is tremendous and dangerous.”It was also commented on by Justice Van de Veen of the Alberta Provincial Court in R. v. Marano [2007] A.J. 425 at para. 16:“The nature of the offence before the Court is extremely serious.The scheme facilitated by the accused strikes at the very foundation of modern monetary technology heavily relied upon by the public at large to secure necessities of daily life on an ongoing basis.”In R. v. Sandranathan [2007] O.J. 2326, a case heard in this court by Wong, J., in a Victim Impact Statement provided by the bank, in that case the CIBC, as to the impact of skimming and bank card fraud has on the banking system as a whole, the bank had this to say:“This issue (card fraud) adds to a diminished belief in the structure and stability of the convenience card process.The lifeblood of any financial institution is its customer base, and if there is a lack of faith from clients in any of its systems, including the convenience card sector, the economy as a whole is eventually impacted.”[17]The key sentencing principles in this case are specific and general deterrence and rehabilitation.[18]The increasing prevalence of this type of crime, its potential significant impact on the integrity of the banking system and its possible effects on the personal finances of individual bank customers demonstrates a strong need for deterrence.[19]Although the accused was far more likely a foot soldier as opposed to a general or even a captain in the scheme, the success of any campaign is dependent on each of those individuals doing their job, all aware of the objectives of the whole.The accused though a lonely foot soldier, was nevertheless involved and played his part in a pre-planned organized attack on the banking system and its customers, knowing the wrath that such an attack could inflict.[20]Neither a conditional discharge nor a suspended sentence would reflect the degree of deterrence, specific or general, that is needed in this case.No cases have been referred to me where a conditional discharge for this type of offence has been granted.[21]That is also true for a suspended sentence, with the exception of the co-accused in this case.This raises the issue of parity in that the accused does not appear to be in any different position as Mr. Drepaul.He was granted a suspended sentence.It does appear that that case was resolved before Marshall, J. in the absence of any sentencing authorities and without any input for the victim.This additional information greatly assisted the court in understanding the significant potential impact of this criminal activity.In light of the review of that material, I am satisfied that a suspended sentence is not an appropriate sentence in this case.Incarceration is the appropriate sentence for this offence.[22]The real issue for this court is whether the offence and the circumstances of the offender require the sentence be served in jail or whether a conditional sentence is appropriate.[23]The period of incarceration appropriate in this case is in the range applicable to conditional sentences.Further there is no evidence to suggest that the safety of the community would be endangered by the offender serving his sentence in the community, given that the accused has no criminal record, has remained on bail since his release without breach and appears to have been engaged in the lower end of the criminal enterprise.In assessing the risk I considered both the likelihood of re-offence and the gravity of damage should the accused re-offend.Although the gravity could be severe, the likelihood of re-offence is low.[24]Satisfaction of the pre-requisites to the imposition of a conditional sentence of course doesn’t end the matter.For a conditional sentence to be appropriate it must still be consistent with the sentencing principles set out under section 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code.[25]Denunciation, general and specific deterrence and rehabilitation are all applicable principles of sentencing in this case.The need for general deterrence is heightened given the increased prevalence of this type of crime and the significant and widespread potential for damage to the banking system.There is a compelling argument that a significant sentence of incarceration is warranted on grounds of general deterrence, to send a strong clear message to those willing to risk exposure to be caught, all for easy gains, while those higher up in the enterprise remain hidden from the authorities.[26]As regard specific deterrence, the accused appears to have entered an early guilty plea and expressed remorse.He has no record.A severe sentence is unlikely necessary to address specific deterrence.[27]Although both specific and general deterrence are relevant sentencing principles, I am cognizant that rehabilitation is also of paramount consideration in a case where the accused is a youthful first offender.It is well established that when sentencing such an individual, the paramount considerations are rehabilitation and specific deterrence and that the court should be careful not to overemphasize general deterrence; see R. v. Stein (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 376 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Priest (1996), 1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.).[28]As in all cases, but in this case particularly, there are competing sentencing principles emphasizing the need for a meaningful custodial sentence on one hand and others principles, militating away from sending a first offender to jail.[29]The aggravating factors point to a sentence geared towards general deterrence and institutional incarceration.These include the significant potential for impact on the banking system by the type of criminal activity engaged in by the accused, including his loose but nevertheless association with others in what can fairly be characterized as a criminal organization.There is also the increasing prevalence of this type of crime which calls for the court to address general deterrence.Does the presence of these factors preclude the imposition of a conditional sentence?[30]R. v. Ijam 2007 ONCA 597 (CanLII), [2007] O.J. 3395 (Ont. C.A.) is a sentencing case which has some significant parallels with the case at bar.Both involve a youthful first offender.Neither involved an actual loss, although the potential for loss was great and thirdly, both involved an attack on the integrity on the banking or monetary system.[31]In Ijam the accused had, along with his co-accused, set up a fairly sophisticated counterfeiting operation.They were apprehended before the counterfeited money, some $8000, could be distributed.The issue before the Court of Appeal was whether a conditional sentence could be impose in light of the aggravating factors which militated against the imposition of conditional sentence and towards a jail term to be served in an institution.[32]Sharpe, J. speaking for four of the five member Court, stated at para 58:“….even when there are aggravating factors which might point to the need for a sentence geared to general deterrence, “a conditional sentence may provide sufficient denunciation and deterrence”, and it is an error “to rule out the possibility of a conditional sentence ab initio simply because aggravating features are present.”: R. v. Proulx (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.).”[33]In my view this is a close call, but I am prepared to find that in this case, that sufficient deterrence, specific and general, can be fashioned in a conditional sentence, to be followed by a probationary term largely to address the rehabilitative aspects of the sentence.[34]My sentence is therefore as follows:[35]You will be sentence to incarceration for a period of 4 months, to be served conditional in the community.[36]In addition to the mandatory terms, for the first three months of the Conditional Sentence Order you will remain confined in your residence except for the purpose of employment, personal medical appointments and religious services, for a single two hour continuous period weekly for the purpose of shopping for necessities and to comply with legal obligations regarding this Conditional Sentence Order.In the discretion of your supervisor, these will be incorporated into a letter of permission to be out of your residence and the letter shall be carried on your person while outside your residence and provided to a police officer upon demand for identification.You may obtain from the supervisor written permission to be outside your residence for any other reason deemed appropriate by the supervisor and again, this permission shall be carried with you when outside your residence and provided to police upon demand for identification.[37]For the last month of the custodial portion of your Conditional Sentence Order, you will be confined to your residence from 10 pm to 6 am, 7 days a week.[38]You will perform 25 hours of community service work at a rate of not less than 5 hours per month starting within 30 days of this Order, to be completed to be satisfaction of the supervisor and completed within 4 months.[39]You will reside at an address approved of by your supervisor.[40]You will not associate with or have any communication with Marcus Drepaul.[41]In addition you are not to possess any financial instrument, including but not limited to any bank credit or debit card, not in your own name.[42]Following the Conditional Sentence Order, you will be placed on probation for 12 months on the following terms - reporting forthwith to your probation officer and thereafter as is required, keep the peace and be of good behaviour, reside at an address approved of by your probation officer, not to possess any financial instrument, including but not limited to any bank credit or debit card, not in your own name and have no contact directly or indirectly with Marcus Drepaul.[43]At the request of the accused, the shopping period will be each and every Sunday from 10 a.m. to 12 noon, unless a different two hour period is agreed upon by your supervisor.[44]The predicate offence will be the possession of the forgery device.The sentence on the other two offences will be concurrent to each and concurrent to the predicate offence.The Victim Surcharge will be waived.[45]Any remaining charges, if any, on this information will be withdrawn at the request of the Crown.Released:February 29, 2012Signed: “Justice Robertson”"}

Daviau, forthe appellantJohn Patton, for the respondentHeard:June 29, 2010On appeal from the conviction entered byJustice J.M. Wilson of the Superior Court of Justice on April 6, 2005, andthe sentence imposed on June 28, 2005.MacFarland J.A.:[1]Following a trial by judge alone the appellant was convicted on thirteen of seventeen charges, one of which was stayed pursuant to the Kienapple principle.Counts 1 through 8 related to various assaults on K.M., the complainant.Counts 9 through 13 related to the possession of two handguns and ammunition.Count 14 related to a breach of recognizance for possessing a weapon and counts 15 through 17 related to possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.[2]The appellant appeals both his conviction and sentence.Sentence Appeal[3]In relation to sentence, the appellant submits that subsequent to his sentence in relation to the thirteen charges of which he was convicted he was sentenced to a further period of incarceration for an unrelated offence. The sentence he received for that unrelated matter when added to the sentence received for the matters before this court amount to a penitentiary sentence.Accordingly, because the total sentence exceeds a reformatory sentence, the probationary part of the sentence before us has become unlawful.The Crown concedes that the probation imposed by the trial judge, in light of the ensuing events, cannot stand.That part of the sentence will accordingly be set aside.Conviction Appeal[4]The appellant raises two grounds of appeal.First, he argues that the trial judge erred in admitting into evidence the complainant’s prior inconsistent videotaped statement.Second, he argues ineffective assistance of counsel.This latter ground of appeal relates to an Agreed Statement of Facts which was entered into evidence following the appellant’s testimony at trial.The Facts[5]The complainant’s grandmother contacted the police on April 4, 2003.She was concerned for her granddaughter’s safety.The grandmother advised the police that a threat by the appellant included a threat with a weapon.Given the allegation of a weapon, police took the threat seriously and police were placed to observe the grandmother’s residence and to intervene if necessary.[6]At 3:00 p.m. on April 4, 2003, Detective MacDonald and his partner attended at the grandmother’s home.They asked initial questions of the complainant.Based on their observations both officers concluded she had been assaulted.The police requested a videotaped statement from both K.M. and her grandmother. They were both willing to provide a statement and accompanied the police to the station.In her videotaped statement, K.M. described six different assaults that the appellant allegedly committed on her, since 2002.The final incident involved the appellant putting a gun on her and forcing her to strip naked, take a shower, and serve him drinks for an hour.After the incident was over, the complainant said she wrapped the gun in her pyjama bottoms and hid the gun in a shoe box amongst her clothes.[7]On April 4, 2003, shortly before midnight, the appellant was arrested in a high-risk take-down.A digital scale was found in his jacket pocket and 9.97 grams of cocaine in a series of four baggies, was located on the passenger seat floor by the door.The police obtained a search warrant to search the residence of the appellant’s parents for a weapon as described by the complainant in her videotaped statement. The search warrant was executed shortly after midnight on April 5, 2003.In the appellant’s bedroom the police located two handguns, ammunition and potential drug related items, including an electronic scale, a grinder, various cutting agents and baggies.They also seized what appeared to be two debt lists dated 2001 and 2003.[8]At trial the complainant recanted the allegations outlined in the videotaped statement.She claimed that when she gave the statement she was angry at the appellant for his infidelity, high on ecstasy and had had little sleep in days. She had continued her relationship with the appellant and had, one month before his conviction, given birth to his child.After a voir dire, the trial judge admitted the statement into evidence for the truth of its contents.The complainant was also declared adverse.[9]The appellant testified and during his examination-in-chief alleged a complex police initiated conspiracy in defence of the possession charge.Immediately thereafter, the Crown notified the court of its intention to investigate the appellant’s allegation and call reply evidence. Defence counsel did not re-examine the appellant after cross-examination.Rather than calling reply evidence defence counsel and the Crown agreed to file an Agreed Statement of Facts (ASF) which touched on four narrow issues. The ASF clarified and corrected certain evidence which the appellant had given.[10]The trial judge convicted the appellant on four of the eight assault charges, of pointing a firearm and five other gun-related charges and of breach of recognizance as the result of the gun convictions.He was also convicted of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of the proceeds of crime.The KGB Statement[11]First, the appellant argues that the trial judge improperly admitted the complainant’s KGB statement.His argument essentially is that the video recording does not meet the requirements established by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. K.G.B., 1993 CanLII 116 (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 740.The criticisms include that the camera was not close enough to the complainant, that there was no additional close-up photo within the frame showing the complainant at close range so that the trial judge could properly assess her demeanor, and that the faces of the interrogating officers were not shown.[12]In my view, this argument is entirely without merit.First and foremost, video recording has come a long way in the seventeen years since KGB.The subject video, played during the argument of the appeal, is clear and focused.The complainant’s face is clearly visible at all times.While there was no second camera focused on the officers, their faces are clearly and adequately visible in profile.No complaint is made of the quality of the audio recording.[13]It is clear from her reasons that the trial judge had no difficulty with the quality of the recording.Her reasons for judgment include the following observations in relation to the video recording:[K.M.] recanted her videotaped statement.Her evidence at trial recanting the videotaped statement appeared flat, stilted and scripted. She simply denied any abuse and provided no explanation for her previous statement that was credible.There were moments during the trial, during her viva voce testimony where her evidence appeared to be true when she was not being asked directly about the allegations and she was “off script”. By way of contrast, her videotaped statement was credible, natural in its delivery and made sense.It was understated.She did not exaggerate.…In my view, the two officers conducted a professional, sensitive interview. They asked questions, but were not directive or leading in how they pursued the videotaped interview.…The videotape confirms that [K.M.] is angry and upset by Mr. Curnew’s conduct – not surprisingly. However, the thrust of her evidence was that the incident with the gun really, really frightened her.There is no indication in the videotape of any exaggeration of events, there is no indication of any jealousy in her evidence.If anything, she understates what happened. She is angry about him arranging for her to go into debt. However, she realizes that by coming forward to the police, she will probably not see the money again.Defence also raises the issue of the allegation that she had taken a narcotic, ecstasy, before providing the statement.I have previously ruled upon this issue. I concluded that she had not taken a narcotic or, if she had, it did not affect the quality and reliability of her evidence. I repeat that conclusion here.I reject the suggestion that [K.M.] had taken anything that affected the reliability or truthfulness of her disclosure made to the police in her videotaped statement.[14]It is apparent from these comments as well as her ruling on the admissibility of the statement, that the trial judge had no difficulty with the quality of the video recording or with her ability to observe the complainant’s demeanor.In my view, the appellant’s interpretation of KGB is too narrow.That case does not require that, to be admissible, the video recording must be in the exact same format as the video recording was in that case.As Lamer C.J. explained at p. 793-94: “a complete videotape record of the type described above, or one which duplicates the experience of observing a witness in the courtroom to the same extent, is another important indicium of reliability” (emphasis added).[15]The quality of the video recording was not raised as an issue at trial.The only issue raised at trial was voluntariness, where the defence argued that the complainant had had little sleep in the hours preceding the making of her video statement and was high on ecstasy at the time.[16]In response to that argument, after reviewing the law relating to operating mind, the trial judge was satisfied that even if she accepted the complainant’s trial evidence in relation to the taking of the drug, any effects from her ingestion would have worn off in any event by the time she gave her statement and the quality and reliability of her evidence was not affected. It will be noted, however, that the trial judge did not accept the complainant’s evidence that she had taken drugs. Because it was not raised at trial, the quality of the video recording is not the subject of the trial judge’s ruling on the admissibility of the statement.[17]However, in dealing with the voluntariness issue that was raised, there are findings made by the trial judge from which it may reasonably be inferred that she had no difficulty with the quality of the video recording.By way of example:The most telling evidence, in my view, of an operating mind is the contents of the videotape, itself.The answers given by [K.M.] to the questions asked were spontaneous and natural.She included gestures by way of explanation.The flow of her evidence was natural.She also exhibited a good memory for detail.Throughout her statement she was co-operative, quiet spoken and provided her evidence in a clear, comprehensive manner.I note that [K.M.] had no physical signs of any sort of impairment.[18]In conclusion, it is obvious from her ruling on the voir dire as well as her reasons for judgment that the trial judge had no difficulty with the quality of the video recording and she was able to observe the complainant’s demeanor in a meaningful way.[19]I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.Ineffective Assistance of Counsel[20]This ground of appeal concerns trial counsel’s agreement to file the Agreed Statement of Facts.The effect of that document was to undermine some of the evidence which the appellant had given at trial.He argues that the filing of that statement made him out to be a liar in the trial judge’s eyes. He argues that had his credibility not been impugned in this way, he might have been believed and the result would have been different.[21]The appellant gave evidence at trial.In the course of giving that evidence he alleged a complex police initiated conspiracy in defence of the possession charge which included the alleged recycling of exhibits by the police from an earlier trial at which the appellant had been acquitted.[22]There can be no question that the appellant was a difficult client who had his own ideas about how the trial should be run.In giving his evidence, the appellant’s answers implicated his trial counsel in the sense that he indicated that his allegations could be confirmed by his lawyer.Defence counsel was put in a difficult position in attempting to balance his duty to represent his client to the best of his ability and his duty as an officer of the court to ensure that the court is not misled.[23]Defence counsel did not re-examine his client after cross-examination was complete.In my view, he cannot be criticized for his decision.Just to take one example, the appellant alleged that the debt sheet, which had been made an exhibit at trial and supported the charge of possession for the purpose, was the same document that had been made an exhibit at a trial before Matlow J. in 2003 where the appellant was acquitted for a similar charge.His evidence was that the police merely recycled that exhibit to support the charges against him in 2005.Trial counsel in 2003 and 2005 was the same lawyer.In his evidence the appellant indicated that trial counsel could prove his allegation.Trial counsel had compared the exhibits filed in 2003 and 2005 and knew they were not the same.[24]The Crown indicated it would call reply evidence which would demonstrate the falsity of this allegation.Trial counsel determined that the filing of the Agreed Statement of Fact would be better than a string of witnesses who would prove the falsity of the appellant’s evidence with devastating effect.[25]The appellant argues that the Agreed Statement was filed without his consent and that trial counsel did not inform him nor give him the opportunity to participate in it.This was a tactical decision and one properly available to him as an officer of the court.[26]As Major J. noted in R. v. G.D.B., 2000 SCC 22 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at para. 34: “Where, in the course of a trial, counsel makes a decision in good faith and in the best interest of his client, a court should not look behind it save only to prevent a miscarriage of justice.”[27]In G.D.B., Major J. noted:[27]Incompetence is determined by a reasonableness standard.The analysis proceeds upon a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. The onus is on the appellant to establish the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment.The wisdom of hindsight has no place in this analysis.[28]Miscarriages of justice may take many forms in this context.In some instances, counsel’s performance may have resulted in procedural unfairness. In others, the reliability of the trial’s result may have been compromised.[29]In those cases where it is apparent that no prejudice has occurred, it will usually be undesirable for appellate courts to consider the performance component of the analysis. The object of an ineffectiveness claim is not to grade counsel’s performance or professional conduct. The latter is left to the profession’s self-governing body.If it is appropriate to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of no prejudice having occurred, that is the course to follow (Strickland, supra, at p. 697).[28]This court must first consider whether the alleged incompetence resulted in a miscarriage of justice.In my view, there can be no doubt on this record that there has been no miscarriage of justice.[29]The trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence but in so doing did not rely solely on the Agreed Statement of Facts.Her reasons for judgment make it clear that she rejected the appellant’s evidence for many reasons and not just on the basis of the Agreed Statement of Facts.[30]Starting at p. 21 of her reasons, she described the appellant as follows:He was an arrogant, nonresponsive witness.He blamed the system for the false accusations and the conspiracy against him.He was always the victim.He was volatile and angry in giving his answers, although he tried very hard to contain his reactions.His story and version of events often bordered on the fantastical.It appeared that he just made things up as he went along.If there ever was a plan, with his counsel being aware of the theory of the defence, it appears that Mr. Curnew did not follow the plan.Andrew Curnew aggressively asserted facts and events which were proved conclusively beyond a reasonable doubt in reply evidence not to bear any resemblance to the truth.When giving answers, Andrew Curnew was cagey.He tried to figure out what the question was and what its relevance was before providing an answer.He had his own agenda.I do not accept his evidence. His manner and attitude in testifying speak volumes, however, with respect to the nature of the relationship and the dynamic of control exerted by Andrew Curnew in his relationship with [K.M.]…Andrew Curnew was always right, and others are always to blame. This quality was obvious from his testimony before the court as he spun an incredible web to try to explain away significantly incriminating evidence.According to him, he was the victim of an elaborate police conspiracy.The tape recording of the various telephone calls[1] confirms that Andrew Curnew is always right and that others, including [Ms. M.], “fuck things up”.Andrew Curnew is an angry, explosive person. These qualities were obvious from both his testimony and, in particular, from three recorded telephone calls.…Andrew Curnew acknowledged that he broke [Ms M.’s] nose. He was faced with the awkward observation of two police officers who confirmed that on April 4th, 2003, that each of them observed the cut on [Ms. M.’s] nose and swelling around her eye.Andrew Curnew then fabricated some story that he accidentally broke [Ms. M.’s] nose when she hit a snowbank while driving a car.At one point he says he was asleep and his arm accidentally flung out and hit her nose.Later, he said it was a protective reaction towards her in the context of an accident.I do not accept either explanation.It is part of the elaborate web to cover the truth.I note, as well, that [Ms. M.] simply denied that he broke her nose.She did not outline any accident theory in her evidence.…I do not accept the evidence of Andrew Curnew that he accidentally hit [Ms. M.] on the nose when she drove into a snowbank. It bears no air of reality. At one time, he said it was an accident and it occurred while he was asleep; on another occasion, he said it was his reaction to protect her.I do not accept either explanation.…The suggestion by Andrew Curnew that the drugs were planted by the police, or that they had previously seized from another person, a Mr. Barry Curnew, not a relative, was fantastical.…The items located by the police in the accused’s bedroom were also evidence of trafficking.This included an electric scale, which had a white residue on its surface, according to Officer Eagleson. I accept the evidence. The scale was accurate to one-one hundredth of a gram.I do not accept Mr. Curnew’s explanation that this scale was used in his courier business.[31]It is apparent that the trial judge had many reasons for rejecting Mr. Curnew’s evidence apart from the Agreed Statement of Facts.In such circumstances, the result of the trial would necessarily have been the same. There is no miscarriage of justice and accordingly no need to review the conduct of defence counsel at trial.[32]I would give no effect to this ground of appeal.Conclusion[33]I would allow the sentence appeal and set aside the probation order.In all other respects I would dismiss the appeal.RELEASED:November 12, 2010“KF”“J.

Humphrey dated January 7, 1998.E N D O R S E M E N T[1]The appellant submits that the trial judge shifted the burden of proof in convicting the appellant.She relies, in particular, on one sentence from the trial judge’s reasons:If Angie Codina is telling the truth, both lawyers conspired to frame her by perjured evidence.[2]This sentence must be read in context.Later in his reasons, the trial judge considered and properly applied W.(D.)[3]The appellant also submits that the trial judge was overly critical of the appellant’s evidence and was not similarly critical of the evidence of the two key Crown witnesses.In our view, the approach taken by the trial judge to the evidence of the appellant and to Crown witnesses was both reasonable and understandable.We see no merit in this ground of appeal.[4]The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in finding that she concocted exhibit 48 in the absence of independent evidence of concoction.In our view, the circumstances of this case are distinguishable from those in R. v. Coutts and Middleton (1998), 1998 CanLII 4212 (ON CA), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 545 at 551 (Ont. C.A.) and similar cases.The appellant was the author of exhibit 48.The finding of concoction flows directly and without alternative from the trial judge’s rejection of the appellant’s evidence with respect to exhibit 48.The trial judge also found that the appellant’s explanation concerning exhibit 48 did not give rise to a reasonable doubt. We, therefore, think that the trial judge did not err in concluding that exhibit 48 was concocted.This ground of appeal fails.Therefore, the conviction appeal is dismissed.Sentence[5]This was a fraud on the public purse by an officer of the court.If anything, the sentence imposed was lenient.We do not think that the fact that the appellant was later sentenced to 9 years and 3 months to 28 years in jail in New York State provides justification for reducing the manifestly reasonable sentence imposed by the trial judge.[6]Leave is granted but the appeal against sentence is dismissed.“C.A.

He and Warren Kakakaway had been at the Regina General Hospital to use the internet. As they walked down Dewdney Avenue, Mr. Strongquill and Mr. Kakakaway encountered a number of other young men. The group remained together for the evening, consuming alcohol.At about 3:00 a.m. they encountered two other young men who approached them. These two men were Stewart Whitebird and Darian Moise. Mr. Whitebird and Mr. Moise had also been drinking that evening.[4]One of the men in the bigger group made the statement that “those guys rolled on me today”. Mr. Strongquill’s group then surrounded these two men and deployed bear mace. Both Mr. Whitebird and Mr. Moise ran away. Mr. Whitebird was successful in evading the group, but Mr. Moise was chased by the group and cornered by Mr. Strongquill on the steps of 1266 Robinson Street and stabbed once by Mr. Strongquill with a hunting knife.[5]Mr. Moise was left to die and he remained on the steps for a number of hours before he was discovered by a group of young girls.THE ACCUSED[6]Mr. Strongquill is a 22 year old member of the Keeseekoose First Nation. He has a common law wife and a two year old daughter. Mr. Strongquill appears before the court on his first criminal conviction.[7]Mr. Strongquill had a chaotic childhood. He was one of 11 children born to Lawrence Strongquill, Sr. and Sheila Kakakaway. Mr. Strongquill and his siblings were first apprehended by the Ministry of Social Services May 29, 2002 due to parental neglect. This included problems with chronic parental addiction issues, domestic violence between the parents, violence perpetrated against the accused’s sisters by his mother, as well as no food in the home for lengthy periods of time, no furniture or beds in the home and no toys for the children. After this initial apprehension, Mr. Strongquill was apprehended on a further 14 occasions and placed in 7 different homes. By the time Mr. Strongquill was 12 years old, he became a long term ward of the Ministry of Social Services.[8]Mr. Strongquill described these placements as being in predominately white homes in white communities. He felt overt racism. Many of Mr. Strongquill’s family members, including his father, attended residential schools.[9]By age 16, Mr. Strongquill opted out of the Long Term Ward Program and tried unsuccessfully to rebuild a relationship with his mother. Mr. Strongquill has established contact with his father and now considers his father to be a pro social support.[10]Mr. Strongquill is not involved with any gangs. He states he rarely consumes alcohol, although he was intoxicated at the time of this offence. He regularly uses marijuana.[11]Mr. Strongquill is completing his GED while in custody. He has had various jobs during his life and was employed full-time at ME Janitorial in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan at the time of the offence. He had come to Regina for the weekend to visit.[12]Mr. Strongquill has been assessed as being at a low risk to re-offend. He does not hold pro-criminal attitudes or beliefs.[13]Two letters were filed in support of Mr. Strongquill. The first is from Beverly Severeight who described Mr. Strongquill as being a well-mannered, intelligent person who showed respect and love towards her and to his family. The second letter is from Molly and Eugene Belanger, the grandparents of Mr. Strongquill’s common law partner. They described Mr. Strongquill as being compassionate, independent, even tempered, motivated and hardworking.THE VICTIM[14]Darian Denzel Moisewas 16years old at the time of his death. Mr. Moise’s mother predeceased him and he was raised by his grandfather on the Ochapowace First Nation. Mr. Moise’s cousin Erica described him as being a very kind, fun loving person.Every greeting came with a hug, a bro shake and a big smile.[15]The victim impact statements filed by Mr. Moise’s, auntie, Barbara Still and by his cousin Erica Allary reflect their grief at his loss. Ms. Still reflected on when she heard the news and the heartbreak she felt when she saw and heard her dad crying after Mr. Moise’s death. Ms. Still said there are no words to express the hurt and anger felt by her family. She has honored Mr. Moise’s memory by naming her infant son after him.[16]Ms. Allary described the hurt, anger and grief experienced by her family. She described the loss they feel in never being able to see Mr. Moise graduate, in never seeing him in his first job, get married or have his first child. Ms. Allary has organized a walk in north central Regina in memory of Mr. Moise. She will do this for a total of four years.She said in her victim impact statement that Mr. Moise would not want [them] to hold bad feelings nor ever seek revenge. That is not how our grandmothers and grandfathers taught us”. She has chosen a positive way to remember Mr. Moise.CROWN AND DEFENCE JOINT SUBMISSION[17]The Crown and the defence join in their submission to the court that a sentence of eight years minus the credit for the time spent on remand would be the appropriate sentence in these circumstances. Both counsel filed some cases for the court’s consideration.ANALYSIS[18]In sentencing offenders, the court considers mitigating and aggravating factors. I find the following to be mitigating factors:1.Mr. Strongquill has no previous criminal record. Mr. Strongquill has been in custody since September 29, 2015.This is a total of 451 days actual custody or at 1.5 credit for each day in custody it would be equivalent to 676.5 days. He has been a contributing member of society, having held a number of jobs. He was supporting his common law partner and child prior to his incarceration. He has expressed his remorse to the Moise family. I find that to be a sincere expression of his position. I find that the accused decided at an early date to accept responsibility for his actions. This is clear evidence of remorse. I find that he and his family have suffered financially as a result of his actions. The accused was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the offence. To be clear the voluntary consumption of alcohol by the accused is not a mitigating factor but it provides some explanation for this senseless act of violence by someone with no previous record of violence towards someone who was a complete stranger to him.2.Mr. Strongquill is a First Nations man who has experienced a number of Gladue factors (R v Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 SCR 688). He experienced familial breakdown and isolation. He grew up in extreme poverty. He was apprehended on more than 14 occasions and was separated from his siblings, having been placed in white homes in white communities. He was subject to overt racism. He was subjected to alcohol abuse and observed physical abuse in his home. He did not feel loved and safe as a child.[19]I find the following to be aggravating factors:Mr. Strongquill was part of a bigger group. Mr. Moise tried unsuccessfully to get away. Mr. Strongquill was a stranger to Mr. Moise. Mr. Strongquill was clearly armed with a knife, which made it too easy for him to inflict the fatal blow, cutting short the life of a young man with a lot of life left to live.[20]In reviewing the principles of sentencing, all are relevant but some of the stated objectives appear to be more or less important than others in this case. Mr. Strongquill has no previous criminal record and has been assessed at a low rate to re-offend. The pre-sentence report was very positive.[21]However, the sanction imposed here should denounce his unlawful conduct. It should deter other persons from committing like offences. It should provide reparation for harm done to the victims or to the community. It should promote a sense of responsibility in offenders and an acknowledgment of the harm done to the victim and to the community.[22]The next important principle for me to consider is that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.[23]I have considered a number of cases in assessing this principle. In R v Keepness, 2010 SKCA 69 (CanLII), 359 Sask R 34, Jackson J.A. discussed at some length the concept of range of sentences, in particular for manslaughter. She said the following at para. 28:28In Saskatchewan, a review of the case law bears out the statement that there is a usual range for manslaughter, involving brutality and alcohol or drugs, from four to 12 years. In Hathway, the sentencing judge, after a helpful review of the authorities, reached this same conclusion …[24]Justice Jackson then quoted at length from the decision of Allbright J. in R v Hathway, 2008 SKQB 480 (CanLII), 327 Sask R 129, including para. 36 from that decision which provides as follows:36In considering the relevant decisions of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal and various decisions of the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench which have not been subject to appeal, I have concluded that the appropriate range of sentencing for the offence of manslaughter in the Province of Saskatchewan is between four years and 12 years. There are isolated instances of sentences less than four years, and sentences greater than 12 years, however they are indeed exceptional, and in my view, a sentence falling outside of the range of four years to 12 years ought to occur only in the most unusual, exceptional or extenuating of circumstances. A distillation of the sentencing principles articulated in ss. 718, 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code, along with the circumstances of the offence and the circumstances of the offender, will result in the vast majority of instances, in a sentence falling within this range.[25]Justice Jackson indicated that she agreed with this general review of the law except for one thing. She held that it overstated “...the matter to conclude that departures from a range occur in the most unusual or exceptional circumstances only.” (para 29)[26]A review of other cases from this jurisdiction involving convictions for manslaughter follow.[27]In R v Lafontaine, 1997 SKCA (SentDig) 22, the Court of Appeal upheld a seven year sentence imposed on a 24 year old accused who fatally wounded his uncle with a shotgun while they struggled. The accused had no previous record, was intoxicated and was confronting the victim about sexual abuse issues in the family.[28]In R v Key, 2000 SKCA 127 (CanLII), 199 Sask R 239, the Court of Appeal increased a sentence for manslaughter to seven years from four years. This was in addition to credit for time in custody of about four years. The accused had a significant criminal record, containing over 40 previous offences. The court found that the stabbing death resulted from a common criminal enterprise planned well in advance and expected to be violent. One person was beaten, one was stabbed to death, and another had his door kicked down and his life threatened. This would have been equivalent to an 11 year sentence.[29]In R v Thorne, 2000 SKCA 131 (CanLII), 199 Sask R 278, the Court of Appeal increased Ms. Thorne’s sentence to five years. She was involved in the same incident as Mr. Key, supra. She had no previous criminal record, she did not participate in the actual stabbing and she had done well in custody. She was 18 years of age at the time and there was no pre-trial custody.[30]In R v Blind, 2000 SKQB 536 (CanLII), 200 Sask R 14, I sentenced Mr. Blind to seven years imprisonment after he entered a guilty plea to manslaughter. The accused had been involved in an argument in his home with others, ordered everyone to leave his house and as they were leaving, he fired a shot into their car which hit the victim, a teenage girl. The offence was out of character for the accused, he had been drinking and he had a dated unrelated record.[31]In R v Littlewolfe, 2002 SKCA 143 (CanLII), 227 Sask R 245, two brothers beat the victim using a four foot long wooden board as a weapon. Justice Tallis indicated in his judgment that “[t]he circumstances of this offence could hardly be more chilling.” (para. 3) Mr. Littlewolfe had no previous record and the Court of Appeal reduced his sentence from 10 years to 8 years. The court noted that the accused was responsive to programs made available to him while on bail. Mr. Harper’s 10 year sentence was upheld as he was the older brother, was the leader and had a previous record which included 23 previous convictions including an assault with a weapon.[32]In R v White, 2002 SKQB 104 (CanLII), 216 Sask R 218, Barclay J. sentenced a 71 year old accused with no previous criminal record to nine years imprisonment for shooting his wife. The accused was intoxicated at the time of the offence.[33]In R v Campbell, 2005 SKCA (SentDig) 13, the Court of Appeal upheld a nine year sentence imposed on a 28 year old accused who stabbed his roommate twice, causing his death while both were intoxicated. The accused called 9-1-1 immediately afterwards. Mr. Campbell had a previous record consisting of 35 previous convictions, including two threats and one assault.[34]A selection of sentencing decisions reviewed from other jurisdictions include the following:[35]In R v McDougall, 2009 MBQB 299 (CanLII), 247 Man R (2d) 147, Associate Chief Justice Joyal (as he then was) imposed a sentence of three years on an aboriginal woman with no previous criminal record who killed her husband while under the influence of alcohol. The Crown sought a five year sentence and the accused sought a conditional sentence.[36]In R v McKay, 2010 MBQB 56 (CanLII), 249 Man R (2d) 287,McKelvey J. imposed a sentence of seven years. The accused was given two for one credit for his pre-trial custody resulting in a further term of two and one-half years in custody. The Crown had sought a sentence of 10 years and the accused sought a sentence of 6 years. The victim died as a result of a single stab wound to the heart administered by the accused who was his cousin. Excessive consumption of alcohol was a factor.[37]In R v Woodcock, 2010 ONSC 3752 (CanLII), the accused, Woodcock and Barnett, were convicted of one count of manslaughter and four counts of aggravated assault. They had been in a shopping mall with a group of young men who were armed with loaded guns. They became involved in a gunfight with other men on the street which resulted in the death of a bystander and four other serious injuries. However, neither accused fired the shot that killed the deceased. The 4 years and 11 weeks spent in pre-trial custody was credited on a two for one basis (translating to a credit of eight years and five months), which left a remaining term of three years and seven months imprisonment.[38]In R v Marini, 2007 ONCA 858 (CanLII), the case involved an attempted robbery of a high-end jewelry store. The Court of Appeal affirmed the global sentence of 10 years. The accused had no criminal record and the Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was the shooter. However, the offence involved considerable planning and the accused attempted to destroy evidence after the offences.[39]In R v Dhanda, 2005 BCCA 533 (CanLII), 218 BCAC 170, the accused killed the victim by firing a pump action shot gun two times at the victim’s face from close range. The jury rejected that the accused acted in self-defence but concluded he had been provoked by the victim. There had been various confrontations in the past between the two men and on the night the victim was killed, the victim and two other people had come to the accused’s house to vandalize it. On appeal, the court affirmed the eight year sentence. The accused had a previous criminal record involving firearms.[40]As is evident from the cases referred to, there is a wide range of circumstances covered by a conviction for manslaughter. Justice Fraser, in R v. LaBerge, 1995 ABCA 196 (CanLII), 165 AR 375 stated the following at para 6:6All unlawful act manslaughter cases have two common requirements conduct which has caused the death of another; and fault short of intention to kill. However, despite these common elements, the offence of unlawful act manslaughter covers a wide range of cases extending from those which may be classified as near accident at the one extreme and near murder at the other [citations omitted]. Different degrees of moral culpability attach to each along a continuum within that spectrum. It is precisely because a sentence for manslaughter can range: from a suspended sentence up to life imprisonment that the court must determine for sentencing purposes what rung on the moral culpability ladder the offender reached when he committed the prohibited act. The purpose of this exercise is to ensure that the sentence imposed fits the degree of moral fault of the offender for the harm done.[41]A similar comment was made by McLachlin J., as she then was, in R v Creighton, 1993 CanLII 61 (SCC), [1993] 3 SCR 3. Although referencing an older version of the manslaughter provision, her point remains relevant: “[b]ecause manslaughter can occur in a wide variety of circumstances, the penalties must be flexible....[t]he point is, the sentence can be and is tailored to suit the degree of moral fault of the offender. (p. 48)CONCLUSION[42]Not surprisingly, there are no cases directly on point. However, it would appear that the joint submission is an appropriate one based on the circumstances of this case. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has consistently directed trial judges to accept joint submissions unless they are contrary to the public interest or contrary to the administration of justice. These principles have recently been affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada (R v Anthony-Cook, 2016 SCC 43 (CanLII)).I do not find the proposed sentence to offend the principles of justice and I am prepared to accept it.[43]I sentence Mr. Strongquill to 8 years with credit to be given for effectively 676.5 days in custody. Accordingly the sentence will be 6 years 51 days on a go forward basis.[44]Mr. Strongquill is prohibited from possessing any firearm, other than a prohibited firearm or restricted firearm, and any cross-bow, restricted weapon, ammunition and explosive substance during the period that begins on the day on which this order is made, and ends 10 years after his release from imprisonment; and any prohibited firearm, restricted firearm, prohibited weapon, prohibited device and prohibited ammunition for life.[45]Mr. Strongquill is required to surrender to a peace officer, a firearms officer or a chief firearms officer anything the possession of which is prohibited by my order; and every authorization, license and registration certificate relating to anything the possession of which is prohibited by my order. He shall have 30 days in which to comply with this order.[46]Mr. Strongquill has committed a primary designated offence within s. 487.04 of the Criminal Code. Pursuant to ss. 487.051(1) of the Criminal Code, I make an order in Form 5.03 authorizing the taking of the number of samples of bodily substances that is reasonably required for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis.[47]I am required to imposed a victim fine surcharge. Given the circumstances I impose a victim fine surcharge of $150.00 in default 30 days.The fine is payable forthwith and the default time is to be served concurrently with any other time being served.J.E.J.

Dennis Starr, appeals a sentence of seven years which was imposed upon him by the trial judge after his second jury trial on two charges of murder, which resulted in a single conviction for manslaughter.2The circumstances leading to the imposition of the seven-year sentence are highly unusual.BACKGROUND FACTS TO THE OFFENCE3In the early morning hours of August 21, 1994, two individuals, Bernard Cook and Darlene Weselowski, were murdered on Provincial Road 247 on the outskirts of metropolitan Winnipeg.4Weselowski was shot twice in the head with a 9mm handgun.Cook was shot in the head four times and three more times in the abdomen with the same handgun.5The accused was arrested and charged with two counts of first degree murder on November 24, 1994.He was held in the Winnipeg Remand Centre while awaiting and during his trial.He was convicted on both counts of murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment on December 12, 1995.6The accused elected not to testify on his own behalf at his 1995 trial.The Crown built a case on the theory that the accused was the “hit man” responsible for a gangland-style execution of Cook.The theory was the more real because Cook was the “enforcer” with the Warriors, an aboriginal group of men known to be involved in criminal activities.There was some bad blood between the Warriors and another group with whom the accused may have had some loose association.The theory of the Crown is that the victim Weselowski simply happened to be present and therefore had to be eliminated.7There was evidence that Cook and Weselowski were at a bar which was also frequented by the accused on the night of the executions.They all left the bar at about the same time.They proceeded to the outskirts of Winnipeg in two vehicles, one of which was to be destroyed by Cook as part of an Autopac fraud.Cook busied himself driving that vehicle in a ditch in a manner which would intentionally occasion damage.It was at this point that first Weselowski and then Cook were executed.8The evidence strongly suggested the presence of the accused at the scene of the crime.There was a hint in the evidence that one or more other persons may have been involved.9The theory of the defence at the first trial was that other persons were responsible for the two murders.10The accused appealed his convictions to the Manitoba Court of Appeal.On February 13, 1998, the convictions were upheld by a majority decision.Twaddle J.A., in dissent, would have ordered a new trial.The focus of the appeal was on two evidentiary issues and the adequacy of the charge to the jury on the subject of reasonable doubt.11The accused appealed further to the Supreme Court of Canada.There was a hearing on December 3, 1998, and a second hearing on February 24, 2000, and judgment was delivered on September 29, 2000.The majority ruled that a new trial should be ordered.12The accused was returned to the Remand Centre, where he was held pending his second trial.That second trial resulted in a single conviction for manslaughter rather than murder, and the sentence of seven years was imposed on September 7, 2001.13From the time of his first conviction until the time that a new trial was ordered by the Supreme Court of Canada, the accused was imprisoned at Stony Mountain Institution (the Institution), and he again returned to that institution to serve the sentence imposed upon him by Keyser J.14When the accused was confined to the Institution after his first trial, an intake assessment was developed, including the accused’s own version of the offence.This was recorded in early March of 1996.The accused volunteered a statement, in which he admitted his involvement in the crime, but denied primary responsibility.He stated that he had lured Cook to the isolated area on the pretext of an Autopac scam, under which Cook would be paid $500 for intentionally damaging a particular motor vehicle.The plan was to break Cook’s legs.Two other individuals were involved in the scheme, including the accused’s cousin, one Ray McCauley.When these two additional individuals appeared at the scene, it was Ray McCauley who shot Weselowski, and then Cook.15It seems self-evident that the statement influenced the jury’s decision at the second trial, which was to convict for manslaughter and only with respect to the death of Cook.16In the sentencing hearing, Keyser J. concluded that the circumstances of the crime would normally call for a sentence of 15 years for the manslaughter.Giving credit for the time spent in custody, both at the Remand Centre and at the Institution, she reduced the sentence to one of seven years, commencing as of the date of the sentencing.17In crediting the accused with eight years, the trial judge gave him credit for the time in the Remand Centre on a two-for-one basis, but no extra credit for the time served in the Institution.She calculated that he had spent one year in remand and six years in the Institution, resulting in a credit of eight years against what would normally be a 15‑year sentence.18Counsel agree that there was a miscalculation by the trial judge.The accused spent close to two years in the Remand Centre and five years in the Institution, which would result in a credit of nine years rather than eight.19On appeal, counsel for the accused argued that the trial judge relied upon facts not established by the evidence as aggravating factors which would normally justify a sentence of 15 years.I disagree.Moreover, this point was not vigorously argued at the appeal hearing.The substantial challenge to the fitness of the sentence was based upon an argument that the accused had been given insufficient credit for time served.20There is, of course, considerable jurisprudence justifying a two-for-one credit for the time spent in remand pending a trial.There have been cases where a three-for-one credit has been given, but these are the exception rather than the rule, and a two-for-one credit suggested by the trial judge in this case cannot be termed “unfit.”21The issue is whether the accused is entitled to a more generous credit than one-for-one for the five years spent in the Institution.CIRCUMSTANCES OF IMPRISONMENT IN STONYMOUNTAIN INSTITUTION22The fundamental point of Mr. Brodsky’s submission is that the accused’s five years in the Institution were served in segregated confinement of one degree or another.A comparison is drawn to the time a prisoner spends on remand.Since the accused was serving “hard time,” it is argued that his credit for pre-sentence custody should be on a higher scale than one-for-one.23That the accused was held in segregation is not disputed.The Crown’s position is that after May 7, 1996, when his segregated status changed, he could have been transferred to another institution where he would have been part of the general prison population had he taken appropriate steps to do so.24Counsel agreed that the evidence concerning his confinement had not been presented to the trial judge, and they also agreed that this court should have that information before deciding the merits of the appeal.Accordingly, Huband J.A. was commissioned to hear evidence presented by both the Crown and the accused and to make a site visit and then report findings to the panel.That report was submitted and made available to counsel on April 9, 2002, after which a further hearing took place before the panel on May 31, 2002.25I do not intend to review in detail the report of April 9th.26Initially, the accused was held in “D” range of the segregated area of the Institution.“D” range houses inmates which the Institution believes would jeopardize the security of the Institution if allowed to be present in the general population.It is not surprising that the accused was so classified.At that time, and throughout his confinement at the Institution, the accused stood as a man of violence who had executed two persons, one of them simply because she happened to be in the way.27In May of 1996, the accused’s security rating was changed to medium security, entitling him to move to “E” range, with a somewhat greater degree of freedom.For reasons which will be explained, the accused elected not to move to “E” range until March of 1997.“E” range houses prisoners whose presence in the general population would jeopardize the inmate’s own safety.28From March of 1997 onward, the accused was housed in “E” range except for two short-term transfers to “F” range, where, again, the degree of freedom was slightly greater.29There is no doubt that the circumstances of confinement are fairly harsh for inmates who are segregated from the general prison population.“D” range is the most unpleasant.The prisoner in “D” range is confined to his cell for all but one hour of exercise time (with limited exercise facilities) and time to take a shower.The cells are Spartan.There is a sliding steel door with an opening so that meals can be passed through it to the prisoner.All meals are taken in the cell.30Prisoners in the segregated ranges do not have the same degree of access to rehabilitation programs as those in the general population, and the accused showed little or no interest in those programs which were available to him.Educational upgrading was available, but the accused showed no interest.31The accused was reluctant to move to “E” range when his security rating was changed in the spring of 1996.The inmates on “E” range were there for their own protection – sex offenders and those who testified against other accused persons, or inmates like the accused, who were perceived to be at risk from other inmates because of the nature of their crimes.Prison authorities considered the accused to be at risk from members of the Warriors gang because of his involvement in the execution of Cook, and those concerns were well founded.32The move to “E” range gave the accused a greater degree of freedom.He could exercise for up to two hours both morning and afternoon.There was a greater degree of social interchange.While meals were taken in their cells, the prisoners were allowed to leave their cells to obtain their meals from a common area and return.33The accused accepted the opportunity to be employed during his incarceration, but the employment was of a menial nature.Segregated prisoners do not have the same employment opportunities that are available to the general population, although the remuneration for what they do is the same.34Prisoners in segregated custody enjoy the same visiting privileges as other inmates.There were times when visiting the accused was restricted to “booth visits” or none at all.This was because the intended visitor set off the machine that monitors illegal drugs or because of the accused’s own misconduct involving drugs within the Institution.Restrictions on visiting were not long-lasting.35When the accused was reassessed as a medium-security risk in May of 1996, he became eligible for transfer to another medium-security institution, where he would not be in danger of revenge by members of the Warriors.A transfer can be ordered by prison authorities, but in this case, the Institution was not about to force a transfer against the accused’s wishes.Moreover, the general policy of the Institution was not to transfer a prisoner while there was an appeal pending or while there were outstanding charges against the accused.In this case, there were both.Concerning his appeal to this court, there were hearings on September 10, 1997, and a continuation on November 10, 1997.It was totally unnecessary for the accused to be present at those two hearings, but no formal waiver of his right to attend was provided to prison authorities.36Having lost the appeal, the accused appealed further to the Supreme Court of Canada.There were two hearings before that court and a further wait before the court rendered a decision ordering a new trial on September 29, 2000.It is obvious that the accused’s attendance at the Supreme Court was neither required nor desired.37The real reason the accused was not transferred to another institution was the outstanding charges, which remain outstanding even to this date.The charges in question pre-dated the murder charges – possession of a prohibited weapon (The Pas) and possession of a dangerous weapon and pointing a firearm (Amaranth).In the intake assessment when he was first admitted to the Institution, the accused indicated that he planned to deal with these charges as soon as possible by pleading guilty with respect to one charge and not guilty with respect to the others.That of course did not occur.These charges were on the docket in Provincial Court in Winnipeg from the time of his incarceration in the Institution forward.Presumably, they were adjourned from time to time.There is no evidence that the accused was present in court for any of these remands.Indeed, there is positive evidence that he was not present at any of the remands, 12 in number, between February 2, 1999, and his transfer from the Institution to the Remand Centre in the fall of the year 2000.38It is clear in retrospect that the accused was not needed, but this was not made clear to the administration at the Institution.Mr. Brodsky provided a letter to the Institution on behalf of his client dated May 15, 2000, which is ambiguous in its terms.The letter confirms that Mr. Brodsky appeared before Wyant P.J. on May 10th and that the matter was remanded to August 17th and that the accused’s appearance on that date was waived.The last sentence of the letter states that a new date “likely in October will be fixed on August 17th for your next attendance.”39In spite of the ambiguity, prison authorities then became active in arranging a transfer for the accused, but the plan was not completed before the decision of the Supreme Court was handed down.40Counsel for the accused says there were good reasons why the outstanding charges were not dealt with.Whether that is so or not, the fact remains that neither the Crown nor the accused were in any hurry to deal with the matters, and in the meantime, it was known that they constituted a barrier to the transference of the accused to another institution.41It would appear that the accused could have been transferred to another facility and become part of the general prison population had he and his counsel seriously desired a transfer and then taken the necessary steps to facilitate it.However, at the end of the day, I do not think it matters greatly whether his non-transference was due to his own lack of initiative or otherwise.The fact is he remained in segregated custody of one kind or another for about five years.THE EXTENT OF THE CREDIT42There is jurisprudence to support the granting of a credit of more than one-for-one for time spent on remand; see R. v. Wust, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455, 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII).There is no such jurisprudence with respect to pre-sentence time served in the penitentiary as a sentenced prisoner.In my opinion, it would establish a dangerous precedent to enlarge the credit beyond one-for-one in this case.43It is clear that being an inmate in segregation is distinctly unpleasant.That should come as no surprise since part of the function of the sentence is punitive.44It is also clear that there are different degrees of unpleasantness.There are maximum-, medium-, and minimum-security institutions, and the prisoner’s preference would doubtless be for the minimum-security institution if a choice was to be made.Within a medium-security institution such as the Institution, it is obvious that some inmates have greater freedom of movement and greater access to programs and recreational activities than others.Low-risk inmates within the Institution may live relatively free from the usual restraints at the prison farm.45The decision of who is assigned to what prison and at what level of security is for the prison administration, not for the courts.Yet, a decision in this case to grant a more generous credit than one-for-one would make it the business of the courts.I illustrate by putting the converse of the accused’s situation.Suppose that the prison authorities, for whatever reason, decided that the accused was a candidate for the least restrictive form of custody.It surely would not be open to the Crown to argue that the accused should receive less than a one-for-one credit by reason of the relatively benign circumstances of his imprisonment.46In my view, a decision to grant a more generous credit than one-for-one could and would impact on future sentencing decisions.It is often known in advance, by the nature of the crime committed and the record of the accused, where the prisoner will likely be placed within the prison system, just as it was predictable in the present case that this accused would be confined as a segregated inmate.Where such a prediction can reasonably be made, should the courts take that into account in framing the sentence?Should the serial rapist be sentenced more leniently because much of his prison time will be as a segregated prisoner?Should a wheelchair-bound fraud artist, who poses no threat to any person and who is incapable of escape, be sentenced to a longer prison term because of the certain knowledge that his confinement will be under light security and with full privileges?I answer these rhetorical questions with an emphatic “No.”Nor should the courts participate in a retroactive way, making these determinations as we are asked to do by the accused in the present case.47There are two areas where a parallel can be drawn with pre-sentence custody spent on remand, and those relate to the determination of the date on which an inmate is eligible to apply for parole and, secondly, the date on which there is automatic remission of the sentence after two-thirds of it has been served.48Concerning eligibility to apply for parole, the accused argues that had he received a 15-year sentence when he was first convicted in 1995, he would be eligible to apply for parole today.The sentence imposed in September of 2001 automatically means that he is not eligible to apply for parole until at least a part of that sentence has run.However, eligibility to apply for parole is by no means a guarantee that parole would be granted.To accede to the accused’s argument would be for the courts to assume responsibility for either granting or withholding parole.That is the function of those responsible for administering the parole system, rather than the courts.49Concerning automatic remission, if the accused had been sentenced to 15 years after his first trial on December 12, 1995, he would likely have had the benefit of automatic remission at the end of the year 2005.A sentence of six years imposed as of September 7, 2001, means that he would reach the point where automatic remission would apply at approximately the same date.50As a consequence, considerations of parole are not a factor which should alter the one-for-one credit.51I would allow the appeal only to the extent of providing a two-for-one credit for the time spent on remand, and I would therefore reduce the sentence imposed, effective September 7, 2001, to one of six years’ imprisonment.______________________________ J.A.I agree:______________________________ J.A.I agree:______________________________ J.A."}

Kakekagamick, 2006 CanLII 28549 (ON CA), 211 C.C.C. (3d) 289, in accordance with s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code.Counsel for Mr. Eno indicated on the record that he was specifically waiving Mr. Eno’s rights under the Gladue decision in this particular case.[8]The maximum sentence of imprisonment for Mr. Eno, pursuant to section 255(1) (b) of the Criminal Code of Canada is five years imprisonment.Section 259 (1) (c) of the Criminal Code of Canada mandates that I prohibit Mr. Eno from driving no less than three years plus any of the time that Mr. Eno is sentenced to imprisonment. There is no upper limit on the driving prohibition.[9]I have read with interest the decision of my brother, Justice Kukurin, in the case of R. v. Noel, 2005 ONCJ 492 (CanLII).Justice Kukurin has set out a detailed analysis of the law with respect to sentencing offenders with multiple prior drinking and driving convictions.I adopt his reasons for decision in this case.[10]I agree with Justice Kukurin that the themes that pervade the decisions on sentencing in drinking and driving cases are as follows:“1) Deterrence and denunciation are key objectives;2)Imprisonment is almost invariable for third or subsequent offences;3)For offenders with multiple, that is approaching ten, drinking/driving related offences, with poor evidence of addressing the drinking problem, sentences exceed two years;4)Sentences for offences arising out of the same transaction or incident need not be concurrent, but may be consecutive particularly where different public interests are tied to the offences;5)Convictions for additional offences may result in additional imprisonment subject to the totality principle;6)Appellate courts appear to be harsh in their attitude towards sentencing when the offender has reached a point where s/he hasn’t learned despite many chances, and the odds on rehabilitation are poor;7)The courts are sensitive to the public demand for intolerance by our justice system to drinking/driving behaviour and to the importance of the public's perception of and approval of sentencing practices.”[11]In the present case, I would have no difficulty in according to the Crown's submissions for a four year penitentiary term for Mr. Eno, if his conviction had taken place on or about 1996.Mr. Eno's case, then it would have fit within the principles set out in the Ontario Court of Appeal’s decisions which are referred to in the case of R. v. Noel, supra.The challenge for me in the present case is to balance those decisions with the principle of proportionality, the gap principle, and the step principle.[12]The evidence before me at Mr. Eno's trial was to the effect that Mr. Eno was stopped in a RIDE program.It is true that he rolled through the RIDE program and the officers had to yell at him to stop, which he did.Mr. Eno refused to blow into the Approved Screening device, because he had knowledge that he had consumed alcohol, which was in contravention of his G1 license.The police officers, I find, treated Mr. Eno fairly and appropriately.They charged Mr. Eno with refusing to provide a suitable sample of his breath for analysis into an Approved Screening Device and released him immediately on his undertaking to appear.The police officers did not charge Mr. Eno with impaired driving, because they did not feel that there were reasonable and probable grounds to charge him with this offence.There was no evidence of bad driving by Mr. Eno.[13]On the issue of rehabilitation, I must take into consideration the fact that Mr. Eno had no Criminal Code convictions between 1995 and January of 2007.Although Mr. Eno is an admitted alcoholic, and clearly was drinking and driving on December 18th, 2005, Mr. Eno was successful in rehabilitating himself to the extent that he had no convictions during this twelve year period.[14]I am mindful of the fact that Mr. Eno has been sentenced in the past to reformatory terms of imprisonment.One sentence was six months in duration, and another was seven and a half months.[15]In the present case, I acknowledge that there is no way short of imprisonment to achieve the objectives of denunciation and deterrence with respect to Mr. Eno.I am, however, persuaded by the submissions of counsel for Mr. Eno that a two-year sentence is appropriate in all of the circumstances.I am advised that Mr. Eno has spent 120 days in Pre-sentence custody and I will give him credit on a two-for-one basis for that time in jail, which is equivalent to 240 days or eight months in prison.Under the circumstances, I am imposing a sentence of 16 months in jail for Mr. Eno.In addition, I am prohibiting Mr. Eno from driving anywhere in Canada for the rest of his life.I am waiving the victim fine surcharge with respect to this matter.Released:March 8th, 2007________________________________________The Honourable Mr. Justice G.

Gauthier, [1996] B.C.J. No. 1469 (QL), 108 C.C.C. (3d 231 (C.A.)).[3]Monkman was identified by independent witnesses at the scene as the person who actually stabbed Ming Hong Huynh (“Huynh”) four times.Counsel for Monkman, in his address to the jury, conceded as much and asked for a manslaughter conviction only.The jury, however, found the killing to be intentional.Aside from independent witnesses at the scene, the crown’s main witness was Danny Simao (“Simao”), the cousin of Tavares.For many reasons that I outlined in the charge to the jury, I cautioned that it would be dangerous to rely on Simao’s evidence without confirmation in some way, but that the jury was free to accept some, all or none of it if it so chose.[4]Because of the convictions for manslaughter of Tavares and Ponce on which I will comment later in greater detail, the jury must have relied on at least some of Simao’s testimony, most notably the conversation in the car that Simao said took place on the way from the Freehouse lounge to Club Desire.Simao said that both Tavares and Ponce were saying, “We’re going to fix you up” or words to that effect.Monkman had a knife in the back seat that he showed to Simao and then said, “I’m going to juck him” or similar words, which Simao took to mean “stab”.Within a very short time after arriving at Club Desire, Monkman was seen by several witnesses in possession of a knife and having inflicted four stab wounds to Huynh.[5]Simao testified that before the group left the Freehouse a phone call had been received by Tavares to the effect that, “Buddy’s at the rave.”Although Simao conceded that “rave” was his term and not used by anyone else, he said he was told that this was the person who had stabbed his cousin some time before.Medical records (ex. 25) showed that Tavares had in fact received a stab wound the previous month, although he provided an innocent explanation for the wound to medical personnel.The defence argued that no connection had been made between Huynh and any of the accused, but a reasonable inference may be drawn that Huynh either was the person who had stabbed Tavares or at least was believed by the three accused to be the person who had inflicted the wound.[6]This inference is bolstered by the observations of some of the witnesses at the scene. Michael Embury testified that Monkman was laughing as he got back in the SUV.Anthony Raposo, working security at Club Desire, did not hear any laughing, but described Monkman as cheering himself on and saying “I fucking got him.”James Wakefield testified that Monkman was performing a celebratory touchdown dance before he got into the SUV.This demeanour closely mirrors the evidence of Simao that, when Monkman returned to the car after the stabbing, he said, “I fucking got him.”[7]In my view, therefore, the jury put weight on Simao’s testimony as to the conversation in the SUV.Although the jury was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing of Huynh was both planned and deliberate so as to make it first degree murder, the evidence the jury must have accepted was that there was at least some indicia of planning before the confrontation.[8]For Tavares and Ponce to be found guilty of manslaughter, the jury first had to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that they knew Monkman intended to cause bodily harm, but did not know it was likely to cause death, even though death ensued.Both had the same opportunity to observe and hear from the front seat what was transpiring in the back seat, and the same information was available to them.The jury, in my view, had to rely on Simao regarding the comments made by Tavares and Ponce in the car, the comments of Monkman about “jucking” someone and knowledge of the knife by both Tavares and Ponce in order to find that they knew Monkman intended to cause bodily harm to someone at Club Desire.[9]The jury further had to find that, with that knowledge, Tavares and Ponce either aided and/or abetted Monkman.I am satisfied that the jury relied on the words spoken by Tavares and Ponce in the SUV on the way to Club Desire.These comments must have been considered by the jury to be words of encouragement to Monkman to cause the bodily harm and that, by so doing, they intended those words to be encouraging of Monkman’s actions.Their words were uttered with the intention that Monkman be encouraged to cause bodily harm.When Huynh died as a result of Monkman’s actions and the encouragement of Tavares and Ponce, they were guilty of manslaughter as abettors.[10]In addition to that, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Tavares drove the vehicle to Club Desire with the intention of aiding Monkman to cause bodily harm.Simao testified that Tavares was the driver of the vehicle.No one other than Simao identified Tavares as being at Club Desire at all.However, the four of them left the Freehouse only minutes before the confrontation, as verified by the video at the Freehouse.Also, a witness at the scene phoned 911 with a licence plate of the suspect SUV being FLO 159.This plate did not exist, but when substituted with commonly mistaken letters, plate ELD 159 came up.This was a 2006 Lincoln Navigator, rented April 26, 2006, by Andrea Melnyk and John Dacamera.Tavares was present when the vehicle was rented.It was found some days later in a chop shop in Selkirk, with Monkman’s blood in the back seat.There is no doubt that this was the vehicle in which all the accused and Simao drove to Club Desire and fled after the stabbing.[11]I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Tavares knew Monkman intended to cause bodily harm to someone at Club Desire and that he drove him to and away from the scene with the intention of assisting Monkman.This is particularly so when the words of encouragement to Monkman by Tavares have apparently been accepted by the jury.[12]The Crown contended that Ponce was also guilty of aiding Monkman.Their position was that Ponce acted as a distraction to Huynh so as to enable Monkman to sneak up on him and inflict the fatal blows.Simao’s evidence as to what Ponce did at the scene was unreliable and contradicted by all the independent witnesses.Simao described a confrontation between Tavares and Ponce on the one hand, and Huynh on the other hand, on the steps of Club Desire.The confrontation did not occur on the steps – there was no blood found there at all.Huynh had cocaine and marijuana in his system and an extremely high blood alcohol content of .31.His shirt was off, as was usual for him when he wanted to fight, according to his girlfriend Angela Pfeiffer.None of the independent witnesses saw any physical contact between Ponce and Huynh.Jared Lehotsky, who could not identify Ponce, said Huynh and a smaller man were facing each other with their hands down and fists clenched.Michael Laurin agreed there was no physical contact between the two men and that Ponce was not taking an aggressive stance.Anthony Raposo testified that Huynh and the smaller man were angry and facing each other. He was going to intervene when a man he identified as Monkman told him to back off.He confirmed that the smaller man was retreating, and Huynh was advancing aggressively.[13]Jeanine Brouillette initially noticed a smaller guy on the corner motioning for Huynh to come on.This was not mentioned in her statement to police and, on cross-examination, she admitted she could not recall if he made gestures.She confirmed that the smaller Asian guy never took one step toward Huynh and never threw a punch at him.On direct, she commented that he appeared to be leading Huynh.Again, that term was not used in her conversations with the police.Dee Dee Griffiths described Huynh and the smaller guy as yelling at and goading each other.I did not find Dee Dee Griffiths to be a reliable witness.She was confrontational with defence counsel and seemed to be enjoying a verbal joust with them rather than trying to actually say what she saw.Heather Mousley used the term “circling” to describe the motions made by the smaller man and Huynh.Shayne Lewis said both were “jawing,” but that there was no contact.Finally, James Wakefield said he saw two Asians circling, but no blows were exchanged.[14]I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Ponce acted deliberately to distract Huynh as opposed to having been caught up in Huynh’s aggression that evening.Huynh had been aggressive and confrontational with other people before the fatal encounter with Monkman.There was also no evidence from Simao or anyone else that any conversation had taken place about Ponce trying to act as a distraction to assist Monkman to sneak up on Huynh.In the absence of that, I am not prepared to find that the actions of Ponce at the scene were only consistent with aiding Monkman.[15]Therefore, I am satisfied, on the evidence the jury had to accept and the evidence I find to be proven, that Tavares was guilty of manslaughter by both aiding and abetting Monkman in his actions and that Ponce was guilty of manslaughter only by abetting Monkman.Monkman[16]Because Monkman was convicted of second degree murder, the automatic sentence is one of life imprisonment.The Crown has recommended that there be no eligibility for parole before 15 years, whereas defence counsel has requested the minimum statutory term of life with no parole for 10 years.The jury declined to make a recommendation when asked if they wished to do so.The victim impact statement supplied by Huynh’s sister is heartrending and sets out the loss that his family feels as a consequence of his death.His sister described how their parents left Vietnam during wartime and escaped with only the clothes on their backs in order to give their children a better life.She talked about how her brother Ming would never have the opportunity now to get married and have a family or to be an uncle to her children.And she described the emotional and physical toll his death had caused her personally.It is important never to forget the profound effect the loss of a family member to violence causes to those left behind.[17]The criminal record of Monkman was filed as Exhibit S2 during sentencing submissions.It reflects that he has twice been incarcerated in a federal penitentiary, once in 1991 for property offences and once in 1997 for robberies.There is violence on his record and, at the time of the commission of this murder, he was on probation for an offence involving domestic violence.[18]Monkman is of aboriginal background, but counsel advised that no Gladue report was being requested.I was told that Monkman does not appear to have suffered from any of the classic systemic disadvantages of many people with his background.His parents were both professionals who raised their children to be good citizens.Of nine siblings, he is the only one who has ever been in trouble with the law.He candidly described himself as the black sheep of the family.[19]As defence counsel pointed out, Monkman will receive a sentence of life imprisonment for his conviction.Even with the minimum period of 10 years to serve before being eligible for parole, there is no guarantee that he will in fact be granted parole after 10 years without showing that he is ready to be put back into society.Nonetheless, the Code sets out the ability of a sentencing judge to raise the eligibility period to up to 25 years.The closer the offence is to first degree murder or the more aggravating the circumstances of the murder, the more likely that the minimum period will be raised.[20]I accept that Monkman is genuinely remorseful for having taken Huynh’s life.However, there are aggravating elements present in this case.These involve:(i)a certain amount of planning or deliberation in his actions;(ii)use of a knife to inflict four wounds to Huynh, three of which were potentially lethal;(iii)attacking Huynh when the latter was extremely intoxicated and not expecting the assault by Monkman;(iv)his jubilant reaction after having inflicted the wounds to Huynh;(v)his prior criminal record for violence; and(vi)the fact that he was on probation for violence at the time of the commission of this offence.[21]Given the criminal antecedents of Monkman, particularly for violence, and the elements of planning that are present in this case, I am of the view that the appropriate disposition for Monkman is one of life imprisonment with no parole for a period of 12 years.Tavares[22]Tavares comes before the court as an individual with a criminal record as well.It was filed as Exhibit S3 during sentencing submissions.Tavares received a sentence of 32 months in November 2002 for charges of assault, assault with a weapon, uttering threats and failure to comply. Then, two months later, he received four years consecutive for possession of crack cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.The first set of convictions was related to disturbing actions of violently confronting people who had outstanding drug debts.Tavares acted as “muscle” to enforce those debts, and both threatened and assaulted several individuals.The disturbing particulars of those circumstances no doubt explain the significant penitentiary sentence handed out to a person with no prior criminal record.Despite having been sentenced to an effective sentence of more than six and one-half years after the second conviction, he received day parole in July 2004.Tavares had been on day parole for 21 months at the time of this involvement.[23]The Crown has requested a sentence of ten years, less credit for some of the time he has been in custody.Tavares was arrested in May 2007, and his parole was revoked.His original sentence lapsed in February 2009, at which point he was transferred to the Winnipeg Remand Centre.The Crown has submitted that Tavares receive 1.5 to one credit for time served from February 24, 2009, to the date of sentencing, for an approximate credit of 18 months, but that he should receive no credit for time served between his arrest in 2007 and February 2009.Defence counsel has requested a sentence of three to five years, less time served.They are requesting credit of one for one from May 2007 to February 2009 and two for one after, which would equate to a period of 45 months’ credit for time served.[24]The Crown provided no case law to support the position that Tavares should receive ten years’ incarceration for his involvement.Defence counsel filed several cases, none of which are particularly on point with the facts of this case.There are few precedents for people who are convicted as abettors and/or aiders rather than for having personally inflicted the fatal blows.That makes sentencing for manslaughter, already one of the most difficult crimes for which to sentence, even more so.In R. v. Hermiz, [2007] O.J. No. 1589 (QL) (S.C.J.)), Hill J. of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice made reference to a number of appellate decisions that had commented on the broad range of sentences available for manslaughter.These include:-R. v. Clarke, 2003 CanLII 28199 (ON CA), [2003] O.J. No. 1966 (QL) (Ont. C.A.) at ¶7:“The range of sentence for the offence of manslaughter can vary immensely.”-R. v. C.C., 2003 MBCA 51 (CanLII) at ¶7:“The sentencing options available to a sentencing court for this offence are like no other.”-R. v. Dasilva, [1988] B.C.J. No. 1744 (QL) (C.A.) at ¶2:“It is clear enough that sentences for manslaughter vary from a suspended sentence to sentences of life imprisonment.”-R. v. E.H., 2005 BCCA 3 (CanLII), [2005] B.C.J. No. 4 (QL), 192 C.C.C. (3d) 366 (C.A.), at ¶20:“... the well-established spectrum of culpability in manslaughter cases ranging from ‘near accident’ to ‘near murder’...”.[25]In R. v. Henry, 2002 NSCA 33 (CanLii) (CanLII) at ¶19, Roscoe J.A., writing for the court, said that, “a significant distinguishing factor between cases where a low or non-penitentiary term is appropriate and those where a lengthy sentence is imposed for manslaughter is the moral blameworthiness or fault of the offender.”There is a lot of discretionary room between the two extremes of the spectrum.[26]Section 718 of the Criminal Code sets out the following purpose and principles of sentencing:718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.[27]Tavares is 30 years of age and has a grade 11 education.He has an 11-year-old daughter and a mother battling cancer.Defence counsel tried to propose that Tavares was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time and that there was no plan to hurt Huynh.However, this is not consistent with the findings of the jury.[28]There is little to be said in mitigation for Tavares, other than his relative youth and personal circumstances.Although he did not personally attack Huynh, he has been found to have both encouraged and assisted Monkman in the killing.There are a number of aggravating factors for Tavares:(i)his assistance and encouragement of Mr. Monkman contributed significantly to the violence that befell Huynh;(ii)the assistance and encouragement were not impulsive, spontaneous acts, but in fact took some time;(iii)Tavares has a recent criminal record for serious violence; and(iv)he was on parole for those violent offences at the time of the commission of this offence.Thus, in my view, Tavares has a high degree of moral culpability for the death of Huynh.He is disentitled to leniency as a result of all those factors.[29]Tavares will be sentenced to seven years for this manslaughter.He will receive no credit for the time between May 2007 and February 2009, as that period is attributable to time remaining on his original drug and assault charges once parole was revoked.From February 2009 on, he would not be disentitled to credit for roughly two for one.I am giving him credit for two years’ time already served.Therefore, the effective sentence from today’s date will be one of five years’ incarceration.Ponce[30]Ponce comes before the court for sentencing with no criminal record whatsoever.I found that he was guilty of encouraging Monkman, but not assisting him at the scene.In the case of Ponce, rehabilitation is more important than with respect to Monkman or Tavares.I was advised that Ponce had spent 11 months in pre-trial detention.Similarly, he has been in custody since the jury rendered its verdict, and he will receive credit for two years of time served.The Crown and defence are in agreement that two for one credit for time served is appropriate under the circumstances.The Crown has requested that he receive seven years, less time served, while defence has suggested three years less time served.[31]There are more mitigating factors available in the case of Ponce:(i)he is relatively young and in a stable relationship of 11 years with two children, nine and three, and a wife in a professional faculty at the University of Manitoba;(ii)after spending 11 months in pre-trial detention, he received judicial interim release and spent a lengthy time out on strict bail conditions with no breaches;(iii)he has strong community support;(iv)he was the least involved of all the accused; and(v)he has no prior criminal record.Ponce has good prospects for rehabilitation.Nonetheless, he was involved in encouraging Monkman to harm Huynh, which resulted in Huynh’s death.This was not a spontaneous act, but one with a certain amount of planning.Thus, although he was less involved than Monkman or Tavares, his moral culpability remains relatively high.[32]In my view, the appropriate sentence for Ponce is four years’ incarceration less time served, for an effective sentence as of today of two years.[33]Lastly, the following orders will be made with respect to all accused:(i)weapons prohibition orders pursuant to s. 109(2)(a) of the Code for 10 years and s. 109(2)(b) for life;(ii)s. 487.051 order pursuant to the Code for the taking of such samples of bodily substances as may be required for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis; and(iii)no victim impact surcharges will be imposed given the periods of imprisonment that have been imposed.J."}

MorinDate: 1983-04-20Docket: 78Between:R.andMorinMaher, J.Counsel:D. Albert Lavoie, for the Crown;David Kaiser, for the accused.[1]MAHER, J. [Orally]: I am prepared to render judgment in the matter that was raised and impose sentence in the[2]On Monday last the accused Ivan Joseph Morin was arraigned on an indictment containing two counts. They read as follows:\"THAT on or about the 18th day of May, A.D. 1982, at the City of Saskatoon, in the Province of Saskatchewan, he …\" Ivan Joseph Morin, \"… did attempt to murder William F. Simpson, a peace officer, by shooting at him with a firearm, contrary to s. 222 of the Criminal Code;\"Count number two,\"THAT on or about the 18th day of May, A.D. 1982, at the City of Saskatoon, in the Province of Saskatchewan,…\" the said Ivan Joseph Morin, \"… did use a firearm, to wit, a pistol, while committing an indictable offence, contrary to s. 83(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.\"[3]Following the arraignment the Crown provided particulars of the use of the firearm. They were that the firearm was used in the commission of the offence of attempted murder as contained in count number one of the indictment.[4]Upon arraignment the accused entered pleas of guilty, Counsel on behalf of the accused spoke to sentence and the matter was adjourned until today for the imposition of sentence. I do not propose to review in detail the facts which were agreed to and put before the court by counsel.[5]The accused on May eighteenth, 1982, accompanied by one Agecoutay, robbed a Safeway Store at Confederation Park in the City of Saskatoon; Agecoutay using a revolver and the accused a knife.[6]They left the store with some ten thousand dollars in cash and took the Assistant Manager David Cheke as hostage. They also commandeered Mr. Cheke's car and a chase throughout various parts of the City followed during which shots were fired at a pursuing police car by Agecoutay. Mr. Cheke's car was demolished and a police car was commandeered in its place. They finally entered the Huskey House on Idylwyld Square in the City, still using Cheke as a hostage, where a woman and two police officers were also taken hostage. Some hours later the accused voluntarily surrendered and Agecoutay also surrendered some time later and the hostages were unharmed.[7]On September twenty-first, 1982, following pleas of guilty to four charges, the accused was sentenced to a total term of eight years imprisonment in a Federal Penitentiary. The charges and the sentences imposed were as follows: Count number one, armed robbery, six years. Count number two, kidnapping the Assistant Manager Cheke, six years concurrent to count number one. Count number three, unlawful confinement of one Marina Patricia Sweeney, two years consecutive to count number one. And count number four, the unlawful confinement of Gary Lund, a police officer, the sentence was two years concurrent to count number one.[8]Other facts that must be taken into consideration before imposing sentence include the record of the accused and the sentence imposed on his accomplice Agecoutay on the same charges. And finally there is a question of law which was argued on Monday with respect to count number two, namely the effect of the Chapter of Rights and Freedoms on the state of the law as it existed prior to its proclamation.[9]Dealing first with the facts, the record of the accused is extensive. He is now only twenty-three years of age, will be twenty-four in less than two months, and he has been in almost continuous trouble with the law since he ceased to be a juvenile in 1975. Prior to that he was institutionalized from the age of eleven, spending most of his life from age seven when his mother died in foster homes. On some thirty convictions since he became an adult, mainly for breaking and entering, theft and possession of stolen property, he has had custodial sentences imposed on him that range from fourteen days to two years. As his Counsel points out, almost all his adult life has been spent in prison. He has taken advantage of programs available in prison and has managed to obtain his grade twelve education.[10]While it was not referred to in detail, Agecoutay apparently had a far more serious record of previous conviction than this accused with a number involving the use of offensive weapons. Following the hostage taking Agecoutay pleaded guilty to seven charges that included armed robbery, kidnapping, attempted murder, three counts of unlawful confinement and one count of using a firearm while committing an indictable offence. He was sentenced to a total of eighteen years imprisonment. To the same counts to which Morin has pleaded guilty before this court, Agecoutay was sentenced to eighteen years for attempted murder and two years consecutive on the charge of using a firearm while committing an indictable offence.[11]I believe this to be a sufficient review of the facts and I have, I turn now to the question of law that was argued before the court on Monday.[12]It relates to count number two and as I mentioned previously the effect if any of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms on the interpretation of s. 83(1) (a) of the Criminal Code.[13]Section 83.(1)(a), that is the provisions that are relevant to this charge, reads as follows:\"Every one who uses a firearm(a) while committing or attempting to commit an indictable offence, …\" \"… whether or not he causes or means to cause bodily harm to any person as a result thereof, is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment.(c) in the case of a first offence under this subsection,…\" \"… for not more than fourteen years and not less than one year;\"Subsection two provides:A sentence imposed on a person for an offence under subsec. (1) shall be served consecutively to any other punishment imposed on him for an offence arising out of the same event or series of events and to any other sentence to which he is subject at the time the sentence is imposed on him for an offence under subsec. (1).[14]This section was proclaimed in force January first, 1978. Its interpretation has been considered by a number of the courts of this country culminating in the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in McGuigan v. The Queen (1982), 1982 CanLII 41 (SCC), 40 N.R. 499; 66 C.C.C.(2d) 97. Therein the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada, five out of seven of the presiding judges, concluded that, in enacting the section, it was the clear intention of Parliament to depart from the principle, the fundamental principle that an accused should not be punished twice for the same matter. Dickson, J.A., speaking on behalf of the majority of the court said at page 124.\"In my view, Parliament has in the enactment of s. 83 departed from the fundamental common law principle of the criminal law that nemo debet bis puniri pro uno delicto, elaborated in Kienapple, and has shown that the use of a firearm in the commission of the offence of robbery shall also constitute a separate and distinct offence under s. 83 for which a separate and additional …\" \"… punishment shall be imposed.\"He went on:… When Parliament turned its attention to s. 83 it is obvious from the language used that Parliament was concerned with 'use', not innocent possession, and concerned with 'firearms', not knives or toy pistols. Parliament clearly contemplated that when in the course of a robbery a firearm is used, multiple prosecutions and multiple convictions would follow and would supplant the common law principle expressed in Kienapple and in Cox and Paton v. The Queen,…He concluded:If Parliament had intended to exclude from the meaning of the words 'an indictable offence' in s. 83(l)(a) any criminal offence an essential element of which is the having of a firearm, it could have made its meaning clear through apt words, or it could have simply re-enacted the former s. 122, which had been judicially interpreted restrictively, as the new s. 83. Parliament did neither.[15]In dissent Laskin, the Chief Justice, Ritchie concurring, concluded in the MoGuigan case that where the involvement of a firearm is the essential element of the offence, and in that case robbery, and the circumstances show that the accused used the weapon, it would be the height of technicality or formalism to say that the accused is also rendered liable to conviction under s. 83(1) simply because the use of a firearm is not an essential element of the offence of robbery.[16]The minority said in effect that the statement of an offence in the terms of the Criminal Code cannot be disassociated from the circumstances affecting the accused or his conduct so as to expose him to an additional liability for that conduct unless the additional liability is clearly assigned. This was the state of the law as of April seventeenth, 1982, and I am of course bound by the majority decision of the Supreme Court.[17]On April eighteenth, 1982, the Charter of Rights and Freedoms was proclaimed and became part of the law of Canada. The section we are concerned with is s. 11 and the relevant portions read as follows:11. Any person charged with an offence has the right(h) … if finally found guilty and punished for the offence, not to be tried or punished for it again;[18]The question is whether the introduction of the Charter alters the interpretation that was given to s. 83 or affects it in any way.[19]With the assistance of Counsel, I am satisfied that there is only one reported decision on the question and it deals with the specific point. While I do not have the full reasons for judgment, I was able to locate a more detailed report of the decision in (1983), 2, Charter of Rights Decisions, 725.250.02. The name of the case is R. v. Krug.[20]The accused in that case attempted to recover an automobile which had been seized by a finance company. He went to the office of the towing company that had seized the car taking a rifle with him after stating he would shoot anyone that got in his way. He knocked at the door and when an employee responded, he pointed the rifle and ordered the employee to open the door. The police arrived and found the rifle with one shell in the chamber and three more in the clip. The accused was charged with attempted robbery, possession of a firearm for purpose dangerous to the public, pointing a firearm, and the same offence with which this accused stands charged; the use of a firearm while committing an indictable offence contrary to s. 83.[21]Vannini, County Court Judge, dismissed the charge of possession of a firearm for a purpose dangerous to the public on the ground that the purpose of the possession was to commit the robbery and the principles of Kienapple foreclosed a finding of guilt on that charge when there was a finding of guilt on the charge of attempted robbery. But in addition to committing the accused of attempted robbery, His Honour Judge Vannini also found the accused guilty of pointing a firearm and the offence under s. 83. His comments with respect to the Charter as found in the report available to me are as follows:Because s. 11(h) of the Charter is expressly and specifically referrable to 'the offence' of which a person has been acquitted or for which a person has been found guilty and punished, it applies only if the offences involved are identical in that they contain the same elements and constitute one and the same offence arising out of the same set of circumstances. Because the offence of using a firearm in the commission of an offence of attempting to steal while armed therewith constitutes a separate and distinct offence under s. 83(1)(a) for which a separate and additional punishment shall be imposed by a term of imprisonment and does not have the same elements and does not constitute one and the same offence as the offence of attempting to steal while armed therewith of which the accused has been found guilty, s. 11(h) of the Charter does not preclude a finding of guilt being made for the offence under s. 83(1)(a) and an additional punishment being imposed in respect thereof.[22]With this finding I am in agreement. The argument that the lack of an essential element is not sufficient to warrant conviction for a second offence was rejected by the Supreme Court of Canada, that is the majority of the court, in R. v. McGuigan and in my view the specific wording of the Charter does not have the effect of altering the law as it existed prior to April eighteenth, 1982, with respect to s. 83.[23]Applying the findings to the present case, the shooting of the firearm by Agecoutay is only one element of the offence of attempted murder. There are a number of other elements that are required to establish that offence and accordingly conviction under s. 83 is not precluded by the Charter.[24]I turn now to the record of the sentences previously imposed which I have and also to the judgment of my Brother Wimmer in September, 1982. I am satisfied that Mr. Justice Wimmer considered all the facts and circumstances that led to the charge of attempted murder even though that charge is not specifically before him. He had available to him the record of the accused and the punishment imposed on Agecoutay for the same offences. It is not my intention to add to the maximum punishment that Mr. Justice Wimmer imposed. I will also take into consideration the time served from September, 1982, to this date as the trial on these charges could not proceed because of the court calender and not through any fault of the accused.[25]Would you stand up, please Mr. Morin. On count number one, the charge of attempted murder, you will be sentenced to a term of imprisonment in the Federal Penitentiary of seven and one half years, such sentence to run concurrent to any sentence you are presently serving. On count number two, the charge of using a firearm while committing an indictable offence, you will be sentenced to a term of one year imprisonment and that sentence shall be served consecutively to any other punishment imposed on you for an offence arising out of the same events or series of events and to any other sentence to which you are subject as of this date.[26]There will be a further order that I am required to make even though one is already in place and that is that you will be prohibited from having in your possession any firearm, ammunition, or explosive substance for a period of five years from the date of your release from incarceration.[27]Is there anything further you wish to say, Mr. Morin?MR. MORIN: No.THE COURT: All right, Gentlemen, that will be the sentence imposed on the two charges.Order accordingly."}

Tomlinson, for the DefenceDefendant))))HEARD:October12, 2016REASONS FOR SENTENCEBielby J.Overview[1]On July 27, 2016, I convicted the offender, Faith Chinwendu Uzondu, of, on June 9, 2015, having heroin in her possession for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. Three other charges were dismissed.[2]A sentencing hearing was conducted on October 12, 2016.The Facts[3]In June, 2015, a package was intercepted by Canada Border Services and was found to contain 486 grams of heroin. The package was made up of a number of wooden dowels which were covered by bangles. The heroin was inserted into the dowels.[4]The RCMP was notified and a controlled delivery was organized. On its face, the package was to be delivered to a Samuel John. It was to be delivered by TNT Delivery.[5]On July 8, 2015 the offender called TNT and said she was the wife of Samuel John and provided her home address for the delivery of the package. The package was delivered to the address on July 9, 2015. The offender was not home so as pre-arranged by the offender, a second floor tenant signed for the package and left it on the stairs leading down to the offender’s apartment.[6]Shortly thereafter the offender returned home and discovered the package. She then called a person by the name of Dan who had arranged for her participation in the delivery of the package. She was advised by Dan that someone else would attend at her home and take possession of the package.[7]The offender hid the package behind the furnace. Subsequently the police exercised a warrant and entered the premises. The package was located and the offender arrested.[8]The offender was to be paid $700 for her role.[9]The expert report of RCMP Officer Corcoran was admitted on consent and therein the officer opined that the amount seized was possessed for the purpose of trafficking. This opinion was not challenged.Circumstances of the Offender[10]The offender has been in custody since July 9, 2015. She has resided in Canada since 2011, entering the country from Nigeria on a student visa. She left two children in Nigeria in the care of her mother who was financing the offender’s trip to Canada for the purposes of a higher education.[11]The offender studied for one year at Durham College in Oshawa but then dropped out of school. The offender’s visa expired in 2012 which resulted in the offender making a refugee claim. She remained in Oshawa for a while but soon relocated in Toronto to live with her boyfriend.[12]The offender got involved in fraudulent internet schemes which involved wire transfers and the collection of cheques. Her activities also involved the use and transfer of fraudulent credit cards and passports.[13]In 2014, the offender was introduced to Dan and continued, with him, to participate in fraudulent activities. She would collect monies obtained through fraud and deposit the funds in accounts in her name. She would then withdraw the monies and pay them to Dan.[14]The offender testified that a portion of the monies she earned was sent back to Nigeria to help support her children. Counsel for the offender argues that the offender, shortly after her arrival in Canada, was vulnerable and was taken advantage of by other individuals who used her for their illegal purposes.[15]While this may be true to some extent, from the text messages received and the offender’s testimony the offender seemed to be a willing participant.[16]In her pre-sentence report the offender denies responsibility and knowledge of the heroin. It is suggested therein that she is remorseful for the criminality in which she voluntarily participated.[17]In her statement to the police the offender was very misleading, however, defense counsel submits that the lies did not cause the police to conduct a useless investigation and ultimately the offender told the police about Dan.[18]Further, it is submitted that when the offender was in actual possession of the package there was only a very small amount of heroin contained therein as most of it had been removed by the police. The amount left in the package was about 5.5 grams.Impact on the Victim and/or Community[19]The impact of illegal drugs on the community needs no real explanation.It continues to tear at the social fabric of our nation. The cost of the damage done is horrendous. The costs are both in money and lives.[20]Heroin is one of the hardest of drugs and one of the most addictive. Generally, for sentencing purposes the possession of heroin results in longer sentences than those imposed with respect to the other types of controlled substances.[21]From the judgement of the Court of Appeal, in R. v. Pannu 2015 ONCA 677 (CanLII), para. 184, and in reference to the trial judge, I quote, “He also pointed out the highly addictive nature of the heroin, its promotion of other crimes to sustain it users’ habits and its ruination of lives and families.”Legal Parameters[22]Section 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act provides for a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for the possession of a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking. The possibility of life imprisonment is an indication of the very serious nature of the offence for which the offender was convicted.Positions of Crown and Defence[23]The Crown seeks a sentence of five years. The Crown submits that the range of sentencing for a first offender in possession of .5 to 1 kilogram of heroin is six to 12 years. The Crown also requests the offender be ordered to provide a DNA sample which request was unopposed by defence counsel.[24]The Crown submits that there is nothing exceptional or extenuating and while the circumstances are regrettable, a crime was committed.[25]The offender was a low level participant in the movement of heroin and often such participation arises out of unfortunate circumstances.[26]The Crown submits that the aggravating factors include the type of drug, and the amount of the drug. The offender was motivated by profit, also an aggravating factor.[27]The Crown agrees that the offender should get credit for time served at the rate of 1.5 days for every day in custody pending sentence.[28]Defence counsel submits that the appropriate global sentence would be two years less one day. He submits the offender has been in custody since July 9, 2015 and should get a credit of 1.5 days for each day in pre-trial custody, resulting in a sentence of time served.[29]Defence counsel submits that his client should be subject to a three year probation order.[30]As noted, defence counsel takes no issue with the request for a DNA order.Case Law[31]As referenced previously, R. v. Pannu, is a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal. The trial judge had imposed, on each of the accused, a sentence of nine years for the possession of a kilogram of heroin for the purpose of trafficking. Neither accused had a criminal record. Both accused appealed the length of their sentence. The appeal was dismissed.[32]The trial judge opined that the range of sentence was between six years and 12 years, for first time offenders.[33]From paragraph 192 of the Court of Appeal’s ruling I quote,“Second, the sentences imposed are within the range of sentence the appellants themselves concede is appropriate for first offenders convicted of possession of heroin for the purpose of trafficking. The sentences sit at the mid-point of the range the appellants says is apt, although some authority suggests that the appropriate range is nine to 12 years for similar amounts of heroin: R. v. Shahnawaz (2000) 2000 CanLII 16973 (ON CA), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 6.”[34]The Appeal Court went on to say, at paragraph 193,“But they were also found in possession of a substantial amount of a highly addictive drug. It is a reasonable inference that their possession was for financial gain. Nothing more. Nothing less. For those so inclined, the price upon conviction must be steep.”[35]R. v. Kelsy [2008] O. J. No. 3879 is a decision of G. Trotter J., as he then was, of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. The accused was convicted of a number of gun charges as well as possession of 34.42 grams of heroin for the purpose of trafficking. The accused was 24 at the time the crimes were committed and had no criminal record.[36]The court found that the gun charges were an aggravating factor in considering the sentence for the possession charge. The court also took into account the almost five years the accused was under strict terms of bail pending trial. Further, during that time the accused had educated herself, and put herself in a better position to care for herself and her child.[37]The accused was sentenced to jail for two years less a day.[38]Counsel for the offender referenced two other authorities; R. v. Chan 2003 CarswellOnt 3115 (ONCA) and R. v. Giammarco 2012 CarswellOnt 2917.[39]In the Chan case the RCMP intercepted a package containing six kilos of heroin. All was removed except for one gram and a controlled delivery was executed. At trial the accused, who was found to be in possession for the purpose of trafficking, was sentenced to ten years in jail. It was argued on appeal that when the appellant took possession of the package it only contained the one gram and that such a small amount is not sufficient to convict for the purpose of trafficking.[40]The Court of Appeal rejected that argument stating at paragraph 27, that the quantity of the drugs possessed is not part of the actus reus of the offence.Regardless of the amount, if the intent of the possession is to traffic, then the offence is made out.[41]In Chan the appellant argued that the trial judge erred in principle in imposing a sentence of ten years imprisonment. In regards to the actual amount of heroin in the package (one gram) when the appellant was found in possession the Court said, at paragraph 74,“It is clear that, but for the intervention of the authorities, the appellant would have succeeded in his efforts to obtain possession of a much larger quantity of heroin than that which he actually received. Because of the appellant’s efforts were frustrated only as a result of that intervention, I see no reason for reducing his sentence in any significant way from that which would have been imposed had the appellant succeeded.”[42]The Giammarco decision is that of Hourigan J., as he then was, of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. This case also dealt with the RCMP interception of package containing an amount of heroin and the execution of a controlled delivery. The two accused were sentenced to five and six years in jail.[43]In Giammarco it was argued by defence counsel that while their clients had no knowledge of the specific type of controlled substance in the package,the trial judge ruled that such wilful blindness is not a mitigating factor as the accused did not take any reasonable steps to understand the nature of the substance.Mitigating and Aggravating Factors[44]Ms. Uzondu readily admitted to her involvement in ongoing fraudulent schemes. She was paid by Dan to do whatever he requested, including taking delivery and having possession for the purpose of trafficking, a package containing a quantity of heroin. I find her participation in the fraudulent activities to be an aggravating factor.[45]The type of drug seized, heroin, given its addictive qualities and its impact on society, is an aggravating factor.[46]The planned circumstances of the offence I accept as an aggravating factor as well as the motivation for profit.[47]Notwithstanding her admission of fraudulent activity the offender, it would appear, does not have a criminal record which is a mitigating factor, to some degree, notwithstanding that when arrested for this offence the offender was on bail in regards to a charge(s) relating to fraud. She will be treated as a first time offender.[48]She was gainfully employed at the time of the offence and sent money home to support her two children. I accept those factors as mitigating in nature.Principles of Sentencing[49]Section 718 of the Criminal Code of Canada sets out the purpose of sentencing and lists the objectives to be considered by the sentencing judge.[50]As noted in the Kelsy case, paragraph 35, the objectives to be emphasized in cases such as this, are denunciation and deterrence, both general and specific.Reasons and Decision[51]The offender, Faith Chinwendu Uzondu, had in her possession, for a short period of time, heroin and for sentencing purposes the amount of heroin to be taken into account is almost half a kilo.[52]The possession was planned and deliberate and the offender was one person out of many, to participate in the scheme of trafficking in heroin. She was paid for her participation, which was akin to a drug mule.[53]The nature of the offender’s role puts her at the low end of the heroin trafficking hierarchy. She was a conduit, used to insulate others from possibly arrest.[54]I accept the submissions of the Crown that the case law suggests the appropriate range of sentence to be six to 12 years but accept the submission that given the amount of heroin involved was less than half a kilo, the sentence should be at the lower end of that range or even below.[55]As noted by Trotter J. in Kelsy, other authorities suggest a very wide range and in Kelsy the accused was sentenced to two years less one day.Counsel for the offender relies on this case in support of what he believes to be the appropriate global sentence.[56]With respect, I disagree with defense counsel. Given aggravating factors as determined by me, a longer sentence is appropriate.[57]Taking all of the circumstances into account I believe a global sentence of four years is required but is subject to a credit for time served.[58]In regards to a credit, I will grant it at a rate of 1.5 for every day of custody up to the date of sentencing. The offender has been in custody since July 9, 2015, which, to the date of sentencing amounts to 502 days. Accordingly, the offender is to get credit for 753 days in custody.[59]I therefore sentence the offender to a further 22 months in jail.[60]The offender is ordered to provide a DNA sample.___________________________Bielby J.Released:November 23, 2016CITATION: R. v.

No. 6178The Issues[1]There are two issues for me to decide.Firstly, should Mr. Perch serve a jail sentence, or would a fine and probation with community service suffice?Secondly, if his actions are found to require a jail sentence, for how long?Possible Penalties[2]The Securities Act provides for fines up to $1,000,000 and imprisonment of up to two years.The Crown has asked for a jail term of 12 to 14 months and probation and defence has asked for probation and community service work.Both counsel agree that probation can be imposed by virtue of The Summary Convictions Act, but that a conditional sentence is not available.I am not being asked to order restitution.The Facts[3]Over a 2¾ year period between 2001 and 2004, Mr. Perch, then the golf pro at the Transcona Golf Club, solicited $380,000 from eight investors.He told them he was going to expand his golf-related business interests.Investors, who included golf club members, an employee and strangers solicited through newspaper ads, were promised interest rates of 20% per year, wholesale golf equipment which they were permitted to resell, and other extremely attractive incentives.[4]At no time was Mr. Perch registered to sell securities under The Securities Act.He says that he was not aware he had to register, and the Crown did not elect to prove otherwise.[5]It appears Mr. Perch deposited all the monies invested into his personal bank account.Monies invested went in and out of Mr. Perch’s account very quickly, often disappearing in a matter of weeks.For a period of time, obligations were apparently kept – interest and other payments were made totalling, according to his lawyer, about $100,000, so the actual loss to investors would have been that much less.However, in 2003 interest cheques began to be returned as there were insufficient funds in Mr. Perch’s bank account to cover them.Nevertheless, Mr. Perch continued to solicit other investors, by newspaper ads and otherwise, apparently then using their money to pay interest to previous ones.[6]By the end of May 2003, on most days Mr. Perch’s bank account reflected negative balances, and on July 23, 2003, it was closed with a zero balance.[7]Mr. Perch solicited the apparently most vulnerable investor, Dave Reimer, his employee and a person with a tragic past, initially in 2001 and then again in August of 2003.At a time when it does not appear Mr. Perch even had a bank account, he had Mr. Reimer “reinvest” $20,000 that he had originally invested in 2001, as well as invest additional funds for a total of $65,000 - money that Mr. Reimer had received as royalties on a book about his life.Apparently, after an incorrectly performed circumcision, Mr. Reimer had lived his first twelve years as a female.According to Mr. Martel, “everyone” at the Transcona Golf Club knew about this, so Mr. Perch would have known as well.Nevertheless, Mr. Perch made contractual promises to Mr. Reimer which were almost too attractive to resist.As late as August of 2003, when Mr. Perch was already in financial difficulty, he offered 20% interest and full time employment on an investment of $50,000.He then contracted for an additional $15,000, promising $5,000 in interest and return of the principle in just four months.According to witness Robert Martel, Mr. Reimer, who is now deceased, lost both his job and his money.Mr. Reimer had worked for Mr. Perch and was not getting paid.After Mr. Reimer complained to the Board of the Transcona Golf Club, Mr. Martel approached the Securities Commission, because he was upset at. what had happened to Mr. Reimer.[8]Paul Marchinko, aged 23, responded to a newspaper ad in the spring of 2003 ‑ when he would have only been about 20 years of age.He was looking to invest his savings.He was told by Mr. Perch that Mr. Perch either had land or was going to get land for a driving range, and was looking at investing in other golf courses.Mr. Marchinko was told he could get his money back at the end of six months - that is, on October 7, 2003.At the time he signed the contract with Mr. Marchinko, Mr. Perch’s bank account was overdrawn.Nevertheless, the contract provided for interest of 20% per year, and the principal of $20,000 repayable in October.Mr. Marchinko was also promised a “consulting fee of $400 per month, wholesale merchandise, one round trip airfare to Toronto and a 5% commission on any investor he might be able to bring in.Mr. Marchinko went to a “business lawyer” and after being advised by that person, signed the contract and paid the money.[9]Mr. Perch declared bankruptcy in December of 2004, listing the total amount invested by each of the investors, as well as about $400,000 in other debt.Approximately $70,000 of the $380,000 invested was actually reinvested by two investors, so the amount of principal outstanding, at least in regards to these charges, was actually about $310,000.[10]Three victim impact statements were filed prior to sentencing.One was from the widow of Joe Stemkoski.Mr. Stemkoski had died of cancer in May of 2003.Mr. Stemkoski invested $75,000 in his personal capacity, and apparently more through his business, the latter not being the subject of charges.He made his investment in May of 2002 and, according to his widow, there were problems with failed undertakings by May of 2003, when Mr. Stemkoski was terminally ill with cancer.Mr. Stemkoski met with Mr. Perch in that month, three days before his death, in a futile attempt to get back the money to leave for his young family.Mrs. Stemkoski, after outlining the toll Mr. Perch’s actions have had, concluded by writing, “I hope that any sentence imposed upon Mr. Perch by this Honourable Court will mirror for Mr. Perch, what we, his victims, have felt.”[11]A trial began before me in November of 2005.Although Mr. Perch had the right to a trial and while there were obviously some legal issues, it was after he heard the compelling testimony from the first witnesses, and especially from Mr. Martel about the consequences to Mr. Reimer, that Mr. Perch decided to plead guilty.In the meantime, Crown and witnesses had had to prepare for, and anticipate, a trial.[12]A Pre-Sentence Report was prepared.Mr. Perch has no previous criminal record.The report is unremarkable except for the lack of genuine remorse the probation officer noted in Mr. Perch.Although Mr. Perch told her he felt “horrible” about his offence, and he told her that he believed the investments “were legal as lawyers were involved in the transactions,” he, according to her, “demonstrated little remorse for his actions and appeared to be more concerned about how his actions have affected himself and his socio‑economic status”.He apologized in court, but I also thought his apology appeared hollow.He did file letters of reference and a list of awards.Undoubtedly, Mr. Perch is well thought of by many and has done positive things, but those acts pale beside the damage done to the people who trusted him with their money.[13]Mr. Perch’s counsel admitted that some of the money had gone to pay Mr. Perch’s personal expenses.Some must have gone into the pro shop.When I asked Mr. Perch where the rest had gone, his only answer was that it went toward the promotion of a “ladies night” and to advertising.He blamed everything on the Transcona Golf Club’s terminating his contract two years early.The termination, however, did not occur until November 18, 2003, months after cheques started being returned and Mr. Stemkoski being unable to get his money back.A year earlier, the Club had removed the collecting of green fees from Mr. Perch’s control.The Club revenues had then risen $100,000 over that period.[14]Although Mr. Perch is presently employed, albeit only as a courier, and he lives at his sister’s without being required to pay rent, as yet he has not paid any money back to any investor or investor’s family.The Precedents[15]The Crown has asked for a sentence of 12 to 14 months incarceration, citing the Edgar, Bachewich, Werbeniuk and Zitzerman cases.She argued that Edgar and Werbeniuk were important because they set out the purpose of securities legislation and the seriousness of breaching it.She cited from Edgar, at paragraph 13, an older case, Bowman, as follows:One of the principal purposes of the Securities Act is to protect the “innocent abroad” in the investment world from the goldbricker or the rapacious shark that such easy game attract.[16]From the Bowman case also, Edgar quoted the other principle:…the dividing line between imprisonment and monetary punishment as the appropriate penalty must be in which class the offender falls, the merely careless or the designedly evasive delinquent who is bent on defrauding the public unhindered by the watchful supervision of the Commissioner’s investigators.[17]In Werbeniuk, former Associate Chief Judge Miller also cited Bowman and adopted the same “test” for determining whether a fine or jail was the appropriate penalty.[18]Factors considered by the court in Edgar included the lapse of time, the monetary amount taken and lost, and the breach of trust of his friends and of his new contacts.[19]Looking at the Bowman “test” and the continuum of culpability, does Mr. Perch fall into the category of offenders who are “merely careless” and thus entitled to a fine, or is he the “designedly evasive delinquent who is bent on defrauding the public unhindered by the watchful supervision of the Commission’s investigators” and subject to a term of imprisonment?[20]Mr. Perch does not fit easily into either group but, rather, somewhere in between.I will attempt to place him along the continuum of culpability.[21]I find that Mr. Perch is more blameworthy than someone who was “merely careless”.He says that he was not aware of the requirement of registration and no evidence being adduced to the contrary, I am required to accept that.Certainly he is not, as were the individuals in many of the precedents referred to by the Crown, either a lawyer or a person employed in the field, who would certainly have been aware.But the Crown has argued, and I agree, that that is not the end of the issue ‑ that there was still an element of deceit.[22]For example, he told Mr. Robert Martel, “not to worry” (about losing money) because he owned a hotel in B.C. and “money was not a problem”.In fact, although Mr. Perch may have held shares in a hotel, he did not own one.[23]Mr. Perch promised a great deal, in person, in written contracts, and in newspaper ads.But he then put all the money into his personal account, and used some to pay personal expenses and some to pay other investors’ interest payments.In fact, Mr. Martel saw that Mr. Perch was still running an ad for investors in the Winnipeg Free Press after the cheques he had written to Mr. Martel had begun to bounce.At least during the later periods during which the offences were committed, he had to have known that things were not going well, that he was not making money for his investors, that he was “robbing Peter to pay Paul”, using the money for his own purposes, and making contractual promises that he would probably not be able to keep.When he declared bankruptcy in December of 2004, Mr. Perch declared liabilities of over $863,000.Although he blamed his financial downfall then, as well as in court, on the fact that his contract with the Transcona Golf Club was broken two years before expiry, he obviously knew at the time of advertising and making overly generous contractual promises to at least the later investors that it was highly unlikely that he could fulfill those contracts.I find him more blameworthy than someone who was “merely careless”.[24]It is also admitted by the defence that some of the money taken from investors was used to pay personal expenses of Mr. Perch.This, in my view, brings his actions close to theft.Some of the money may have gone towards inventory for the pro shop.When I asked Mr. Perch, at his counsel’s suggestion, where the rest had gone, the only answer I got was that it had gone for “advertising” and promotion of a “ladies night”.None appears to have gone into another business or toward the purchase of land discussed with one of the investors.[25]The people the investment contracts were sold to included relatively successful golf club members, but also those who just had modest life savings, such as Paul Marchinko, and especially Joe Stemkoski and Dave Reimer.I did not hear the circumstances of the other investors.The most glaring case is that of Dave Reimer.Mr. Reimer was Mr. Perch’s employee and an individual with personal problems.And yet, Mr. Perch asked him for money in 2001, and then again in 2003, when Mr. Perch was apparently in dire financial straits.Mr. Perch would have known, as did, according to Mr. Martel, everyone at the Club, about Mr. Reimer’s issues.It would not have required much imagination to conclude that Mr. Reimer was a vulnerable individual.This is obviously the most serious offence.[26]Then Mr. Perch solicited a staff member of the Securities Commission in November of 2003.[27]Having found that Mr. Perch was more than merely careless, the precedents seem to say a jail sentence is required.I do not see any other sentence reflecting the required denunciation and deterrence.I do not believe a fine and probation with a community service order is adequate.How Long a Jail Sentence?[28]Having decided that a jail sentence is required, what length of sentence is appropriate?[29]Counsel for the Securities Commission cited Bachewich and Zitzerman on the issue of quantum.Mr. Bachewich had 12 victims, who invested $250,000, as opposed to Mr. Perch who had eight victims who invested $380, 000 (or, taking into account that some money was reinvested, $310,000).Bachewich sought investors over a period of four years, while for Mr. Perch the period was 2¾ years.Mr. Bachewich and Mr. Perch were of similar ages and neither had a criminal record.However, Mr. Bachewich, very significantly in my mind, had previously been employed by a brokerage firm and was also charged with fraud under the Criminal Code.He received 27 months on the fraud charge and 17 months concurrent on the charge under The Securities Act.He was obviously not claiming to be unaware of Securities Act legislation.His offences under The Securities Act involved false reporting, rather than failure to register.A sentence which was concurrent to a sentence for fraud in my mind of questionable value as a precedent.[30]Mr. Zitzerman was sentenced under the previous sentencing regime - where the maximum jail sentence was one year and the maximum fine $2,000.The changes came into effect October 19, 1988.Mr. Zitzerman was an “experienced lawyer of many years” who “should have, or ought to have known, that such dealings required registration under the Act.”His actions were described by the sentencing judge as a “designed, deliberate, and wilful act on his part to avoid the strict sanctions imposed on traders by The Securities Commission, and by the Act.” (at page 2).Mr. Zitzerman received a sentence of 12 months imprisonment.Mr. Zitzerman, however , according to defence and not disputed by Crown, also served a lengthy term in Stony Mountain Institution for other offences - when that sentence was imposed in relation to The Securities Actone I do not know.[31]In Werbeniuk there were fewer victims and a lesser dollar amount - less than $54,000.A co‑accused had made some restitution.Mr. Werbeniuk “was not ignorant of the legal requirements upon him.”There was a “predatory tinge” to his conduct.The sentence was one of four months.[32]In Edgar the accused engaged in the sale of securities to four individuals over five years.The loss was $135,000.The sentence was one of four months.[33]Counsel for Mr. Perch also referred to a number of decisions.[34]Lewandosky, a decision of my brother Chartier, is similar in a number of respects.The Court accepted that “when Ms Lewandosky first started to borrow funds from the complainants she did so fully intending to repay them.” In the case of Mr. Perch, I cannot conclude otherwise.However, as with Mr. Perch, “At some later date, she knew or ought to have known that she could no longer reasonably expect to pay these individuals.”The financial and emotional effects were similar, except perhaps in the case of Mr. Reimer, who was particularly vulnerable, and in that of Mr. Stemkoski, who died without being able to provide for his family.The amounts taken by Ms Lewandosky were larger - some $915,000 from nine different sets of investors.In her case, about $300,000 had been repaid by the date of sentence.Ms Lewandosky exhibited genuine remorse - I find that Mr. Perch does not.Ms Lewandosky’s sentence of six months was given under the old sentencing regime where the maximum was 12 months.[35]In Whittingdon, a 2000 decision, the same penalty provisions applied.Less money was taken - $25,000 - but the accused was in the investment business.He was given 90 days to be served intermittently.[36]The Alexander, Crimeni and Carmichael cases were not helpful on the issue of quantum.[37]I have concluded that Mr. Perch is less culpable than Mr. Werbeniuk and Mr. Zitzerman in that they would not have been able to say that they were not aware of the requirements of The Securities Act and that at least Mr. Werbeniuk was also convicted of fraud.On the other hand, the Court in Werbeniuk was able to make compensation orders.However, in terms of remorse and failure to make restitution he is more culpable than Ms Lewandosky.The sentencing regime has changed since Lewandosky, the maximum term of incarceration having doubled.Also this case is more aggravating in my view because of Mr. Reimer and Mr. Stemkoski.[38]In my view the appropriate sentence is one of 10 months and I impose that sentence.That will be followed by 12 months supervised probation.During that time Mr. Perch will report as required, and perform 100 hours of community service work.He is not to be involved in the securities industry in any capacity nor is he permitted to manage, invest money, or trade in securities on behalf of others.“J.A.

Wigderson,for the AppellantAppellant)))HEARD:March 10, 2015Morissette J.RULINGOn Appeal from The Hon. Mr. Justice R.McKay conviction and sentenceon November 2nd, 2012, April 5th,2013, June 7th, 2013 and August 27th, 2013[1]The issue before the Court in this appeal is whether the Ontario Court of Justice has the jurisdiction to join and proceed to trial on separate informations under the Provincial Offences Act (P.O.A) and Criminal Code (C.C.) simultaneously.Background facts:[2]The appellant had a single trial before Justice A. T. McKay of the Ontario Court of Justice at London, for two C.C. offences (assault with a weapon (a car) and dangerous driving) and two Highway Traffic Act (HTA) offences (fail to stop for police and fail to report damage to property).[3]The appellant was found guilty of dangerous driving and fail to stop for police.He was acquitted on the assault with a weapon and failure to report damage to property.[4]The appellant appeals his convictions on the ground that it is impermissible to simultaneously try charges laid pursuant to the C.C. and charges laid pursuant to the P.O.A. and, as a result, seeks a declaration that the trial was a nullity.[5]When the appellant’s trial commenced, the C.C. and P.O.A. informations were before the Court. Crown counsel proposed the appellant be arraigned on both informations and counsel for the appellant consented.The Court proceeded to try the appellant for all four charges simultaneously.Analysis:[6]In 1992, the Supreme Court in R. v. Clunas (1992), 1992 CanLII 127 (SCC), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 115 decided to reverse the historical law that it was impermissible to jointly try charges set out in two or more informations, even if the charges were laid pursuant to the same enabling statute.[1][7]The Court in Clunas was asked to decide whether the joint trial of one summary conviction matter and one indictable matter was a jurisdictional or procedural error.In Clunas, the matters had proceeded to a joint trial on consent of the Crown and defence.In finding that it was not an error to try the matters together in one trial, the Court held:Whether the accused consents or not, joinder should only occur when, inthe opinion of the court, it is in the interests of justice and the offencesor accused could initially have been jointly charged.[2][8]The appellant submits that Clunas has provided a two-prong test to determine whether the joinder of two informations ought to be allowed to proceed in a simultaneous trial as follows:First, by asking whether the two separate informations could be joined in a single information?And second, whether the same rules of procedure and evidence govern the two informations?[9]The Crown submits that the comments made in the Clunas’ decision that joinder should only occur when the offences could initially have been jointly charged, relates to the C.C. restrictions on joinder pursuant to sections 589 to 593 of the C.C.Given that the court in Clunas was dealing with the joinder of two C.C. charge informations, (i.e. one indictable and one summary conviction), the Crown submits that is why the Court had to make this comment.[10]The Crown further submits that its position is supported by the reference made in Clunas’s immediately following the statement relied upon by the appellant, when the court states:I would adopt the American Federal Rules of Criminal Procedureformulation, which is as follows[3]:The court may order two or more indictments or informations or both to be tried together if the offences and the defendants, if there is more than one, could have been joined in a single indictment or information.The procedures shall be the same as if the prosecution were under such single indictment or information.I would also add, quoting from the Law Reform Commission’s WorkingPaper 55, at p. 39, the following:… any particular aspects of the rule in favour of severance would have to be inapplicable in order for this judicial joinder to occur.This rule would thus reflect the rule for unsuccessful severance on a joint charge.[11]The Crown asks this Court to interpret Clunas not as prohibiting the joint trial of a P.O.A. information and a C.C. information, but rather, as a statement abandoning the previous rigid adherence to antiquated procedural practices.[12]The issue of whether a C.C. information and a P.O.A. information could be heard at the same time was not before the Court in Clunas, nor was the issue ever specifically addressed according to both parties before this Court.[13]The Court in Clunas concluded that when the joinder of offences (or of a number of accused for that matter), is considered, the Court should seek the consent of both the accused and the prosecution.If consent is withheld, the reasons should be explored.Whether the accused consents or not, joinder should only occur when, in the opinion of the Court, it is in the interests of justice and the offences (or accuseds) could initially have been jointly charged.[14]As indicated earlier, Clunas was dealing with two C.C. charges.Whether the offences or accuseds could have initially been jointly charged is an issue that speaks to the nexus of the fact situation. If the nexus is found then, whether the separate informations could have been joined initially is not of importance when you consider adopting a principled approach taking into consideration the interest of justice, including the efficient use of judicial resources, while ensuring not to prejudice the interests of the accused.[15]As set out in R. v. Krisza2007 ONCJ 471 (CanLII), Morneau J. reviewed the law of joining C.C. charges and P.O.A. charges and although she did not order a joint trial, she refused to order a joint trial as a result of a lack of consent by the parties.[4][16]Holding two separate trials in the matters that arose out of the same set of facts has the potential to result in inconsistent verdicts which, in my view, is not in the interest of justice.[17]A judge of the Ontario Court of Justice has the jurisdiction to hear both the C.C. and P.O.A. informations separately and is empowered to try provincial offences matters as well as summary conviction offences.[18]The P.O.A. provides for its own procedure and specifically in section 2 thereof highlights that there are differences between the procedures in the C.C. and in provincial prosecutions. However, as in this case, the appellant is charged under Part III of the P.O.A. Proceedings were commenced by information. The rules of evidence at the criminal trial, including proof beyond a reasonable doubt, etc., would be essentially the same, whether in the summary conviction criminal proceeding or in the provincial proceedings.[19]The appellant raises the issue of the difference between the federal and provincial rules of evidence that govern the contradicting of one’s own witness. In my view, the slight difference between section 9(2) of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. E-10 and section 23 of the Ontario Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E. 23 did not affect the outcome of the trial in this case.The appellant was not prejudiced by it.[20]For these reasons, I find that the decision in Clunas supports the permissibility of a more efficient and effective trial process unencumbered by artificial rules that serve no useful purpose and rest on no sound principle.[21]Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.Appeal as to Sentence:[22]At the outset, leave was granted to appeal as to sentence.[23]The standard to be considered on an appeal of sentence is whether the sentence imposed is a fit sentence. A variation of sentence should only be allowed where the appeal court is convinced the sentence imposed is unreasonable in that it is clearly excessive or inadequate, that the sentencing judge applied the wrong principles or that the sentencing judge failed to consider all the relevant facts.[5][24]The appellant submits that the sentencing judge erred in two ways:a) that he failed to recognize in the sentencing phase one of the findings of fact that he found during the conviction phase and that is that the appellant “panicked”;and b)he found that general deterrence could only be met by a suspended sentence, probation and a driving prohibition and not by a conditional discharge, probation and a driving prohibition.[25]The appellant did not apply for a stay of his prohibition from driving; he performed his community service hours, paid his fine and victim fine surcharge.His probation officer did not recommend any counselling and he is no longer required to report to him.[26]At the time of the offences, the appellant was 19 years of age and 21 at the time he was sentenced.He had no prior criminal record and comes from a stable and supportive family.He was a full-time Fanshawe College student living with his parents and now, as of the fall of 2014, works full-time as a salesperson for a flooring accessories company.[27]At issue is whether imposing a suspended sentence is the appropriate sentence instead of a conditional discharge. As the Court of Appeal said in a case in which a provincial court judge refused to grant a discharge to a pair of shoplifters and instead suspended the passing of sentence:We do not think that a suspended sentence is a greater deterrent to youths that may be tempted to steal than a discharge, certainly not a conditional discharge with probation.The fact of speedy apprehension, arrest and trial with the public disgrace and jeopardy which is thereby occasioned should be sufficient deterrent, and the future of these two young men need not be jeopardized by insisting that they bear a criminal record.[6][28]In the conviction phase, the dangerous driving was triggered by what the Court had itself characterized as “panic”.However, when it came to the sentencing phase, the Court did not mention in his reasons the “panicking” aspect of the offence.[29]One could categorise this finding as important to sentencing when the appellant’s conduct is entirely out of character and as a young person with above average potential to contribute meaningfully to society, and a conviction could seriously restrict the appellant’s opportunities in the future.[30]In this Court’s view, given that a discharge would not be contrary to the public interest, the nature and circumstances of the offence does not preclude the granting of a discharge, especially bearing in mind that the Court found the appellant drove away from the officer because the appellant “panicked”, and the subsequent driving was of very brief duration.[31]Accordingly, the suspended sentence for dangerous driving is set aside and replaced with a discharge.Disposition:[32]The conviction appeal is dismissed but the sentencing appeal is allowed and replaced with a discharge.______________________Justice J.

Monette............................................................................................................for the CrownM. Shea...........................................................................for the Defendant, Bobby MathiesonREASONSFORSENTENCEHARRIS J.:INTRODUCTION[1]Bobby Terry Mathieson has entered guilty pleas to one count of possessing child pornography and one count of printing child pornography and one count of breaching his probation. Crown counsel elected to proceed by indictment with respect to all charges.[2]Mr. Mathieson is before me today to be sentenced.[3]Crown counsel suggested that the appropriate global sentence would be imprisonment for four years less pre-sentence custody credited on a 1:1 basis.[4]In addition, he proposed that I make the following ancillary orders:1.a DNA order;2.forfeiture orders for the computer and the media seized;3.an order compelling Mr. Mathieson to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for life; and4.an order pursuant to s. 161 of the Criminal Code, limiting Mr. Mathieson’s access to children under the age of 16 years.[5]Counsel for Mr. Mathieson suggested that the appropriate sentence would be one of time served, being 334 days, credited as one year plus imprisonment for a further two years followed by probation for three years. He agreed that the ancillary orders would be appropriate.[6]My task then is to determine the appropriate sentence here.THE LAW[7]I have had to address this issue with respect to child pornography cases on a number of previous occasions.[1]Rather than repeat everything that I have said in those cases, I will limit myself to adopting those reasons and to making the following observations.[8]It is universally accepted that simple possession of child pornography is a serious offence. By its very definition, child pornography is created by recording the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children. These children are victimized for the first time when the pornography is created. They are re-victimized time and time again whenever someone views those images.[9]This is occurring more frequently than in the past. The advent of digital cameras and the development of the Internet have made more child pornography available to more people, all at the push of a few buttons or keys on their computers, and this is all available in the comfort and safety of the offender’s own home.[10]With greater sophistication on the part of law enforcement officials, more of these offenders are being apprehended and, hence, the number of child pornography cases coming before the courts is increasing at a horrendous rate.[11]I note the comments of Justice De Filippis at para. 6 in R. v. Strohmeier, 2007 ONCJ 141 (CanLII), [2007] O.J. No. 1250 (Ont. C.J.) where he said, “... there is a link between images of child pornography and [reduced] inhibitions about the sexual abuse of children.”[12]Justice Molloy of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice stated at para. 49 of her reasons in R. v. Kwok, 2007 CanLII 2942 (ON SC), [2007] O.J. No. 457 thatCollectors of child pornography seek to distance themselves from the direct physical and emotional harm caused to children. However, the collectors of this filth are a vital part of the evil menace it represents and bear responsibility for its malignant growth right along with its creators.[13]She goes on to say in paras. 50 and 52 that the existence of this ready and eager consumer base could only be seen as an incitement to, “[those] ... depraved individuals who ... obviously get some kind of extra “kick” out of photographing and videotaping these atrocities and having other people look at them.”[14]She suggests that one way to deter would-be pornographers would be, “... by deterring those who are interested in acquiring the pornography.”[15]In light of all this it should come as no surprise that courts have consistently held that the primary focus for sentencing in cases of simply possessing child pornography must be denunciation and general deterrence. The Criminal Code amendments providing for minimum jail sentences reinforce this sentiment. The same principles are even more applicable in cases of printing child pornography while on probation for similar offences.[16]The minimum sentence for possessing child pornography is imprisonment for 45 days if prosecuted by indictment. The maximum sentence is imprisonment for five years.[17]The minimum sentence for printing child pornography is imprisonment for one year if prosecuted by indictment. The maximum sentence is imprisonment for ten years.[18]There is no minimum sentence for breach of probation. The maximum sentence is imprisonment for two years if prosecuted by indictment.THE OFFENCES[19]The facts in this case are that on September 23, 2012, Mr. Mathieson went to a photo store in St. Catharines where he used their machine to print 56 photos from digital images files. A store employee saw that these included child pornography and a self portrait and called the police.[20]The police obtained and executed a search warrant for Mr. Mathieson’s residence. They found more hard copy photographs that qualified as child pornography, digital storage devices and two video game consoles that were capable of accessing the Internet.[21]Mr. Mathieson was on probation at the time. He was to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. He was not to possess any digital storage devices.[22]He had been convicted of one count of possessing child pornography and one count of printing child pornography. On December 16, 2010, he was sentenced to time served, being 260 days of pre-sentence custody plus imprisonment for 16 months, followed by probation for three years.[23]An employee at a computer store read the press release following Mr. Mathieson’s arrest and realized that he had left a computer at the store to be repaired.[24]The police obtained a new search warrant authorizing them to seize and examine the computer. The subsequent search turned up 908 images of child pornography and two short video clips of child pornography. Mr. Mathieson had downloaded these from the Internet and saved them.[25]These images included photographs of very young children who were naked and had their legs spread and their genitals exposed. There were similar pictures with an adult hand touching the children’s genitals. Others showed these children in close proximity to erect adult penises. There were photographs showing young female children having vaginal and anal intercourse with adult males. Two photos showed a prepubescent male and female simulating intercourse. Another photo showed a young child with a foreign object inserted into her anus.[26]Clearly then, the offences committed by Mr. Mathieson are serious ones that cry out for a sentence that will make it clear to everyone that such crimes will not be tolerated in our community.[27]Having said that, I must not lose sight of the other principles of sentencing, including rehabilitation. I must not ignore the circumstances in the background of Mr. Mathieson that might mitigate against what could otherwise be an even longer sentence.BACKGROUND OF MR. MATHIESON[28]In Kwok, supra, Justice Molloy lists a number of generally recognized mitigating factors, including:1.the youthful age of an offender;2.the otherwise good character of an offender;3.the extent to which the offender has shown insight into his problem;4.whether he has demonstrated genuine remorse;5.whether he is willing to submit to treatment and counselling or has already undertaken such treatment;6.the existence of a guilty plea; and,7.the extent to which the offender has already suffered for his crime, for example in his family, career or community.[29]Few of these factors are applicable in this case.[30]I have been provided with the following information about Mr. Mathieson.[31]He is 36 years old.[32]He is the youngest of five male siblings born to his mother. All five had different fathers. He was placed in the care of his maternal aunt at two years of age and adopted by her at 13.[33]He has been developmentally delayed since birth.[34]He reported “a really good childhood” despite his adoption and open heart surgery at age three where he contracted HIV through a blood transfusion.[35]He finished high school but is functioning at a grade five level.[36]He receives approximately $40,000 from the compensation fund as a result of contracting HIV from tainted blood.[37]He has a history of inappropriate behaviour towards young female children. This began when he was five years old and continued until he was 20.[38]While incarcerated in November 2012, he acknowledged a sexual attraction to children and that he needed help with his urges.[39]During his Pre-Sentence Report interview, he denied this.He is unsure of why he offended and indicated that he needed help but could not say what help that would be.[40]He expressed a desire, following completion of this sentence, to reside in Niagara Falls close to one of his half-brothers. This brother has a criminal conviction for sexually inappropriate behaviour towards a minor female. He believes his half-brother’s claim that he was innocent of the offence.[41]While on probation, Mr. Mathieson attended the Basic Cognitive Sex Offender Relapse Prevention Group Program between January and June 2012. He missed three of 20 sessions due to illness. He attended the follow up maintenance program from June 2012 until his incarceration in November 2012.[42]In June 2012, he failed to inform his probation officer that new tenants, with young children, were moving into the upper unit of his rental property.[43]He attended for counselling with a psychiatrist in Ottawa. He went twice for phallometric testing. He opted out the first time because of a headache. On the second occasion, he left to go for coffee and did not return for three hours. He then completed part of the assessment only before declining to proceed further.[44]The Pre-Sentence Report states that Mr. Mathieson “is considered at an elevated risk to reoffend” and “Based on the aforementioned concerns including sexual deviance, non-compliance and his refusal to reside long-term in a supervised environment upon release the subject is considered an unsuitable candidate for community supervision”.ANALYSIS[45]Child pornography is a serious matter and the number of child pornography cases is growing to such an extent that it is like a plague that needs to be stamped out.[46]Accordingly, general deterrence and denunciation must be emphasized in determining the appropriate sentence. That sentence must make it absolutely clear to any like-minded individuals that such behaviour will not be tolerated, but rather will result in imprisonment for a significant length of time.[47]In this case, Crown counsel has argued that this is also one of those cases where the offender must be separated from society for a long time in order to protect that society.[48]Mr. Mathieson committed theses offences after he had been imprisoned for the equivalent of two years or more for the very same offences. In addition, he was still on probation for those offences.[49]These are very aggravating circumstances that call for the imposition of a longer period of imprisonment this time.[50]As I said before, Mr. Mathieson does not qualify for much in the way of mitigation of his sentence.[51]He is not youthful although I recognize that 36 is not nearly so old as to warrant giving up on his rehabilitation entirely.[52]He is not otherwise of good character.[53]He has shown little or no insight into his problem.[54]Other than pleading guilty, he has not demonstrated genuine remorse.[55]He has not been truly willing to submit to treatment and counselling and has so far undertaken only such treatment as he was compelled to.[56]It cannot be said that he has already suffered for his crime, for example in his family, career or community.[57]I point out that none of these are what I would classify as aggravating factors. They represent mitigating factors that, were they present here, would provide a reason for me to impose a lighter sentence than might otherwise be justified. Their absence simply means that Mr. Mathieson is not entitled to any such mitigation of his sentence.[58]The only true mitigating feature here is the fact that Mr. Mathieson entered guilty pleas.I take that to be an expression of some remorse and an acceptance of responsibility on his part. It also saved considerable time on our overcrowded criminal docket.[59]Even giving him credit for that, however, I find that the appropriate sentence here is imprisonment for four years.PRE-SENTENCE CUSTODY[60]Counsel for Mr. Mathieson asked me to give enhanced credit for the 334 days Mr. Mathieson spent in pre-sentence custody.[61]During his submissions on this point, I made reference to the recent decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Summers, 2013 ONCA 147 (CanLII), [2013] O.J. No. 1068[2], paraphrasing para. 117 which readsThat said, nothing in these reasons should be understood as suggesting that enhanced credit will be available under s. 719(3.1) to every remand offender on the basis of the absence of remission and parole eligibility. There must be some basis in the evidence or the information before the sentencing judge to support the conclusion that this factor merits enhanced credit for a particular offender in a given case.[62]Counsel however declined to call any such evidence in support of this request.[63]I also noted that the Information contains the endorsement “Detention order – secondary”.[64]This is important because s. 719(3.1) of the Criminal Code, sets out when enhanced credit greater than 1:1 may be given. It statesDespite subsection (3), if the circumstances justify it, the maximum is one and one-half days for each day spent in custody unless the reason for detaining the person in custody was stated in the record under subsection 515(9.1) or the person was detained in custody under subsection 524(4) or (8). (emphasis added)[65]Section 515(9.1) states(9.1) Despite subsection (9), if the justice orders that the accused be detained in custody primarily because of a previous conviction of the accused, the justice shall state that reason, in writing, in the record.[66]The secondary ground for detention is of course the protection of the public. I find accordingly that the endorsement indicating that Mr. Mathieson was detained on the secondary ground is a clear statement, in writing, that Mr. Mathieson was detained because of his previous conviction for the same offences. I am therefore precluded from crediting Mr. Mathieson’s pre-sentence custody at anything other than a rate of 1:1.SENTENCE[67]Accordingly, I sentence Mr. Mathieson as follows.[68]With respect to printing child pornography, I sentence him to time served, being 334 days of pre-sentence custody credited as 11 months plus imprisonment for a further 37 months.[69]With respect to possessing child pornography, I sentence him to imprisonment for one year, to be served concurrently.[70]With respect to breaching his probation, I sentence him to imprisonment for one year, to be served concurrently.[71]I also make the following ancillary orders with reference to both child pornography offences.[72]They are primary designated offences and I make an order pursuant to s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code, authorizing the taking from Mr. Mathieson of any number of samples of one or more bodily substances, including blood, that are reasonably required for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis.[73]I am not satisfied that Mr. Mathieson has established that if an order were made, the impact on him including on his privacy or liberty would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest in protecting society through the effective investigation of crimes of a sexual nature, to be achieved by the registration of information relating to sex offenders under the Sex Offender Information Registration Act. Accordingly, I make an order pursuant to s. 490.012 of the Criminal Code, that Mr. Mathieson comply with the provisions of the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for the rest of his life.[74]The behaviour of Mr. Mathieson, together with the absence of any explanation for it, causes me concern about the risk that Mr. Mathieson may present to children in general. Therefore I make an order pursuant to s. 161 of the Criminal Code prohibiting Mr. Mathieson for life, from(a)attending a public park or public swimming area where persons under the age of 16 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, or a daycare centre, schoolground, playground or community centre;(b)seeking, obtaining or continuing any employment, whether or not the employment is remunerated, or becoming or being a volunteer in a capacity, that involves being in a position of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 16 years;(c)having any contact – including communicating by any means – with a person who is under the age of 16 years, except under the supervision of a responsible adult who has knowledge of his offending;(d)using the Internet or other digital network.[75]I make an order pursuant to s. 164.2(1) of the Criminal Code, directing that the property seized by the police, including any computer, computer parts, loose media storage devices and all Internet access devices shall be forfeited to Her Majesty and disposed of as the Attorney General directs.[76]In light of the time to be spent in custody and the financial position of Mr. Mathieson, I waive the surcharges.Released:September 24, 2013Signed:“D.A.Harris J.”_________________________D.A.Harris J.[1] See R. v.

GordonDate: 1984-01-11Docket: 1253Between:R.andGordonBayda, C.J.S., Woods and Tallis, JJ.A.Counsel:Carol A. Snell, for the Crown;Peter S. Kolenick, for the accused.[1]Tallis, J.A.: The Crown appeals from a sentence of six months’ imprisonment imposed on the respondent following his plea of guilty to indecent assault of his four year old stepdaughter .[2]At the time of this offence the respondent was 24 years of age. On the night in question he attended a dance with his wife. He became upset with his wife and left the dance in an intoxicated condition. He picked up his stepdaughter from the babysitter’s place and then proceeded to the family home where this offence occurred. The injuries sustained by his step-daughter were caused by digital manipulation rather than penile penetration.[3]The aggravating factor in this case is the gross abuse of a child by a person in a parental role. A little girl of four years of age is helpless in the hands of her step-father who should be protecting her rather than abusing her in a most reprehensible and revolting fashion.[4]In his favor we observe that the respondent has shown very considerable remorse concerning this incident, which so far as his record is concerned, is an isolated one. The medical evidence makes it clear that this sexual misconduct was a direct result of his chronic alcoholism. He has now taken the necessary steps to deal with this problem. The real question is whether the sentence of six months, is, in all the circumstances, an adequate sentence to express society’s revulsion for crimes involving breach of trust with young children who require protection.[5]The learned trial judge had the benefit of detailed psychiatric evaluations of the respondent. There is no evidence that the little girl will suffer serious consequences as a result of the offence. The respondent does not appear to have an aggressive personality. He is responding to therapy--indeed he has not consumed any liquor since this incident which occurred over one year ago. We would also observe that he has a good employment record. Society will be better served if this man can be rehabilitated other than put away for a lengthy period of time to serve sentence in an environment where he will require protection from other inmates.[6]The principle of sentencing which emphasizes the need generally to express society’s revulsion for crimes of this kind by the imposition of a lengthy custodial sentence is not a principle which demands a rigid and inflexible adherence to it in all cases involving the commission of such offences, regardless of the circumstances. The factors of deterrence and denunciation which the court must apply should be balanced against all other considerations properly taken into account in the sentencing process.[7]In this case the learned trial judge endeavoured to carefully balance all factors and concluded that a sentence of six months was appropriate. Although in most cases this would not be an adequate sentence for an offence of this nature, we are not persuaded that, in the circumstances of this case, there was any error in the custodial term.[8]We do however feel that the interests of justice would be advanced and society would be better protected by requiring the respondent to be on probation for a period of two years after the expiration of his prison sentence. Accordingly the Crown appeal is allowed to the extent that the sentence of six months’ imprisonment shall be followed by probation for two years on the usual statutory terms and the following special terms:1. The respondent shall report in person to the Chief Probation Officer at Yorkton, immediately upon his release and thereafter at such times and places as the said Probation Officer may require.2. The respondent shall take such counselling and attend such programs for alcohol addiction as his Probation Officer may from time to time require.Appeal allowed in part."}

(3d) 161, one of the issuesconsidered by the Supreme Court of Canada was the problem ofmissing portions of the trial transcript.The appellant, who hadbeen convicted of first degree murder, contended that theinability to obtain a proper and full transcript of the trialproceedings for an appeal comprises a miscarriage of justicewarranting a new trial.Both the majority and the minority ofthe Supreme Court agreed on the test to be applied where portionsof the trial transcript are missing.On behalf of the majority,L’Heureux-Dub‰ J. stated the test at 165:A new trial need not be ordered for every gap in atranscript.As a general rule, there must be a seriouspossibility that there was an error in the missing portion of thetranscript, or that the omission deprived the appellant of aground of appeal.For the minority, Sopinka J. stated the test at 170:I agree that the correct approach is toconsiderthe effect of the gaps inrelationtoanypossible prejudice to an appellant’sabilityto appeal a conviction.The centralrole which the charge to the jury assumesinanappealofajury’sverdictmustbeconsidered.However, not everygapinthetranscript of a charge will justifygrantinganew trial.As a general rule, a new trialwillonlybeordered where thereissomereasontobelieve that theremaypossiblyhavebeenanerror in the passageofthecharge which was missing or that the omissionotherwise may have deprived the appellantofa ground of appeal. [5]In this appeal, virtually the entire transcript isunavailable.In the circumstances of this appeal, counsel forthe respondent conceded that the Hayes test for granting a newtrial has been met by the appellant. [6]Against this background, counsel for the appellant and therespondent entered into negotiations and reached what wasdescribed by counsel for the respondent as a just resolution ofthe appeal that does not offend the administration of justice.Essentially, what was presented to the court was a jointsubmission. [7]As presented by Mr. Breen on behalf of the appellant, it wasproposed that the sentence be varied to seven years and fivemonths to commence on December 19, 1994 and to be servedconcurrently with the 13 year sentence the appellant was servingon the commencement date, to effect the result that each sentencewould expire on May 19, 2002, and that the appellant wouldabandon his appeal against conviction. [8]In joining in this proposal, counsel for the respondentacknowledged that the appellant has served a significant amountof time in custody on other charges and has achieved success inhis rehabilitation as evidenced by the fact that he was grantedday parole on October 5, 1997, and full parole, on November 13,1998.As well, the appellant is currently employed as anassociate producer for the CBC and is a member of a referencegroup which advises the Solicitor General of Canada on issuesrelating to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.Counselfor the respondent is satisfied, given the appellant’semployment, current interests and the obvious community response,all of which are outlined in the appellant’s affidavit, that heis re-integrating himself into the community. [9]Although we commend counsel for their efforts in attemptingto resolve this appeal by way of their joint submission, which weappreciate would result in putting an end to the prosecution ofthe conspiracy charge, we do not think that it would beappropriate for this court to give effect to the jointsubmission.We have no difficulty in accepting the position ofboth counsel that the Hayes test has been met and that this is anappropriate appeal in which to direct a new trial.We do not,however, think that it is appropriate for this court to engage ina review of the sentence on the assumption that the conviction iswell-founded.It is our view that should the Crown proceed witha new trial, and if the appellant is convicted or pleads guilty,the trial court will be the appropriate forum to impose theappropriate punishment. [10] In the result, the appeal from conviction is allowed, theconviction is set aside, and a new trial is ordered."}

The parties jointly proposed a sentence of 20 months less time served of 5 months. The sentencing judge rejected this joint submission and imposed a sentence of 5 years plus time served.[2]The appellant submits that the sentencing judge made two errors.First, as he intended to depart significantly from the joint submission, he ought to have given counsel an opportunity to make further submissions. He erred by failing to do so, see R. v. Hagen. Second, the sentencing judge failed to accord significant weight to the joint submission.[3]We agree with the appellant’s first submission, and indeed the Crown concedes this error. However, it remains open to this court to assess the fitness of the sentence. That brings us to the appellant’s second submission.[4]In our view, the sentencing judge was justified in departing from the joint submission. In the light of the seriousness of these offences, a sentence of 20 months would have brought the administration of justice into disrepute. The sentence that the sentencing judge did impose, 5 years on top of time served, was entirely fit.[5]Accordingly, although leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is dismissed.“John Laskin J.A.”“J.C.

Constantine (K.M.)Date: 2002-01-17Lynn Moore, for the Crown;Tony St. George and Mary Boulous, for Ms. Constantine;Derek Hogan, for Mr. Noftall.(2000 01 T 318)[1]O’Regan, J.: On the night of September 12, 1998 Joseph and Catherine Clowe, retired senior citizens, spent an evening at home watching television. After the late-night news they went to their separate bedrooms. Sometime early in the morning on September 13th their granddaughter, Krista Constantine, aided by her boyfriend, Frederick Noftall, broke into the basement of the residence. Both Constantine and Noftall were juveniles at the time and their intention was to break in and steal the Clowes’ bank card and leave for the mainland.[2]During the break and entry, Catherine Clowe was brutally strangled and Joseph Clowe was locked in his bedroom. Joseph Clowe was successful in opening the window and with the aid of an electrical cord he dropped to ground level. He then entered the house through the front door and found his wife’s body in her bedroom. There were two cords around his wife’s neck and she appeared lifeless. He called 911. An emergency crew and the police arrived at which time Catherine Clowe was pronounced dead. Immediately, Krista Constantine and her boyfriend, Frederick Noftall, became suspects.[3]Krista Constantine was arrested on the afternoon of the 13th of September, 1998. Prior to her arrest she had told three teenagers that she was involved in the murder. Shortly after her arrest, and in the presence of her foster mother, she gave a video statement claiming full responsibility for the murder. Both Constantine and Noftall were charged with break and entry with intent; first degree murder; and two charges of unlawful confinement. They were remanded in custody and denied bail until the trial. A year later while in custody, Noftall gave a cautioned statement to the police acknowledging that he alone was responsible for the murder.[4]Both Constantine and Noftall testified at trial. They both blamed each other for the murder and said that their original statements to the police were false. Constantine stated that she originally took the blame for Noftall because she was in love with him and acceded to his request to solely take the blame for the murder. Likewise, Noftall said that it was his concern and love for Constantine that made him take the blame, but at trial he maintained that the original statement was false. At trial Noftall pleaded guilty to the break and entry charge. Constantine, in her testimony, agreed that she was responsible for the break and entry as well. Both denied any involvement in the murder of Catherine Clowe. Constantine’s position was that she was in the living room when she heard a struggle in the bedroom but was not a witness to the murder and was only present after it had occurred. Noftall’s position was that he was reluctant to go into the house after the window had been broken in the basement and he stayed outside the house for some time. Noftall stated that when he finally entered the house, he discovered that Constantine had committed the murder by strangulation.[5]The Jury gave the following verdicts:1. Both Constantine and Noftall were found guilty of break and entry with intent.2. Krista Constantine was found guilty of second degree murder.3. Frederick Noftall was found guilty of manslaughter.4. Both were found guilty of unlawful confinement in relation to Joseph Clowe.I had instructed the Jury by way of a directed verdict to find both not guilty of unlawful confinement of Catherine Clowe.[6]This is the sentencing decision. Both Constantine and Noftall were juveniles at the time the offences occurred. On application by the Crown, both were tried as adults. Convictions now having been entered, sentence is to be imposed as adults except for parole eligibility in relation to Krista Constantine. I intend to deal with them individually for the purposes of sentencing.Krista Constantine[7]Krista Constantine has a troubled background. The psychiatric and social history reports show that she had a history of severe neglect as a small child. She had a childhood diagnosis of reactive detachment disorder of infancy which the experts attributed to neglect antedating her foster-home placement at the age of 2 1/2. By the time she was placed in the care of a loving foster family, the severe neglect that she suffered as a child had basically taken over her life. This mistreatment led to behavioural disturbances at home and at school.[8]Having been convicted of second degree murder, I have no discretion as to the sentence to be imposed. Krista Constantine has been tried as an adult and the Criminal Code provides that she is to serve a sentence of life imprisonment. The Criminal Code provides that the Jury be asked if they had a recommendation as to the date that she would become eligible for parole. Because Krista Constantine at the time of the offence was under the age of 16, s. 745.3 of the Criminal Code applies to the direction that must be given to the Jury when somebody is found guilty of first degree or second degree murder. S. 745.3 reads as follows“Persons under sixteen -- Where a jury finds an accused guilty of first degree murder or second degree murder and the accused was under the age of sixteen at the time of the commission of the offence, the judge presiding at the trial shall, before discharging the jury, put to them the following question:“You have found the accused guilty of first degree murder (or second degree murder) and the law requires that I now pronounce a sentence of imprisonment for life against the accused. Do you wish to make any recommendation with respect to the period of imprisonment that the accused must serve before the accused is eligible for release on parole? You are not required to make any recommendation but if you do, your recommendation will be considered by me when I am determining the period of imprisonment that is between five years and seven years that the law would require the accused to serve before the accused is eligible to be considered for release on parole.”[9]This question was put to the Jury and they made no recommendation. Although no recommendation was made by the Jury, I still have the discretion to make a recommendation under s. 745.1. The pertinent portions of 745.1 relating to this case are as follows:“Persons under eighteen -- The sentence to be pronounced against a person who was under the age of eighteen at the time of the commission of the offence for which the person was convicted of first degree murder or second degree murder and who is to be sentenced to imprisonment for life shall be that the person be sentenced to imprisonment for life without eligibility for parole until the person has served(a) such period between five and seven years of the sentence as is specified by the judge presiding at the trial, or if no period is specified by the judge presiding at the trial, five years, in the case of a person who was under the age of sixteen at the time of the commission of the offence;”[10]In deciding whether to exercise my discretion to make a recommendation, I am governed by the factors as listed in 745.5:“At the time of the sentencing under section 745.1 of an offender who is convicted of first degree murder or second degree murder and who was under the age of sixteen at the time of the commission of the offence, the judge who presided at the trial of the offender or, if that judge is unable to do so, any judge of the same court, may, having regard to the age and character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, and to the recommendation, if any, made pursuant to section 745.3, by order, decide the period of imprisonment the offender is to serve that is between five years and seven years without eligibility for parole, as the judge deems fit in the circumstances.”[11]The factors listed in 745.5 of the Criminal Code which should be considered in fixing the parole eligibility are the age and character of the offender, the nature of the offence, the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence and any recommendations that have been made by the Jury. In summary, I can recommend that parole eligibility be fixed at 5, 6 or 7 years, or if I make no recommendation, then it is deemed that she will be eligible for parole in 5 years.[12]It is blatantly obvious that the offence is of the most serious that one can envisage. This was an unprovoked attack on an elderly lady in her home and death ensued in a most brutal way. Although I am dealing with parole eligibility, I have taken into consideration the factors that one would normally consider in sentencing both from the authorities and the codification of principles which are now part of our Criminal Code. As stated, sentence is mandatory and I am cognizant that any recommendation that I make does not have to be followed by the parole board. The final decision will be dictated by the circumstances when the accused becomes eligible for parole. In considering whether or not I should make a recommendation, I rely on the reports I have received pursuant to 16.2(3) of the Young Offenders Act and, most importantly, on the psychiatric report. Dr. Craig’s psychiatric report dated December 16, 2001 lists his opinions and recommendations as follows:“1. Ms. Constantine has a history of severe neglect as a small child, a childhood diagnosis of reactive detachment disorder of infancy (which Dr. Aldridge attributed to neglect antedating her foster home placement at age 2 1/2) and a history of self-mutilation, and other behavioural disturbances at home and at school.“2. Ms. Constantine has a substantial history of substance abuse, her preferred substances of abuse being alcohol, cannabis and diazepam (valium). She undoubtedly merited the diagnosis of alcohol and poly-drug abuse until shortly prior to her arrest. Whether her substance abuse would be in remission had she access to substances of abuse or not is unknown.“3. Ms. Constantine was given a diagnosis of conduct disorder by Dr. R. Vardy in October 1998 and borderline personality disorder by Dr. U. Jain in January 1999.“4. I do not see any evidence of any acute mental disorder at this time, nor do I see any current evidence of a personality disorder. However I would not put much weight on my failure to find any current evidence of personality disorder in view of the fact that she has been in a highly structured environment for over three years and, more particularly, in view of her previous history. [Emphasis added]“5. Although Ms. Constantine did not wish to discuss the offenses in question, she expressed remorse for the death of her grandmother and her part in that death which she implied was a passive one.“As Ms. Constantine has been convicted of second degree murder, I assume that she will receive a life sentence and that she will be eligible for parole sometime in the next few years.“In light of that assumption, my recommendations are as follows“ 1. Following her sentencing and presumed transfer to a Federal Institution, Ms. Constantine should undergo a comprehensive assessment by a multidisciplinary mental health team to ascertain her needs and how best to meet them. Particular areas to be assessed include her history of childhood neglect (and probable abuse) and its effect on her, her behavioural difficulties during childhood and adolescence, her history of substance abuse and her offenses and their aftermath. This team should be provided with copies of this report, the corresponding clinic note and the reports and letters referred to in the clinic note. (Emphasis added)“2. Ms. Constantine should undergo whatever treatment is felt to be appropriate after this assessment is completed and should comply with whatever treatment is offered to her. I expect that this will include appropriate counselling to help her come to terms with the offenses in question, her role and responsibility for these offenses and their effects that they have had on her life.“3. Ms. Constantine should be encouraged to pursue her education and appropriate training to prepare her for an appropriate career after her release on day parole and/or parole.”[13]The character of Krista Constantine is one of the important factors to be considered in making a recommendation for parole eligibility under s. 745.1. Dr. Craig has suggested that before being eligible for parole, a comprehensive assessment by a multi-disciplinary mental health team should take place. The merits of this recommendation are obvious. Parole will be determined after such an assessment, especially when risk is taken into consideration. For me to make a recommendation without such an assessment would be to make a decision as if viewing “a crystal ball”. In essence, a recommendation without this relevant background information would border on speculation.[14]By not making a recommendation, I realize that the Criminal Code provides that parole eligibility will be 5 years. Nevertheless, the parole board still has the authority to decide when parole takes place and considering risk assessment, she may not be paroled after the expiration of 5 years. I am confident that the board’s decision on parole will take place after a full review of all the background information. The offence of second degree murder, and the circumstances surrounding the charge, are in themselves sufficient grounds to warrant a determination that parole eligibility could be 7 years. Nevertheless, the assessments from all the sources suggested, coupled with Krista Constantine’s behaviour during her period of incarceration, will dictate when the proper time arrives for her release.[15]In summary, circumstances dictate that it would be inappropriate for me to make a recommendation at this time.[16]As to the other two convictions of break, entry with intent and unlawful confinement, the Crown has suggested a sentence of 5 years on each count and no serious issue was taken with that suggestion by the defence. Considering the fact that there is a life mandatory sentence on the second degree murder charge, any sentence that I would have imposed in relation to these two charges would have been concurrent. As the accused has been on remand for 3 years, I will exercise my discretion in giving credit for that time, which I deem to be a credit of 6 years. In that regard, the sentences for break and entry with intent, and unlawful confinement, will now be deemed to be time served.[17]Under the provisions of s. 109(1) and 109(3) of the Criminal Code there will be a life prohibition on weapons.[18]Because Krista Constantine was a young offender who was raised to adult court, her placement on conviction is still covered by the Young Offenders Act. Under s. 16.2(1) (c) her sentence shall be served in a penitentiary because it is greater than 2 years. Counsel for the Crown, and defence, agree that under the provisions of s. 16, as well as the authorities, I have the jurisdiction to not only decide where the placement should be, but also whether the placement should be under maximum supervision or otherwise. I am aware of the fact that it is policy that people convicted of second degree murder are placed in maximum security for a number of years for assessment. I am satisfied, however, and counsel agree, that I have the authority to order that considering the circumstances such as age and availability of treatment, education and other resources, as well as the number of years that will be served prior to parole eligibility, that this sentence should be served in a Federal institution but not maximum security.[19]In summary, Krista Constantine is sentenced as follows:1. Second degree murder -- Life imprisonment2. Break entry with intent -- Time served3. Unlawful confinement of Joseph Clowe -- Time served4. Mandatory life weapons prohibition[20]I make no recommendation as to parole eligibility.Frederick Noftall[21]Mr. Noftall pleaded guilty to the break and entry with intent charge and was found guilty by the Jury of manslaughter in relation to the death of Catherine Clowe and unlawful confinement regarding Joseph Clowe.[22]I will deal with the sentencing on each charge separately.Manslaughter[23]A year after the offence occurred Fred Noftall gave a cautioned statement to the police stating that he alone was responsible for the murder of Catherine Clowe. At trial he denied any involvement with the murder and explained to the Jury that his original admission as to his guilt was false. His explanation was that he was requested by Krista Constantine to take the blame and because he was still in love with her, he decided to do that. Having changed his story at trial, he explained to the Jury that when they did the break and entry he stayed outside of the house for some time because he had hoped that Krista Constantine could steal the bank card on her own. When she did not return, he entered the house and discovered that the murder had occurred.[24]At a pre-charge conference, all counsel agreed that I should put manslaughter as a possible verdict for either accused to the Jury. Manslaughter was a possibility because both accused had agreed that they did the break and entry with intent, but both denied any involvement with the murder. The charge for manslaughter arises out of these circumstances in that the Jury could find that although either party agreed to be involved with the break and entry with intent to steal, and although one of them was not involved in the murder, they could still be found guilty of manslaughter based on their involvement in the unlawful act of break and entry with intent.[25]It is obvious from the verdict that the Jury believed Mr. Noftall. When one considers the direction given to the Jury, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that the Jury accepted his explanation. In that regard, I find it important to quote my directions to the Jury on manslaughter:“As I have instructed you, either one or both of the accused can be found guilty of first degree murder, or second degree murder, as the principal offender, or accomplice, using Section 21 which defines Parties to the Offence. Because of the circumstances of this case, I will also discuss with you the offence of manslaughter.“You will recall that my instructions to you are that each accused can only be found guilty of murder as an accomplice if he or she knew of the co-accused’s intention to kill Catherine Clowe or to cause her bodily harm that he or she knew was likely to cause death and if the accomplice intended to aid or abet the co-accused. Alternatively, either of the accused could be found guilty of murder pursuant to Section 21(2) which is the section dealing with co-perpetrators, if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he or she formed an intention in common with the co-accused to commit the robbery and that the accused knew that the commission of murder would be a probable consequence of carrying out that intention.“You will recall when I spoke to you about intent in relation to murder. I said that the intent for manslaughter was somewhat different. I am now going to instruct you on the intent that is necessary for manslaughter.“If you are left in doubt about the accomplice’s knowledge of the co-accused’s intention to kill the deceased, or to cause bodily harm that he or she knew was likely to cause death, the accused can be convicted of manslaughter if he or she intended to aid or abet the co-accused in committing the offence of break and entry and knew that a probable consequence of the break and entry with intent to commit the offence of theft was bodily harm resulting from the dangerous act which was undertaken. In making a determination of whether or not he or she knew that bodily harm was a probable consequence, you would use the test of what a reasonable person in the same circumstances would have foreseen.“As well, either accused can also be convicted of manslaughter on the application of Section 21(2) co-perpetrators. Manslaughter would be the appropriate finding if you find that either accomplice lacked the intent to commit murder as I explained it to you but you find that in pursuit of a common intention to steal, one of the accused committed murder, and a reasonable person in the accomplice’s position would have foreseen at least the risk of bodily harm to the deceased.”[26]The Jury then was entitled to find either accused guilty of manslaughter on this charge. They were entitled to find either accused guilty of manslaughter if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that:1. In committing the offence of break and entry either one of them knew that a probable consequence was that bodily harm was foreseeable; or2. either party lacked the intent to commit murder, but in the pursuit of a common intention to steal, one of them did commit murder and the other party would have foreseen at least the risk of bodily harm.[27]In finding Frederick Noftall guilty of manslaughter, the Jury found objective fault. In essence, the Jury found that he was not the perpetrator of the murder but found that a reasonable person in his position could have foreseen that a possible consequence of the break and entry was bodily harm or at least foreseen the risk of bodily harm. Returning a verdict of manslaughter means that I must take the facts found either expressed or implied by the Jury. S. 724(2) of the Criminal Code states:“(2) Where the court is composed of a judge and jury, the court(a) shall accept as proven all facts, express or implied, that are essential to the jury’s verdict of guilty; …”[28]In considering sentencing, I am also aware of the fact that had the Jury found Fred Noftall guilty of murder either as a principal or an accomplice, he would have been found guilty of second degree murder and although he was tried as an adult, his parole eligibility would have been taken into consideration and he could have been eligible for parole after a minimum of 7 years. When being sentenced for manslaughter, his age is not taken into consideration and he is sentenced as an adult, but obviously, in sentencing him for manslaughter, which is unintentional murder, I have addressed my mind to what his sentence would have been had he been convicted of intentional murder.[29]I now turn to the matter of sentence for manslaughter. As I stated, the finding of guilt in relation to manslaughter comes from the direction and clearly shows that the Jury entered the conviction based on the fact that a reasonable person in Frederick Noftall’s position should have foreseen that:i. a probable consequence of the break and entry with intent to commit the offence of theft was bodily harm resulting from that dangerous act, orii. in pursuit of a common intention to steal, murder was committed by Krista Constantine, and Frederick Noftall would have seen at least the risk of bodily harm in carrying out that common intention to steal.[30]The Criminal Code provides a statutory outline for sentencing:“Purpose“718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.“Fundamental Principle“718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.“Other Sentencing Principles“718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender….(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.”[31]The offence of manslaughter was addressed by Justice McLachlin (as she then was) in R. v. Creighton, 1993 CanLII 61 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3; 157 N.R. 1; 65 O.A.C. 321; 83 C.C.C.(3d) 346, at page 374:“The most important feature of the stigma of manslaughter is the stigma which is not attached to it. The Criminal Code confines manslaughter to non-intentional homicide. A person convicted of manslaughter is not a murderer. He or she did not intend to kill someone. A person has been killed through the fault of another, and that is always serious. But by the very act of calling the killing manslaughter the law indicates that the killing is less blameworthy than murder. It may arise from negligence, or it may arise as the unintended result of a lesser unlawful act. The conduct is blameworthy and must be punished, but its stigma does not approach that of murder.”[32]Manslaughter, by its very definition, is an unintentional crime and in this case, according to the findings of the Jury, manslaughter arose as the unintended result of the unlawful act of break and entry with intent to commit theft. Although manslaughter is an unintentional crime, the unlawful act has resulted in a tragic death. The Victim Impact Statement by the family members expressed their great loss and considering their expected desire for vengeance or retribution would, from their perspective, call for a lengthy sentence. Mercer, J., addressed this dilemma in R. v. Canning (C.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 11553 (NL SCTD), 148 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 1; 464 A.P.R. 1 (Nfld. T.D.), where he benefited from the guidance given by our Court of Appeal in R. v. Woodward (H.) (1993), 1993 CanLII 8183 (NL CA), 108 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 240; 339 A.P.R. 240, at page 254.“The purpose of a sentence is not to exact retribution or vengeance for the criminal offence - and a senseless death. To greatly oversimplify a very complex matter, vengeance is not a principle of sentencing and ought to play no part in the process… Whatever the public perception, the sentencing judge is obliged to rely on certain concepts characterized as the ‘principles of sentencing’.” (p. 252)“The common misunderstanding, as logical as it may be, is to think of a sentence and the punishment levied as somehow or other equal to or to be balanced against the particular enormity of the loss of the human life involved. That of course is impossible. It is true that in the offences described above, bodily harm or death will probably result in the increase of a sentence, but there is no attempt to evaluate, assess, or determine the goodness, quality or usefulness of a human life. Imposition of a sentence is not an attempt to reflect the ‘worth’ of a particular human being. That is not the function of a court of criminal law. I repeat, the thrust of the court sanction by way of sentence is to curtail criminal activity and in that effort the sentencing judge must abide by the generally accepted principles of sentencing and that includes a disposition that is proportionate to the offence for which an accused has been convicted and, depending upon the facts and circumstances established in each case, within the range appropriate to the offence.” (p. 254)[33]The range for sentence in manslaughter is from a suspended sentence to life imprisonment. The authorities given to me by counsel are helpful but none are on all fours with the unique circumstances of this case. The facts that make this case unique are that the Jury found that Frederick Noftall did not participate in the murder of Catherine Clowe but did commit a break and entry and, as a result of that unlawful act in which he assisted, a tragic death occurred. In sentencing Mr. Noftall I have been assisted by the principles in Woodward as well as the statutory provisions in the Criminal Code.[34]Like Krista Constantine, Mr. Noftall comes from a troubled background. Dr. Craig, in testimony, suggested that he was a person who was capable of being at serious risk to reoffend, but that assessment was based upon Dr. Craig’s assumption that Mr. Noftall was involved in the murder. This was not the finding of the Jury and it is on their finding that I must impose sentence. I have taken into consideration the principles of sentencing, and in particular the seriousness of the offence. I am also cognizant that the accused has a lengthy criminal record and like Krista Constantine comes from a troubled background.[35]I accept the position taken by counsel for Mr. Noftall that he should be given credit for time served. The normal calculation when a person is on remand is to take into consideration the time served and double it for the purpose of sentence. Although the principle is not binding authority, I see no reason, under the circumstances here, to deviate from that principle.[36]Considering the principles of sentencing, and the authorities, I find that a suitable sentence for a person such as Mr. Noftall who was involved in a break and entry with the intent to steal, but not the murder itself, would be 7 years. Taking into consideration a 6-year credit for time served, I impose a sentence of 1 year in Her Majesty’s Penitentiary.[37]On the break and entry with intent, and unlawful confinement, I would have imposed a sentence of 5 years concurrent to the sentence of 7 years I would have imposed had Mr. Noftall not been on remand. Considering that I am giving him credit for time served in the amount of 6 years, the sentences in relation to the break and entry and the unlawful confinement will be time served.[38]Under the provisions of s. 109(1) and 109(3) of the Criminal Code there will be a life prohibition on weapons.[39]I have discussed with counsel and they agree that because the sentence for Mr. Noftall, considering all the circumstances, is 1 year, I am able to impose probation as well. In that regard, I impose a period of probation for 2 years after Mr. Noftall’s release from prison under the following conditions:1. Keep the peace and be of good behaviour.2. To participate in any treatments deemed beneficial by his supervisor.3. Have no contact with Joseph Clowe or any members of his family.4. Report to his supervisor within 2 days of his release from prison.5. Mr. Noftall will report to the Clerk of the Court on Monday, January 21, 2002 at 10:00 a.m. at which time the probation order will be explained to him in terms of his failure to comply and carry out the provisions and penalties for any breaches as provided by the Criminal Code.Accused sentenced."}

Marriott, 2014 NSCA 28Date:20140325Docket:CAC 352265Registry:HalifaxBetween:Aaron Gregory MarriottAppellantv.Her Majesty The QueenRespondentJudges:Oland, Fichaud and Farrar, JJ.A.Appeal Heard:October 2 and 3, 2013, in Halifax, Nova ScotiaHeld:The fresh evidence motion is allowed, leave to appeal is granted,but the appeal is dismissed, per reasons for judgment of Oland, J.A.; Fichaudand Farrar, JJ.A.Counsel:ElizabethD. Cooper, for the appellantMarkScott, for the respondentStaceyGerrard, for Kevin Burke, Q.C.Reasons for judgment:[1]In the early evening hours of November 18, 2008, gunshots rang out in the parking lot of the children’s hospital in Halifax.Within a month, Aaron Marriott was arrested and charged with three attempted murders, one conspiracy to commit murder, and several weapons offences.He plead guilty to one attempted murder and, in accordance with a joint recommendation by the Crown and his trial counsel, was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.He appeals his sentence and applies to introduce fresh evidence to support his appeal.[2]The appellant submits that the sentencing judge, Justice Kevin Coady of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, erred because essential facts concerning the offence as supplied by the Crown were incomplete or wrong, so he did not receive due process.He also maintains that he did not have the requisite intent for attempted murder, suggests that certain particulars were overlooked, claims breaches of his Charter rights, and argues that his sentence was demonstrably unfit.He does not allege ineffective assistance of counsel.[3]In R. v. Marriott, 2013 NSCA 12 (CanLII) (“Marriott #1”), this panel dealt with certain matters pertaining to this appeal.Fichaud J.A., for the court, determined that Mr. Marriott had impliedly waived his solicitor-client privilege with his former counsel, Kevin Burke, Q.C. to the limited extent as prescribed in that decision.He also held that the Crown’s motion for dismissal of the appellant’s grounds of appeal relating to alleged breaches of the Charter was premature.As I will explain later, that decision led to additional filings, including a fresh evidence motion, and cross-examination of certain affiants at the hearing of this appeal.[4]For the reasons which follow, I would allow the fresh evidence motion, grant the leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal.Background:[5]I begin by quoting from Marriott #1 which included a summary of theprocedural history pertaining to the charge, the plea and joint recommendation, and the sentencing hearing:[4]Mr. Marriott was charged, on a multi-count information, with attempted murder of Jason Hallett.His co-accused were Jeremy LeBlanc, Matthew Murphy and Shaun Smith.[5]The event occurred on the evening of November 18, 2008 outside the IWK Children’s Hospital in Halifax. …[6]Mr. Marriott elected a trial by judge and jury in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.He was represented by Mr. Kevin Burke, Q.C., an experienced criminal counsel.According to the comments by counsel to the trial judge, there had been an extensive and lengthy evaluation of evidence and negotiation between the Crown and Mr. Burke.Mr. Burke said he had “extensive discussions with my client, before an agreement was reached here”.As a result, on the opening day of trial, April 26, 2011, Mr. Marriott entered a guilty plea to attempted murder under s. 239 of the Criminal Code.Justice Kevin Coady of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia presided.The sentencing was adjourned to May 16, 2011, to enable the Crown and defence to place before the Court the basis for their joint recommendation on sentence.No pre-sentence report was requested.[7]The guilty plea and joint position incorporated more than one file for which Mr. Marriott was subject to prosecution.The plea and recommendation were premised partly on the Crown’s withdrawal of an eleven count indictment alleging, among other things, another attempted murder by Mr. Marriott on the same victim three months before the IWK event.[8]The sentencing hearing proceeded on May 16, 2011, Justice Coady again presiding.[9]At the sentencing hearing, the Crown’s brief included a statement of facts … that both counsel informed the sentencing judge was not in dispute.The Crown and Mr. Marriott’s counsel jointly recommended a forward sentence of fifteen years, meaning no reduction for remand custody from the fifteen years.Mr. Marriott’s counsel informed the court that Mr. Marriott understood the implications, including segregation, of penitentiary time for his offence.Mr. Marriott attended during the sentencing hearing on May 16, 2011, addressed the Court after hearing the submissions by the Crown and his own counsel, said he took full responsibility, and said “I have to face the consequences and take my punishment”.[6]An elaboration of the facts leading to this appeal is necessary to provide the requisite context.On April 26, 2011 when Mr. Marriott elected to be tried by a judge and jury, Mr. Burke asked that the attempted murder charge be read and said that the appellant would enter a plea.The transcript sets out Mr. Marriott’s plea of guilty and the judge’s questions to him, including in regard to disclosure:COURT CLERK:AARON GREGORY MARRIOTT, you stand charged that on or about the 18th day of November, 2008, at or near Halifax, that you did attempt to murder Jason William Hallett while using a firearm, by discharging a firearm at Jason William Hallett, contrary to Section 239(a) of the Criminal Code.\"How do you plead?AARON MARRIOTT:Guilty.THE COURT:Any comments on the remaining counts?MS. SMITH:Yes.Again, My Lord, it would be the Crown's intention, if that plea is accepted, to withdraw the remaining counts on the indictment.We have, again, a request for an adjourned sentencing date.The date convenient to Mr. Burke and myself would be May 16th at 9:30 a.m., for two hours.And we will have a joint recommendation to make to the court at that time.THE COURT:Thank you.All right.Mr. Marriott, you've indicated that ... you have indicated your willingness to plead guilty to count number 2, as I understand it?AARON MARRIOTT:Yes, Your Honour.THE COURT:All right.You understand ... And you've received disclosure; you understand what they're alleging you did?AARON MARRIOTT:Yes.THE COURT:All right.And can you assure me that no one is bringing any pressure to bear on you to plead this out?AARON MARRIOTT:No, Your Honour.THE COURT:And you understand that you are presumed innocent, as you stand here now, until I accept your plea, but you're giving it up and you're going to be guilty?AARON MARRIOTT:Yes.THE COURT:You understand that?AARON MARRIOTT:Yeah.THE COURT:And you understand that the joint recommendation that may, that your counsel and Ms. Smith have spoken about, that I'm not necessarily bound by that?AARON MARRIOTT:Yes, I understand.THE COURT:Okay.I'm prepared to accept his plea.… I'll put Mr. Marriott's sentencing over til May 16th at 9:30 a.m. …[7]Ms. Smith advised that she would have the Indictments, which contained charges that would be withdrawn, brought before the court on May 16th.Mr. Burke confirmed that no pre-sentence report was sought.[8]The transcript of the May 16, 2011 hearing included the Crown’s and trial counsel’s submissions on sentencing and their joint recommendation.The submissions recounted the event which led to the charge of attempted murder and some particulars about the appellant.Thetranscript reads in part:MS. SMITH:And as I had indicated to the Court, and I believe it may have been indicated on the day that Mr. Marriott entered his plea, my friend and I have a joint recommendation before the court today's date.THE COURT:All right....SUBMISSION ON SENTENCING BY MS. SMITHMS. SMITH:...The facts in relation to this matter are referred to at length in the brief filed by the Crown, and I will touch on them briefly.These matters are not in dispute as between my friend and myself.The sequence of events that unfolded on November 18th of 2008 unfolded very rapidly, beginning with a call from the girlfriend of Jeremy LeBlanc, an associate of Mr. Marriott's, advising that one Jason Hallett could be located at the IWK Hospital in downtown Halifax.Within half an hour of that call being received, Mr. Hallett was shot by Mr. Marriott in the front area of the hospital's parking outside of the entrance, these events having unfolded with that call and the result being that Mr. Marriott, along with others, traveled to the hospital via two separate vehicles.Once there, Mr. Hallett was located, quite by chance, as he had come out of the building, from visiting his infant child, to have a smoke and to obtain more cigarettes from a friend.At the time that Mr. Hallett was shot by Mr. Marriott, Mr. Hallett was shot while seated in the passenger seat in the front of a Jeep Cherokee being operated by the person who had come to provide him with cigarettes.There was another individual who was in the back seat at that time.This shooting occurred at approximately 6:45 p.m. on a weekday evening.Mr. Hallett was shot at close range with a handgun.He was struck in the wrist, and this was despite the fact that witnesses would say anywhere from three to five shots were fired into the Cherokee.Certainly, on a forensic examination of the vehicle, the vehicle was hit with at least three distinct projectiles.The injury that Mr. Hallett suffered was superficial; it required some treatment by way of stitches at the Emergency, and Mr. Hallett was certainly releasable that day.The motivation for this crime, as if there could ever be any good one, was simply that Mr. Hallett had switched allegiances from one rival crime group to another.Mr. Marriott is 20 years of age.He comes before the court with 22 prior convictions, those convictions having been entered between 2004 and 2011.Essentially, the last seven years saw Mr. Marriott amass these 22 prior convictions.In 2004, when his criminal record began, he was a mere 13 years of age.All of his prior convictions, save for one, had been committed while he was a youth.The one that has been committed since he was an adult occurred while he was on remand in relation to this offence and related to ...THE COURT:Did you say of the 22 prior convictions ...MS. SMITH:Yes.THE COURT:How many were as a youth?MS. SMITH:21.THE COURT:21 as a youth.MS. SMITH:21 of those.The one prior or the one conviction that occurred as an adult occurred since Mr. Marriott has been on remand for this offence and relates to a mischief offence that occurred in the correctional facility.This record of Mr. Marriott's includes crimes of violence, weapons offences and drug trafficking.We do not have the benefit of a pre-sentence report before the court.My friend and I have discussed this matter, and I'm sure Mr. Burke will have much to say about Mr. Marriott's personal circumstances.I can recall, certainly, from reading past pre-sentence reports in relation to Mr. Marriott, that he was said to come from a law-abiding family, to have had the benefit of a good upbringing, to have had opportunities to have played hockey and engage in sports as a young person.Very clearly, this was a lifestyle that Mr. Marriott chose....The recommendation that my friend and I have reached, on a very considered basis, Your Lordship, is for a sentence of 15 years' imprisonment.That would be on a go-forward basis, with no credit for the remand time that Mr. Marriott has served to date, which has been since his arrest some two and a half years ago, in December of 2008.Effectively, the recommendation that the Crown makes and which my friend has joined in has already taken into account the remand time that Mr. Hallett(sic) [from transcript] has served.This is a primary designated offence and, as such, we're asking that a DNA order be made.I have provided a copy to the clerk for the court.My friend has a copy.As well, there is a mandatory firearms order and, because of the previous order made against Mr. Marriott, that order should be for life....SUBMISSION ON SENTENCING BY MR. BURKEMR. BURKE:Thank you, Your Honour, My Lord. The facts that the Crown has outlined to the court, for the most part, I don't take issue with.The comments concerning Mr. Hallett, I think, deserves a little more elaboration than maybe what my learned friend has pointed out to the court.Mr. Hallett was carrying a handgun at the time, carrying a handgun inside the Children’s Hospital, a loaded handgun. It’s very difficult to appreciate the emotional impact that this particular incident had on Mr. Hallett, given the fact that he has quite a history in terms of his participation in one criminal gang versus another, the fact that he was carrying a handgun into a public children’s hospital on, I believe it’s on the second floor, for no other purpose, I would respectfully suggest, than had he had to use the handgun, that the handgun would have been there for use. And so I point that out to the court, not in the sense that if any particular person is a victim of violence that, obviously, they’re going to suffer some degree of trauma as a result, but given the fact that there are special circumstances as it relates to Jason Hallett that I think need to be taken into consideration, as well.As my learned friend has pointed out, there have been extensive discussions in respect to this matter.The discussions not only focused on the IWK incident but also has focused on other matters that, as Your Lordship can see, are presently before this court and will be dealt with as part of the whole submission that's being made here this morning.The discussions as it relates to this joint recommendation commenced close to a year ago.They've been ongoing for some considerable period of time.I have had extensive discussions with the Crown, as well, extensive discussions with my client, before an agreement was reached here.A number of factors have been carefully considered and, in particular, the strength of the Crown's case as it related to this particular incident and also as it relates to the other matters that are presently before the court.So the sentence that's being suggested here is not an undue lenient sentence, by any stretch of the imagination.It's a 15 year sentence, commencing today, that also recognizes that Mr. Marriott has been in custody since December of 2008, December 11th, 2008.So he's got 29 months in pre-trial custody.Now, obviously, that has to be reflected, and it is reflected, the fact that he is, essentially, being sentenced without any two-for-one credit being considered at all, that he's looking at 17 years and five months....Now, of course, the difficulty that he's facing is that ... and Mr. Marriott knows that, as well as a lot of us, that he'll be sentenced and he'll be sent to Renous and, because of past associations, he will be dealt with accordingly.In other words, he will be segregated.He will be segregated with his past associates, which creates an almost insurmountable difficulty in trying to extract himself from a never-ending scenario.He will then be in the same situation that he would have been, say, growing up, when he was 13 or 14 or 15, in Spryfield, or the same thing in Burnside.There's no course corrections here.What, in essence, will happen is that there'll be a lot of associates that would be put on the same range as Mr. Marriott, from the officials' point of view, more for control than anything.No attempt at rehabilitation of any meaningful, in any meaningful way.It will be simply a matter of control.And consequently, he has to be looking at a sentence of 15 years that really nothing is changing in his environment.He's in the same environment that he moved out of in Spryfield into Burnside and on to Renous.The only possibility that he has is to, essentially, apply for a transfer, which everyone else is doing.And that even follows him wherever he goes, whether it's B.C. or Ontario or Alberta, that the association of being involved with a \"gang\" automatically characterizes him and where he's going to be placed in whatever institution.So it's a very difficult future that a 20-year-old faces.Even if he has a sincere and honest desire to somehow change his life, if he recognizes that he has a level of intelligence that can allow him to change, he recognizes that the only person that is going to give him any assistance, any assistance whatsoever, is himself.And this is something he's learned in Burnside, that his contacts, his communications with, say, professors at Acadia may open a world to him, but you can see, without much further consideration, that that's a very, very small part of what his life is going to be like when he's sent to Renous.He recognizes that unless something should come out of these efforts that he's making, in terms of trying to get a university degree, that he's looking at two situations: one, that he'll end up doing two-thirds of his time - he's 20 years old, he's ... he knows that - not one-third of his time, by virtue of his being associated, his being, I guess, pigeon-holed or characterized.So you're looking at 10 years, not five years, in terms of when he actually has a realistic possibility of being released.So he's, essentially, going to be from 20 to 30 years old at the time when he is applying....Mr. Marriott ...What I'm, essentially, relating to the court today, Mr. Marriott has related to me, over a number of discussions that we've had over the past several years.These are views, these are feelings that he has expressed to me, that I'm passing along to the court.And it's a rather tragic situation that we are looking at today.It is a joint recommendation, and Mr. Marriott is prepared, he understands what 15 years is all about and he's prepared to accept it and to deal with it.And the way he's going to try an (sic) deal with it is the way that I've explained it to the court today.Those are my comments.THE COURT:Mr. Marriott, would you like to say anything?AARON MARRIOTT:Do you think I could have a brief recess first?Is there any way ...[9]After a recess of a full hour, Mr. Marriott addressed the judge and took sole responsibility for his actions.He even exonerated two of the others who had been charged.The transcript reads:THE COURT:...All right.Mr. Marriott, did you wish to say something, sir?AARON MARRIOTT:Yes, Your Honour.I've prepared a few things.THE COURT:Well, you go ahead, sir.AARON MARRIOTT:First of all, Your Honour, I would like to take this moment to address the court.I would like to apologize for what I did.I am very remorseful, and I definitely regret my actions on that night.I would also like to apologize to the public for what I did.What I did was unacceptable and I have no excuses for what happened, but what did happen should have never taken place in the location that it did, under any circumstances.I am sorry for what I did, but I deeply regret that it happened in such a public place.I would like to apologize to my family for everything that I've put them through.They also suffered the consequences of my actions.They also feel the punishment.So I am sorry for everything that I put them through.I not only messed up my own life but also theirs.I would also like to sincerely apologize to two people, in particular, Jeremy LeBlanc and Matthew Murphy, and also their families.I am sorry for dragging them into this mess.What I did was unpredictable and completely out of character for me.Jeremy LeBlanc and Matthew Murphy are completely innocent.They are both standing trial because of my actions and the decisions that I made.There is no way possible that they could have known what I was going to do that night.Unless they had psychic abilities, they didn't know what was about to happen.I didn't even know what I was going to do.I'm not sure exactly when I made the decision, but it was sometime between getting out of my vehicle and walking toward the victim.It was my fault for having a loaded handgun on me.There was no way that Jeremy or Matthew could have known I was carrying a gun on me.I am using this opportunity to let the courts know that two completely innocent men are facing charges because of my actions.And what I done has affected so many people - my family, them, their families, the victim, his family, all the people that were at the IWK that night when I did what I did.I'm responsible for what happened, and not them.I can't explain the weight that I have been carrying with me during the last two and a half years that I have been incarcerated, knowing that my actions have affected as many people's lives as they did.I have no excuses for what I did.I definitely regret it.There's no way that I can undo it.And I know that all there is now is I have to face the consequences and take my punishment.THE COURT:Thank you, Mr. Marriott.AARON MARRIOTT:Thank you for your time, Your Honour.[10]The judge then accepted Mr. Marriott’s re-election to judge alone for an 11-count Indictment.After the Crown advised that it would not be offering evidence on any count other than one attempted murder, the judge dismissed the remaining ten charges.[11]At the beginning of their submissions on sentencing, both counsel referred to the facts as contained in the Crown’s brief.The Crown told the judge that those facts quoted “are not in dispute as between my friend and myself”.Similarly, Mr. Burke stated that “[t]he facts that the Crown has outlined to the court, for the most part, I don’t take issue with”.He did add that Mr. Hallett had a loaded handgun at the time.No evidence was presented at the sentencing, and no pre-sentence report was prepared.[12]The statement of facts in the Crown’s sentencing brief recounted the events of November 18, 2008 and the arrests of Messrs. LeBlanc, Murphy, Smith and Marriott.According to the appellant, errors and omissions in this document led to the imposition of a demonstrably unfit sentence.Here is what the statement of facts said:Part 1 – Facts1.On November 18, 2008, Jeremy Leblanc (hereinafter “LEBLANC”) and his associates, including Aaron Marriott (hereinafter “MARRIOTT”) made a plan to kill Jason Hallett (hereinafter “HALLETT”).They were unaware that while they made this plan the police were listening.2.Operation Intrude was a joint investigation by RCMP and Halifax Regional Police into Criminal Code and C.D.S.A. offences being committed by a targeted group of individuals who were subject to surveillance of different varieties, including phone intercepts.MARRIOTT, LEBLANC, and Shaun Smith (hereinafter “SMITH”) were known to police to be members of a group working in the illicit drug trade and referring to themselves as the “Spryfield M.O.B.”3.On the date in question, judicial authorization to intercept MARRIOTT, LEBLANC and SMITH’s phone calls, and phone calls of other LEBLANC associates, was obtained by police.Consequently, the phone conversations that took place between and among LEBLANC, MARRIOTT, SMITH and Matthew Murphy (hereinafter “MURPHY”) as the plan to kill HALLETT developed, were recorded.4.On November 18, 2008, at approximately 6:09 pm, LEBLANC received a phone call from his then-girlfriend, Jennifer Hachey, who worked at the IWK Children’s Hospital in Halifax.Hachey told LEBLANC that HALLETT was at the IWK hospital.LEBLANC told Hachey, “just do your job, okay?”(see Intercepts, Tab 1).5.LEBLANC proceeded to communicate by phone with each of SMITH and MARRIOTT, informing them that HALLETT, a member of a rival gang, was at the IWK Hospital.LEBLANC was already proceeding to the IWK hospital in a vehicle with MURPHY.MARRIOTT and SMITH drove together to the IWK hospital in a Chevrolet Blazer that was missing its rear window, and that had clear plastic affixed in the place of the rear window with bright red tape.The Blazer’s license plate was ENM 609.6.MARRIOTT and SMITH stopped to meet with Dawn Anne Bremner at approximately 6:26 pm, before carrying on to the IWK hospital.7.While proceeding to the IWK hospital, MARRIOTT phoned LEBLANC to clarify where Hachey worked, and LEBLANC confirmed to SMITH and MARRIOTT that HALLETT was located at the IWK hospital: “the same place we were lookin’ before” (see Intercepts, Tab 9).During this phone conversation, LEBLANC directed MARRIOTT not to run right in to the hospital in order to carry out their plan, since Hachey was working there, and her employer “might fuck around with her later.”8.HALLETT was at the IWK hospital because his child had been born there a few days earlier, and the child was still admitted to the hospital.9.LEBLANC and MURPHY arrived first together at the IWK hospital on the evening of November 18, 2008.From within their vehicle, they covertly observed HALLETT outside the hospital, and passed information about HALLETT’s location to SMITH by phone.HALLETT had come down from visiting his child inside the hospital in order to smoke a cigarette outside of the hospital, and in order to obtain more cigarettes from a friend.HALLETT had a handgun in his possession at that time.10.When LEBLANC indicated to SMITH over the phone that HALLETT might be leaving the hospital grounds, SMITH expressed to LEBLANC a desire to block HALLETT from leaving.11.Subsequently, after it became evident that HALLETT was not leaving the hospital yet, LEBLANC and MURPHY, while on the phone with SMITH, drove beside HALLETT’s exact position, and MURPHY told SMITH that HALLETT was “right there on the right.”At this point, SMITH is heard saying, “gimme, gimme the gat” (see Intercepts, Tab 11).12.Shortly afterward, in a subsequent phone call, LEBLANC and MURPHY told SMITH that HALLETT had jumped into a Cherokee (a Jeep sport utility vehicle).13.In the final phone call before HALLETT was shot, LEBLANC and MURPHY confirmed the location of the Cherokee, “right in front,” to SMITH and MARRIOTT (see Intercepts, Tab 13).SMITH then told MARRIOTT, “get out and blaze that Cherokee.”14.At approximately 6:45 pm, MARRIOTT then exited the Blazer, dressed all in white and wearing a hooded sweatshirt with the hood pulled close over his face, and proceeded to walk up to the Cherokee that HALLETT and two other passengers were sitting inside.15.MARRIOTT fired several shots at close range from a handgun into the Cherokee in an attempt to kill HALLETT.Various eyewitnesses reported having heard anywhere between three and five shots.Forensic analysis revealed that the Cherokee had sustained damage from at least three different fired projectiles, and that the projectiles were most likely fired from a .375, .38, or 9 millimetre-calibre pistol or revolver.16.MARRIOTT then turned and ran back to the Blazer.Once he was inside the Blazer, SMITH drove away proceeding Westbound in an Eastbound lane on University Avenue, and then Northbound on Robie Street.An eyewitness who was in a vehicle behind the Blazer on Robie Street called 911 to report the Blazer, as the eyewitness suspected that the driver was intoxicated on the basis of the Blazer’s erratic and dangerous driving through traffic.17.HALLETT was hit only once, in the wrist, by the shots that were fired at him.He received emergency medical treatment at the QEII hospital shortly after the shooting, and was discharged from that hospital the same night.18.No one else was injured in the shooting, although the shooting caused a substantial disruption to the IWK hospital, which declared a “Code” and a form of lockdown in relation to the shooting, and to the witnesses who were all kept behind for hours and asked to provide statements to police investigators.19.Multiple eyewitnesses who were present in very close proximity to the Cherokee at the time of the shooting, and the IWK hospital security camera footage, all indicated that an individual who was dressed completely in white walked up to and fired several shots into the Jeep Cherokee.The shooting took place at or around a normal IWK hospital staff shift change, so there was substantial pedestrian and vehicular traffic around the entrance to the hospital at the time of the shooting.20.HALLETT positively identified the individual who shot him as Aaron MARRIOTT.Although HALLETT was initially reluctant to cooperate with police investigators, he indicated to a police officer who was at the QEII hospital on the night of November 18, 2008, that MARRIOTT was the shooter, and HALLETT has subsequently confirmed this information to the police throughout the investigation into the shooting.21.MARRIOTT was arrested on December 11, 2008, for shooting HALLETT; the arrest took place after HALLETT had agreed to cooperate with the police investigation.22.SMITH, LEBLANC, and MURPHY were later arrested for their roles in the shooting, but only after the expiration of the Operation Intrude judicial authorization to intercept communications that yielded the intercepted phone calls relating to the shooting of HALLETT.23.HALLETT has been placed in witness protection for his safety as a result of his participation in police investigation into the shooting and his testimony at judicial proceedings arising from the shooting.24.HALLETT has suffered substantial psychological trauma as a result of the shooting.He is unable to maintain the relationships and the lifestyle that he knew prior to the shooting.[13]After hearing counsels’ submissions, the judge accepted their joint recommendation.He sentenced Mr. Marriott to fifteen years’ incarceration.His oral decision of May 16, 2011 included:I am familiar with the principles and objectives of sentencing as set out in the Criminal Code, and I’m not going to repeat them here. And I’m very familiar with the similar cases that have been provided to me by counsel that helped me determine if the joint recommendation is an appropriate recommendation. And I will say, after consideration of those authorities, I have no difficulty accepting the joint recommendation of 15 years. I recognize that the law says I should accept joint recommendations unless I can articulate a good reason not to, and I have no hesitation in saying, in this case, that I have no such reason that I could possibly articulate.... Ms. Smith got it right when she described this as a botched first degree murder. ... But when our citizens hear about an attempt to murder someone at 6:45 p.m. at the local maternity and children’s hospital, things change considerably. When they hear about someone running up to another person in a vehicle and blasting them three to five times with a high-powered pistol, in the middle of that parking lot, it sends out a message that’s new to the general community.... But this type of shooting and the great possibility of what one could callously call collateral damage has done great damage to our community and our citizens and their sense of self, well being.The other tragedy is that Mr. Marriott stands before this court as a 20 year old person who’s been in jail for all of his adult life. ...These factors tell me it’s all about accepting peer pressure and wanting to make his mark in the criminal community, without very much thought about the consequences of what would happen to the person receiving the damage and himself. In a way, as I was sketching out my remarks, I wanted to say to Mr. Marriott just how lucky he is. It’s something I want you to think about in the coming years. Mr. Hallett could be dead, and that would be a lost life, and you could be facing a life sentence with no chance of parole for 25 years.… But I think it’s very clear from the comments of your counsel, and which I know from my own experience, that you must disassociate yourself from your fellow offenders in jail and over the years, if you want to have any chance whatsoever of a better life in your 30s, 40s, and 50s.… I am going to sentence you to 15 years in prison for your involvement in this offence.The Appeal:[14]Mr. Marriott was unrepresented when he filed a Notice of Appeal against sentence with this Court.Among other things, he appealed on “the basis of incompetent counsel.”That ground was withdrawn when his current appeal counsel filed an Amended Notice of Appeal, and other grounds including alleged breaches of his Charter rights were added.[15]As mentioned earlier, this panel dealt with certain matters pertaining to the appeal in Marriott #1.We found that Mr. Marriott had impliedly waived solicitor-client privilege.This Court subsequently received an affidavit sworn by Mr. Burke, his trial counsel.[16]On his appeal, Mr. Marriott sought to adduce fresh evidence.His grounds of appeal submit that:1.the sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment pursuant to s.12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms;2.the sentence is demonstrably unfit;3.the sentence is unduly disparate compared to those of the co-offenders; and4.notwithstanding the joint recommendation, the trial Judge failed to place sufficient emphasis on mitigating factors.I will deal with the last three items together.Consequently, there are three matters to be decided:(a)whether to receive fresh evidence on appeal (b)whether the sentence breached s. 12 of the Charter, and (c)whether the sentence was demonstrably unfit.Fresh Evidence Motion:[17]The appellant moved to introduce evidence which was not presented when he was sentenced because the sentencing went forward by way of joint recommendation.[18]In Marriott #1, Justice Fichaud described the Court’s request to Mr. Marriott’s counsel to list those items which the appellant says were incorrect in the Agreed Statement of Facts before the sentencing judge and her response.He also summarized extracts from the brief for the fresh evidence motion, which came before us on the appeal:[23]On January 8, 2013, Mr. Marriott’s counsel filed a letter that said “The Appellant disagrees with” seven points in the statement of facts that had been put to the sentencing judge.Those points of disagreement are significant, and include the wording in the statement of facts that:“Marriott made a plan to kill Jason Hallett.” (Statement of Fact # 1)“Marriott ... were known to the police to be members of a group working in the illicit drug trade and referring to themselves as the ‘Spryfield M.O.B.’ ” (Statement of Fact # 2)That the victim, Jason Hallett was “a member of a rival gang”. (Statement of Fact # 5)[24]In her written and oral submissions to the Court of Appeal, Mr. Marriott’s counsel also contended that, apart from the inaccuracies, the facts put to the sentencing judge were incomplete, as of the date of the sentencing hearing, in a number of material respects.[25]As to how these alleged inaccuracies and deficiencies came to be in the position jointly stated to the sentencing judge, we have the following.Mr. Marriott’s affidavit of September 7, 2012, says:18.I was never shown the agreed statement of facts that formed part of the Crown’s brief.His factum says:1.... Because of his guilty plea, the facts in relation to the Appellant were not brought forward.His Brief for the Fresh Evidence Motion says:22.The Appellant was told, by his counsel, that he would have the weekend to think about the proposed sentence.25.The Appellant had no opportunity to see the agreed statement of facts, nor any opportunity to review the contents of the Crown’s position contained in the Crown’s brief filed at his sentencing, that forms the basis of his sentence.71.The way the Appellant was sentenced, he was left in the cold with nothing said about him.93.... He is simply stating the fact that he did not see the agreed statement of facts, nor the justification for the Crown’s sentence, before his sentencing. As well, the sentence that he received, that was agreed upon by the Crown and his attorney, was not communicated to him until the day before he pleaded guilty to the offence, on which the sentence is based.109.The nature of the joint recommendation on sentence in the Appellant’s case, that excluded any credit whatsoever for the 2.4 years that the Appellant spent in pre-trial custody, silenced [underlining in the Brief] Mr. Burke, Q.C. from having any opportunity to raise a Charter argument on sentencing.156.... very little about his background was brought to the attention of the Court at his sentencing.159.While a pre-sentence report would have been of assistance in the Appellant’s case, it was not required for a joint recommendation on sentence, and neither the Crown nor the defence at trial requested that one be prepared.[19]The appellant’s motion to adduce fresh evidence was supported by several affidavits, some with numerous attachments:(a)Mr. Marriott’s affidavit sworn September 7, 2012 which, among other things, deposed that:(i)he had been charged with three attempted murders, one conspiracy to commit murder and several weapons offences and, in exchange for the dropping of two of the attempted murders and the other charges, he had pled guilty to the attempted murder of Mr. Hallett;(ii)he was out on his own at age 13, his attempts to return home were unsuccessful;(iii)his criminal record “consisted of schoolyard quarrels”;(iv)while in pre-trial custody, he was kept in solitary confinement for lengthy periods;(v)during pre-trial custody, he completed a high school equivalency and was accepted into Acadia University;(vi)after sentencing, he experienced difficult times in the federal penitentiary system, including segregation; and(vii)he was eventually transferred to the medium security institution at Drumheller Institution in Alberta, and accepted to Athabasca University.(b)His Supplementary Affidavit sworn December 5, 2012 which provided further details of the conditions of his pre-trial custody and, in particular, periods of segregation at Central Nova (Burnside) and at the facilities at Southwest Nova and Cape Breton Correctional, and described the complaints he made to prison authorities and their responses;(c)His Second Supplementary Affidavit sworn June 25, 2013 which supplied additional details regarding his treatment in the correctional institutions;(d)The affidavit of his appellate counsel sworn on June 28, 2013, to which were appended 11 exhibits intended to provide the full circumstances of the offence for which Mr. Marriott was sentenced. These included a transcript and audio of the police wiretap evidence, a DVD containing police interviews of Mr. Hallett, and surveillance videos of the shooting outside the children’s hospital;(e)A second affidavit from his appellate counsel, also sworn on June 28, 2013, to which were appended documents pertaining to a riot at the Central Nova Scotia Correctional Facility (Burnside) on April 8, 2009 and Mr. Marriott’s sentence on September 24, 2010 to four months in custody by Judge D. William MacDonald in an unreported decision, including the transcript of the proceedings and the brief filed by his counsel on Charter issues for that matter; and(f)The affidavit of Donald Bureaux, President of Nova Scotia Community College and part-time lecturer at Acadia University regarding Mr. Marriott’s performance in his first year business course.[20]In response to the appellant’s fresh evidence motion, the Crown filed 14 documents.These included correspondence between the Crown Prosecutor at trial and Mr. Burke, material pertaining to previous offences the appellant committed, a 2006 Pre-Sentence Report pertaining to Mr. Marriott, and the sentencing decision pertaining to the appellant’s conviction for property damage in relation to the prison riot.Mr. Marriott then filed further material in relation to his earlier convictions.[21]The hearing of the motion to adduce fresh evidence and the merits of the appeal consumed two days.It commenced with short submissions on whether the Crown should be permitted to cross-examine Mr. Burke on his affidavit.The panel determined that this was appropriate.Each of Crown counsel and counsel for the appellant cross-examined Mr. Burke.The Crown’s cross-examination of Mr. Marriott on his affidavit evidence was followed by re-direct by the appellant’s counsel.His counsel then cross-examined Cst. Benny Kirton on his affidavit and played portions of the DVD video pertaining to the shooting of Mr. Hallett in the hospital parking lot.On the second day of the hearing, counsel presented their submissions on the fresh evidence motion and the appeal.[22]Fresh evidence may be received provided the criteria in Palmer v. The Queen, 1979 CanLII 8 (SCC), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 as modified by R. v. Lévesque, 2000 SCC 47 (CanLII) are satisfied.The evidence should generally not be admissible if, by due diligence, it could have been adduced at trial;however, this criteria will not be applied as strictly in criminal cases as in civil cases.The fresh evidence must be relevant and probative and, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, must be expected to have affected the result.The admissibility criteria are the same for appeals against sentence as they are for appeals from verdict:Lévesque at ¶ 22.[23]In this case, the proffered fresh evidence was not presented to the judge at the sentencing hearing because sentencing proceeded by way of a joint submission.While some of it may have been available then, an appeal against sentencing in the circumstances of this proceeding persuades me that the somewhat relaxed due diligence criteria in criminal proceedings has been satisfied.[24]I also accept that the material tendered as fresh evidence is relevant and credible, and could have affected the result, namely the sentence imposed on the appellant.In doing so, I observe that whether some of the material was in admissible form may be questionable; however, I need not decide that aspect to determine this appeal.Cruel and Unusual Punishment:[25]The appellant submits that it was the actions by the state that led to inaccurate and incomplete material in the statement of facts before the judge at his sentencing.This then resulted in mitigating circumstances not being presented, including his being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment contrary to s. 12 of the Charter while incarcerated.[26]His affidavit evidence shows that while incarcerated before sentencing, Mr. Marriott was subjected to several periods of segregation.These included ten days of solitary for a fight, 73 days pursuant to a mischief charge arising out of a prison riot, ten days segregation for a fight in the back of the sheriff’s van, 15 days segregation for another fight, and 11 days segregation for making liquor.He claims that on other occasions, other inmates caused disruptions for which he was also blamed and ended up in segregation.He complains that during periods of segregation, he was locked down for 20 to 24 hours a day, refused fresh air almost every day and forced to wear handcuffs.[27]The appellant deposed that after sentencing in the spring of 2011, he was held in administrative segregation for months during which he was locked down 22 to 23 hours a day, and only allowed to shower every second day.He complained several times to the authorities at the correctional institutions about his treatment when he had not been in any trouble there.In a request to see a psychologist, the appellant explained that he felt like a fish in a fish bowl, and had a permanent headache and severe anxiety when he had never had anxiety before.According to his affidavit, a security intelligence officer told him that he was held in segregation because previously the institution had a lot of problems with people from Spryfield or those who associated with them.[28]The appellant raises this Charter argument for the first time on appeal.Generally, new grounds on appeal are allowed only in exceptional circumstances.The appellate court has no trial decision to review and the record is often insufficient:R. v. Phillips, 2006 NSCA 135 (CanLII), at ¶ 30-33.[29]In her dissenting judgment in R. v. Brown, 1993 CanLII 114 (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 918 (S.C.C.), L’Heureux-Dubé J. explained the rationale for the prohibition at pp. 923-24:. . .[T]he general prohibition against new arguments on appeal supports the overarching societal interest in the finality of litigation in criminal matters. Were there to be no limits on the issues that may be raised on appeal, such finality would become an illusion. Both the Crown and the defence would face uncertainty, as counsel for both sides, having discovered that the strategy adopted at trial did not result in the desired or expected verdict, devised new approaches. Costs would escalate and the resolution of criminal matters could be spread out over years in the most routine cases. Moreover, society's expectation that criminal matters will be disposed of fairly and fully at the first instance and its respect for the administration of justice would be undermined. Juries would rightfully be uncertain if they were fulfilling an important societal function or merely wasting their time. For these reasons, courts have always adhered closely to the rule that such tactics will not be permitted.She also set out at p. 927 the factors that must be satisfied before a new issue, including a Charter challenge, is permitted on appeal:… First, there must be a sufficient evidentiary record to resolve the issue. Second, it must not be an instance in which the accused for tactical reasons failed to raise the issue at trial. Third, the court must be satisfied that no miscarriage of justice will result from the refusal to raise such new issue on appeal.[30]Does the record indicate that the appellant’s failure to bring forwardCharter arguments based on segregation he experienced while incarcerated prior to sentencing was other than a tactical decision?I am not persuaded that it was.[31]It was no surprise to Mr. Marriott that he was likely to be segregated after sentencing.He was in the courtroom when his trial counsel, in making his submissions to the sentencing judge, spoke of Mr. Marriott knowing that because of “past associations”, “he will be segregated” and that his imprisonment would be a matter of control rather than meaningful rehabilitation.The appellant made no protest regarding these comments.[32]Mr. Marriott was also well aware that Charter arguments could be raised.After all, he had relied on s. 11(h) of the Charter at the September 2010 hearing in regard to the property damage charges arising from the prison riot, for which he was sentenced to four months imprisonment.Yet, at his sentencing in May 2011 for attempted murder, a far more serious charge, for which the Crown was seeking 15 years on a go forward basis, he was silent in regard to Charter issues.Even when he himself was given an opportunity to address the court, the appellant made no complaint about the conditions of his incarceration as described in his affidavit evidence.[33]Mr. Marriott, in his written and oral submissions, argues that the joint recommendation “silenced” Mr. Burke from having any opportunity to raise a Charter argument on sentencing.However, all that was elicited from trial counsel during cross-examination before this panel was that, had he walked in at sentencing and started raising any issues, such as Charter arguments,“the thing would have come to an abrupt halt and ... I would expect the matter would have been adjourned and there would have been a great deal of discussion as to what, what’s the next procedure.”The “thing” to which Mr. Burke was referring was the negotiated joint submission.His evidence does not amount to anything more than the reality that, the Crown and trial counsel having come to an agreement, any last-minute challenges or deviations would unwind the joint submission.[34]It appears that the appellant is equating the fact of segregation with prima facie cruel and unusual punishment, contrary to s. 12 of the Charter.But segregation is not an automatic breach of that Charter right.In R. v. Olson (1987), 1987 CanLII 4314 (ON CA), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 534 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d 1989 CanLII 120 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 296 (S.C.C.), the appellant inmate submitted that his confinement to his cell for 23 hours each day amounted to cruel or unusual punishment.Brooke, J.A. writing for the Ontario Court of Appeal stated at ¶ 41 that “[s]egregation to a prison within a prison is not, per se, cruel and unusual treatment … [but] it may become so if it is so excessive as to outrage standards of decency.”In his reasons, he observed at ¶ 32 that:… Unlike the complaints in McCann v. The Queen (1975), 1975 CanLII 1104 (FC), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 337, 68 D.L.R. (3d) 661, [1976] 1 F.C. 570 (T.D.), the appellant has not complained about the nature of the place or cleanliness or the lack of food or reasonable comfort, or brutality or conduct which one might think is not necessary for security, nor does he complain that he is arbitrarily denied any privileges ordinarily enjoyed by other inmates save those excluded by the nature of his confinement. …After reviewing all the evidence, he determined that the long-term segregation in that case was not so excessive as to amount to a Charter breach.The Supreme Court of Canada affirmed his decision on a different, narrow issue, which did not require it to comment or endorse Brooke J.A.’s reasoning.[35]Thus, Olson is the leading case on whether segregation constitutes “treatment that is so excessive as to outrage standards of decency”.Since that decision, several cases from trial courts across Canada have found that segregation does not constitute a breach of s. 12 of the Charter.These include McArthur v. Regina Correctional Centre, (1990), 1990 CanLII 7609 (SK QB), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 151 (Sask. Q.B.), R. v. Chan, 2005 ABQB 615 (CanLII), R. v. Munoz, 2006 ABQB 901 (CanLII), Wu v. Canada (Attorney General), 2006 BCSC 44 (CanLII), R. v. Aziga, [2008] O.J. No. 3052 (Ont. S.C.J.), Trang v. Alberta (Edmonton Remand Centre), 2010 ABQB 6 (CanLII), R. v. Farrell, 2011 ONSC 2160 (CanLII), and R. v. Jerace, 2011 ABQB 50 (CanLII).[36]Bacon v. Surrey Pretrial Services Centre, 2010 BCSC 805 (CanLII), appears to be the one reported case where a judge found a s. 12 Charter breach based on segregation.There the appellant successfully sought a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid seeking release from administrative segregation while awaiting trial for first degree murder.The judge found significant violations of the B.C. Corrections Act.The warden of the institution was found to have (¶ 352) “exercised the powers vested in her:(a) for the improper purpose of assisting the police in its criminal investigation; [and] (b) in a manner that has improperly fettered her discretion by allowing the police to unduly influence the petitioner's placement in separate confinement.”[37]Mr. Bacon was locked up for 23 hours a day; he had dirty bedding, cold food and no access to a pen.The lights were left on in his cell 24 hours a day and a video camera in his cell recorded and monitored his activities.With respect to communications, there were restrictions on Bacon’s ability to use the telephone, a restriction on all visits except by legal counsel and restrictions on his mail delivery.He was also denied use of an inhaler for asthma.Justice McEwan concluded at ¶ 353:The respondent is in breach of s. 12 of the Charter in arbitrarily placing the petitioner in solitary confinement, in failing to appropriately mitigate his circumstances in solitary confinement, and in unlawfully denying him the other rights to which he was entitled, significantly threatening his psychological integrity and well-being. These impositions collectively amount to cruel and unusual treatment.[38]All of the cases on whether s. 12 rights were breached as a result of segregation are heavily fact-specific; the conditions, duration and reasons for segregation must all be considered.Moreover, it is essential that there be a proper evidentiary record for the proper consideration of a Charter issue.[39]The jurisprudence indicates that the courts do not lightly interfere with the administration of correctional and detention facilities.For example, in Aziga, Justice Lofchik stated at ¶ 34:It is recognized that the courts ought to be extremely careful not to unnecessarily interfere with the administration of detention facilities such as the Hamilton-Wentworth Detention Centre where the Applicant is currently held. Unless there has been a manifest violation of a constitutionally guaranteed right, prevailing jurisprudence indicates that it is not generally open to the courts to question or second guess the judgment of institutional officials. Prison administrators should be accorded a wide range of deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and maintain institutional security.Maltbey v. Saskatchewan (A.G.), [1982] S.J. No. 871 (Q.B.) at paras. 20 and 41; appeal denied (1984), 1984 CanLII 2546 (SK CA), 10 D.L.R. (4th) 745 (Sask. CA).Almrei v. Canada (A.G.), [2003] O.J. No. 5198 (S.C.J.) at para. 18.[40]Moreover, disciplinary segregation has not been considered a s. 12 breach.Aziga at ¶ 51-52 reads:As set out above, in certain instances the Applicant was found to have committed (and/or admitted to) an act of inmate misconduct for which he was sanctioned with of (sic) close confinement. Incidents for which the Applicant was found guilty of misconduct and sanctioned for his misbehaviour cannot possibly form the basis of a Section 12 Charter challenge. This hearing is not an appropriate forum for the Applicant to seek to overturn any earlier inmate disciplinary findings given the Ministry statutory review process for inmate misconduct matters which the Applicant has not followed.In respect of the Applicant's time spent in close custody detention as a sanction for inmate misconduct, the courts generally have rejected the suggestion that this form of detention per se violates Section 12 of the Charter. The judiciary has been reluctant to second guess administrative decisions made by institutional officials of this nature, which reflect their special knowledge and expertise with matters relating to institutional safety and security.•McArthur v. Regina Regional Centre (1990), 1990 CanLII 7609 (SK QB), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 151.•R. v. Olson (1987), 1987 CanLII 4314 (ON CA), 62 O.R. (2d) 321 (C.A.) at 333-336.[Emphasis added]See also Trang at ¶ 1035-1036 which referred to decisions where lengthy periods of disciplinary and administrative segregation did not amount to a s. 12 breach.[41]In this case, it appears that most of the appellant’s time in segregation before sentencing were sanctions for misbehaviour such as fights and participation in a prison riot.This was disciplinary segregation.The remainder are instances where the appellant claims he was a bystander or not the instigator.It appears the institution imposed segregation for purposes of internal order, discipline and security.I would be reluctant to interfere with its judgment in those matters.This segregation does not rise to cruel and unusual punishment.[42]I then turn to the periods of segregation after sentencing.According to the appellant’s affidavit evidence, he filed several complaints and grievances.The earlier ones, made before a correctional plan was completed for him, were about lack of access to programs.In rejecting subsequent complaints seeking reasons for why he was “locked down 23 hours a day even though I am not on sanctions”, the institution denied his claim of 23 hours daily lockdown, saying that he had been given access to showers, outside recreation and gymnasium recreation.[43]In responding to a later grievance regarding his segregation status, the institution wrote in October 2011:… You were segregated for being an associate of the Spryfield MOB.Your association with the gang and the threat that this gang poses as a group in General Open Population creates a risk that is not assumable.However, you have been taken off segregation status at your 5 day review and are now following an enhanced structure routine in unit 3. …The appellant’s continued complaints and grievances did not deny the correctness of the affiliation with a gang described in this response.On November 7, 2011 in answer to his second level grievance about having been placed in administrative segregation since his arrival in May 2011, the Assistant Deputy Commissioner, Atlantic Region, wrote:“[s]ubsequent to your arrival, file information obtained through the RCMP indicated that you were a member of a criminal organization …”She then set out the relevant material including portions of CD 568-3 Identification and Management of Criminal Organizations and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20 on administrative segregation.Her letter ended:To conclude, we were informed by your Parole Officer that your Case Management Team is currently working on an Inter-regional transfer to another region.This would certainly allow you an integration in the general open population.The appellant has not been in segregation since his transfer out of the Atlantic Region.[44]I do not doubt that the appellant found his periods of disciplinary and administrative segregation personally very difficult, and even harsh.He was a young man with no adult offences before the attempted murder and property damage pursuant to the prison riot; it was his first time in prison.Not everything was done in strict accordance with time lines in the legislation and subordinate legislation, and he had to wait for responses to his complaints.However, it appears that with regard the administrative segregation which followed his sentencing, the institution officials made decisions “which reflect their special knowledge and expertise with matters relating to institutional safety and security.”Based on the record before me, I cannot agree that this segregation amounted to a breach of s. 12.[45]It may also be that the Court of Appeal is not the proper forum to hear complaints of conditions in prison post-sentence.Mr. Marriott did not dispute that the venues for redress set out in the Crown’s argument in this respect were incorrect, or were not or are not, available to him.The Crown’s factum reads in part:35.…At the time of any segregation, the Appellant had the following options:(i)seeking a writ of habeas corpus in Supreme Court;(ii)seeking judicial review of the administrative decisions in Federal Court;(iii)launching a claim of civil tort and/or constitutional tort in Supreme Court.[R. v. Farrell, 2011 ONSC 2160 (CanLII) ...; R. v. VandenElsen-Finck, 2005 NSSC 71 (CanLII) ...; Samms v. Atlantic Institution, 2004 NBQB 140 (CanLII) ...; May v. Ferndale Institution, 2005 SCC 82 (CanLII) ...; Canada (A-G) v. McArthur, 2010 SCC 63 (CanLII) ...; R. v. Aziga, 2008 CarswellOnt 4619 (S.C.) ....]36.He may still sue, should he wish.[46]For all of the above reasons, I would dismiss the appellant’s claim of cruel and unusual punishment and a breach of s. 12 of the Charter while he was incarcerated before and after he was sentenced.The Fitness of the Sentence:[47]Mr. Marriott argues that although his sentencing proceeded by way of joint recommendation reached by the Crown and his trial counsel, Mr. Burke, and they made oral submissions to the judge as well, the judge erred by imposing a sentence that is demonstrably unfit.[48]In his summary factum, which incorporated an earlier factum, an earlier brief and previous correspondence to the court, Mr. Marriott stated the issue on his appeal thus:“Should the Appellant, who had no home, employment or school, receive double the length of the sentence of the actual perpetrators of the offence?[49]Mr. Marriott was sentenced to 15 years on a go forward basis.What he considers a fit sentence for himself is a ten-year sentence, less a credit of 4.8 years, being his 2.4 years in remand at 2:1.The result would be a sentence of 5.2 years going forward from the date of his original sentence.(a)Standard of Review[50]The Supreme Court of Canada recently reiterated the standard of reviewfor appeals from sentence in R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII):[46]Appellate courts grant sentencing judges considerable deference when reviewing the fitness of a sentence.In M. (C.A.), Lamer C.J. cautioned that a sentence could only be interfered with if it was “demonstrably unfit” or if it reflected an error in principle, the failure to consider a relevant factor, or the over-emphasis of a relevant factor (para. 90; see also R. v. L.M., 2008 SCC 31 (CanLII), [2008] 2 S.C.R. 163, at paras. 14-15; R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at paras. 123-26; R. v. McDonnell, 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at paras. 14-17; R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227).As Laskin J.A. explained in R. v. McKnight (1999), 1999 CanLII 3717 (ON CA), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 41 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 35, however, this does not mean that appellate courts can interfere with a sentence simply because they would have weighed the relevant factors differently:To suggest that a trial judge commits an error in principle because in an appellate court’s opinion the trial judge gave too much weight to one relevant factor or not enough weight to another is to abandon deference altogether.The weighing of relevant factors, the balancing process is what the exercise of discretion is all about.To maintain deference to the trial judge’s exercise of discretion, the weighing or balancing of relevant factors must be assessed against the reasonableness standard of review.Only if by emphasizing one factor or by not giving enough weight to another, the trial judge exercises his or her discretion unreasonably should an appellate court interfere with the sentence on the ground the trial judge erred in principle.[51]Here, the sentence was the product of a joint submission.Is the standard of review different when a sentence is imposed in that circumstance?In R. v. A.N., 2011 NSCA 21 (CanLII), where there had been a joint recommendation, this Court accepted the same approach:[16]The parties agree to the standard of review stated by Justice Saunders in R. v. Knockwood, 2009 NSCA 98 (CanLII):[11] There is no dispute as to the proper standard of review in this case. This Court's review of a sentencing order is a highly respectful one. We must show great deference whenever we are asked to consider appeals against sentence. Absent an error in principle, a failure to consider a relevant factor, or an over-emphasis of appropriate factors, we should only vary a sentence imposed at trial if we are convinced that the sentence is demonstrably unfit. See for example, R. v. L.M., 2008 SCC 31 (CanLII); R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500; R. v. Longaphy, 2000 NSCA 136 (CanLII) and R. v. Conway, 2009 NSCA 95 (CanLII).See also R. v. Solowan, 2008 SCC 62 (CanLII), [2008] 3 S.C.R. 309, para. 16 and R. v. McDonnell, 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, paras. 15-17. Similarly, in R. v. Markie, 2009 NSCA 119 (CanLII), Justice Hamilton said:[11] The parties agree the standard of review is one of deference as set out in R. v. Longaphy, 2000 NSCA 136 (CanLII):20A sentence imposed by a trial judge is entitled to considerable deference from an appellate court. A sentence should only be varied if the appellate court is satisfied that the sentence under review is \"clearly unreasonable\": R. v. Shropshire (1995), 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at pp. 209-210. Absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence if the sentence is \"demonstrably unfit\": R. v. M.(C.A.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 (S.C.C.) at p. 374.See also R. v. Starratt, 2007 NSCA 21 (CanLII) and R. v. Markie, 2009 NSCA 119 (CanLII); both appeals of joint submissions wherein the court relied upon Longaphy.[52]I observe that none of the appellants in A.N., Markie or Starratt complained that the jointly recommended sentence was unfit, as does Mr. Marriott in this appeal.In those three decisions, as in the vast majority of appeals of joint recommendation, the judge rejected the joint recommendation.[53]However, on an appeal taken against sentence, s. 687 of the Criminal Code requires this court to “consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against”.Whether or not the sentence was imposed pursuant to a joint recommendation, the analysis will include a determination of whether the judge made any error in principle and whether the sentence was demonstrably unfit.[54]Neither the Supreme Court of Canada, nor any Canadian appellate court, has closely examined whether the standard of review changes depending on whether there is a joint recommendation.In R. v. Levesque, 2012 ONCA 231 (CanLII) at ¶ 1, the Ontario Court of Appeal declined to address the issue.[55]It may be that the standard on review on an appeal from sentence imposed pursuant to a joint recommendation accepted by the judge and, particularly where there is no allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel such that the plea bargain amounted to a miscarriage of justice, should attract different or a higher level of defence.This is not the case for determining this issue.Counsel did not raise the matter.Moreover, it is not necessary for the determination of this appeal.For this appeal, I will give the same level of deference and adopts the same principles as for an appeal of any sentence.(b)Demonstrably Unfit Sentence[56]In arguing that his sentence was demonstrably unfit, Mr. Marriott raised a number of matters.These included submissions pertaining to alleged errors in the Agreed Statement of Facts the Crown presented to the sentencing judge.According to the appellant, he had not had the requisite intent for attempted murder, the offence for which he had been sentenced.He also suggested that his having been ordered to shoot the victim and his having acted in self-defence were overlooked.He argued that the judge failed to consider parity and proportionality, and to give him credit for time in remand.(i)The Agreed Statement of Facts[57]In his summary factum, the appellant argues that he received double the sentence of two co-accused he describes as the “actual . . . perpetrators” of the shooting “because the Crown selected the facts they wanted the Court to hear.”He maintains that the Crown forced his trial counsel to accept the sentence and no credit for remand, was late providing the Agreed Statement of Facts to his trial counsel and the court, his counsel had insufficient time to review it, he himself had never seen it, and the judge had not read it thoroughly before the sentencing proceeding.[58]As indicated earlier, Mr. Marriott does not suggest that Mr. Burke, acknowledged to be a very experienced criminal lawyer, was ineffective.Rather, on multiple occasions, he emphasized that ineffective assistance of counsel was not a ground of appeal.What he says in claiming that the actions of the state resulted in a demonstrably unfit sentence is that his counsel was overcome by the hard position taken by the Crown in its negotiations, which resulted in the joint recommendation of 15 years imprisonment.[59]With respect, I see nothing in the record that supports the appellant’s argument in this regard.Rather, the evidence before me is to the contrary.[60]In his testimony, Mr. Burke stated that there were three separate instances where Mr. Marriott was alleged to have attempted to murder Mr. Hallett.He was the appellant’s counsel at two preliminary inquiries which the appellant attended.As to the facts presented by the Crown and whether he was disadvantaged by its late filing or coerced into agreement with the Crown’s position, Mr. Burke testified under cross-examination by the Crown:...Mr. Scott:Did you ever have any misunderstandings or did you ever perceive any misunderstandings from Mr. Marriott about what the Crown’s allegations were in this case?Mr. Burke:No the, at the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry, I met with Mr. Marriott and discussed the evidence, discussed the I guess the possibility of him giving evidence on his own behalf in respect to one or more of these charges.I received his advice with respect to his taking the stand.I then discussed it further with him that if indeed the Crown were to lay the evidence before a court in the absence of any contradictory evidence what the probable outcome could be.Especially when we were carrying two additional attempt murder charges which was always first and foremost in our discussions.Mr. Scott:Okay.Mr. Burke:As, it was very clear that Mr. Marriott was facing three separate incidents where the allegation is he attempted to murder this particular fellow....Mr. Scott:Okay.And was there anything about those facts that took you by surprise in light of how the prosecution had advanced at that point?Mr. Burke:No, I did recall that the brief came in late.I do recall reviewing the facts in the brief.Mr. Scott:Um humMr. Burke:I do not recall any facts that were in the brief that I was unfamiliar with or that I took issue with.Mr. Scott:Okay.Mr. Burke:And, if there had been, okay, the matter would not have proceeded butMr. Scott:Sorry, can you elaborate on that please?Mr. Burke:Well obviously if I took issue with the fact in the Crown’s brief, I would ask that the matter be adjourned especially given the lateness of the delivery of the Crown’s brief.Mr. Scott:Okay.Mr. Burke:Consequently, I would check with my client, that if I had a problem with facts then that he may have a problem with the facts as well.So consequently, and my client and I had talked about the facts at length and I think he was quite familiar with them, as was I.Mr. Scott:Alright.Mr. Burke:And so consequently, I had no issue with the facts and the matter proceeding.Mr. Scott:Alright.Did the timing of when you received the Crown brief in any way prevent you from representing your client on the 16th of May at the sentencing hearing?Mr. Burke:No.Mr. Scott:Did you feel like you were being bullied by the Crown in agreeing with the facts by receiving at that time?Mr. Burke:Was I bullied?Mr. Scott:Bullied.Mr. Burke:No.No.I know that if indeed I had taken issue with the any of the facts there that it would have been appropriate to have the matter adjourned until such time as that matter got resolved.[61]In his cross-examination of Mr. Burke, the Crown referred to the sentencing hearing and the recess requested by Mr. Marriott before he addressed the court.The recess lasted about an hour, after which the appellant rose in court and took full responsibility for shooting Mr. Hallett.He apologized not only to the public and his family, but also to Messrs. LeBlanc and Murphy whom he described as “completely innocent.”[62]Mr. Burke confirmed that he did not meet Mr. Marriott during the recess.The cross-examination continued:Mr. Scott:Okay.At any point did Mr. Marriott at this time indicate any disagreement with facts that were either related by the CrownMr. Burke:No.Mr. Scott:or you?Okay.I’m sorry, just wondering if you can verbalize that for the record.Mr. Burke:No, he did not express any disagreement to me at any time as to the facts that had been outlined....Mr. Scott:Okay.And can you indicate to the court whether Mr. Marriott ever instructed you to plea enter a guilty plea on his behalf on any facts other than those alleged by the Crown?Mr. Burke:No.[63]Mr. Marriott’s counsel then questioned Mr. Burke.Asked by Ms. Cooper what opportunity he had had to explore the salient facts, Mr. Burke specifically recalled a meeting with the Crown prosecutor that “involved a great deal of discussion about the facts”.He continued:Mr. Burke:… I was familiar with the facts as there was a fair bit of evidence given at the preliminary about what indeed happened that evening.In addition, there were video that was watched, there was audio, and that that‘s why quite frankly when I received the facts they basically confirmed what I had known for sometime as to the details of what what occurred that particular evening.Ms. Cooper:Right, but due toMr. Burke:It wasn’t surprising.She never provided those facts to me a week or a month before.I grant you that and I don’t take issue with that.She was late in getting that to me.It was a joint recommendation which you know was being put to the court and given that it was a joint recommendation and that I wasn’t arguing sentence, I wouldn‘t have had the same concerns say that if I had if we were arguing sentence and there were issues with respect to the facts that could affect the sentence.Obviously if you are arguing sentence, the facts become a much greater issue in the court and between counsel.[64]Mr. Burke gave his evidence in a straightforward and candid manner.His testimony makes it clear that, despite its late filing, he had had sufficient time to review the Crown’s brief.Moreover, the Crown’s hard bargaining had not forced him into any corner.Had he thought that any facts the Crown recounted were improper, Mr. Burke was prepared to seek an adjournment.He was obviously startled by the suggestion that he might have been bullied by the Crown into accepting incorrect facts.His then client never indicated either during the sentencing proceeding or during the hour long recess that there was any problem whatsoever with any of the facts.Mr. Burke testified that he was “quite surprised” when Mr. Marriott addressed the court, and that he had not had any discussions with him about the version of events that he gave at that time.[65]In his evidence, Mr. Marriott deposed and testified that he had never seen the Crown’s Agreed Statement of Facts and had had no opportunity to review its brief.But it is uncontested that the appellant had attended the preliminary inquiries pursuant to the charges which alleged several attempts to shoot Mr. Hallett; he heard the Crown’s case against him.Moreover, it was not disputed that he had had discussions with his trial counsel.Mr. Burke testified that after those preliminary inquiries, he had discussed the evidence against the appellant with him.In his submissions at the sentencing hearing, trial counsel also spoke of “extensive discussions with my client” before the joint sentence recommendation was reached.[66]In one of his briefs, Mr. Marriott argued that the sentence to which the Crown and his trial counsel agreed, was not communicated to him until just the day before he pled guilty to the offence.But under cross-examination at the hearing of the appeal, Mr. Burke testified:Mr. Burke:...But in this particular case, the elephant that was in the room at all times were these two other charges.Obviously that was of great concern to me, it was of great concern to my client and we had you know, the Crown and I had great discussions about the three charges.My client and I had great discussion about the three charges.Consequently, when I spoke to Mr. Marriott about the bottom line for the Crown, it was then and it’s still is my practice that when I seek a final decision from my client, I essentially ask him to think about it.Normally, I would go over on a Friday or I would go over on a Thursday and I’d basically say to him, don’t give me an answer now, think about it, take your time, I’m not rushing you with respect to making a decision.And that’s what I did here. The next meeting that I had with Mr. Marriott, I recall, was that he told me that he was accepting it, that he had discussed it fully with his family, that he wanted to get on with his life, and consequently he was going to proceed in the manner that had been outlined by the Crown.[67]In view of the evidence from the appellant and his trial counsel regarding the appellant’s attendance at the preliminary inquiries and their discussions regarding the evidence, I am satisfied that even if he had not received a hard copy of the Crown’s brief and reviewed it, Mr. Marriott understood the case against him on the charge of attempted murder and the facts upon which the Crown would be relying.(ii)Mitigating Factors[68]There was no pre-sentence report and the Crown’s brief to the sentencing judge did state that there was “a complete absence of mitigating factors”.The appellant argues that “he was left in the cold with nothing said about him”.In particular, he alleges a dearth of information about his background, and a misunderstanding of his criminal record.He says that at the time of the offence he was not in school, was unemployed and had no home, but was highly intelligent and showed potential.According to the appellant, none of this information was presented to the judge who consequently did not take it into account.[69]The record shows that both counsel advised the court that Mr. Marriott was 20 when sentenced.In his submissions, Mr. Burke brought a number of circumstances to the judge’s attention.He pointed out that the victim of the shooting, Mr. Hallett, had himself been carrying a loaded handgun at the time and asked that these “special circumstances” as they relate to the victim be taken into consideration.He stated that the appellant had had “a rough history”, “a rough upbringing”, not through any fault of his parents, but because of the environment where he comes from and the people he hangs around with.He also advised that, while in pre-trial custody, the appellant had completed his high school equivalency, had taken the initiative to find out how to enroll and did enroll at Acadia University, and had scored 92.5 percent on the written portion of the one course he had completed.Trial counsel pointed out that the appellant had taken it upon himself to try and change his life.[70]The records shows that the appellant’s claim that information about him was omitted is not well-founded.The sentencing judge was alerted to many of the appellant’s circumstances through the oral submissions.Any that remained missing were not before him because Mr. Burke did not raise them in his oral submissions, or call for the preparation of an updated pre-sentence report.In the absence of any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, I cannot accept the appellant’s argument.(iii)Criminal Record[71]At the sentencing hearing, the Crown reported that Mr. Marriott had 22 prior convictions, all within the previous seven years, and he had committed all of them except one while a youth.According to the Crown, his record included “crimes of violence, weapons offences and drug trafficking”.On appeal, the appellant objects to this characterization of his criminal record.In his affidavit evidence, he dismissed his criminal record as one which merely “consists of school yard quarrels including one where I used a jack knife and one where I took a bank card but returned it to the boy I took it from.”[72]On cross-examination, the appellant acknowledged that in September 2005, he had pepper-sprayed a man who tried to retrieve his boy’s bicycle which Mr. Marriott had taken.He agreed that that was not a school yard situation.He also admitted that in December 2005, when he robbed someone of his bank card and cell phone near Pizza Corner, he had stabbed the person he robbed.He agreed that that was not a school yard quarrel either.[73]In my view, in the face of his own concessions, Mr. Marriott’s suggestion that the Crown incorrectly described his record as including matters more serious than “school yard quarrels” cannot be sustained.(iv)Intent to Kill[74]Under cross-examination of his affidavit evidence, Mr. Marriott confirmed that he had plead guilty to attempted murder, which he knew was a serious charge.However, asked whether he had understood that intent to kill was an essential element of attempted murder, he answered:“I didn’t have intent to kill on my mind.Like I didn’t have murder on my mind but firing a gun.I took responsibility for the charge and plead guilty because I did fire the gun.”The appellant confirmed that he knew that the Crown’s allegation was that he and three others had intended to kill Mr. Hallett that evening, and that he understood that first degree murder involved planning and deliberation.But he maintained that he had not had the specific intent to kill when he fired, and the shot was not directed at anyone.He had simply plead guilty because he was the shooter; that is, for firing the gun.[75]The Crown questioned Mr. Burke on the mental element required for attempted murder.He confirmed his familiarity with it, and added that he had discussed intent with the appellant in the context of a case where it was alleged that Mr. Marriott had pointed and attempted to fire a gun at someone, but the weapon was inoperable.His evidence continued:Mr. Scott:Mr. Marriott had testified this morning that he did not intend to kill Jason Hallett at the IWK.Can you indicate whether that was ever discussed between yourself and Mr. Hallett, Mr. Marriott?Mr. Burke:No.That he, he didn’t intend to kill him?Mr. Scott:Yeah.Mr. Burke:No.Mr. Scott:Okay.Do youMr. Burke:I’m sorry, I don’t understand what you mean by that.Mr. Scott:Well he said that he went there and shot at him with a gun but didn’t intend to kill him, just wanted to hurt him.Did you have any discussion with Mr. Marriott about that as the basis for attempted murder guilty plea?Mr. Burke:No.Mr. Scott:Would you have advised him to plead guilty if that were the fact, that he was …Mr. Burke:Well, if Mr. Marriott had put that proposition to me what I would have done would be to sit down and discuss the case with him.[76]Mr. Burke’s reaction to this questioning on intent to kill was one of surprise.I accept trial counsel’s evidence that he went over the elements of attempted murder with his former client.Having watched and heard Mr. Marriott testify, I would describe him as intelligent, articulate and combative.He withstood questioning without being intimidated.The appellant was originally charged with more than one count of attempted murder, and attended more than one preliminary inquiry in relation to major criminal charges.That such a forthright individual, faced with very serious consequences if found guilty, never thought to mention to his counsel that he did not mean to kill anyone, strikes me as preposterous.That the appellant would make this submission yet, at the same time, not claim ineffective assistance of counsel because his lawyer had not recognized or raised the requisite intent with him, only emphasizes how disingenuous his argument is.(v)Self Defence[77]Mr. Marriott also suggested that, in shooting Mr. Hallett, he had been provoked or had acted in self-defence.He did not raise this in earlier proceedings where it would have operated as a complete defence to the charge of attempted murder.Since self-defence does not act as a mitigating factor affecting the fitness of the sentence, it is a bit strange that this is being put forward in an appeal of sentence only.In any event, the appellant’s submission is largely based on a Continuation Report written by Cst. Kirton.In that document, the officer commented that Mr. Marriott was viewed shuffling his feet back “believed to be a result of Jason HALLETT pointing his gun”.The appellant also says that the fact that the driver of the Cherokee, in which Mr. Hallett was seated, left the vehicle before the shooting rather than drive away, and Mr. Hallett’s statement that he had a loaded gun and watched the appellant approach, suggest that Mr. Hallett was the instigator of the shooting.[78]In his affidavit filed on this appeal, Cst. Kirton deposed:6.I am the author of a Continuation Report wherein I viewed the security footage and observed Aaron Marriott approach the vehicle in which Jason Hallett was sitting, and observed Mr. Marriott fire a gun towards that vehicle numerous times.7.I observed Mr. Marriott’s feet shuffling, or stance change while he was firing towards the vehicle.8.My comment that Mr. Hallett may have had a gun pointed at Mr. Marriott was based purely on speculation, wondering what may have caused Mr. Marriott to shuffle his feet, or change his stance, in the manner that he did.9.There was no evidence within our investigation to suggest that Mr. Hallett, in fact, pointed his gun at Mr. Marriott at any time.[79]Under cross-examination, Cst. Kirton described his suggestion that Mr. Hallett may have pointed a gun at the appellant as “speculation”.The appellant’s affidavit evidence did not address self-defence, and he did not give any testimony in support of this claim.In my view, the officer’s affidavit and oral evidence are far from sufficient to establish that Mr. Hallett pointed or started to raise his gun at Mr. Marriott.The driver could have left the car for any number of reasons and neither that person nor Mr. Hallett testified as to whether the latter or the appellant was the first to raise his weapon.I have no evidentiary foundation for finding that Mr. Marriott shot Mr. Hallett, in self-defence or because of any action on Mr. Hallett’s part.(vi)Resources of the State[80]According to the appellant, the state used unprecedented resources to arrest him and to make a case against him.In this regard, he points to an article in the local Chronicle Herald newspaper quoting the Police Chief as saying at an earlier news conference that the force was “pulling out all the stops to arrest the gunmen” and “were going to put unprecedented resources into this”.The article also quoted an officer saying that “[t]his (arrest) [of the appellant] is a result of those unprecedented resources.”With respect, assuming this material was admissible, I do not understand how swift and substantial efforts by the police to capture those responsible for a shooting adjacent to a children’s hospital which alarmed the public would reduce the appellant’s culpability or sentence.[81]The appellant also claims that the state used its:“unprecedented resources … to obtain the evidence of a known, drug addicted, cocaine trafficker [Mr. Hallett], to frame a kid [Mr. Marriott], and put him away for life, and completely ignoring the criminality of the other criminal, rewarding him and giving him the opportunity for a new life”He argues that initially Mr. Hallett had been reluctant to co-operate with the police and only did so after being induced by promises and threats.Mr. Hallett’s credibility would have or could have been tested at the preliminary inquiry by cross-examination by the appellant’s trial counsel.There is no claim of ineffective assistance here.This complaint of unprecedented resources being used to “frame” the appellant is overstated.(vii)Wiretap Evidence[82]The applicant submits that the wiretap evidence of the calls exchanged with an individual at the hospital and then Messrs. LeBlanc and Murphy in one vehicle, and Messrs. Smith and Marriott in the other, before and at the time of the shooting, was illegal.He says that the authorization for the wiretaps was backdated to the date of the offence and that he should benefit from any doubt as to the actual date on which they were legally authorized.[83]The fresh evidence the appellant submitted on appeal included what purported to be the final page of the authorization for the wiretap evidence in the case.The last line as typed read “DATED at Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, this 19th day of November, 2008”.The “19th” had been crossed out and “18th” hand-written above it.[84]Assuming that this evidence is admissible, it is not so unequivocal as to persuade me that improper motives can be ascribed to the change.For example, it is possible that the document was issued on the 18th, the typed dated was wrong and simply corrected by the judge who signed the authorization and initialled the new date.(viii)Directed to Shoot[85]Mr. Marriott also submitted that certain circumstances under which he shot Mr. Hallett were not emphasized when he was sentenced.This argument is based on the evidence of the telephone calls intercepted by the police, and assumes the validity of the wiretap evidence.When the location of the Cherokee in which Mr. Hallett was seated was identified in the hospital parking lot, Mr. Smith told the appellant to “get out and blaze that Cherokee.”Mr. Marriott then proceeded to walk up to that vehicle and fire several shots from a handgun at Mr. Hallett.[86]However, his evidence under cross-examination at the hearing of his appeal does not support the suggestion that Mr. Marriott felt compelled by Mr. Smith’s words to shoot.The appellant confirmed that the Crown’s allegation throughout was that he and Messrs. Smith, LeBlanc and Murphy coordinated their efforts to find where Mr. Hallett was so that he could shoot him.The exchange continued:Mr. Scott:… Are you saying that you acted alone when it came to this shooting of Mr. Hallett?Mr. Marriott:To an extent, yes.Mr. Scott:What do you mean to an extent?Mr. Marriott:I have to take responsibility for what I did.I fired the gun.I can’t blame anyone else for that.. . .Mr. Scott:And were you directed by anyone else to do so?Mr. Marriott:No, I basically have to listen to myself kind of thing.I don’t know.Mr. Scott:No one told you to shoot at Mr. Hallett?Mr. Marriott:Not to my knowledge, some things happened so fast, one after another, I don’t really recall.. . .Mr. Scott:And you stated to Judge Coady when you were being sentenced that you acted alone, right?You stated to him, you didn’t even know what you’re going to do until you’d gotten out of the car and was walking towards Mr. Hallett.Mr. Marriott:That’s true.Mr. Scott:That’s true?And that’s the basis on which you pleaded guilty to attempted murder?Mr. Marriott:On the basis that I did fire the gun at Mr. Hallett in his wrist.So, I plead guilty to attempted murder.. . .Mr. Scott:You’re in the car with Smith, right?Mr. Marriott:Yes.Mr. Scott:You didn’t have to talk with him on the phone, did you?Mr. Marriott:No.Mr. Scott:And he’s saying blaze the Cherokee, right?Mr. Marriott:I just don’t recall the conversations and everything.At the night, like it happened so fast, like . . .[87]The appellant’s evidence was either that no one told him to shoot Mr. Hallett, or that he didn’t recall because things happened so fast that night.This undermines his argument that it was Mr. Smith who directed him to shoot and that he, a naïve young man with no criminal record other than “school yard quarrels” simply followed instructions.Moreover, his address to the judge at his sentencing hearing wherein the appellant stated that he himself did not know what he was going to do as he got out of the car and walked towards the vehicle in which Mr. Hallett was seated, is contrary to his position.(ix)Remand Credit[88]Mr. Marriott argues that the judge erred by not reducing his sentence to take into account the 2.4 years he spent in custody.He submits that not only should he have received a 2:1 remand credit but, because of state misconduct and the time he spent in segregation, further enhanced or increased credit.[89]The appellant was charged in 2008 prior to the enactment of the Truth in Sentencing Act, S.C. 2009, c. 29.At that time, s. 719(3) of the Criminal Code provided that the sentencing judge “may take into account any time spent in custody by the person as a result of the offence”.While a 2:1 credit for time spent in remand was common practice, various considerations could result in a variation or denial of credit:see, for example, R. v. LeBlanc, 2011 NSCA 60 (CanLII) at ¶ 21-22.A 2:1 credit was not a mechanical formula, but it was “entirely appropriate” and remained discretionary:R. v. Wust, 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII) at ¶ 44-45, and R. v. A.N., 2011 NSCA 21 (CanLII) at ¶ 41.The sentencing judge’s exercise of that discretion was required to be done on a principled basis:A.N. at ¶ 40.Since remand credit is discretionary pursuant to s. 719(3), appellant intervention is only warranted where an error in principle or palpable and overriding error has been shown.[90]Citing Nasogaluak, the appellant says that the judge should have exercised his discretion and given him even more than the 2:1 credit because of the misconduct of the state which he says included:(i)selecting one criminal over the other to take the wrap (sic), and ignoring the criminality of Mr. Hallett,[ii]the arbitrary treatment and cruel and unusual punishment, to which the Appellant was subject, at the hands of the authorities, in the prisons in which he was incarcerated, contrary to their own rules.[iii]the actions of the Crown, in seeking this grossly excessive sentence on the Appellant.As explained earlier, these allegations of state misconduct have not been substantiated so there is no basis for such further enhancement of any remand credit.[91]As for any enhanced credit because of segregation, this has been rejected or accepted based on the particular facts of the case.In R. v. Nehass, 2010 YKTC 64 (CanLII) at ¶ 12, where segregation had been required to manage the aboriginal offender’s oppositional behaviour while in custody – he was being sentenced for twice assaulting police officers in the correctional centre – it was rejected.Segregation did result in a credit in R. v. Sakebow, 2012 SKQB 81 (CanLII), where the accused, a long-term offender, was placed in segregation because of information that his life and safety would be threatened if placed in the general population.At ¶ 38, the judge found that as it was not the accused’s conduct that resulted in segregation, he was entitled to an increased credit for that time.In R. v. C.L., 2012 ONCA 835 (CanLII), the appellant who had been held in administrative segregation for the 18 month pre-trial period, spending 23 hours a day in his cell, argued that the judge failed to attach sufficient weight to his harsh segregation conditions in giving him only 1:1 credit.The Court of Appeal determined that the judge acted within his discretion, and considered the administrative segregation conditions but also other factors that weighed against enhanced credit such as the appellant’s outstanding charges and having been on bail when he committed the offences for which he was charged.[92]Here, the segregation for which the appellant claims the judge should have given him remand credit was for disciplinary purposes, arising from his misconduct or, he claims, that of others.In such circumstances, the judge would not have erred by exercising his discretion and denying any credit.[93]I would add that the judge was made very aware that the jointly submitted sentence of 15 years included some two and one-half years of remand time.The Crown reiterated this in its closing comments.In his submissions at trial, Mr. Burke spoke of “extensive discussions” “ongoing for some considerable period of time” and “extensive discussions with the Crown, as well, extensive discussions with my client, before an agreement was reached”.Mr. Burke also spoke of factors including the strength of the Crown’s case for this incident and others before the Court.He then addressed the 15 year sentence commencing that day, which recognized or included the appellant’s 29 months in pre-trial custody.In these circumstances, where remand time had been taken into account and ineffective assistance of counsel has not been argued, it is difficult to say that the judge erred in not granting remand time.(x)Proportionality[94]Mr. Marriott argues that he was sentenced as though he was the sole perpetrator of the offence, without regard to the roles of the other participants, and that his sentence was not proportional to that of the others.He points out that he plead guilty to attempted murder and was sentenced to 15 years on a go forward basis and that the sentences received by the other three co-accused were lighter.Those men were sentenced by the same judge, after Mr. Marriott was.Their sentences were as follows:(a)Matthew Murphy was tried and sentenced to five years for attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder, to be served concurrently:R. v. Murphy, 2011 NSSC 410 (CanLII).His appeal to this court was dismissed by a majority:2012 NSCA 92 (CanLII); his appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed:2013 SCC 21 (CanLII).(b)Shaun Ryan Smith who plead guilty to conspiracy to commit murder, was sentenced to ten years, less credit for 27 months spent in pre-trial custody, for a sentence of seven years, nine months on a go forward basis, 2011 NSSC 413 (CanLII); and(c)Jeremy LeBlanc was tried and sentenced to ten years for attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder, to be served concurrently.He had no pre-trial custody credit available, 2011 NSSC 412 (CanLII).[95]I will address the appellant’s various arguments by:(a)reviewing how a judge is to proceed when presented with a joint submission on sentence;(b)considering what the judge did in this case; and(c)considering the principles of parity and proportionality.[96]It is useful here to recount that the appellant plead guilty to attempted murder, pursuant to s. 239(1)(a.1) of the Criminal Code which stipulates a minimum sentence of four years and a maximum of life imprisonment.While these are the outer limits of the punishment, they do not necessarily denote the range of sentence.In R. v. E.M.W., 2011 NSCA 87 (CanLII), Fichaud, J.A. discussed the meaning of range and the principle of proportionality:[29]The statutory maximum term of imprisonment for an offence under s. 271 of the Code is ten years.But that does not mean the effective “range” for parity purposes in E.M.W.’s sentencing has a ceiling of ten years.In R. v. Cromwell, 2005 NSCA 137 (CanLII), [2005] N.S.J. No. 428 (C.A.), para 26, Justice Bateman discussed the meaning of “the range”:[Counsel] broadly defines the range of sentence, in these circumstances, as all sentences that might be imposed for the crime of impaired driving causing bodily harm.I disagree.In my opinion the range is not the minimum to maximum possibilities for the offence but is narrowed by the context of the offence committed and the circumstances of the offender (“... sentences imposed upon similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances ...” per MacEachern, C.J.B.C. in R. v. Mafi (2000), 2000 BCCA 135 (CanLII), 142 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (C.A.)).The actual punishment may vary on a continuum taking into account aggravating and mitigating factors, the remedial focus required for the particular offender and the need to protect the public.This variation creates the range.To similar effect R. v. A.N., 2011 NSCA 21 (CanLII), para 34:Unless expressed in the Code, there is no universal range with fixed boundaries for all instances of an offence: R. v. M.(C.A.), para. 92; R. v. McDonnell (1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948), para. 16; R. v. L.M., para. 36.The range moves sympathetically with the circumstances, and is proportionate to the Code’s sentencing principles that include fundamentally the offence’s gravity and the offender’s culpability.[97]The law is clear that, outside of the joint recommendation context, sentences falling outside of the range of appropriate sentences are not necessarily unfit.In Nasogaluak, the Supreme Court of Canada stated:[44]The wide discretion granted to sentencing judges has limits.It is fettered in part by the case law that has set down, in some circumstances, general ranges of sentences for particular offences, to encourage greater consistency between sentencing decisions in accordance with the principle of parity enshrined in the Code.But it must be remembered that, while courts should pay heed to these ranges, they are guidelines rather than hard and fast rules.A judge can order a sentence outside that range as long as it is in accordance with the principles and objectives of sentencing. Thus, a sentence falling outside the regular range of appropriate sentences is not necessarily unfit.Regard must be had to all the circumstances of the offence and the offender, and to the needs of the community in which the offence occurred.[98]This same reasoning has been applied to joint submissions.In R. v. Oxford, 2010 NLCA 45 (CanLII) the Newfoundland Court of Appeal stated:76If, therefore, a sentence not involving a joint submission and falling outside the regular range of appropriate sentences is not necessarily an unfit sentence, then a fortiori a jointly-submitted sentence will not necessarily be unfit and certainly will not bring the administration of justice into disrepute simply by virtue of the fact that it falls outside the normal range.Accordingly, sentences imposed by way of joint recommendations which fall outside the range are not necessarily unfit.[99]I turn then to how a judge is to proceed when counsel present a joint recommendation.In R. v. MacIvor, 2003 NSCA 60 (CanLII), Cromwell, J.A. (as he then was) provided this guidance:[31]. . . It is not doubted that a joint submission resulting from a plea bargain while not binding on the Court, should be given very serious consideration.This requires the sentencing judge to do more than assess whether it is a sentence he or she would have imposed absent the joint submission: see, e.g., R. v. Thomas (2000), 2000 MBCA 148 (CanLII), 153 Man. R. (2d) 98 (C.A.) at para. 6.It requires the sentencing judge to assess whether the jointly submitted sentence is within an acceptable range - in other words, whether it is a fit sentence. If it is, there must be sound reasons for departing from it: see, for example, R. v. MacDonald (2001), 2001 NSCA 26 (CanLII), 191 N.S.R. (2d) 399; N.S.J. 51 (Q.L.)(N.S.C.A.); R. v. Tkachuk (2001), 2001 ABCA 243 (CanLII), 159 C.C.C. (3d) 434 (Alta. C.A.) at para. 32; R. v. C.(G.W.) (2000), 2000 ABCA 333 (CanLII), 150 C.C.C. (3d) 513 at paras. 17-18; R. v. Bezdan, 2001 BCCA 215 (CanLII), [2001] B.C.J. No. 808 (C.A.) at paras. 14-15; R. v. Thomas, supra, at paras. 5-6; R. v. B.(B.), 2002 Carswell NWT 17 (N.T.C.A.) at para. 3; R. v. Webster (2001), 2001 SKCA 72 (CanLII), 207 Sask. R. 257 (C.A.) at para. 7.[32]Even where the proposed sentence may appear to the judge to be outside an acceptable range, the judge ought to give it serious consideration, bearing in mind that even with all appropriate disclosure to the Court, there are practical constraints on disclosure of important and legitimate factors which may have influenced the joint recommendation.[100]In R. v. Cromwell, 2005 NSCA 137 (CanLII), Bateman, J.A. explained why a judge usually respects a joint recommendation as to sentence arising from a negotiated guilty plea and when a judge might depart from it:RESOLUTION AGEEMENTS[18]In R. v. MacIvor, this Court approved with particular emphasis, the following comment by Fish, J.A. (as he then was), writing for the Court in R. v. Douglas (2002), 162 C.C.C. (3d) 37 (Que. C.A.):[51]....the interests of justice are well served by the acceptance of a joint submission on sentence accompanied by a negotiated plea of guilty - - provided, of course, that the sentence jointly proposed falls within the acceptable range and the plea is warranted by the facts admitted.[19]There are many situations in which it is in the public interest for Crown and defence counsel to enter into negotiations which result in a guilty plea and a joint sentence recommendation.There may be uncertainties in evidence which induce both counsel to prefer a compromise.Avoidance of a trial may save substantial public expense and spare prosecution witnesses the trauma of testifying.A negotiated resolution, which shortens the time between the charging of the offence and disposition, protects the public from those who would re-offend while on pre-trial release and spares victims of crime the long ordeal of awaiting trial of the perpetrators.Offenders sometimes provide the police with critical information leading to the solution of other crimes.This can serve as a quid pro quo for a sentence somewhat reduced from what would otherwise be appropriate.Heavy criminal caseloads resulting in court backlogs can also be alleviated through consensual resolution, in the proper circumstances.Such resolutions are more likely to be achieved where it is probable that the sentencing judge will accept the recommendation of counsel.[20]Joint sentence submissions arising from a negotiated guilty plea are generally respected by the sentencing judge. Ultimately, however, the judge is the guardian of the public interest and must preserve the reputation of the administration of justice.Where the agreed resolution is contrary to the public interest, would bring the administration of justice into disrepute or is otherwise unreasonable the judge retains the discretion to reject the joint submission (R. v. Cerasuolo (2001), 2001 CanLII 24172 (ON CA), 151 C.C.C. (3d) 445 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Dorsey (1999), 1999 CanLII 3759 (ON CA), 123 O.A.C. 342 (C.A.); R. v. C. (G.W.) (2000), 2000 ABCA 333 (CanLII), 150 C.C.C.(3d) 513 (Alta. C.A.)).[21]A trial judge may decline to give effect to a joint recommendation, not simply because she would have imposed a more severe sanction, but where the sentence is clearly unreasonable and then, only if the judge is satisfied there are no other compelling circumstances justifying, as in the public interest, a departure from an otherwise fit sentence.FITNESS OF SENTENCE[22]In R. v. Shropshire 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227 an “unfit” sentence is described as one that is “clearly unreasonable” (at para. 46 per Iacobucci, J., for a unanimous Court), in other words, “clearly excessive or inadequate” (see also R. v. Muise (1995), 1994 CanLII 4074 (NS CA), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 119 (N.S.C.A.)).An unreasonable sentence is one falling outside the range (Shropshire at para. 50 and MacIvor, supra at para. 31).[23]In evaluating a joint submission the judge must determine the acceptable range of sentence for the offence before the court.A fit sentence is one that falls within that range.Fixing the range requires a consideration of the general sentencing principles and, for purposes of this case, those of conditional sentencing.[24]Where there is a joint submission, the judge considers the record before him – the admitted facts of the offence; information about the offender; the victim impact statements and submissions of counsel.It is counsels’ obligation to provide sufficient detail to justify the joint submission. (R. v. G.P., supra at para. 20 and R. v. Douglas, supra at para. 45).There are occasions when all relevant factors prompting the joint submission cannot be disclosed to the judge.The offender may have provided useful but confidential information about other crimes, disclosure of which would endanger his safety or compromise an on-going investigation.For that reason, even where a joint submission falls outside the range, it should be given serious consideration (McIvor, supra at para. 37).[101]In Starratt, this Court adopted the protocol set out in R. v. Sinclair, 2004 MBCA 48 (CanLII) which is consistent with MacIvor and Cromwell.There, the Manitoba Court of Appeal in regard to joint submissions on sentence outside the range wrote:5If a sentence recommended by both counsel is outside the range of sentence established by precedent, then the sentencing judge need not follow the joint recommendation. See R. v. Booh (I.) (2003), 170 Man.R. (2d) 249, 2003 MBCA 16 (CanLII).6However, even in that situation, a sentencing judge should exercise caution before ignoring a sentence carefully negotiated by experienced counsel. As stated by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in R. v. MacIvor (2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d) 420, 2003 NSCA 60 (CanLII) (at para. 32):Even where the proposed sentence may appear to the judge to be outside an acceptable range, the judge ought to give it serious consideration, bearing in mind that even with all appropriate disclosure to the Court, there are practical constraints on disclosure of important and legitimate factors which may have influenced the joint recommendation.[102]In summary, if a sentence recommended by both counsel is outside the range of sentence, the judge should give the joint submission “serious consideration” (MacIvor) and “exercise caution before ignoring a sentence carefully negotiated by experienced counsel” (Sinclair).If the sentence is clearly unreasonable, the judge may only reject the joint submission if satisfied there are no other compelling circumstances justifying, as in the public interest, a departure from an otherwise fit sentence.[103]How did the sentencing judge in this case proceed?His decision began:I am familiar with the principles and objectives of sentencing as set out in the Criminal Code, and I’m not going to repeat them here. And I’m very familiar with the similar cases that have been provided to me by counsel that helped me determine if the joint recommendation is an appropriate recommendation. And I will say, after consideration of those authorities, I have no difficulty accepting the joint recommendation of 15 years. I recognize that the law says I should accept joint recommendations unless I can articulate a good reason not to, and I have no hesitation in saying, in this case, that I have no such reason that I could possibly articulate.He accepted the Crown’s description of the appellant shooting Mr. Hallett as a “botched first degree murder”, and lamented the situation of a young man firing multiple shots with a high-powered pistol in the middle of the parking lot of the local children’s hospital.[104]This is not a situation where the judge found any fault with the joint submission.Rather, after reviewing the statement of facts in the Crown’s sentencing brief, hearing the submissions of the Crown and the appellant’s trial counsel, and considering the case law, the sentencing judge here assessed whether the jointly submitted sentence was appropriate and determined that it was within an acceptable range.[105]The appellant submits that he did not give it the requisite “serious consideration” .The judge did not read the Crown’s brief before the hearing started.The transcript of the sentencing proceeding shows that at its outset the judge told the Crown that he had not had a chance to read her brief and that he would take time when submissions finished.After the court recessed for an hour and after the appellant’s address to the judge but before imposing sentence, the judge told the Crown:I just want to say, Ms. Smith, that I had a chance to read your brief, I’m familiar with it.It was a quick read but, nonetheless, I did that.It was the sentencing judge who set the duration of the recess, and he confirmed that he had had sufficient time to appreciate the material before him.[106]There is nothing on the record that indicates that the judge did not take into account the factors presented to him by counsel in assessing sentence.Nor is there anything on the record that supports the appellant’s claim that he was sentenced as though he was the sole perpetrator of the offence.The facts as presented by the Crown, and the submission the Crown and trial counsel made to the judge, all referred to the involvement and actions of the three other co-accused.[107]As explained earlier in my decision, none of the matters raised by the appellant pursuant to his fresh evidence motions such as the allegedly incorrect characterization of his criminal record or his (lack of) intent to commit attempted murder were substantiated.Accordingly, there was nothing omitted or substantially incorrect in the material before the sentencing judge.[108]Since the judge did not reject the sentence jointly proposed by the Crown and trial counsel as outside the range and thus unfit, there was no need for him to seek further submissions from counsel or to give cogent reasons for not accepting it:Sinclair at ¶ 17, as approved by this Court in Starratt, at ¶ 12.[109]Mr. Marriott argues that his sentence lacked parity.Section 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code reads:Other Sentencing Principles718.2A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:…(b)a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;…As indicated earlier, his sentence was heavier than the sentences later imposed on by his co-accused who received, for attempted murder and conspiracy, ten years concurrent (Mr. LeBlanc) and five years concurrent (Mr. Murphy); and, for conspiracy to commit murder, ten years (Mr. Smith).What the appellant considers would be a fit sentence for himself is ten years, which he says should be reduced by a remand credit already reviewed.[110]The appellant’s parity argument assumes that, because all four accused were sentenced as a result of the same incident which culminated in the shooting of Mr. Hallett at the hospital, his sentence should be calculated only with their sentences in mind.But what the parity principle calls for is a consideration of sentences imposed on “similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances”.There is no constraint limiting the comparable sentences to those of any co-accused.[111]Moreover, the appellant’s actions are distinguishable from those of his co-accused.As he himself says, he was the shooter.It was the appellant who, loaded gun in hand, walked across the parking lot, stopped by the Cherokee, raised and pointed the gun at Mr. Hallett, and fired it several times.It is an inescapable fact that the appellant shot another person in a public place.I have not accepted from the fresh evidence or his testimony on appeal that he did so without intent to kill or in self-defence or under some form of coercion.A person who commits attempted murder has the specific intent to kill.The fact that the intended victim did not die is simply good fortune.The Supreme Court and this Court have described an attempted murder offender as a “lucky murderer”:R. v. Logan, 1990 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 731 at p. 742-743; R. v. Bryan, 2008 NSCA 119 (CanLII), at ¶ 41.[112]While parity is one of the several sentencing principles, proportionality is the fundamental principle.Section 718.1 establishes that proportionality is most directly concerned with the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offence.Fundamental Principle718.1A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.It is the individualisation of sentencing that calls on a court to determine a fit sentence with regard to all relevant factors concerning the offence and the offender.[113]In determining whether a sentence was fit and appropriate in all the circumstances, the case law on sentencing is helpful.The following case summaries, supplied by the Crown, provide guidance:(i)R. v. LeBlanc, 2011 NSCA 60 (CanLII) …–This Court confirmed sixteen years’ incarceration for a botched hit on James Melvin, Jr.The offender and others planned to kill Mr. Melvin and communicated with him in order to ascertain his whereabouts.The offender chased the victim, and fired a handgun a number of times.The victim was struck twice suffering internal injuries for which he received surgery.The Appellant had a lengthy criminal record.There was no joint recommendation;(ii)R. v. Smith, 2012 NSCA 37 (CanLII) …–Seventeen and a half year old offender, nineteen at the time of sentencing, convicted of shooting Michael Patriquen, Jr. at close range in the chest.The victim suffered many health problems, including paraplegia.His life expectancy to be shortened by twenty to twenty-nine years.The victim was shot at the request of an associate of the Appellant.A lengthy violent criminal record and disturbing psychiatric profile.Fourteen years’ incarceration confirmed on appeal;(iii)R. v. Clarke, 2010 ONSC 656 (CanLII) …–Offender shot victim in front of convenience store just after noon.The victim suffered two chest wounds from a sawed-off shotgun at close range.Injuries were life-threatening.Offender had young family.Four prior convictions.Use of handgun in a public place during daylight hours, and reckless disregard for human life factors in informing twelve and a half years’ imprisonment minus remand time;(iv)R. v. Guedez-Infante, 2009 ONCA 739 (CanLII) …–Appellant was a young man with no prior criminal record.The shooting, however, took place in public leaving serious injury to the victim.Alcohol involved.Ten years’ imprisonment confirmed on appeal;(v)R. v. Thompson, 2009 ONCA 243 (CanLII) …–Few facts in appeal case.Twelve years affirmed on appeal for serious shooting with a handgun planned in advance and committed in a public place by individual with lengthy record, including convictions for violence;(vi)R. v. Boissonneault, 2012 MBCA 40 (CanLII) …–In the days leading up to a shooting in public, the Appellant was drinking, smoking crack cocaine and marijuana, and not sleeping much.He used a 357 Smith and Wesson to shoot the victim while he was sitting in a cab with another person.The Appellant harboured a strong dislike for the victim.The Court of Appeal intervened where trial Judge failed to explain consecutive sentences for firearm convictions which arose as a result of the attempt murder.Seventeen years in total reduced to fourteen years based on totality.Appellant had significant criminal record; however, majority of convictions were drug related.[Appears to be second degree attempted murder.];(vii)R. v. Situ, 2010 ONCA 683 (CanLII) …–Two Appellants involved in horrific shooting in a public place which rendered victim quadriplegic.Situ had a criminal record.Fifteen years’ incarceration confirmed on appeal;(viii)R. v. Truelove, 2010 ONCA 608 (CanLII) …–Few facts from Court of Appeal decision.Conviction for attempted murder and several other charges which arose out of a shooting in a nightclub.Thirteen years’ incarceration upheld on appeal;(ix)R. v. Chevers, 2011 ONCA 569 (CanLII) …–Appellant twenty-four years old when he twice shot the victim in a public place.He missed both times.Fifteen year sentence upheld on appeal where the Court noted the double-digit prison sentences for attempted murder had been imposed in cases of planned executions involving the use of loaded firearms.Other factors included premeditation, use of prohibited handgun, firing two shots, impact on the victim and community, and offender’s prior record;(x)R. v. Brown, 2009 ONCA 563 (CanLII) …–At 7 p.m., June 14, 2005 victim shot six times at point-blank range in parking lot.Victim survived, however paralyzed from the waist down.Numerous injuries to critical areas.Appellant was a first offender with a young child.No evidence of rehabilitative potential apart from implication arising from youth.The Court characterized the offence as a cold-blooded senseless act which was unprovoked.Life imprisonment confirmed due to use of gun without warning in a public place where other citizens, including children, were present and at potential risk.Growing gun violence a proper and necessary factor as well.[114]It appears that the low end of the range for attempted murder is around ten years’ imprisonment; the middle around 12; and the high between 15 years and life.See also R. v. Tan, 2008 ONCA 574 (CanLII), at ¶ 35 to 39.[115]In this case, the aggravating factors include:(a)The brazen shooting in a hospital parking lot, a public place, in the early evening;(b)The use of a relatively high-powered handgun;(c)The firing of multiple shots; and(d)A lengthy criminal record, albeit mostly a youth record, including crimes of violence and the use of weapons.The appellant on appeal denies any planning or joint enterprise with the co-accused because the telephone intercepts did not include him taking part in the exchanges as the two vehicles sped to the hospital and Mr. Hallett.However, it is difficult to accept that Mr. Marriott could not have known from hearing the urgency and content of the discussions, that Mr. Hallett was the target.[116]The firing of multiple shots in a public place shows a callous and high disregard for the safety of others going about their business.The attempted murder calls for denunciation of that unlawful conduct and for deterrence, specific to this offender and general to other members of the public, that such actions will attract heavy penal consequences.[117]The mitigating factors are the appellant’s youth – he was 18 at the time of the shooting – and his guilty plea to attempted murder.Since sentencing, he is doing well in the correctional institution and has shone in his academic studies.However, the appellant did not plead guilty until the first day of trial.He did not do so until after the preliminary inquiries were held, negotiations between the Crown and trial counsel towards resolution of all charges including others of attempted murders were completed, and he had re-elected from trial by judge and jury to judge alone.[118]Having considered the offence and this offender, and the principles of sentencing and particularly those of proportionality and sentence, it is my view that 15 years imprisonment on a go forward basis may be at the higher end, but is still within the range of sentence.Consequently, it is not a demonstrably unfit sentence.Disposition[119]I would admit the fresh evidence, grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.Oland, J.A.Concurred in:Fichaud, J.A.Farrar, J.A."}

Following conviction, the Crown made an application to designate Mr. Knife as a dangerous offender. The sentencing judge declined to do so. Mr. Knife was instead designated a long-term offender and sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment and a long-term supervision order of ten years. Mr. Knife appeals his conviction. The Crown appeals the trial judge’s refusal to designate Mr. Knife as a dangerous offender. Finally, Mr. Knife cross-appeals his sentence contending it to be unfit.[2]At the hearing, Mr. Knife abandoned his conviction appeal. For the reasons that follow, the Crown’s dangerous offender appeal is allowed, and it is hereby ordered that Mr. Knife shall be designated as a dangerous offender. His substantive sentence is not altered. It follows Mr. Knife’s sentence appeal is dismissed.II.BackgroundA.Facts[3]The maximum security unit of the Saskatchewan Penitentiary has a special block designated for members of the Indian Posse and related gangs, known as “B Block”. Mr. Knife was serving a sentence for manslaughter in the penitentiary and, because he was a member of the Indian Posse at the time of the offence, he was housed on B Block.[4]The charges arose out of an incident which occurred in the B Block common room on the evening of September 1, 2008. The incident was captured by two surveillance videos. The following summary is adopted from the trial judge’s description of the events occurring on the videos, the facts of which are not in dispute.[5]Mr. Knife and eight other inmates were relaxing and socializing in the common room at approximately 8:00 p.m. that evening. Nothing appeared to be amiss.[6]At 8:25 p.m., Keith Coutu filled up a cup with liquid, placed it in the microwave, and turned it on. Approximately three minutes later, he took it out of the microwave. He walked over to one of the tables where Murray Dorion (the first victim) was sitting. Mr. Knife and Tristan Raphael followed Mr. Coutu to the table.[7]Mr. Coutu sat down next to Mr. Dorion and threw the cup of hot liquid in Mr. Dorion’s face. Mr. Coutu then began to stab Mr. Dorion, and Mr. Knife joined in. Mr. Knife and Mr. Coutu delivered numerous stab wounds to Mr. Dorion.[8]At this point, Darren Demeria (the second victim) attempted to come to Mr. Dorion’s aid. He pulled Mr. Knife away from Mr. Dorion and they began to wrestle. Cory Dreaver then joined in the fray and began to repeatedly stab Mr. Demeria. As Messrs. Knife, Demeria, and Dreaver continued to wrestle with each other, Mr. Knife managed to get close to Mr. Dorion (who was still being stabbed by Mr. Coutu) and stabbed Mr. Dorion several more times.[9]While Mr. Knife was stabbing Mr. Dorion, Mr. Dreaver picked up a television set, which he promptly threw at Mr. Demeria. Mr. Demeria deflected the television set. Mr. Knife picked it up and threw it at Mr. Demeria again. Messrs. Knife and Dreaver then began to stab Mr. Demeria repeatedly.[10]Mr. Demeria eventually managed to escape from Messrs. Knife and Dreaver. Mr. Knife and Mr. Dreaver then returned to Mr. Dorion, who was now being stabbed by Mr. Raphael. Messrs. Knife, Dreaver, Coutu, and Raphael began to stab Mr. Dorion together.[11]The melee finally ended when a corrections officer fired a warning shot into the wall of the common room and directed all of the inmates to lie prone on the floor. Each inmate was removed from the common room individually. After the inmates were removed, seven homemade knives were found in and around the common room.[12]Despite the large number of stab wounds that they received, Mr. Dorion and Mr. Demeria both managed to escape serious injury. Mr. Dorion received first and second degree burns to his face, eye, neck, and shoulders. He also sustained a large number of puncture wounds, but none were overly-serious.[13]Messrs. Knife, Coutu, and Raphael were all charged with aggravated assault. Mr. Knife was also charged with one count of common assault for the attack on Mr. Demeria. Mr. Coutu and Mr. Raphael each entered a guilty plea and were sentenced separately pursuant to joint submissions. Mr. Knife pleaded not guilty and the matter proceeded to trial.B.Decision Below[14]The only real issue at trial was whether the defence of self-defence applied. Mr. Knife testified that at approximately 11:30 a.m. on the day of the offence, Mr. Dorion and several other inmates made an unprompted threat toward Messrs. Knife, Coutu, Dreaver, Raphael and Dustin Eagle (who ultimately did not participate in the common room assault). This threat was something to the effect that Mr. Dorion and his group were going to take Mr. Knife and his group out. Mr. Dorion and his associates were apparently brandishing homemade knives as they threatened Mr. Knife and others.[15]Mr. Knife testified it was this threat of violence, in combination with other small details he had noticed throughout the day, which led him to conclude he and his group would be attacked by Mr. Dorion and his friends if he did not attack first. Mr. Knife took the position he lawfully acted in self-defence, and he should not be convicted.[16]The trial judge rejected this argument. He accepted the threats of the morning could constitute an assault on Mr. Knife but the elements of self-defence as set out in s. 34(2) of the Criminal Code (as it read in 2008) were not met. He found Mr. Knife did not subjectively believe he was being assaulted at the time he stabbed the victims and that, even if he did hold such a belief, the belief was not objectively reasonable. He also found the other two elements of the defence could not be established in this case. He held the defence could not apply, and convicted Mr. Knife accordingly.[17]Following conviction, the Crown made an application to designate Mr. Knife as a dangerous offender. The trial judge declined to make such a designation, as he found none of the criteria listed in s. 753(1)(a) of the Criminal Code were met. He found that there was no pattern of repetitive or aggressive behaviour by Mr. Knife, as the predicate offences were only Mr. Knife’s second adult conviction.[18]The trial judge reasoned that Mr. Knife’s only other adult conviction—a manslaughter conviction—was too dissimilar to the predicate offence to constitute a pattern. The manslaughter conviction was the product of a drunken argument which resulted in Mr. Knife stabbing two people (and killing one), while the predicate offence was the product of Mr. Knife’s involvement in the gang lifestyle. His youth offences did not involve similar levels of violence, and the trial judge did not believe they were particularly relevant to the issue of whether a sufficient pattern of behaviour could be established.[19]Although the trial judge declined to designate Mr. Knife a dangerous offender, he was satisfied Mr. Knife should be designated as a long-term offender pursuant to s. 753.1 of the Criminal Code. He sentenced Mr. Knife to eight years’ imprisonment (less four years remand time), a ten-year long-term supervision order, and the necessary ancillary orders.III.Conviction appeal[20]As stated earlier, counsel for the appellant advised the panel at the beginning of oral argument of Mr. Knife‘s intention to abandon his conviction appeal.IV.CROWN SENTENCE APPEAL[21]There is only one issue on the Crown’s sentence appeal: did the trial judge err in failing to designate Mr. Knife as a dangerous offender? The Crown does not ask us to alter Mr. Knife’s substantive sentence, but only to alter Mr. Knife’s designation. This is for the purposes of s. 753.01 which deals with the situation where a dangerous offender is later convicted of a serious personal injury offence or an offence under subsection 753.3(1). By virtue of this provision, a prosecutor can apply for an assessment and apply for an indeterminate sentence. The dangerous offender can then be sentenced according to the principles of dangerous offender sentencing. In other words, the Crown does not have to run another dangerous offender hearing if Mr. Knife reoffends. The section does not apply to a long-term offender.A.Jurisdiction and Standard of Review[22]The predicate offences were committed in September of 2008, after the 2008 amendments to Part XXIV of the Criminal Code had come into effect. The relevant provision is s. 753(1)(a), which states:753. (1) On application made under this Part after an assessment report is filed under subsection 752.1(2), the court shall find the offender to be a dangerous offender if it is satisfied(a) that the offence for which the offender has been convicted is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph (a) of the definition of that expression in section 752 and the offender constitutes a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons on the basis of evidence establishing(i) a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, showing a failure to restrain his or her behaviour and a likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons, or inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons, through failure in the future to restrain his or her behaviour,(ii) a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, showing a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his or her behaviour, or(iii) any behaviour by the offender, associated with the offence for which he or she has been convicted, that is of such a brutal nature as to compel the conclusion that the offender’s behaviour in the future is unlikely to be inhibited by normal standards of behavioural restraint[.][23]This is a Crown appeal from a dangerous offender proceeding, taken pursuant to s. 759(2) of the Criminal Code, as such it is limited to a question of law. It follows the applicable standard of review is correctness: R v Dagenais, 2003 ABCA 376 (CanLII) at para 62, 181 CCC (3d) 332.[24]The Crown argues the sentencing judge erred in law by misinterpreting s. 753(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, and requiring too high a degree of factual similarity between Mr. Knife’s prior offences and the predicate offence. This, according to the Crown, caused the sentencing judge to lose sight of the purpose of s. 753(1)(a), which is to identify offenders who are truly dangerous.[25]The Crown also argues that the sentencing judge erred in failing to consider Mr. Knife’s youth offending when determining whether a pattern of behaviour was made out; and that the sentencing judge erred by failing to consider the expert evidence adduced at the dangerous offender hearing when determining whether the requisite pattern of behaviour was made out. In the Crown’s view, these errors led the sentencing judge to determine that a dangerous offender designation should not be imposed. The Crown submits that the statutory requirements in s. 753(1)(a)(i) or (ii) were made out in this case, and Mr. Knife should be designated as a dangerous offender. Thus, if s. 753(1)(a)(i) is made out then the Court does not have to proceed to s.753(1)(a)(ii).[26]To deal with this Crown appeal, I will begin by briefly reviewing Mr. Knife’s offending history, the expert evidence tendered at the dangerous offender hearing, and the sentencing judge’s decision. I will then turn to the errors alleged by the Crown and the proper interpretation of s. 753(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. Finally, I will assess whether Mr. Knife should be designated as a dangerous offender.B.Mr. Knife’s Offending History[27]The following summary of Mr. Knife’s prior violent offences is taken from the evidence presented at the dangerous offender hearing.[28]Mr. Knife’s violent offending began when he was 12 years old. He and another youth confronted a young boy in Prince Albert. Mr. Knife grabbed the boy’s shirt and demanded money from him. He was sentenced to 30 hours of community service and one year of probation.[29]The next offence occurred when Mr. Knife was 14 years old. He and several others broke into a school in Prince Albert and stole some basketballs. The police interviewed one of the boys, who said Mr. Knife was involved in the break-in. Mr. Knife and several others confronted the boy a few days later. They pushed him and swore at him. Mr. Knife tried to punch the victim and tried to knee the victim in the face. The victim’s glasses fell on the floor and Mr. Knife smashed them. He was convicted of break and enter and assault and sentenced to 100 hours of community service and 14 months of probation.[30]In October of 2000, he was convicted of two more offences. One was a count of break and enter, as Mr. Knife and several other accomplices broke into a school in Prince Albert and stole eight computers. The other offence was a robbery conviction. Mr. Knife and several of his accomplices approached two boys playing basketball. They placed the boys in a chokehold and stole the victims’ bicycles. Mr. Knife was sentenced to a total sentence of eight months open custody and 18 months of probation.[31]His next convictions occurred in August of 2003. He was convicted of assault with a weapon, break and enter, and robbery. The assault with a weapon and robbery convictions arose out of an incident where Mr. Knife and another accomplice confronted two boys on the street in Prince Albert. Mr. Knife and his accomplice told the victims to empty their pockets, and both complied. Mr. Knife was armed with a beer bottle and his accomplice was armed with a crowbar. Mr. Knife hit both victims with the beer bottle. He was sentenced to seven months secure custody and two years of probation.[32]Mr. Knife committed his first adult offence in June of 2005. He was at a party in Creighton, Saskatchewan with his sister-in-law and one of her friends. The two girls left the party and met up with Robert Morin and Ben Dumas. The four of them went to Mr. Dumas’ house. Mr. Knife phoned Mr. Dumas’ residence, and he argued with Mr. Dumas over the phone. Mr. Knife went over to Mr. Dumas’ residence and, upon arrival, was apparently confronted by Mr. Dumas who was armed with a knife. He wrestled the knife away from Mr. Dumas and used it to stab Mr. Dumas twice. Mr. Morin came over to break up the fight, and Mr. Knife stabbed Mr. Morin three times. Mr. Morin died of his injuries, while Mr. Dumas survived. Mr. Knife pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to six years imprisonment (less four years remand credit). He was serving this sentence at the time of the predicate offence.[33]Institutional documents filed at the dangerous offender hearing indicate that Mr. Knife was involved in several violent incidents while on remand awaiting trial on the manslaughter offence. In August of 2005, Mr. Knife was involved in a fight with Lanny Dumas, the cousin of the surviving victim of the manslaughter offence. In April of 2006, corrections officials observed Mr. Knife attacking another inmate with a hockey stick. In June of 2007, Mr. Knife fought with a member of a rival gang, repeatedly punching the victim’s head and face and causing a scalp wound that required stitches. No criminal charges were laid as a result of any of these incidents.C.Expert Evidence[34]There were two expert psychiatric reports tendered at the dangerous offender hearing: the Crown tendered a report by Dr. Lohrasbe, and the defence tendered a report by Dr. Nicholaichuk. Both psychiatrists also testified. The following is a summary of the reports and testimony of both as it pertained to Mr. Knife’s risk to reoffend.[35]Dr. Lohrasbe diagnosed Mr. Knife with an Antisocial Personality Disorder, with significant psychopathic traits. He identified alcohol and drug abuse as two areas where Mr. Knife requires significant intervention in order to reduce his risk to reoffend.[36]Dr. Lohrasbe assessed Mr. Knife as being at a high risk to reoffend violently. He described Mr. Knife’s antisociality and deviant behaviour as “broad and deep”, as he has engaged in a wide range of criminal activities from an early age, and this criminality is a “major aspect of his social identity.”[37]Dr. Lohrasbe administered the HCR-20 to assess Mr. Knife’s risk to reoffend. The HCR-20 is a structured guideline that is commonly used to evaluate an offender’s risk of reoffending. It involves the evaluation of the presence or absence of 20 risk factors and their impact on the likelihood that the offender will continue to offend in the future. Using the HCR-20, he found 11 risk factors were present, three were absent, and the rest could not be rated based on the information available to him.[38]In discussing the ways in which Mr. Knife’s risk could be reduced, Dr. Lohrasbe indicated that Mr. Knife has not yet had the opportunity to complete any institutional programming for his violence or substance abuse problems. Because he has not had this opportunity, Dr. Lohrasbe could not assess how he responds to treatment, and whether treatment may be useful in reducing his overall risk to reoffend. It was thus impossible for him to conclude there was no reasonable possibility of controlling his risk in the community.[39]Dr. Lohrasbe also discussed Mr. Knife’s continued insistence he has left the Indian Posse gang. Mr. Knife testified at trial he left the Indian Posse in December of 2008 (after the predicate offences were committed) and he was moved to a different range in the Saskatchewan Penitentiary. He has continually affirmed since then he is no longer involved with the Indian Posse. Various institutional documents filed at the dangerous offender hearing indicate Mr. Knife may have continued to be involved with the Indian Posse after December of 2008, but this was never proved.[40]Dr. Lohrasbe stated that, if Mr. Knife has truly left the Indian Posse, it would be unreasonable for him to conclude Mr. Knife was untreatable or unmanageable in the community. However, Dr. Lohrasbe noted that reducing Mr. Knife’s risk of reoffending is still a “monumental undertaking” even without gang membership.[41]Dr. Nicholaichuk agreed with Dr. Lohrasbe that Mr. Knife exhibits “notable anti-social attitudes” and remains “significantly criminalised” in these attitudes. He also agreed Mr. Knife exhibits psychopathic personality characteristics, but these characteristics are not extreme.[42]Dr. Nicholaichuk administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory [MMPI-2], which is a scale that is commonly used to diagnose personality issues. He concluded Mr. Knife suffers from moderate emotional distress, characterized by brooding, dysphoria, and anhedonia.[43]Dr. Nicholaichuk rated Mr. Knife on several actuarial scales to assess his risk of reoffending. He concluded that “45% or more” of individuals like Mr. Knife can be expected to be reincarcerated within one year of release. He concluded that Mr. Knife has a 40% chance to reoffend violently within 4.4 years of release. The factors relevant to his assessment of Mr. Knife’s risk to reoffend include his criminal history, his lack of education and employment skills, his substance abuse, and his association with pro-criminalized peers. His extensive history of violence contributed to his risk of reoffending violently.[44]Dr. Nicholaichuk testified that without any intervention Mr. Knife is at a high risk to reoffend. He agreed with Dr. Lohrasbe the absence of institutional programming means it is too early to conclude such programming would not be effective and Mr. Knife’s risk could not be managed in the community.D.Decision Below[45]The dangerous offender application turned on whether the Crown was able to prove that a pattern of behaviour under either s. 753(1)(a)(i) or s. 753(1)(a)(ii) was established in this case. The trial judge found the Crown had failed to do so. His reasons on this point are succinct:[56]After a careful and thorough examination of all of the evidence, I am not satisfied that the Crown has established either of the requisite patterns referred to in (i) or (ii).[57]The offender has only one previous adult criminal conviction. The conviction, a manslaughter, occurred when he was just 19 years old. While extremely intoxicated on a combination of alcohol and drugs, he stabbed the victim with a knife during a fight. There is no evidence that the offender was part of a gang or that the commission of that crime had any gang overtones. The offender acted alone. There was no premeditation. The offence can be characterised as a senseless drunken argument gone horribly wrong.[58]Over three years later, after embracing the gang lifestyle while in custody, the offender and several others attacked a rival gang member in a common area within the prison. Hot liquid was thrown in the victim’s face, and he was repeatedly stabbed by the offender and his accomplices. This offence, the predicate offence, was committed while sober and in custody and was part of a calculated plan to inflict serious harm on a rival gang member for motives related to self-preservation and/or intimidation.[59]Although both incidents have common aspects – a violent stabbing – the situations are sufficiently dissimilar so as not to constitute a pattern as contemplated by ss. 753(1)(a)(i) or (ii).[60]The Crown took great pains during the hearing to attempt to characterise all of the offender’s past indiscretions as part of an overall pattern of repetitive or persistent aggressive behaviour. In fact, it was argued that even the incidents when the offender grabbed a classmate and asked for money at age 12 and broke another acquaintance’s glasses at age 14 are part of this overall pattern. While such instances are admissible and marginally relevant, they fall far short of establishing the types of patterns contemplated by ss. 753(1)(a)(i) or (ii) even when combined with the offender’s institutional history and his manslaughter conviction. While it is a fair observation that the offender’s frequent involvement with the criminal justice system indicates a serious problem, I am unable to find the requisite pattern necessary to satisfy the criteria of either s. 753(1)(a)(i) or s. 753(1)(a)(ii). (emphasis added)[46]The trial judge was thus not satisfied that the pattern of criminal behaviour required by ss. 753(1)(a)(i) or (ii) was established. He declined to designate Mr. Knife as a dangerous offender.E.Analysis[47]The Crown has appealed this decision. It argues the trial judge erred by requiring too high a degree of factual similarity between Mr. Knife’s offences. It also argues the trial judge erred by failing to properly take Mr. Knife’s youth offences into account and by failing to consider the expert evidence.[48]These arguments raise three interrelated issues, all stemming from the wording of s. 753(1)(a) and its application. While this is certainly not the first appellate decision to consider this section of the Criminal Code, it is nevertheless useful to review what the section says, why it says it, and how it should be applied.[49]I propose to conduct this review in two stages: first, by assessing the purpose of the provision; and second, by examining how other appellate courts have interpreted the notion of a “pattern” of behaviour. With the principles discerned from this review in mind, I will then turn to the errors alleged by the Crown in this case.1.The Purpose of Section 753(1)(a)[50]Section 753(1)(a)(i) states that an offender shall be designated as a dangerous offender on the basis of evidence establishing “a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part”. Further, this pattern must show “a failure to restrain” the offender’s behaviour and a likelihood of causing death or injury in the future to other persons through the offender’s failure to restrain his or her behaviour.[51]Section 753(1)(a)(ii) is similarly worded. Under this provision, an offender shall be designated as a dangerous offender based on evidence establishing “a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part”. This pattern must show “a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his or her behaviour”.[52]The seminal decision on the purpose of Part XXIV of the Criminal Code is the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in R v Lyons, 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1987] 2 SCR 309 [Lyons]. In considering the constitutionality of the preventive detention provisions in Part XXIV (then Part XXI), La Forest J. articulated the legitimate purpose of these provisions at p. 323:The present legislation, enacted in 1977, clearly pursues the historical purpose of protecting the public, but is now carefully tailored so as to be confined in its application to those habitual criminals who are dangerous to others. In brief, Part XXI provides that where a person has been found guilty of a “serious personal injury offence”, the court may, upon application, find the offender to be a dangerous offender and may thereupon impose a sentence of indeterminate detention in lieu of any other sentence that the offender might have received for the offence….[53]The Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed the purpose of the dangerous offender provisions is the protection of the public: see, e.g., R v Johnson, 2003 SCC 46 (CanLII) at para 19, [2003] 2 SCR 357; R v L.M., 2008 SCC 31 (CanLII) at para 42, [2008] 2 SCR 163; and most recently in R v Steele, 2014 SCC 61 (CanLII) at para 29, [2014] 3 SCR 138.[54]Section 753(1)(a) serves as a gateway to the dangerous offender sentencing provisions, which now impose a presumptive indeterminate sentence on the offender unless the sentencing judge is satisfied that a lesser sentence would adequately protect the public: see s. 753(4.1). The purpose of s. 753(1)(a) is to define those from whom the public must be protected—i.e. to identify those who are truly dangerous.[55]The importance of past conduct for the s. 753(1)(a) analysis is not simply to show the offender has committed violent offences in the past. The dangerous offender provisions are not intended to punish the offender again for his or her past offences, regardless of how similar (or dissimilar) they may be. What is important is that, based on those past offences, the offender is likely to continue to offend violently and endanger the public in the future. The past conduct provides the evidentiary basis for assessing the future threat, but it is the future threat that Part XXIV is aimed at curbing.2.“Pattern” of Behaviour[56]Both ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii) require the Crown to establish the existence of a pattern of behaviour, whether it be a “pattern of repetitive behaviour” or a “pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour”. For both subparagraphs of this provision, the predicate offence must form part of that pattern—in the words of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal, the predicate offence serves as the “last straw in a series of dangerous violence on the part of the perpetrator” (R v Newman (1994), 1994 CanLII 9717 (NL CA), 115 Nfld \u0026 PEIR 197 (Nfld CA) at para 71).[57]Other appellate courts have interpreted the meaning of the “pattern” requirement in ss. 753(1)(a)(i) and (ii). Because the wording of these two subparagraphs has not changed since 1977, it does not matter which statutory regime any of these cases were decided under. The words they were interpreting are the same.[58]In R v Neve, 1999 ABCA 206 (CanLII), [1999] 11 WWR 649 [Neve], the Alberta Court of Appeal interpreted the meaning of the “pattern” requirement, and identified the three requisite elements of a pattern within the meaning of this section: the incidents must be criminal in nature; the past incidents must involve some degree of violence or attempted violence; and there must be similarity either in the kinds of offences or in the degree of violence used. The Court stated:[109] What do these sections require in assessing an offender’s past conduct? First, the type of past behaviour encompassed by these sections is criminal behaviour since the predicate offence, a criminal one by definition, must form part of the pattern of conduct. The dangerous offender legislation is directed at those who hurt people through criminal, as opposed to simply anti-social, conduct. The latter cannot be the foundation for a dangerous offender application.[110] This takes us to the second point: the quality of the past behaviour. Does all criminal behaviour form part of the pattern? In our view, it does not. We read s. 753(a) as requiring that the court be satisfied on two points: (a) that the predicate offence is part of a pattern of behaviour which has involved violent, aggressive or brutal conduct; and (b) that it is likely that this pattern of conduct will continue and will lead to conduct endangering the life, safety or physical well-being of others: see Lyons, supra. Since a predicate offence under s. 753(a) must be a “serious personal injury offence” (meaning that it itself must meet either a violence or endangerment requirement under s. 752(a)), it follows logically that the past behaviour must also have involved some degree of violence or attempted violence or endangerment or likely endangerment (whether more or less serious than the predicate offence). Otherwise, the predicate offence would not be part of that pattern.[111] Third, repetitive behaviour under s. 753(a)(i) and persistent aggressive behaviour under s. 753(a)(ii) can be established on two different bases. [Persistent in this context has been equated with repetitive: Yanoshewski, supra.] The first is where there are similarities in terms of the kind of offences; the second where the offences themselves are not similar in kind, but in result, in terms of the degree of violence or aggression inflicted on the victims. Either will do. Thus, the mere fact that an offender commits a variety of crimes does not mean that no pattern exists. There is no requirement that the past criminal actions all be of the same or similar form, order or arrangement; though if this has occurred, it may well suffice.[59]The British Columbia Court of Appeal utilized a similar interpretation in its slightly earlier decision in R v Dow, 1999 BCCA 177 (CanLII), 134 CCC (3d) 323 [Dow]. It stated:[24] In short, the significance and the relevance of common elements of the pattern must be determined by whether they tend to show first, repetitive behaviour, second, that there has been a failure in each case to restrain the behaviour, and third, that there has been injury to other persons arising from that failure. If any of those three elements is missing, then there may be a pattern but it will not be a relevant pattern. But if all three are present then the essential elements of a relevant pattern are revealed.[60]In R v Hogg, 2011 ONCA 840 (CanLII), 287 OAC 82, the Ontario Court of Appeal considered an appeal by an offender who was designated as a dangerous offender and sentenced to an indeterminate sentence. He argued on appeal the trial judge erred in concluding the predicate offence was sufficiently similar to his prior offences to constitute a pattern for the purpose of s. 753(1)(a)(i). The Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, and stated:[40] To summarize, the pattern of repetitive behaviour that includes the predicate offence has to contain enough of the same elements of unrestrained dangerous conduct to be able to predict that the offender will likely offend in the same way in the future. This will ensure that the level of gravity of the behaviour is the same, so that the concern raised by Marshall J.A. – that the last straw could be a much more minor infraction – could not result in a dangerous offender designation. However, the offences need not be the same in every detail; that would unduly restrict the application of the section.[61]In R v Pike, 2010 BCCA 401 (CanLII), 260 CCC (3d) 68, the British Columbia Court of Appeal addressed the issue of whether a link must exist in s. 753(1)(a)(i) between the pattern of repetitive behaviour and the potential for future offending in order for an offender to be designated as a dangerous offender. The Court held such a link must exist. It stated:[80] The “threat” under s. (a) is to be determined “on the basis of evidence” of a pattern of behaviour under ss. (i) or (ii). That pattern, in turn, must be linked to the predicate offence.[81] Breaking any of these connections – between the predicate offence, the pattern analysis or the threat assessment – distorts the careful balance of the provisions, and risks serious injustice. This is revealed more clearly when one considers the provisions broadly.…[83] Similarly, the pattern analysis is inextricably linked to the ultimate threat assessment. It is the basis for predicting the future behaviour which threatens others. As explained in Neve, the two are linked in the sense that “the court cannot make a determination that an offender constitutes a threat in the manner specified in s. 753(a) except on the basis of evidence that meets at least one of the specified behaviour thresholds….[62]In R v Szostak, 2014 ONCA 15 (CanLII), 306 CCC (3d) 68 [Szostak], the Ontario Court of Appeal held the offences need not be serial offences and the offender’s behaviour need not be intractable for a pattern to be made out under ss. 753(1)(a)(i) or (ii):[60] First, the trial judge erred in finding that since the offences were “spontaneous occurrences” they could not be said to be “serial offences”. There is no requirement that the offences be serial offences. Indeed, the fact that the various offences were spontaneous strongly tells in favour of a pattern in the sense of both paras. (i) and (ii). Looking particularly at para. (i), that the appellant was capable of spontaneously acting with such great violence as exhibited in the four offences demonstrates a failure to restrain his behaviour and a likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons through failure in the future to restrain his or her behaviour.…[62] As I have said, the present legislation does not require intractability as a necessary element for a finding of dangerous offender. Intractability will be an important consideration for the sentencing judge in deciding what disposition to impose under s. 753(4) and (4.1).[63]While the Supreme Court’s decision in Lyons was not about the pattern requirement for designating an individual as a dangerous offender, La Forest J. nevertheless made some useful statements regarding the type of individuals that these provisions are intended to capture. In discussing the restricted application of these provisions, he stated at p. 338:First, the legislation applies only to persons convicted of a “serious personal injury offence” as defined in s. 687 [now s. 752]. These offences all relate to conduct tending to cause severe physical danger or severe psychological injury to other persons. Significantly, the maximum penalty for all these offences must be at least ten years’ imprisonment. Secondly, it must be established to the satisfaction of the court that the offence for which the person has been convicted is not an isolated occurrence, but part of a pattern of behaviour which has involved violence, aggressive or brutal conduct, or a failure to control sexual impulses. Thirdly, it must be established that the pattern of conduct is very likely to continue and to result in the kind of suffering against which the section seeks to protect, namely, conduct endangering the life, safety or physical well-being of others or, in the case of sexual offences, conduct causing injury, pain or evil to other persons. Also explicit in one form or another in each subparagraph of s. 687 is the requirement that the court must be satisfied that the pattern of conduct is substantially or pathologically intractable….3.Summary[64]Section 753(1)(a) is aimed at identifying patterns of violent behaviour. It is the repetition of the violent behaviour which forms the pattern.[65]Repetition obviously implies there is more than one offence. Thus an offender must have prior violent offences (even if only one), and the predicate offence must constitute a repetition of the offender’s violent behaviour.[66]This is true of both s. 753(1)(a)(i) and s. 753(1)(a)(ii). Both are aimed at identifying repetitive violent behaviour. For s. 753(1)(a)(i), the repetitive behaviour must show a failure to restrain the offender’s behaviour as well as a likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons. For s. 753(1)(a)(ii), the repetitive behaviour must show a substantial indifference on the part of the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his or her actions.[67]There are two main ways of identifying this repetitive behaviour: as stated in Neve at para. 111, there may be similarities in the types of offences, or similarities in the degree of violence used. For example, an offender with a history of committing aggravated assaults has necessarily demonstrated a repetition of violent behaviour, as a high degree of violence is implied in the very nature of aggravated assault. Rosenberg J.A. in the Szostak decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal, at para. 63, agreed with Neve stating “Similarity… can be found not only in the types of offences but also in the degree of violence or aggression threatened or inflicted on the victims” (Neve at para. 113).[68]However, despite similarities in the violent behaviour, the offences may be different due to extrinsic factors: for example, the victim may have died rather than been wounded (leading to a manslaughter charge rather than an assault charge); or the offender may have pleaded guilty to a lesser included offence for the purpose of a plea bargain. These extrinsic factors may mean the types of offences on the offender’s record are not the same, despite the fact the offender has repeatedly engaged in a similar degree of violent behaviour. To ensure the dissimilarities in extrinsic factors do not affect the issue of whether an offender is a dangerous offender, “repetition” can be demonstrated by similarities in the degree of violence used.[69]The Alberta Court of Appeal chose to use the phrase “degree of violence” to describe this latter idea in Neve. Another way of characterizing this same idea could be to refer to it as the “nature of the violence”. The nature of violence used may demonstrate significant similarities in the offender’s behaviour which in turn may ground a finding of “repetitive behaviour”—for example, an offender who continually uses weapons to committing violent offences, regardless of what the specific type of offence is. The point is that the focus should be on similarities in the offender’s violent behaviour that show a failure to restrain that behaviour.[70]Thus, where an offender has repeatedly engaged in violent behaviour and a pattern has been established showing (a) a failure to restrain his or her behaviour and (b) a likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons, or inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons in the future through a failure to restrain such behaviour, the offender must be designated as a dangerous offender. The fact of repetition demonstrates a failure to restrain the violent behaviour but the additional element of future risk must also be established.[71]Similarly, once a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour has been demonstrated under s. 753(1)(a)(ii) showing a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences of his or her actions, then the offender must be designated as a dangerous offender.[72]Thus, the pattern/repetition analysis provides the evidentiary basis for assessing the future threat. It is this future threat the dangerous offender provisions are aimed at curbing. Broadly speaking, if a court is unable to conclude the offender will pose a danger to the public in the future based on the offender’s prior violent offences, the requirements of s. 753(1)(a) have not been met and the offender must not be designated as a dangerous offender. However, if it is apparent the predicate offence is not an isolated occurrence but is rather a repetition of violent behaviour which shows a failure to restrain violent behaviour and is likely to continue in the future causing injury or death to others (for s. 753(1)(a)(i)), then the offender does pose a danger to the public in the required sense and should be accordingly designated as a dangerous offender.[73]With these principles in mind, I turn to the sentencing judge’s decision in this case.4.The Alleged Errors[74]The Crown argues: the sentencing judge erred by reading s. 753 (1)(a) as requiring too high a degree of factual similarity between the manslaughter offence and the predicate offence; the sentencing judge failed to recognize the importance of Mr. Knife’s youth offences; and finally, the sentencing judge erred by failing to take into account the expert evidence. Its key submission is the first point and, as a result, I will focus on that point.[75]I reiterate this is a Crown appeal and it is limited to a question of law alone. The Crown frames the question of law here as an error in interpreting a statutory provision, namely s. 753(1)(a). I accept that the proper interpretation of s. 753(1)(a) is a question of law for the purpose of a Crown appeal: Dow at para. 27. The assessment of the evidence based on an alleged misinterpretation of this provision also raises a question of law: Szostak at paras. 58-59; R v J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45 (CanLII) at paras 29-30, [2011] 3 SCR 197.[76]In my opinion, the sentencing judge did err by requiring too high a degree of factual similarity between the circumstances of the offences. He focused on the differences in the specific contexts of the 2005 manslaughter offence and the 2008 predicate offence, namely that the 2005 manslaughter involved significant alcohol consumption and had nothing to do with gangs, while the predicate offence involved no alcohol at all and was entirely gang-related. He did not assess whether there was nevertheless sufficient similarity in the violent behaviour to allow him to conclude that such behaviour is likely to continue in the future and is likely to cause injury or death to others.[77]The sentencing judge also failed to assess whether there were any similarities in the elements of unrestrained behaviour between the youth offences, the manslaughter, and the predicate offences that were sufficient to establish a pattern of dangerous behaviour. He found the elements of a “pattern” to be missing in this case. However, with respect, he did so in error.[78]As stated above, the purpose of the “pattern” requirement is to determine whether there is an evidentiary basis capable of supporting a finding the offender is likely to continue to violently offend in the future as per ss. 753(1)(a)(i) or (ii), and is thus a person from whom the public must be protected. Factual similarities in the contexts of the offender’s previous offences are relevant, but similarities in the actual violence used cannot be ignored. The lack of contextual similarities is not fatal to the existence of a pattern if there are sufficient similarities in the elements of the offender’s violent behaviour to show a failure to restrain that behaviour and a likelihood of causing death or injury in the future.[79]Thus, the sentencing judge erred in his interpretation of what is required by s. 753(1)(a). Because this error involved the interpretation and application of a statutory provision, it is an error of law. This leads to the next issue: what this Court should do in light of this error.[80]Section 759(3) of the Criminal Code sets out the powers of this Court in a Part XXIV appeal. It may allow the appeal and find Mr. Knife to be a dangerous offender, alter the sentence, or order a new hearing. As the British Columbia Court of Appeal stated in Dow, whether an appellate court should impose a dangerous offender designation on its own depends on the nature of the identified error:[37] I think the correct approach to the question of whether, having identified the error in law, the Court should make a finding that the offender is a dangerous offender must lie in looking at the nature of the error in law, looking at the evidence and any relevant findings of fact by the trial judge that are not contaminated by the error, and deciding whether, on the evidence and on those findings of fact, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the offender met all the conditions of one of the subparas. of para.753(a) and was therefore, under the authority of R. v. Moore, a dangerous offender. In some cases that clarity will be present. In others it may not. In those cases where it is not present a new hearing would be required, as contemplated by s-s. 759(4)(a), in relation to the very first stage of the sentencing process, namely, deciding whether the offender is a dangerous offender.[81]The sentencing judge’s error in this case is simply that he interpreted s. 753(1)(a) to require a high degree of factual similarity between the circumstances of the offences, while ignoring the parallels in the unrestrained behaviour constituting those offences. Had he looked at this case based on the similarities in Mr. Knife’s violent offending rather than the dissimilarities in the circumstances of that offending, the evidence was sufficient to establish that Mr. Knife should be designated as a dangerous offender under s. 753(1)(a)(i).[82]Mr. Knife has been committing violent offences on a regular basis since he was 12 years old. It is appropriate to consider his youth record in these circumstances because all of this past behaviour may be predictive of future behaviour. The levels of violence he used have increased from simple assaults to an assault with a weapon (the 2003 beer bottle assault), to manslaughter and aggravated assault (both involving extreme violence with a knife). He has consistently failed to control this violence, and has been violent in a variety of different circumstances. Given this history, there is a pattern of repetitive behaviour which shows both a failure to restrain his behaviour and a likelihood of causing death or injury in the future.[83]As Dr. Lohrasbe indicated in his testimony, the fact Mr. Knife has committed violent offences in so many different contexts points to the fact he is more likely to be violent in the future:… He has been violent when he has been intoxicated and he’s been sober. He has been violent in institutions. He has been violent outside of institutions, and we all know to the fact that he has been violent, at least to some degree, within a spousal relationship. So what we know from that is that the -- his potential for violence is not restricted to a very narrow situation. Just to illustrate that, there are some people who are recurrently violent, but only in the context of ballroom [sic] brawls. They seem to channel all their aggression in a very limited way, and if you can keep them away from bars and keep them away from alcohol then you’ve got a leg up on -- on -- on limiting the context. What you’re pointing to is the breadth of the context within which he could be violent. (at T56)[84]There is also some factual similarity between all of Mr. Knife’s offences. As the Crown pointed out in its factum and in oral argument, Mr. Knife has acted in concert with others in virtually all of these offences. Dr. Lohrasbe picked up on this in his testimony, referring to Mr. Knife’s tendency to commit violent crimes in concert with others as a “somewhat unusual feature of his history” (T60), though Dr. Lohrasbe noted that he was unable to really explore why Mr. Knife tends to commit violent offences when he acts in concert with others.[85]There is even more factual similarity between Mr. Knife’s two adult offences, perhaps not in their circumstantial contexts, but in the elements of violence used. Mr. Knife violently stabbed two people in the 2005 manslaughter. Mr. Knife violently stabbed two people in the 2008 predicate offence. The similarity is not that he stabbed two people in each instance —the number of victims is more coincidence than anything else—but rather that both of these offences involved a significant degree of violence using a similar weapon and inflicting similar injuries on the victims. The only reason the charges were different was that Mr. Morin died while Mr. Dorion survived.[86]In summary, Mr. Knife has been committing violent offences since he was a boy. Almost all of these offences have been committed in concert with others. These offences have escalated in the level of violence used, culminating in the brutal stabbings of the 2005 manslaughter and the 2008 predicate offence. Mr. Knife has been assessed at a high risk to reoffend violently in the future, though institutional programming and his decision to leave the Indian Posse gang may help in lowering this risk. However, his offending history demonstrates he repeatedly resorts to violence in a wide variety of situations, and it is likely he will continue to offend in the future. In short, all of the elements of s. 753(1)(a)(i) are made out. Mr. Knife should be designated as a dangerous offender.[87]The Crown argues Mr. Knife can be designated as a dangerous offender under either s. 753(1)(a)(i) or (ii). In light of my conclusion above, it is not necessary to consider whether Mr. Knife could also be designated as a dangerous offender under s. 753(1)(a)(ii). Similarly, it is not necessary for me to deal, as separate issues, with the Crown’s other two arguments regarding the sentencing judge’s treatment of Mr. Knife’s youth offences and the expert evidence.F.Conclusion[88]The Crown’s sentence appeal is allowed. The sentencing judge erred by requiring too high a degree of factual similarity between the circumstances of Mr. Knife’s prior offences and the predicate offences, thereby losing sight of the repetitive elements of his violent behaviour and the likelihood this violence will continue in the future. Mr. Knife’s behaviour indicates he is a danger to the public as contemplated by s. 753(1)(a)(i) and he shall accordingly be designated as a dangerous offender. Pending the resolution of Mr. Knife’s cross-appeal on sentence below, his substantive sentence shall remain unaltered.V.Mr. knife’s cross-appeal[89]Mr. Knife cross-appealed his sentence, arguing the sentencing judge erred by designating him as a long-term offender; and erred in principle by imposing a sentence that was demonstrably unfit; and further erred in granting him one to one remand credit. I will deal with each of these grounds of appeal in turn.A.Long-Term Offender Designation[90]In light of my conclusion above that the sentencing judge erred in declining to designate Mr. Knife a dangerous offender, this ground of appeal is moot.B.Fitness of the Sentence[91]Mr. Knife argues the sentencing judge erred in imposing an eight-year sentence. He submits the sentencing judge erred in principle in two respects: first, the sentencing judge failed to consider Mr. Knife’s prospects of rehabilitation and the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in R v Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 SCR 688 [Gladue]; and second, the sentencing judge failed to apply the principle of parity because Messrs. Coutu and Raphael were sentenced to shorter sentences than Mr. Knife.1.Rehabilitation[92]Mr. Knife argues the sentencing judge erred by failing to consider Mr. Knife’s prospects for rehabilitation as mandated by Gladue. I cannot accept this submission.[93]The sentencing judge clearly referred to these principles at para. 92 of his decision, stating:It is the responsibility of this Court to impose a fit and proper sentence, having regard to the sentencing principles and objectives set forth in the Criminal Code at ss. 718, 718.1 and 718.2. Because the offender is aboriginal, I have considered, in particular, s. 718.2(e) and decisions that have interpreted that subsection, including R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 SCR 688, 171 DLR (4th) 385. The offence of aggravated assault is a serious offence as demonstrated by the fact that the maximum penalty is a term of imprisonment of up to 14 years.[94]Moreover, the sentencing judge’s reasons disclose a preoccupation with Mr. Knife’s prospects for rehabilitation. The evidence before the sentencing judge was clear that Mr. Knife needed serious intervention in order to reduce his risk of reoffending in the future. Mr. Knife was placed in segregation shortly after the predicate offence was committed, and he was placed on remand in a provincial facility in June of 2009. He remained on remand until the date of sentencing in May of 2013, and he thus did not have access to any rehabilitative programming during that time.[95]The sentencing judge recognized that Mr. Knife needed institutional programming in order to rehabilitate himself, and he had not yet had the opportunity to take such programming. He thus crafted a sentence which would ensure that Mr. Knife would be incarcerated for a sufficient period of time to allow him to complete the programming necessary for his rehabilitation. He stated this at para. 103 of the sentencing judgment:Similarly, here the offender has spent almost four years in pre-sentence custody. A two-for-one credit would have the effect of releasing the offender into the public immediately, which would have potentially disastrous consequences. He needs further incarceration, during which intensive programming for his problems should be undertaken.[96]The sentencing judge also recognized Mr. Knife needs eventual assistance in the community in order to effectively facilitate his rehabilitation and reintegration. This is why he decided to impose a lengthy long-term supervision order (or LTSO). This reasoning can be found at para. 106 of the sentencing judgment:In my view, a lengthy long-term supervision order is required in order to give the offender the best chance to succeed and to protect the public. The longer that he can be supervised in the community, the better. There is no rational basis in this case to reduce the long-term supervision order from the ten-year maximum.[97]As an aside, I am not convinced it is correct in principle to begin from the presumption of a ten-year LTSO and to only reduce the length if a lesser LTSO will give the offender a sufficient chance to successfully reintegrate into the community while still adequately protecting the public. In cases where it is appropriate to order an LTSO, the length of the LTSO should be tailored to the specific needs of each offender, and the sentencing judge’s reasons should disclose why a particular length is being ordered. However, based on the evidence before the sentencing judge I accept that a ten-year LTSO was an appropriate order on the facts of this case.[98]The LTSO order and the reasons for it disclose the sentencing judge was clearly alive to the importance of the principle of rehabilitation. He crafted a sentence which, based on the evidence before him, gave Mr. Knife the best opportunity to be rehabilitated. I fail to see how this is an error in principle. This ground of appeal should be dismissed.2.Parity[99]Mr. Knife argues the sentencing judge erred in principle by failing to take into account the sentences received by his two co-accused. Mr. Knife did not disclose to this Court in his factum or in oral argument what those sentences were or why the co-accused received lighter sentences than Mr. Knife. However, a close examination of the transcript of Mr. Knife’s dangerous offender hearing and the lower court file reveals the following.[100]First, Mr. Coutu was sentenced pursuant to a joint submission after entering a guilty plea. He received a sentence of 48 months. However, he was serving a life sentence at the time of this offence, so the sentence that he received for this offence was imposed in an unusual context.[101]Second, Mr. Raphael initially entered a not guilty plea. After the preliminary inquiry, he changed his plea to guilty. He was sentenced to 44 months pursuant to a joint submission. There is no other indication in the file as to why he received such a comparatively short sentence.[102]The principle of parity requires that sentences which are given to co-accused for the same crime be similar unless there is a justified reason for disparity: R v O’Soup, 2011 SKCA 97 (CanLII) at paras 9-10, 385 Sask R 2. However, as this Court noted in R v Akapew, 2009 SKCA 137 (CanLII) at para 20, 249 CCC (3d) 212, the sentence imposed on a co-accused is persuasive for the purpose of the parity principle, but if the sentence imposed on the co-accused is inadequate, it should be ignored.[103]The sentencing judge in this case correctly noted that the range for similar aggravated assaults involving a similar level of violence with similar aggravating factors is seven to eight-and-a-half years. See, e.g.: R v Keepness, 2010 SKCA 69 (CanLII), 255 CCC (3d) 457 (seven years); R v Fulton, 2012 ONCA 781 (CanLII), 105 WCB (2d) 612 (nine years); R v Larose, 2013 BCCA 450 (CanLII), 344 BCAC 159 (seven years); R v Agyeman, 2012 ONCA 893 (CanLII), 2012 ONCA 893 (eight years).[104]The sentences Mr. Coutu and Mr. Raphael received were well below this range. While we have no information on why these offenders received such low sentences, they do not automatically entitle Mr. Knife to a sentence which is also below the acceptable range. The sentence imposed on Mr. Knife is a fit sentence, and the sentences imposed on his co-accused would be inadequate for Mr. Knife, given his own circumstances and the paramount principle of public protection in the context of a sentence under Part XXIV. The sentences received by Messrs. Coutu and Raphael do not govern here, and this ground of appeal must be dismissed.3.Remand Credit[105]Mr. Knife’s final ground of appeal is the issue of remand credit. He spent approximately four years on remand. The sentencing judge declined to grant him enhanced credit, as to do so would mean he would be released into the community almost immediately. Given his violent behaviour and the need for significant institutional programming, releasing him almost immediately would, in the words of the sentencing judge, “have potentially disastrous consequences” (at para. 103). The sentencing judge declined to grant enhanced credit, and instead used his discretion to grant one to one credit so Mr. Knife can spend adequate time in custody for him to complete the necessary programming.[106]I begin by noting the predicate offence was committed before the 2010 amendments to s. 719 of the Criminal Code came into effect, but Mr. Knife was sentenced after those amendments came into effect. It is the old version of this section that applies to the issue of remand credit for Mr. Knife: R v Marriott, 2014 NSCA 28 (CanLII) at paras 88-89, 309 CCC (3d) 305.[107]The granting of remand credit above the statutory minimum is a discretionary decision, and it attracts a deferential standard of review. In R v E.E.D., 2007 SKCA 99 (CanLII), 304 Sask R 192, this Court dismissed an offender’s appeal on an identical remand credit issue. It stated:[74] Even though it is common to give double credit in sentencing for time spent on remand, there clearly is no absolute rule to this effect. The discretion accorded to the trial judge is particularly important in a context like the one before us, in which the trial judge must consider what period of incarceration is required, where certain programming will be available, so that, coupled with a period of community supervision, the risk to the community posed by a long-term offender can be controlled.[75] In my view, there is no basis to interfere with the discretion of the trial judge in relation to this ground of appeal.[108]This reasoning applies equally to the case before us. The sentencing judge clearly considered defence counsel’s request for enhanced credit, but held it would not appropriately provide Mr. Knife with the programming he required so that his risk could be reduced and reasonably controlled in the community. The sentencing judge was not obligated to grant enhanced credit and he had a justified, principled reason for declining to grant such credit in this case: namely, Mr. Knife’s rehabilitative needs. There is no basis for this Court to interfere with his discretion on this ground. This ground of appeal must be dismissed.VI.Conclusion[109]The Crown’s sentence appeal is allowed, and Mr. Knife shall be designated as a dangerous offender. The sentencing judge erred in law by requiring too high a degree of factual similarity between Mr. Knife’s prior offences, thereby misapplying s. 753(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. Mr. Knife’s cross-appeal on sentence is dismissed, as the sentencing judge did not err in principle and imposed a determinate sentence that was fit in the circumstances. The end result is that Mr. Knife’s designation shall change from a long-term offender to a dangerous offender, but his substantive sentence shall remain unaltered.Dated at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 8th day of July, A.D. 2015.“Lane J.A.”Lane J.A.I concur.“Richards C.J.S.”Richards C.J.S.I concur.“Herauf J.A.”Herauf J.A."}
