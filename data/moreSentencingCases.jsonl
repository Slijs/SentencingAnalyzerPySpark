Hillfor the accusedSENTENCINGGABRIELSON J.June 20, 2012INTRODUCTION[1]C.D.M. (the accused) plead guilty to the following offence:1.between the 28th day of November, A.D. 2006 and the 11th day of December, A.D. 2006 at or near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan did by criminal negligence to wit: not ensuring S.C.C. received medical care, cause the death of S.C.C. contrary to Section 220(b) of the Criminal Code.[2]Following the accused’s plea, counsel for the accused requested that I order a pre-sentence report (PSR). The PSR was ordered and filed with the court on January 26, 2012.[3]Counsel for the accused also requested that a sentencing circle be established and on March 9, 2012 a hearing was held at which counsel made submissions as to whether a sentencing circle was appropriate in the circumstances of this case. In a written decision dated April 19, 2012, I exercised my discretion not to order a sentencing circle and dismissed the application.[4]Sentencing submissions were then made by counsel on May 25, 2012 and I reserved my decision.FACTS[5]Counsel have filed an agreed statement of facts for the purposes of the sentencing hearing wherein the Crown alleged and the defence admitted the following:1.S.C.C. was born to C.D.M. on […], 2005. She was apprehended by Social Services at birth due to testing positive for opiates and placed in the foster care of G.W..2.The accused’s other 3 children, J. (DOB […], 2000); S.1 (DOB: […], 2001); and S.2 (DOB: […], 2003) were then placed into the care of family members through a private arrangement made by C.D.M..3.At some point after S.C.C.’s apprehension, C.D.M. went on the methadone program.4.Visitation with S.C.C. started in January, 2006 and it was somewhat sporadic due to the accused failing to show for a number of visits.5.G.W. noted that, during the visits C.D.M. had with S.C.C., she never seemed to touch her or show her any affection.6.After the accused’s toxicology screens were done and she maintained stable housing, it was approved that the older children could return home on April 7, 2006.7.S.C.C. was permanently returned home on May 30, 2006.8.On August 8, 2006, S.C.C. was admitted to hospital due to burns on her legs from hot water. During that hospitalization, she was seen by Dr. McKenna, a child abuse expert, who noted her to be normally nourished and a reasonably outgoing baby. Dr. McKenna noted that an x-ray revealed a healing fracture of S.C.C.’s upper arm bone, which would have been at least two weeks old. She noted that this would have been a very painful injury and the child would have not wanted to use her arm.9.S.C.C. was discharged on August 30, 2006 to her mother.10.C.D.M. gave birth to L. on […], 2006, who remained in hospital until the end of […], 2006.11.On September 22, 2006, C.D.M. contacted her social worker, Shawna Dickoff [sic], to request a bus ticket to have S.C.C. brought home as she advised that she had been with her sister, D.M., in K[…].12.Shawna Dickoff [sic] made a referral to the Saskatoon Tribal Counsel [sic]. On September 19, 2006, Pauline Cardinal, a worker for the Providers of Aboriginal Lifestyle Support (PALS) program first met with with [sic] C.D.M. and brought with her an Elder.13.From September to December, 2006, the accused made several requests to both Shawna Dickoff [sic] and Pauline Cardinal for transportation for herself and her children which was then provided.14.Pauline Cardinal conducted a home visit on September 28, 2006 and was told by C.D.M. that S.C.C. was sleeping.15.S.C.C. was last seen by Shawn Dickoff [sic] on October 4, 2006 at a home visit and was observed in a high chair.16.On her next home visit of October 13, 2006, Shawn Dickoff [sic] was told by C.D.M. that S.C.C. was down for her nap.17.On October 17, 2006, Pauline Cardinal took C.D.M. and her two older children to register at S[…]’s School.18.On October 18, 2006, Pauline Cardinal assisted the accused in getting to the pharmacy to pick up her methadone.19.On October 24, 2006, Pauline Cardinal picked up the accused and S.2 and took them to the Saskatoon Correctional Centre to drop off clothing for her common-law spouse, a serving prisoner.20.On October 30, 2006, Pauline Cardinal made a home visit. The accused advised her that two children were at school and the others were napping.21.On November 14, 2006, Pauline Cardinal made a home visit. At that time C.D.M. noted that baby L. was sick and wanted to have him checked out at the hospital. Pauline took her to Royal University Hospital.22.On November 15, 2006, C.D.M. called Pauline Cardinal, advising that L. was sounding worse and she wanted to go back to the doctor. Pauline Cardinal did drive her to the doctor.23.On November 16, 2006, the accused called Shawna Dickoff [sic] and advised that she had to go to the pharmacy to pick up her methadone and that Pauline Cardinal was not available. Ms. Dickoff [sic] approved a cab for her.24.On November 17, 2006, Shawna Dickoff [sic] was advised that baby L. was in the hospital with pneumonia.25.On November 22, 2006, Pauline Cardinal made a home visit to C.D.M., at which time she was advised by her that L. was in hospital and S.C.C. was with her sister, D.M..26.On November 27, 2006, C.D.M. contacted Dr. Zenon Belak’s office to request a home visit for her daughter, S.C.C.. Dr. Belak made a home visit that evening, but only L.M., the child’s uncle, was present and not the accused.27.Dr. Belak noted that S.C.C. had extensive infection around her mouth and face, which he described as peri‑oral cellulitis. At that point, S.C.C. had no signs of distress nor of dehydration. The accused was not available by telephone, so Dr. Belak told L.M. to have her call him in the morning.28.C.D.M. called Dr. Belak on the morning of November 28, 2006. Dr. Belak advised C.D.M. that S.C.C. was pretty sick and she should take her right away to the pediatric emergency at University Hospital.29.On November 30, 2006, the accused’s sister, T.M., was helping her move and stayed with her overnight. T.M. noted the red rash around S.C.C.’s mouth and was told by the accused that it was thrush, a rash around a baby’s mouth caused by a bottle, and said that she had medicine for it. That same date, T.M. offered to drive the accused and S.C.C. to a doctor to have S.C.C. checked out. The accused declined the offer and told her sister that she would wait until the next day and, if S.C.C. was not better, she would take her herself.30.D.M. advised Saskatoon Police that the last time she saw S.C.C. was in the month of September, 2006 and had not been getting along with C.D.M. after that time.31.On December 1, 2006, Pauline Cardinal took C.D.M. shopping to Safeway at her request.32.On December 5, 2006, C.D.M. contacted Pauline Cardinal to advise that her two children, J. and S.1, needed transportation home from school, so Pauline picked them up and dropped them off at their apartment building.33.On December 11, 2006, at approximately 13:45 hours, C.D.M. contacted emergency services to advise that S.C.C. was not breathing. When MD Ambulance personnel arrived, it was apparent that S.C.C. had already been deceased for a while.34.Forensic Pathologist, Dr. Shawn Ladham, performed the autopsy on S.C.C.’s body on December 13, 2006. He concluded that S.C.C. had impetigo contagiosa, which is a skin infection due to streptococcus pyogenes. This type of infection has the potential of going into the skin and deeper, causing cellulitis and it can go into the blood and cause a blood-borne infection which can be fatal. He concluded that the infection had been present for a prolonged period of time and was the cause of death.35.Dr. Ladham noted four separate rib fractures that would have dated from two separate dates. These fractures were in the process of healing, which meant that they were at least two weeks old. It was also noted that S.C.C.’s body was covered with numerous bruises that were of different ages.36.After reviewing Dr. Ladham’s report and the autopsy photographs, Dr. McKenna stated that there was absolutely no fat on S.C.C. and there had been a substantial weight loss of 3 to 4 kilograms from the time she had seen her in August, 2006. Specifically, Dr. McKenna noted that babies are supposed to gain weight, not lose it. She also stated that it was not possible that the caregiver could not have noticed how sick the child was.37.In warned video statements provided to Saskatoon Police Service, C.D.M. admitted the following:a. That she did not take S.C.C. to a doctor because she was scared that, due to the bruises on S.C.C., she and the other children would be apprehended by Social Services.b.That she was trying to make S.C.C. better on her own and then planned on giving her back to the foster parents after Christmas because she felt the child had not bonded with her.38.Shawna Dickhoff noted the accused home to be the cleanest, most well-kept home of any of her 44 cases she had at the time. When she saw the accused’s children, they always appeared very well-cared for and she never had any concern with the accused’s ability to provide for their needs.39.On December 11, 2006, Shawn [sic] Dickhoff took the accused’s other children to Royal University Hospital to be examined after S.C.C.’s death. The pediatrician noted at that time that they all appeared to be well-cared for and he had no concerns.SUBMISSIONS BY COUNSEL(a)Position of the Crown[6]Crown counsel submitted that a term of imprisonment of three years would be appropriate in the circumstances of this case. She stated that the Crown’s position was that the goals of denunciation and deterrence should be paramount since S.C.C., (the victim), was a child. Counsel submitted that the accused had admitted that she did not take the victim to the hospital as had been recommended by the doctor, because she feared that if she did, her other children would be taken away from her. Counsel submitted that it was clear that the accused had numerous resources including her family, the Saskatoon Tribal Council and the Ministry of Social Services whom she had accessed whenever her other children were ill but that she did not do so in S.C.C.’s case. Counsel pointed out that on November 28, 2006, the accused had spoken to Dr. Belak who told her that S.C.C. was very sick and needed to be taken to the hospital but that the accused did not do so. Every day for the next 14 days the accused would have made a decision not to take S.C.C. to a doctor because of her fear that her other children would be apprehended because of S.C.C.’s condition. Crown counsel submitted this was not a momentary lapse of judgment or a lashing out as a result of other pressures being experienced by the accused as referred to in some reported cases but rather a conscious decision not to provide care for the victim. Counsel refers to the photographs of the victim which she stated show a marked contrast between the photograph taken while the victim was in foster care which show a healthy robust child and those taken at the autopsy when the victim was “skin and bones”. Crown counsel in her submissions filed no additional case authorities but during the sentencing circle submissions had indicated that the basis for the Crown’s position that three years of imprisonment was the appropriate sentence was the precedent set by the case of R. v. Pauchay, 2009 SKPC 35 (CanLII), 333 Sask. R. 167.(b) Position of the accused[7]Counsel for the accused submitted that an appropriate sentence in the circumstances of this case would be 18 months to 2 years less a day with the sentence to be served in the community. Counsel pointed out that the record of the accused was minor with no offences in the past five years. Counsel submits that the PSR indicates that the accused is a suitable candidate for a sentence in the community and that electronic monitoring would be available if it was to be made a condition. Counsel submits that the accused has the support of the victim’s family and that going to jail would not be in the interests of her other children or society. Counsel submits that there are a number of mitigating factors the court must consider including:(1)a guilty plea;(2)expressions of remorse;(3)lack of breaches or reoffending while the accused has been on a release undertaking for the past five years; and(4)the Gladue factors as referred to in s. 718(2)(e) of the Criminal Code.[8]As part of his sentencing submissions counsel for the accused referred to the cases of R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, 133 C.C.C. (3d) 385, and R. v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII), [2012] S.C.J. No. 13 (QL). During submissions in respect to the sentencing circle application, counsel for the accused had also referred to the cases of: R. v. Pauchay, supra; R. v. Fineday, 2007 SKPC 2 (CanLII), 46 C.R. (6th) 108; R. v. Lam, 2004 ABQB 78 (CanLII), 37 Alta. L.R. (4th) 141; R. v. Pashe (1995), 1995 CanLII 6256 (MB CA), 100 Man. R. (2d) 61, [1995] M.J. No. 76 (Man. C.A.) (QL); R. v. Patten (2002), 2002 CanLII 22206 (NL SCTD), 218 Nfld.\u0026 P.E.I.R. 303, [2002] N.J. No. 295 (N.L.S.C.) (QL); R. v. Rope (1995), 1995 CanLII 4084 (SK QB), 136 Sask. R. 171, [1995] S.J. No. 738 (Q.B.) (QL); R. v. J.K.E., 1999 YTYC 501, [1999] Y.J. No. 119 (QL), and an unreported decision by Lavoie P.C.J., R. v. Tera Lynn Bouvier (January 13, 2011), Saskatoon 88295-07 (Sask. Prov. Ct.). The Fineday case and the Rope case were cases in which the charges were impaired driving causing death or causing bodily harm and while relevant to the issue of whether a sentencing circle should be ordered are not relevant in terms of what would be an appropriate sentence in the circumstances of this case.PRE-SENTENCE REPORT[9]The PSR indicates that the accused is currently 30 years of age having been born […], 1981. She was the second youngest child in a sibling group of six children. Her parents divorced when she was 2 years of age and she remained with her mother. She was raised on a reserve in northeast Saskatchewan until age 13 when she relocated to Saskatoon. She was 14 when she met her common law husband and 15 when she moved out of the parental home as she was pregnant with her first child. She and her common law husband have had six children with S.C.C., the victim, being their second youngest child. In the PSR the accused had indicated that both her parents had abused alcohol but that she had no exposure to domestic violence nor was poverty an issue.[10]The PSR states that the accused started to consume alcohol at age 12 and that from age 16 to age 18 she reports to consuming alcohol on a daily basis. She was hospitalized for two weeks by age 18 with a liver infection due to excessive abuse of alcohol. She also stated that she commenced using drugs at an early age and that when she was pregnant with the victim she and her husband had been using Ritalin intravenously on a daily basis. As a result, their children had been apprehended by the Ministry of Social Services and placed in the care of the accused’s mother. Upon the birth of the victim, the Ministry of Social Services intervened because the victim had suffered Ritalin withdrawal and as a result the victim was temporarily placed in foster care. The older children were returned to the accused and her common law husband within a few months once the accused and her husband had been accepted into a methadone program. The accused was diagnosed with hepatitis C in 2009. According to the PSR the accused reported no substance abuse since the end of 2009.[11]The PSR indicates the accused completed her grade 8 in 1994 while residing in S[…] Bay, Saskatchewan. In 2003, she attended an adult education program but did not complete the one-year program due to her relocation to Saskatoon. In terms of employment history, the accused has had experience as a waitress during the years 2007 to 2009.[12]The PSR refers to the accused’s criminal justice involvement as a young offender in 1997 and 1998 and as an adult in 1999, 2001 and 2008. The convictions include: obstruct police officer x 2 (1997 and 2001), possession of a forged credit card (1999), impaired driving (2008), fail to appear (1999 x 2; 2001; 2008), fail to comply with recognizance (1999 x 2; 2008), fail to comply with disposition (2001). Sentences for these offences included probation, time served, and fines.[13]In respect to the Gladue factors, the PSR indicates that the accused identifies as both Metis and non-status under Bill C-31. She identifies with the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation band of northeast Saskatchewan. The PSR states that while on the reserve she spent time with her grandparents who would share cultural beliefs and practices concerning traditional Cree ways. The PSR indicates that the accused was not exposed to poverty or any types of abuse other than being a victim of sexual abuse at age 5 and age 8. According to the PSR the accused reports she had not experienced racism during her childhood/adolescent years or as an adult. In respect to residential school experience the PSR reports that the accused is aware that her mother had attended a residential school but that her mother would not share stories of the same other than to disclose that it was a “negative” experience.[14]The PSR indicates that the accused’s overall risk for general reoffending was assessed at being medium with major risk factors of substance abuse, peers and companions, education and self-management.[15]The PSR concluded that although the accused has some issues which create challenges, the probation officer who completed the report was prepared to recommend the accused for an electronic monitoring unit if the court should feel that a community disposition was appropriate.VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS[16]Six victim impact statements were filed by members of the W. family who had cared for the victim after a referral by the Minister of Social Services, when the victim had been apprehended at birth due to having tested positive for opiates. The W. family cared for the victim from July of 2005 until she was returned to the accused on May 30, 2006. The statements confirm that once the victim completed the drug withdrawal, she became a healthy, happy child. The W. family struggles with the concept that six months after they delivered the victim back to her mother’s care, she is dead from neglect and they are tormented by the pain and suffering that she must have endured. It is clear that the members of the W. family are still grieving the victim’s death. Their comments were however appropriate and helpful to the court in gaining a better understanding of the victim and what her loss means to them and to the community at large. They spoke for the victim when no one else did.ANALYSIS(a)The Law[17]In determining an appropriate sentence I am governed by the provisions of ss. 718, 718.01, 718.1, 718.2 and 742.1 of the Criminal Code. These sections provide as follows:718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.718.01 When a court imposes a sentence for an offence that involved the abuse of a person under the age of eighteen years, it shall give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence of such conduct.718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.718.2A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor, or(ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s spouse or common-law partner,(ii.1) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a person under the age of eighteen years,(iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim,(iv) evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal organization, or(v) evidence that the offence was a terrorism offenceshall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;(c) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.742.1 If a person is convicted of an offence, other than a serious personal injury offence as defined in section 752, a terrorism offence or a criminal organization offence prosecuted by way of indictment for which the maximum term of imprisonment is ten years or more or an offence punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, and the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years and is satisfied that the service of the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2, the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the offender’s compliance with the conditions imposed under section 742.3.[18]Guided by the above noted provisions of the Criminal Code, I must determine an appropriate sentence for the accused in respect to the offence to which she has plead guilty. The circumstances of this case are tragic. A small child who was born addicted to opiates as a result of the actions of her mother was nursed back to health and provided loving care by a foster family who returned her to her mother’s care after approximately one year. The photograph of the victim which was taken before her return to her mother’s care and which has been marked as exhibit P-1 shows a smiling happy child. Unfortunately, only six months later this child is dead due to the admitted failure of her mother to take her for the medical care she needed and which had been recommended by a physician. The reason she was not taken for medical treatment was admitted to be that the accused was scared that due to bruises on the victim that she and the other children would be apprehended by Social Services. That may be an explanation for the accused’s failure to take her for medical care but it is no excuse. The victim died from an infection but it was an infection which could have been treated but for the criminal negligence of the accused. The accused may be remorseful but the victim lost her life as a result of the accused’s actions or inaction.[19]Notwithstanding the consideration of the principles set out in ss. 718, 718.1, 718.2 and 742.1, as the offence involved the abuse of a child under the age of 18 years, s. 718.01 mandates that in sentencing the accused I must give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence. Denunciation is the process by which I must inform the public that the accused’s conduct in failing to follow a doctor’s recommendation to obtain medical treatment for her child, which then leads to the child’s death is unlawful conduct which will not be tolerated and for which criminal sanctions can be expected. Deterrence is prevention of similar conduct. Deterrence of such conduct has both a personal and non-personal aspect. Personal deterrence of this accused is not likely to be required since I believe she now realizes the impropriety of her actions. The PSR also confirms that the care of her other four children was appropriate. According to the agreed statement of facts a representative of the Ministry of Social Services indicated that whenever she saw the accused’s children they always appeared very well cared for. Appropriate care of her other children was also confirmed by the pediatrician who examined the other children after the victim’s death. However, deterrence also has a public aspect. Other parents must be deterred from abusing their children in a similar fashion by not taking them to a doctor or to the hospital for fear that the children could be apprehended if they did so. Children are the most vulnerable segment of our society. There must be no doubt in a parent’s mind that a failure to seek medical treatment for their child when treatment is obviously needed and also recommended by a physician may be a crime such that the parent will not put their own needs or fears ahead of the best interests of the child. A strong message must be sent so that this senseless tragedy will not be repeated.[20]As mandated by s. 718.1 the sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the accused. In my opinion, causing the death of your child by criminal negligence constitutes a grave offence. By her guilty plea, the accused has admitted that she was responsible for the victim’s death, that her actions were criminally negligent and in a breach of s. 220(b) of the Criminal Code. There is no minimum sentence set but the maximum sentence referred to in s. 220(b) is imprisonment for life.[21]As is mandated by s. 718.2 I must consider the aggravating or mitigating circumstances. I consider the following to be aggravating circumstances:(1)that in committing the offence, the accused abused the victim who was a child under the age of 18 years;(2)that the accused was the mother of the victim and therefore in a position of trust in respect to her and upon whom the victim relied solely for her care at the time of her death;(3)that the abuse had continued for a significant period of time. In this regard Dr. Belak made his recommendation that the victim be taken to the hospital on November 28, 2006, and yet nothing was done by the accused to seek treatment for the victim until after the victim’s death on December 11, 2006.(4)Crown counsel submitted that a further aggravating factor was that the autopsy showed rib fractures dating from two separate dates which were in the process of healing and that the victim’s body was covered with numerous bruises of different ages. In my opinion I cannot consider this to be an aggravating factor because there was nothing in the agreed statement of facts to indicate that these fractures or bruises were caused by the accused. The onus of proving the cause of the victim’s injuries remains on the Crown and absent proof I cannot consider the fractures or bruises to be an aggravating factor.[22]I consider the following to be mitigating factors:(1)The accused entered a guilty plea.(2)The accused has expressed remorse of the loss of her child, the victim.(3)The accused has a relatively minor criminal record which was quite dated with the exception of an impaired driving charge which was dealt with in 2008.[23]Section 718.2(b) requires that I take into account other similar cases and the sentences that were imposed in them. This is the principle of parity that similar sentences be imposed for similar offences involving similar circumstances. In addition to the cases cited to me by counsel, as hereinbefore set out, I have also considered the cases of R. v. Schoenthal, 2006 SKQB 177 (CanLII), 278 Sask. R. 273, conviction overturned 2007 SKCA 80 (CanLII), 299 Sask. R. 1, and R. v. E.T., 2012 SKQB 169 (CanLII), [2012] S.J. No. 276 (QL). I recognize that in the E.T. case, supra, as the victim did not die, the charge was failing to provide the necessaries of life pursuant to s. 215(2) of the Criminal Code. However, many of the same issues were considered in determining an appropriate sentence in the circumstances of that case.[24]The circumstances and sentences reported in the Saskatchewan cases considered were as follows:(1)R. v. Schoenthal, supra. The accused plead guilty to criminal negligence causing the death of her son, a 22-month-old infant who was shaken so vigorously that severe subdural and retinal haemorrhaging caused cardio respiratory arrest and death. The trial judge imposed a sentence of two and one-half years of imprisonment. The conviction was later overturned by the Court of Appeal and accordingly, the appropriateness of this sentence was not further considered.(2)In the Schoenthal decision, there is reference at para. 34 to an unreported oral judgment in the case of R. v. Sherry Perrault (6 October 1998), Regina Q.B.C. 37/98 (Sask. Q.B.). As reported the circumstances in that case were as follows:... a 29 year old woman without a previous convictionpled guilty to criminal negligence causing the death of a five year old child in her care. In a moment of anger the defendant grabbed this child victim, threw her to the floor and stomped on her. The child developed a large abdominal blood clot, fell ill and died from these injuries some days later. The court imposed a three year sentence of imprisonment in that case.(3)R. v. Pauchay, supra. In this case the offender was a First Nations man aged 25, and the father of two girls aged 3 years and 15 months. As a result of severe intoxication, he allowed the children to be exposed to blizzard-like conditions and both children died from hypothermia caused by exposure. He had an extensive criminal record. Following a plea of guilty to the charge of causing death by criminal negligence contrary to s. 220(b) of the Criminal Code, the accused was sentenced to three years of imprisonment.(4)R. v. Bouvier, supra. The facts of this case were related by counsel for the accused and accepted by counsel for the Crown. The accused in this case was staying in a hotel. She had placed an infant and another child in the bathtub while she stepped out to get ice. Upon her return she was locked out and her keycard was not working. By the time she got the staff and gained access to the room, the infant was face down in the water, not breathing, and subsequently died. While originally charged pursuant to s. 220, she plead guilty to an offence under s. 218 of the Criminal Code (abandoning a child). The court accepted a joint submission for a 12-month conditional sentence order.(5)R. v. E.T., supra. The victim, a two-year-old child was found by the trial judge to have been repeatedly struck about the head and spent considerable time locked in a basement room which was windowless and dark. The accused was 55 years of age and the grandfather of the victim. He had a lengthy criminal record. The accused was found guilty of failing to provide the necessaries of life for a child contrary to s. 215(2) of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years.[25]I have also considered the following cases from other Canadian jurisdictions which I found to be helpful and relevant:(1)R. v. Lam, supra. The accused was found guilty of criminal negligence causing death in respect to a child that had sustained severe blunt trauma to the skull while the accused was babysitting. The trial judge reviewed a number of cases and concluded that sentences arising out of the death of an infant can range anywhere from a suspended sentence to five years in prison. The trial judge did however point out that there was a distinction to be drawn between cases where the death was caused by an intentional unlawful act, and cases where death was caused by a negligent act. The sentence imposed was two years less a day to be served conditionally in the community.(2)R. v. J.K.E., supra. In this case, a 17‑year‑old First Nations woman plead guilty to a charge of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. When attempting to place a two-month‑old child in bed the child slipped through her hands and struck an uncarpeted floor. The accused did not seek medical attention for the child although there was swelling and bruising. A week later the child would not stop crying and the accused slapped the child in the face causing her eyelid to go black. Approximately one week later when the child was crying again, the accused repeatedly shook the child. The child suffered serious physical injuries including skull and collarbone fractures, possible brain damage, retinal haemorrhages and a variety of soft tissue traumas. The accused was sentenced to six months of open custody followed by 18 months of probation. It is important to note however, that the accused was sentenced in youth court and that the judge stated that in crafting a sentence the court was focused principally on the needs of the accused youth.(3)R. v. Patten, supra. The accused pled guilty to criminal negligence causing the death of his two-month-old daughter as a result of a skull fracture when he struck the child’s head against the headboard. The accused pled guilty to criminal negligence causing death. He was sentenced to 28 months imprisonment.(4)R. v. Pashe, supra. This was an appeal from a sentence of two years less a day plus three years probation. The accused had pled guilty to criminal negligence causing death. The accused acknowledged that she had struck a 21-month‑old foster child rendering it unconscious and had shaken the child in an effort to revive it following which the child was rushed to hospital but later died. The trial judge had refused to accept a joint submission regarding a 12-month period of incarceration. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and sentenced the accused to 12 months in jail on the basis that the trial judge did not have cause to reject the joint submission. The appellate court commented on the wide range of sentencing available for the offence of criminal negligence causing death as follows:... Clayton C. Ruby, Sentencing (4th ed. 1994), suggests that the “established range now appears to be from several months to eight years’ imprisonment” depending upon the circumstances. ...[26]Based upon the above noted cases, it appears that when child abuse cases are prosecuted under s. 220(b) of the Criminal Code, that the range of sentence in some jurisdictions can be from a few months conditional sentence up to eight years. In Saskatchewan, there have been only a limited number of cases reported, but of those reported, sentences ranged from a 12‑month conditional sentence to three years. Of the five Saskatchewan cases referenced in para. 24, only the Schoenthal, Perrault and Pauchay decisions involved comparable charges brought pursuant to s. 220(b). The sentence in the Schoenthal case was two and one‑half years and in the Perrault and Pauchay cases the sentence was three years. In my opinion, the circumstances in each of these three cases were more serious than in the current case. In Schoenthal and Perrault the unlawful act was an intentional act of violence which caused the death of the child rather than a case of a criminally negligent omission of care found here. In the Pauchay case there were several aggravating factors not present in this case such as self-induced intoxication while the accused was the sole caregiver of his infant children, a lack of insight into his offending behaviour, and an extensive record of 51 entries which were referred to by the trial judge in his sentencing circle decision, 2009 SKPC 4 (CanLII), 328 Sask. R. 173, at para. 21.[27]The final sentencing principle which must be considered is that mandated by s. 718.2(e) whereby I must consider whether a sanction other than imprisonment is reasonable in the circumstances of this case with particular attention to the circumstances of the accused who is an aboriginal offender. In the PSR the probation officer dealt with these Gladue factors. The PSR confirms that the accused identifies as both Metis and non‑status under Bill C-31. The accused spent her childhood on several reserves as her mother was a teacher and relocated often. The PSR indicated that the accused reports that she had not experienced racism during her childhood/adolescent years or as an adult. However, she did experience family break-up when her parents separated when she was age 2. She reported being a victim of sexual abuse at ages 5 and 8. Although the accused has resided in the City of Saskatoon since the age of 13 years, it was pointed out in the case of R. v. Gladue, supra, at page 695, that would not disentitle her to a sentence that fully embraced the principle of restorative justice.[28]In this case, I am satisfied that the accused’s history is illustrative of some of the systemic factors referred to by the courts in respect to the over-incarceration of aboriginal offenders such as poor economic and social conditions, lack of education, lack of employment opportunities due to lack of education or training as a youth and family dysfunction and breakdown.[29]I must also consider s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code. The offence in this case occurred in 2006 which predates the 2007 amendments to s. 742.1 which now exclude a conditional sentence if the offence is a serious personal injury offence as described in s. 752. The accused would therefore be entitled to a consideration of the lesser punishment that was available at the time of the offence in 2006: R. v. Nusrat, 2009 ONCA 31 (CanLII), 239 C.C.C. (3d) 309. However, although I have taken into account the Gladue factors, in my opinion the severity of this offence, the need for adequate denunciation and deterrence as mandated by s. 718.01, and the precedents set in the Saskatchewan cases referred to, require me to exercise my discretion not to impose a sentence to be served in the community.[30]Ms. C.D.M., please stand. Ms. C.D.M., given all the factors relevant to the offence of which you have been convicted which is criminal negligence causing the death of S.C.C., I impose a sentence of two years less one day to be served in a provincial institution. I waive the requirement of payment of a victim fine surcharge for the reason that I am satisfied that due to your unemployment and financial position undue hardship to you would result if such a payment was ordered.__________________________________ J.N.G.

Doucet, for the appellant.Mary Elizabeth Beaton, for the respondent.The judgment of the Court was delivered by1La Forest J. -- The issue in this case is whether courts of appeal have jurisdiction to review orders made under s. 741.2 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, as part of the \"sentence\" imposed by the trial judge.2The facts are not in dispute.The appellant pleaded guilty in the Provincial Court of New Brunswick before McKee Prov. Ct. J. on one count of forcible confinement, one count of assault, one count of uttering a death threat, one count of theft and two counts of assault with a weapon.He was sentenced in August 1993 to a total of 3 years and 9 months imprisonment.Pursuant to s. 741.2 of the Code, the trial judge ordered that the appellant serve one half of his sentence before being eligible for parole.3Section 741.2 of the Criminal Code provides as follows:741.2Notwithstanding subsection 120(1) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, where an offender is sentenced, after the coming into force of this section, to a term of imprisonment of two years or more on conviction for one or more offences set out in Schedules I and II to that Act that were prosecuted by way of indictment, the court may, if satisfied, having regard to the circumstances of the commission of the offences and the character and circumstances of the offender, that the expression of society's denunciation of the offences or the objective of specific or general deterrence so requires, order that the portion of the sentence that must be served before the offender may be released on full parole is one half of the sentence or ten years, whichever is less.4The appellant applied for leave to appeal against his sentence including the order made pursuant to s. 741.2 of the Code.The Court of Appeal of New Brunswick denied the appellant leave to appeal and gave no reasons.Leave was then granted to this Court.At the conclusion of the hearing in this Court, Lamer C.J. issued judgment allowing the appeal, on the basis that an appeal lies to a provincial court of appeal from an order made under s. 741.2 of the Code.The record was referred back to the Court of Appeal of New Brunswick for reconsideration of the application for leave to appeal.Reasons were to follow.These are the reasons.5I should state at the outset that it is my view that courts of appeal have jurisdiction to review orders made under s. 741.2 of the Code as part of \"sentence\" under ss. 673 and 675(1)(b) of the Code.Before reaching this substantive issue, however, a preliminary jurisdictional matter must be addressed.6The respondent argued that this Court should not hear this appeal since it involves the review of a discretionary decision of a lower court, made without reasons.The lack of reasons is not grounds for barring review, since appeals under the Code are taken not from the reasons of a lower court, but from its order; see R. v. Laba, 1994 CanLII 41 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 965.And it is clear from the decision of this Court in MacDonald v. City of Montreal, 1986 CanLII 65 (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 460, that the Court has jurisdiction to review the discretionary decisions of lower courts, even if, as was emphasized in that case, this is a jurisdiction that should only be exercised sparingly.7It is true, as the respondent pointed out, that we cannot be sure in this case that the New Brunswick Court of Appeal refused the appellant leave to appeal his sentence on the basis of a want of jurisdiction respecting the order made under s. 741.2.Still, in light of other judgments issued by that court, there is reason to believe that leave to appeal may have been refused at least in part on this basis.In both R. v. Watson (1993), 1993 CanLII 5409 (NB CA), 142 N.B.R. (2d) 327, and R. v. Landry (1993), 1993 CanLII 5123 (NB CA), 143 N.B.R. (2d) 183, the Court of Appeal held that it did not have jurisdiction to review orders made under s. 741.2.The question of whether such orders can be reviewed by courts of appeal has provoked some confusion in lower courts across the country, and the case at bar presents us with an appropriate opportunity to resolve the issue, which is clearly an important question of law relating to the sentencing process, and therefore a matter upon which this Court should pronounce; see R. v. Gardiner, 1982 CanLII 30 (SCC), [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368, at p. 397.8The argument respecting the jurisdiction of courts of appeal to review s. 741.2 orders turns on the application of ss. 673-675 of the Code.Section 674 provides that no proceedings other than those set forth in the Code \"shall be taken by way of appeal in proceedings in respect of indictable offences\".Pursuant to s. 675(1)(b), a person convicted of an indictable offence may appeal to the court of appeal \"against the sentence passed by the trial court, with leave of the court of appeal or a judge thereof unless that sentence is one fixed by law\".The difficulty arises in determining what constitutes a \"sentence\" under s. 675(1)(b).Section 673 provides that \"sentence\" in this part of the Code includes a variety of orders, declarations and dispositions provided for under various Code provisions.The list does not mention orders made under s. 741.2.9It should first be observed that s. 673 provides that a sentence \"includes\" the listed orders, not that it is \"defined\" by them, or that it \"means\" only them.A plain reading of the word \"includes\" in this context suggests that the list of reviewable orders under s. 673 is not exhaustive.Moreover, on a common sense understanding of the word \"sentence\" it seems clear that orders made under s. 741.2 should qualify.For these orders clearly affect the length of time that a sentence is served, and are relevant to the disposition of the trial judge following conviction; see R. v. Pawlyk (1991), 1991 CanLII 2713 (MB CA), 72 Man. R. (2d) 1 (C.A.), at p. 6.It seems to me artificial to suggest that a s. 741.2 order is not part of the \"sentence\" imposed on an offender.10The respondent argued that a s. 741.2 order is analogous to a parole order made under the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20.As such, it is simply a judicial, as opposed to a typically administrative, power to determine parole, and is not part of a formal sentence.Since the fitness for eligibility of parole is generally not remediable under the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the respondent submitted, it was unnecessary for a trial judge's decision made under s. 741.2 to be remediable.Parliament has been consistent, this argument runs, in giving the Parole Board exclusive jurisdiction and absolute discretion in relation to the granting of parole under the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, and in not providing a right of appeal under the Criminal Code for a judicial decision regarding parole eligibility orders made under s. 741.2.11My difficulty with this argument is that the s. 741.2 order is not an administrative parole determination, within the exclusive jurisdiction and absolute discretion of the Parole Board, but is instead included in the Code as part of a trial judge's authority.Parliament's decision to place this power in the Code rather than in the Corrections and Conditional Release Act should not be ignored.The inclusion of s. 741.2 of the Code should, in my view, be understood to indicate an intention on the part of Parliament explicitly to allow a trial judge to reduce the discretion of the Parole Board in certain circumstances, by requiring an accused to serve one half of his or her term of imprisonment before being able to seek parole.The point is that under s. 741.2 the determination of conditional release eligibility has now become a factor in sentencing, and not simply a matter exclusively in the hands of the Parole Board.I agree with the following comments of Griffiths J.A. in R. v. Goulet (1995), 1995 CanLII 1198 (ON CA), 22 O.R. (3d) 118 (C.A.), at pp. 122-23:Section 741.2 clearly operates as an exception to the general statutory provision governing parole eligibility [s. 120(1) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, which requires generally that one-third of a sentence be served before an application for parole] and contemplates a further restriction on the offender's liberty beyond that which normally flows from the prison term imposed by the sentencing judge.An order made under s. 741.2 restricting eligibility for parole increases the punishment imposed by the sentence in a very real way.In making an order under s. 741.2 increasing parole ineligibility the sentencing judge is looking into the future and declaring that the offender should not even be considered for parole during some part of what would otherwise be his or her period of parole eligibility.A s. 741.2 order pre-empts the normal role of the Parole Board during the added period of parole ineligibility and replaces the case-by-case exercise of that expert tribunal's discretion with an absolute order made years before the effect of that order is felt.12In making its case, the respondent also relied on the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Vaillancourt (1989), 49 C.C.C. (3d) 544, in which it was concluded that the Court of Appeal did not have jurisdiction to review a jury determination respecting parole made under s. 745 of the Code.That section allows an offender who has served 15 years of a sentence for murder to apply for a jury determination as to whether his or her parole ineligibility period should be reduced below the 25-year statutory minimum.The Court of Appeal held that such a determination could not be said to constitute part of the sentencing process and therefore was not appealable as a \"sentence\" under s. 675(1)(b).In my view this case is distinguishable from the case at bar.The determination of a jury respecting parole 15 years after an offender's conviction is, I agree, difficult to cast as part of the sentence imposed by the trial judge upon conviction.By contrast, an order made under s. 741.2 is clearly part of the punishment meted out by the trial judge; as such, I believe it is appealable under s. 675(1)(b).It should also be noted that parole ineligibility orders made under s. 744 of the Code are listed as part of sentence under s. 673.Section 744 provides that a trial judge at the time of sentencing may increase the parole ineligibility period of an offender convicted of second degree murder.This power is analogous to that granted a trial judge under s. 741.2, and in my view the inclusion of s. 744 orders as part of sentence under s. 673 is indicative of Parliament's desire that other similar orders should also be held to constitute part of sentence.13In concluding that courts of appeal have jurisdiction to review orders under s. 741.2 of the Code, I endorse the view taken by several courts of appeal across the country.The Ontario Court of Appeal has explicitly held that it has the jurisdiction to review s. 741.2 orders as part of a \"sentence\" under the Code; see R. v. Steel, [1993] O.J. No. 2563, and Goulet, supra.The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal also seemed to have been of this view in R. v. Warren (1994), 1994 CanLII 3875 (SK CA), 128 Sask. R. 81, although in that case the Crown conceded the court's jurisdiction.14In British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Quebec and Nova Scotia, courts of appeal have assumed the jurisdiction to hear appeals from s. 741.2 orders without ruling on the issue; see for example R. v. Forsythe (1994), 1994 CanLII 2492 (BC CA), 41 B.C.A.C. 294, R. v. Viscount, [1994] A.J. No. 145, R. v. Boone (1993), 88 Man. R. (2d) 110, R. v. Cory (1993), 88 Man. R. (2d) 183, Dankyi v. R., 1993 CanLII 4283 (QC CA), [1993] R.J.Q. 2767, R. v. Leblanc (1993), 59 Q.A.C. 250, and R. v. Hynes (1993), 1993 CanLII 3221 (NS CA), 123 N.S.R. (2d) 447, application for leave to appeal dismissed, [1994] 1 S.C.R. viii.While ruling on the application of s. 11(i) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to s. 741.2 orders, the Newfoundland Court of Appeal has specifically refrained from deciding the jurisdictional issue; see R. v. Lambert (1994), 1994 CanLII 4531 (NL CA), 123 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 347, application for leave to appeal dismissed, [1995] 1 S.C.R. x.15Only the New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island Courts of Appeal have held that they do not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an order made under s. 741.2 because this order is not a \"sentence\" under s. 673 of the Code, but is instead an order made after sentence; see Watson, supra, and Landry, supra, and R. v. Richards (1994), 1994 CanLII 3380 (PE SCAD), 122 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 89.A number of New Brunswick Court of Appeal decisions made since the present case was decided would appear to suggest, however, that its view that it does not have jurisdiction to review s. 741.2 orders may be restricted solely to situations where an appeal on the merits of the s. 741.2 order alone is proposed.In R. v. Ferris (1994), 1994 CanLII 6523 (NB CA), 153 N.B.R. (2d) 241, and R. v. McIntyre, [1995] N.B.J. No. 178, the Court of Appeal granted leave to decide a s. 11(i) Charter issue relating to the application of s. 741.2, but in doing so, it specifically upheld its earlier decision in Watson that it lacked jurisdiction to review s. 741.2 orders alone on their merits.More recently, in R. v. Canney, [1995] N.B.J. No. 248, the Court of Appeal set aside a s. 741.2 order, but it did so in the context of varying the entire sentence imposed by the trial judge.16With respect, it is my view, for the reasons stated above, that the New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island Courts of Appeal are simply wrong to hold that they do not have jurisdiction to review s. 741.2 orders on their merits.The soundness of the view that courts of appeal should be understood to have the jurisdiction to review s. 741.2 orders is confirmed by a recently proposed amendment to the Criminal Code to this effect.Bill C-45, An Act to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the Criminal Code, the Criminal Records Act, the Prisons and Reformatories Act and the Transfer of Offenders Act, was reported to the House of Commons on March 22, 1995 after being considered by the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs.It specifically provides for a right of appeal in the Criminal Code respecting orders made under s. 741.2.At the time the present case was heard, Bill C-45 had not yet received second reading in the House.It contains the following provisions:70.Section 675 of the Criminal Code is amended by adding the following after subsection (2):(2.1)A person against whom an order under section 741.2 has been made may appeal to the court of appeal against the order.71.Section 676 of the Act is amended by adding the following after subsection (4):(5)The Attorney General or counsel instructed by the Attorney General for the purpose may appeal to the court of appeal against the decision of the court not to make an order under section 741.2.17There is no need for me to review the merits of the s. 741.2 order made by the trial judge in this case, as we have referred the matter back to the Court of Appeal for reconsideration of the application for leave to appeal.I do wish to note, however, that two of the offences of which the appellant was convicted, theft under s. 334(b)(i) of the Code and uttering a threat under s. 264.1(1)(a) of the Code, are not listed as Schedules I and II of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act and thus should not have been included in the s. 741.2 order.Appeal allowed.Solicitor for the appellant:Brian B. Doucet, Sackville.Solicitor for the respondent:The Ministry of the Attorney General, Moncton."}

The learned trial judge, having heard the evidence and seen the witnesses, held that there was no doubt about the identification of the accused and that he was the man who robbed the complainant. We are of the opinion that this finding is well supported by the evidence, and should not be disturbed.[2]We are, however, of the opinion that the sentence of two years and six months in the penitentiary should be reduced. We doubt the advisability in this case of the long term for the purpose of giving the accused the opportunity to learn a trade. The representations made by his counsel have convinced us that he will be aided in rehabilitation by a shorter term. True the charge is a serious one, that of robbery with violence under sec 446 of the Criminal Code, RSC, 1927, ch. 36, but the accused was not armed, both men were intoxicated, and the amount taken was only a few dollars. The accused has a previous record, but so far as we have been informed the offences were all of a minor character.[3]The sentence will be reduced to one year in the common jail at Prince Albert, the sentence to run from the date of conviction."}

(Orally):On Sunday the 23rd of January, 1994 at approximately 1:15 p.m., on a cold January afternoon, an armed robbery was committed at Le Dépanneur Les Amis Convenience Store at Fair Isle, Northumberland County. At around that time a male person arrived at the convenience store on a snowmobile dressed in bulky winter clothing, wearing a full-face protection-type helmet, dark colour, left his snowmobile in front of the convenience store and entered the store. He walked around the store and said[Page 2]something, a comment about the weather, and then motioned the attendant towards the cash, pulled a gun and demanded the cash.The attendant, a young lady of some 24 years of age, Lucie Savoie, and the perpetrator of this crime were the only persons in the convenience store at the time. The convenience store itself is connected to the residence of the owner, a Mr. St-Coeur, and although he and other people were present in the residence, they were not in the immediate vicinity of the store and did not witness the incident.The attendant, Ms. Savoie, turned over, according to her evidence, approximately three hundred dollars in cash. The robber put the money in his pocket and left on the snowmobile, a snowmobile described as a Skidoo model, as he left police were immediately called.As a result of the police investigation the present charge has been laid against Mr. Richard Joseph Morang in which he is charged with that robbery. He is charged that on or about the 23rd day of January, 1994, at or near Fair Isle, Northumberland County, he did steal from Les Amis Convenience Store an amount of money while armed with an offensive weapon or imitation thereof, a revolver, contrary to and in violation of Section 343(d) of the Criminal Code of Canada thereby committing an offence under Section 344 of the Criminal Code as amended.The Crown has presented the evidence of nine witnesses and in addition exhibits have been tendered and received in evidence, including a full-face snowmobile[Page 3]helmet, a revolver or an imitation thereof, a map of the area and two statements given by the accused to a police officer. Defence has introduced into evidence a series of photographs which were used at a photo line-up.I'll briefly just review the evidence of the various witnesses. Lucie Savoie, who I said earlier is somewhere in the range of 24 years of age at the time, was working at that convenience store and she testified that at approximately 1:15 a man arrived by snowmobile, entered the store wearing a snowmobile helmet, a green army jacket down to about knee length and she talked to him briefly. She said that he looked around the store, approached her and motioned toward the cash, pulled a gun with his left hand and demanded the cash, that she screamed, and he said, \"Give me the money and I won't go into the house,\" she then turned over the cash.She described the individual as approximately six feet tall, of medium build, and that the helmet he wore hid a greater part of his face but she could see a mustache. The individual was not wearing glasses. She described the helmet as being dark in colour but she couldn't remember the colour and that he was before her some two to three minutes. She did not remember if there was a visor on the helmet, whether it was down, in any event, if there was, it was not down. She could not see the mouth of the individual and obviously her ability to see the face was significantly impaired by the type of helmet that the individual was wearing. She could only see his upper lip and up to above the eyes, in that vicinity.[Page 4]The revolver or imitation thereof that's introduced into evidence is similar to the revolver that she recalls being used. She said the colour was the same, she noticed it to be a strange colour, a grey colour, she looked at the barrel and she saw the chamber also. Although the gun was used by the robber, she said the individual did not point it directly at her.After the cash was picked up, she saw the individual leave on the Skidoo and saw him head to the road that leads towards the Caissie Road. She saw the word Skidoo on the side of the snowmobile.According to her evidence approximately three hundred dollars was taken, the one hundred and thirty dollar float and about a hundred and seventy dollars proceeds from the sales of the day.Ms. Savoie was questioned by police immediately after when they arrived, after they were called, and later participated in a police line-up of photographs and from the photographs that were presented to her, which are shown in Exhibit D-1, she identified an individual who has the number seven below his picture, a man who has been said to be a Mr. Cochrane, as being the person who committed the robbery. At the time she said she was 99% sure this was the individual who had committed the robbery.The next witness to testify was Germain St-Coeur and he testified that on that particular day, around that time, he was going to go to that convenience store to return a video. He had started his vehicle, was warming up[Page 5]the vehicle when he saw a snowmobile go by. He described it as being a red-type of snowmobile, a Skidoo brand, and there was one person on it. This person was wearing a heavy army-type jacket and a hood over a helmet.After his vehicle warmed up, he, his wife and child drove towards the convenience store and met the snowmobile coming back the opposite direction. He stated the speed of the snowmobile was approximately fifty kilometres per hour, that it wasn't a big snowmobile and that the person was driving the snowmobile on the travelled portion of the highway.Daniel Comeau then testified that he arrived in the vicinity of the convenience store where he lives at somewhere around 1:00 o'clock or thereabouts. He saw the snowmobile as he stopped at the stop sign and he saw it turn into the driveway of the convenience store. He drove into his yard, entered his house, was there he said approximately thirty seconds or so to a minute and he got back in his truck and backed out of his driveway. Again he saw the snowmobile leave the convenience store. He described the individual he saw, a person wearing an army coat, a long army jacket, a full-face helmet, black in colour and the red snowmobile.Mr. Gilbert Benoit testified that at the time he was visiting a friend in Lavillette who lives in the immediate vicinity of a residence owned by Mr. Robert Vienneau and that the Robert Vienneau residence was between where he was visiting and the St-Wilfred road; he was working on a car and he saw a snowmobile coming up heading[Page 6]toward the Bathurst Highway and didn't pay too much attention to it.Mr. George St-Coeur testified that on that afternoon as he was going to the convenience store, driving down the Caissie Road at approximately 1:00 p.m., he saw a person with a black and red snowmobile, more red than black. He said he was about two miles from the store when he saw the snowmobile coming toward him.Then I heard the evidence of Constable Boisvert as to his investigation and his involvement and how he arrived at the convenience store. He got the phone call, the complaint, at approximately 1:15, arrived at the convenience store within minutes, took a statement, saw the tracks of a snowmobile, and proceeded to follow those tracks. He followed them to somewhere in the vicinity of the Robert Vienneau residence where he lost them and couldn't follow them any more, but he didn't see any tracks going into Mr. Vienneau's residence. He says that he lost those tracks some three quarters of a mile from the intersection, there were many tracks in that immediate area afterwards. He also testified as to his involvement in arresting Mr. Morang and taking two statements from him on February 1st and February 2nd. He testified that he attended the Vienneau residence in early February, I believe at 11:00 o'clock in the morning on February 2nd and obtained the revolver that was submitted in evidence here in Court today.Corporal Bordage testified as to his involvement in the investigation and how he took a[Page 7]statement from someone who was at the convenience store and was with Constable Boisvert when he followed the snowmobile tracks. In the course of their investigation that afternoon when they lost the tracks in the vicinity of the Vienneau residence, they attended at the residence of Mr. Vienneau and made inquiries of Mr. Vienneau as to whether he had seen anyone with a snowmobile and informed Mr. Vienneau that there had been an armed robbery at the convenience store and described the suspect. Unbeknown to Corporal Bordage Mr. Morang, the accused, was at the Vienneau residence at the time in another area of the house also one Wayne Duplessie, who was the next witness who testified.Mr. Duplessie stated that he had stolen a snowmobile in Newcastle at approximately 7:00 o'clock that morning. He had been drinking the night before and drove from Newcastle to Lagaceville with the snowmobile to the residence of Mr. Vienneau and obviously with the intent to arrange for resale of the stolen snowmobile. He stated that when he arrived that Mr. Vienneau was there, that he awakened him, and later Mr. Morang came out of one of the bedrooms and that it was evident to him that they had been on a party. He described what transpired and said that eventually during the course of the day Mr. Morang took the snowmobile for a drive and then returned shortly thereafter and that he had some money, there was reference to cashing of a cheque of a sister.Finally Robert Vienneau testified as to his recollection of what transpired that day, that Mr. Morang[Page 8]had been there since Friday, that there had been a lot of drinking and consumption of drugs, that Mr. Morang left the residence on the snowmobile, that he came back and that later on there was money that was counted and that revolver that he acknowledges belongs to him was at the residence and on the table, coffee table, in the living room.He acknowledges that the police officers arrived, mentioned the armed robbery and then acknowledges that Mr. Morang shaved his growth of beard, and later testified as to what transpired in relation to the sale of the snowmobile. It was eventually sold in Allardville, exchanged for 3.5 grams of cocaine and fifty dollars.I had the opportunity to review the two statements that were given by the accused to the investigating officer. The Crown of course has the onus of proof beyond reasonable doubt of all essential elements with respect to the charge in question against the accused. There's no doubt that a robbery was committed at the time and place at Fair Isle. The question to be determined is whether or not the evidence proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was the person who did commit that robbery.We have the evidence of Lucie Savoie who at a photo identification line-up identified some other individual as being the perpetrator of the crime, a person who is not the accused. All of the evidence in its totality insofar as it relates to the accused as being the perpetrator of the crime is of a circumstantial nature.[Page 9]There is no doubt, the evidence is clear and undisputed that Mr. Morang left the residence of Mr. Vienneau sometime during the course of the day on a red snowmobile. There's no question that he came back shortly after with money, there's no question that the money as described by the witnesses, Mr. Vienneau and Mr. Duplessie, was of denominations of a similar type as described by Lucie Savoie, there was no change, there were no bills in denominations over twenty dollars, and there is evidence that the amount of money that was placed on the table after Mr. Morang returned to the residence was an amount of approximately the same as was stated to have been stolen from the convenience store.There is no question that the gun which has been introduced in evidence was at that residence, that it was on or in the vicinity of the coffee table at the time that the money was put out on the table. There's no question that there was a helmet, the one that's introduced in evidence, at the house of Mr. Vienneau and belonged to Mr. Vienneau and I accept that it was worn by Mr. Morang at the time that he left for a ride on the snowmobile. There is no question that the police officers by coincidence or by guess or otherwise stopped at the Vienneau residence to make inquiries of Mr. Vienneau and informed the occupant, Mr. Vienneau, that there was an armed robbery and described the suspect. There is no question that after the police made these inquiries, Mr. Morang decided to shave and did shave and shaved a beard that Mr. Vienneau described as[Page 10]being similar to the beard that the individual is wearing here in Court today.Reference was made to a cheque being cashed that belonged to the sister of Mr. Morang but there's no reasonable evidence to substantiate that before me. When one takes and considers and weighs all of the evidence that's been presented, even though it is circumstantial, and even though a mistake of identity was made by Lucie Savoie, and one can understand an individual making such a mistake, I think the only reasonable conclusion to reach is that the accused is guilty as charged and that all of the essential elements have been proven. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the robbery that was committed. It is my conclusion that he is guilty as charged.COURT:What is the pleasure of counsel with respect to the matter of sentencing.MR. NOEL:I'm not sure when Mr. Fowler is scheduled to be up here, the Crown is available at any time.MR. FOWLER:Sentence him today.COURT:Does the Crown wish to address that matter, today?MR.

Lefebvre, for the CrownRenée E.M. Gregor, for the Accused)))HEARD: October 19, 2016, January 27, May 11 and June 21, 2017By court order made under subsection 486.4(1) of the Criminal Code, information that may identify the person described in this judgment as the complainant may not be published, broadcasted or transmitted in any manner.This judgment complies with this restriction so that it can be published.REASONS FOR SENTENCINGCornell J. (orally):Introduction[1]Mr. Agoston pled guilty to one count of distributing an intimate image without consent.I am now called upon to impose the sentence.[2]In accordance with the reasons that follow, I grant Mr. Agoston a conditional discharge.Background[3]While driving a work vehicle, a co-worker of Mr. Agoston was using Mr. Agoston’s phone. While doing so, the co-worker sent two nude male images to the daughter of a family friend of Mr. Agoston.[4]One such image showed the accused standing nude in front of a mirror. The second image showed a picture of a male in work overalls showing an exposed penis. Mr. Agoston denies that this is a photograph of him.[5]The complainant believed that these pictures had been sent by Mr. Agoston. She responded by sending two pictures. One was a picture of her vagina. The defence submissions indicate that the other picture comprised a full body shot, but the face was covered by the presence of the camera. I note that the facts as read in referred to the shot of the vagina, but provided no details about the other picture. In view of this, all that can be said is that the facts that were read in did not suggest that there were features available on either photograph that would identify the complainant.[6]Mr. Agoston indicates that although he knew that his co-worker was texting the complainant, he denied having any knowledge that such texting included naked photos of himself.[7]When he arrived at his place of work, Mr. Agoston showed the naked images to two co-workers. When this came to the attention of a supervisor, the police were called to investigate. Mr. Agoston asserts that the images were deleted shortly after they were shown to his co-workers.Position of the Parties[8]This is not a case where a joint submission was presented.[9]Upon the original return date, the Crown was seeking a conditional sentence and the defence was seeking a suspended sentence and period of probation. At that time, a pre-sentence report was ordered.[10]Upon the next return date, the pre-sentence report was available. Given the information contained within that report, I indicated to all parties that in my opinion, this was a case where consideration needed to be given to the imposition of a conditional discharge. The matter was adjourned to permit both Crown and defence to consider this suggestion and to provide further written submissions.[11]The Crown now submits that this is an appropriate case to impose a suspended sentence and a twelve-month period of probation. It is the position of the defence that this is an appropriate case for a conditional discharge to be imposed.Sentencing Provisions[12]The fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing are set out in s. 718 of the Criminal Code as follows:718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.[13]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code requires that a sentence be “proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender”.[14]I am also to be guided by the sentencing principles contained in s. 718.2 of the Criminal Code which, among other things, requires me to take into account any aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and to impose a sentence which is similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. By virtue of ss. 718.2(d) and (e), an offender should not be deprived of liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances, and all available sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders.Aggravating Facts[15]This offence is relatively new. It was created in response to concerns about the distribution of intimate images in a public forum. It is beyond question that the distribution of such intimate images carries with it the risk of psychological harm and embarrassment to the victims of such crimes.[16]Furthermore, distribution via the internet can result in the image being forever available.[17]However, this is not such a case. There was no internet distribution. The images were deleted shortly after they were shown to Mr. Agoston’s co-workers.While distributing intimate images is an aggravating factor, the “distribution” in the case before me was extremely limited and therefore falls on the less serious end of the spectrum of this offence.Mitigating FactorsGuilty Plea[18]Mr. Agoston chose to enter a guilty plea, albeit at a rather late stage in the proceedings. By entering such plea, Mr. Agoston spared the complainant from having to testify at his trial and took responsibility for his actions.Criminal Record[19]Mr. Agoston does not have a criminal record.Remorse[20]It is very clear from the information contained in the pre-sentence report and the evidence given by Mr. Agoston at the time of his sentencing hearing that he very much regrets his actions and the harm that it has caused.He is truly remorseful.Planning/Deliberation[21]There was no planning or deliberation on the part of Mr. Agoston to obtain the images in question. Indeed, it is acknowledged that he did not solicit the images.Bail Conditions[22]It is well accepted that time spent under stringent bail conditions must be taken into account as a relevant mitigating circumstance when sentencing: see R. v. Downes, 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA).[23]The terms of Mr. Agoston’s initial recognizance of bail imposed upon him a curfew, precluded him from having a smartphone or computer, and prohibited him from being in the company of or communicating with females under the age of 18 years unless in the presence of his surety.[24]Some months later, the terms of his recognizance of bail were amended to delete the curfew, but still prevented him from having access to the internet via a smartphone or a computer, precluded him from having any paid or unpaid activity that involved being in a position of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 16 years, and prevented him from being in the company or communicating directly or indirectly with females under the age of 18 years unless in the presence of certain individuals.[25]Mr. Agoston was subject to these various terms and conditions for a period of approximately two years. Given Mr. Agoston’s family and employment circumstances, it is my view that Mr. Agoston has been subject to stringent bail conditions. This is a mitigating factor that needs to be taken into consideration in crafting a fit sentence: see R. v. Vincent, 2014 ONSC 1068 (CanLII), at para. 28; R. v. White, 2014 ONSC 2878 (CanLII), at paras. 75 and 104; and R. v. Dass, [2008] O.J. No. 1161 (Sup. Ct.), at paras. 90-98.Victim Impact Statement[26]No victim impact statement was provided.Pre-Sentence Report[27]The pre-sentence report can only be described as very favourable.[28]Apart from this offence, Mr. Agoston has been a law-abiding citizen engaged in a pro-social life. He has a strong work ethic and has been steadily employed. He has no substance abuse or mental health issues.[29]He was involved in what is described as a tragic breakdown of his first marriage.He was called upon to raise two children of that union after the children’s mother abandoned the family. He is now in a supportive common-law relationship with a woman with whom he has had a child, and who has two young children of her own. As a result, Mr. Agoston is currently responsible along with his partner to care for and raise five children.[30]The assessment contained in the pre-sentence report concludes as follows:The subject is a first time offender before the Court who seems to stem from a positive family of origin. The subject is in a stable interpersonal relationship, is gainfully employed and is the sole provider for five dependents. Collaterals have suggested the subject’s criminal behaviour was out of character for him. The subject does not present with any substance abuse or mental health issues.As well the subject does not present with any criminogenic needs at this time.Analysis[31]A conditional discharge is available if the following criteria set out in s. 730(1) of the Criminal Code are met: (1) there is no mandatory minimum; (2) the offence is not punishable by a term of 14 years or life; (3) it is in the best interests of the accused; and (4) it is not contrary to the public interest.[32]The first two criteria have been satisfied in that no minimum sentence is prescribed for this offence and the maximum sentence is five years.I now turn to a consideration of the third and fourth criteria.[33]A useful explanation of the third and fourth criteria can be found in R. v. Elsharawy, 1997 CanLII 14708 (NL CA), at para. 3:For the court to exercise its discretion to grant a discharge under s. 730 of the Criminal Code, the court must consider that that type of disposition is: (i) in the best interests of the accused: and (ii) not contrary to the public interest. The first condition presupposes that the accused is a person of good character, usually without previous conviction or discharge, that he does not require personal deterrence or rehabilitation and that a criminal conviction may have significant adverse repercussions. The second condition involves a consideration of the principle of general deterrence with attention being paid to the gravity of the offence, its incidence in the community, public attitudes towards it and public confidence in the effective enforcement of the criminal law. See R. v. Fallofield (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 450 (B.C.C.A.) and R. v. Waters (1990), 1990 CanLII 7561 (SK QB), 1990 Can LII 7561 (SK QB), 81 Sask. R. 126; 54 C.C.C. (3d) 40 (Q.B.).The Ontario Superior Court of Justice has adopted this interpretation of the “best interests of the accused condition”: see R. v. Burke, 2005 CarswellOnt 1964 (Sup. Ct.) at para. 8, and R. v. Shaw, 2000 CarswellOnt 2948 (Sup. Ct.), at para. 15. This view aligns with what Arnup J.A. previously stated in R. v. Sanchez-Pino, 1973 CanLII 794 (ON CA), [1973] 2 O.R. 314 (C.A.), at p. 320.Best Interests of the Accused[34]I am satisfied that it is in the best interests of the accused to receive a conditional discharge.[35]In this day and computer internet age, the existence of a criminal record has become increasingly problematic for a variety of reasons including ease of availability. A criminal record has the potential to impact employment and travel opportunities. Background checks are now often required for social, athletic and extra-curricular activities, particularly when children may be involved.[36]Mr. Agoston has a family of five children to raise. To preclude Mr. Agoston from travelling with his family, limiting his employment opportunities and his ability to become involved in his children’s activities would not just impose undue and unnecessary hardship, but in the overall scheme of things, be counterproductive.[37]Mr. Agoston is a person of good character. He has no prior criminal convictions. In my view, he does not require personal deterrence or rehabilitation. As I have set out, a criminal conviction would likely have significant adverse repercussions upon him. In view of this, I am satisfied that it is in Mr. Agoston’s best interests that a conditional discharge be imposed.Not Contrary to the Public Interest[38]I understand the Crown to argue that given the nature of this offence, deterrence and denunciation should be among the primary sentencing considerations with the result that a conditional discharge should not be available to this accused.[39]It has long been recognized that deterrence and denunciation can be satisfied without imposing a conviction: see R. v. Fallofield, 1973 B.C.J. NO. 559 (CA.), at para. 21.[40]It has been held that it would be an error to find that a discharge was not available to an offender merely due to the nature of the offence: see R. v. Taylor [1975] O.J. 706 (ONCA).[41]Discharges are not confined to any offence or class of offences, unless expressly excluded by Parliament: see Sanchez-Pino, at p. 320.[42]A suspended sentence is not necessarily a greater deterrent than a conditional discharge: see R. v. Cheung \u0026 Chow (1976), 19 Crim. L.Q. 281 (Ont. C.A.).[43]Discharges are not only reserved for “trivial” matters, they are just as available for offences that bear the stigma of serious criminal misconduct: see R. v. Vicente (1975), 18 Crim. L.Q. 292 (Ont. C.A.).[44]In this case, not only is it not contrary in the public interest to grant a conditional discharge, it is in the public interest to do so.Society has an interest in seeing that Mr. Agoston is employed to his full potential, remains a dedicated and supportive parent and for him to be able to be fully involved in his children’s social, athletic and extra-curricular activities.Conclusion[45]There is nothing before me to suggest that this offence constituted something other than a momentary lapse in judgment by Mr. Agoston.I have every reason to believe that this will be the one and only time when he will be involved in the criminal justice system.Given this belief and taking into account all of the other factors that have been considered, I do not believe that it would serve either Mr. Agoston or society at large to impose upon him a criminal record.[46]I am satisfied that it is in the best interests of Mr. Agoston and that it is not contrary to the public interest that I impose upon him a conditional discharge.I impose a twelve month period of probation on the following terms and conditions:1.Report to a probation officer and thereafter be under the supervision of a probation officer and report at such times and places as may be directed by your probation officer and/or designate;2.Not to associate directly or indirectly or have any contact with the complainant and not to attend her residence or place of employment, education or worship;3.Not to exchange any intimate images via personal data devices such as a smart phone, tablet, computer to any individual and not to save or maintain any intimate images on your computer or personal data devices.The Honourable Mr. Justice R.

Demczur for the Crown)))- and -)))CHRISTOPHER COMPANION)))Mr. D. Lenzin for the Defendant)Defendant))))HEARD:September 26, 2008.REASONS FOR SENTENCINGBOSWELL, J.Introduction:[1]Mr. Companion was charged with three counts of robbery with a firearm, three counts of pointing a loaded firearm, one count of possession of a firearm with ammunition, one count of carrying a concealed weapon and two counts of failure to comply with an outstanding probation order.[2]On September 23, 2008, Mr. Companion entered a guilty plea on one count of robbery with a firearm, one count of carrying a concealed weapon and one count of failure to comply with a probation order, specifically to not possess a firearm.[3]A pre-sentence report was waived and the following are my reasons for the sentence imposed.The Facts:(a)The Circumstances of the Offence:[4]On the morning of July 15, 2005, Mr. Companion and one other individual entered the Kestane Jewellery Store in Markham.After pretending to shop for a few moments, Mr. Companion and his colleague produced handguns that had previously been concealed, proclaimed “this is a robbery” and instructed everyone to get down.[5]Mr. Companion then jumped a display case.Before the robbery could proceed any further, one of the proprietors of the store assaulted Mr. Companion with a baseball bat.After a brief melee, Mr. Companion’s colleague fired a shot into a wall near the ceiling, presumably as a warning shot.Mr. Companion and his colleague then fled.Mr. Companion’s gun, wig, sunglasses and cell phone were left behind at the crime scene.[6]Mr. Companion remained at large for some two years, living under an assumed name.He was ultimately apprehended at a traffic stop, where he gave the police a false name.[7]The gun used in the robbery has been tested and found to be a loaded, operational firearm, though apparently it was so dirty as to make it non-operational.Once cleaned, it was able to fire intermittently.[8]At the time of the offence, Mr. Companion was on probation in relation to another offence.A term of his probation was that he not possess a firearm.(b)The Circumstances of the Offender:[9]Mr. Companion is 33 years old.He has a grade 9 or 10 education.He is a construction worker by trade.[10]Mr. Companion has a common-law spouse and a teenaged child, whom he has supported.[11]He has had a number of convictions, including numerous youthful offences dating back to 1989.The most serious of the previous convictions were in 1997.Firstly, for assault causing bodily harm, for which a sentence of 9 months, together with 36 months probation was imposed. Secondly, for break, enter and theft, for which a sentence of 15 months less 2 days was imposed.[12]Since 1997, there have been some six convictions, all for relatively minor offences, the most significant penalty imposed being the equivalent of four months.[13]Mr. Companion has never served a penitentiary sentence.[14]He as been in pretrial custody for more than twelve months, though two months of that time was in relation to another matter.Counsel are agreed that there have been 10 months and 24 days of time served relative to the matters now before the court, prior to today’s date.(c)The Impact on the Victim[15]I received written victim impact statements from Ms. Hadya Kestane and Mr. John Kestane.I also heard from Mr. Berk Kestane who provided his victim impact statement orally today.[16]Each of the victims was present in the store at the time of the robbery.The impact on the victims is consistent and predictable for this type of offence.The victims are now more fearful and less trusting of others.They have suffered emotional harm and anxiety as a result of the traumatic events of July 15, 2005.They remain fearful and angry some 3 years after the incident.Legal Parameters:[17]Pursuant to s. 344 of the Criminal Code of Canada (the “Code”), a conviction for robbery with a firearm carries with it a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a minimum sentence of four years.[18]Pursuant to s. 90(a) of the Code, a conviction for carrying a concealed weapon carries with it a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment.[19]Pursuant to s. 733.1(1) of the Code, a conviction for breach of a probation order carries with it a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment.Positions of Crown and Defence:[20]The Crown submits that a fit and just sentence, on the facts of this case would be six years for the robbery with a firearm, 18 months concurrent for the breach of probation and one year concurrent for the concealed weapon conviction.[21]The Crown points out the minimum sentence for the offence of robbery with a firearm is four years.Mr. Demczur argues that the minimum sentence should be reserved for those parties with a more enviable conviction history – if not entirely exemplary, then close to it.[22]It is argued that Mr. Companion has a lengthy criminal record dating back twenty years, indicative of a gentleman who has made a conscious decision to engage in a life of crime and to turn his back on the conduct expected of reasonable members of society.[23]In relation to this specific incident, the Crown points out that there is evidence of some measure of sophistication and planning:that Mr. Companion had a wig, sunglasses and a gun.Furthermore, Mr. Demczur argues that the use of the firearms and the shot being fired (even though it was not fired by Mr. Companion) shows a distinct lack of regard for the use of violence.[24]The Crown reminds me that Mr. Companion was on probation at the time of the offences now before the court and that he was expressly forbidden from carrying a firearm.He suggests that a concurrent sentence of 18 months is appropriate for the breach of probation and that a further concurrent sentence of 12 months is appropriate for the concealed weapon conviction.[25]Mr. Lenzin, on Mr. Companion’s behalf, suggests that the minimum sentence of four years is appropriate here.He argues that minimum sentences are not reserved only for those with clean records.All of the circumstances of the offence must be taken into account.[26]He points out that the offence is robbery with a firearm and that the minimum sentence of four years obviously factors in the use of a firearm, meaning that the use of the firearm is not then a further aggravating factor.[27]Mr. Lenzin argues that the agreed facts support the conclusion that this was not a sophisticated robbery.The use of a gun so dirty as to not be in operating condition and the error in getting so close to the store owners as to allow himself to be assaulted are signs that Mr. Companion is not a “professional robber” but an unsophisticated amateur.[28]Most significant in Mr. Lenzin’s submissions was the time he took to review Mr. Companion’s criminal record.He points out that, although the record is lengthy and unenviable, the last sentence of any consequence was a decade ago.[29]He argues that Mr. Companion has had 10 years of being a reasonably productive citizen, during which time Mr. Companion worked, supported himself and supported his child.Relevant Case Law:[30]Counsel provided limited caselaw, agreeing that the sentencing on armed robberies varied significantly from case to case.[31]Mr. Lenzin did provide me with, amongst other cases, the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Wust, 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R.455.The Wust decision stands for the proposition that credits for pre-sentence detention remain available in instances where Parliament has imposed a minimum sentence.Mitigating and Aggravating Factors:[32]Section 718.2 of the Code mandates that the Court consider any relevant mitigating or aggravating factors relating to the offence or the offender that may increase or reduce the sentence to be imposed.(i)Mitigating Factors:[33]I have taken into account the guilty plea entered by Mr. Companion.Though it came late in the day, it is still to be given some weight, in view of the fact that Mr. Lenzin received late disclosure that had a significant impact on the advice provided to his client.The guilty plead ultimately did save the victims from having to testify.(ii)Aggravating Factors:[34]There are several aggravating factors that I have taken into account.I agree with Mr. Lenzin that the use of the firearm is already built in as an aggravating factor in the minimum sentence.I have not placed any significant weight on the fact that the firearm was non-operational due to its dirty condition.I have no evidence to suggest that Mr. Companion knew it was non-operational and I think it very likely that the impact on the victims of the robbery was not lessened by the gun’s dirty condition.[35]The concealment of the weapon and the use of the disguise are also recognized aggravating factors.[36]The most significant aggravating factor is Mr. Companion’s criminal record.I agree with Mr. Lenzin that it is an unenviable record.Mr. Lenzin argued that, as is commonly seen, Mr. Companion’s involvement with the criminal justice system has waned as he has aged.Yet, at the same time, I can not ignore that these most recent charges are the most serious he has apparently faced.[37]I acknowledge that in the last decade the convictions have been spread out and have not involved substantial punishments.That said, the record is such that it has a definite impact on my view of the appropriate sentence in this instance.In view of the record, I do not believe that this is an appropriate case to apply the minimum penalty.At the same time, I would describe the nature of the record over the last decade as only moderately aggravating.Principles of Sentencing:[38]Section 718(1) of the Code establishes the fundamental purpose of sentencing:to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and,(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.[39]Without lessening the importance of the remaining factors enumerated by s. 718(1) of the Code, I consider the principles of denunciation, deterrence (both general and specific) and separation of the offender from society to be of paramount significance in this case.Armed robbery, it goes without saying, is an extremely serious offence.The seriousness is underscored by Parliament’s determination that a minimum sentence of four years should apply to such offences.[40]The serious and growing danger posed by gun crimes in our community was recently discussed at some length by Mr. Justice Binnie in R. v. Clayton and Farmer.[1]There he referred to gun calls engaging the “fundamental issues of public peace and public order” and went on to observe that the public can not be expected to tolerate guns flourished or waved about in public places.”Reasons:[41]This is a serious offence involving the use of a firearm.Parliament mandates a minimum four year sentence.To that I am adding an additional four months, after weighing the aggravating factors referred to above, against the mitigating circumstance of the guilty plea.[42]I have considered the fact that Mr. Companion, though having a lengthy record, has never been the subject of a penitentiary sentence.Nevertheless, the seriousness of the offence and the fact that Mr. Companion has a lengthy history of criminal behaviour, take this case beyond the imposition of the statutory minimum.Apart from the general deterrence that such a statutory minimum is designed to promote, specific deterrence in this case is of substantial concern to me where there is a lengthy record and where there appears, in this instance, to be an escalation in the seriousness of criminal behaviour.[43]I have determined that an appropriate sentence in this instance is as follows:a)52 months less time served on the conviction for robbery with a firearm;b)12 months concurrent on the breach of probation; and,c)12 months concurrent on the conviction for carrying a concealed weapon.Ancillary Orders:[44]The following ancillary Orders are also made:(i)Mr. Companion shall be prohibited for life from possessing any firearm, cross-bow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition, and explosive substance, pursuant to section 109 of the Code;(ii)A weapons forfeiture order under s. 491(1);(iii)A DNA order under s. 487.051(1)(b); and,(iv)A victim fine surcharge in accordance with s. 737(1)and (2).Final Decision:[45]It is agreed that a credit of 21 months and 18 days is to be given for pre-trial detention and accordingly, the Indictment shall be endorsed as follows:On Count One, the sentence shall be 52 months, less 21 months and 18 days, for a net sentence of 30 months and 12 days;On Count Five, the sentence shall be 12 months concurrent; andOn Count Eleven, the sentence shall be 12 months concurrent.Together with all ancillary orders referred to.___________________________Boswell, J.Released:September 26, 2008.[1] [2007]S.C.C.

(for the Court):[1]The appellant appeals the sentences imposed following his guilty pleas to refusal to provide a breath sample on May 13, 2010, breach of recognizance by operating a motor vehicle on December 23, 2010, and impaired driving and flight from police on April 22, 2011. The Crown argued at trial for a global sentence of 3 to 4 years, with a 15 to 20 year driving prohibition. The defence suggested a global sentence in the range of two years. The sentencing judge imposed a global sentence of 34 months in jail, less 126 days of pretrial custody, plus a driving prohibition of 15 years. It appears the appellant is or will soon be eligible for parole, and the Parole Board will undoubtedly take his good progress in Drumheller into account.[2]The appellant argues that the sentence imposed was unduly harsh, that excessive force was used on his arrest, and that there were irregularities in the sentencing hearing.[3]The appellant has a significant record of about 34 convictions, including five convictions for impaired driving, and three convictions for driving while disqualified. His last impaired driving conviction was in 2002, but he had a number of other convictions after that.[4]The appellant argues that he was under difficult personal circumstances at the time of the offences, relating partly to the terminal illness of his wife, and also to his aboriginal background. His lawyer drew all these matters to the attention of the sentencing judge.[5]With respect to the incident on April 22, the appellant at first refused to stop, then pretended he was going to stop, but when the constables approached his vehicle he sped off in a dangerous fashion. After a police chase the accused was arrested, but he was resistant and a struggle resulted. It would appear that any injuries suffered by the appellant occurred during that arrest. The appellant continued to be belligerent and uncooperative.[6]The primary responsibility for sentencing is on the trial judge. It is not the role of the Court of Appeal to second-guess what the trial judge has done, or re-sentence the accused person. In order for this Court to change a sentence, the appellant has to identify an error in principle, or that the sentence is unfit. We are unable to conclude that the sentencing judge overlooked a relevant factor, or over-emphasized anything, or that the sentence is demonstrably unfit. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.Appeal heard on April 17, 2012Memorandum filed at Yellowknife, N.W.T.thisday of April, 2012Slatter J.A.Appearances:M.

(orally)[1]After trial the accused respondents were each convicted of sexual assault and each sentenced to two years less a day with the sentence to be served in the community.The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence and if leave is granted to appeal the sentence on the grounds the sentences failed to reflect the gravity of the offences, the degree of the respondents’ responsibility and also failed to reflect the sentencing principles of denunciation, deterrence, and proportionality.[2]The accused were convicted for what at one time was referred to as a gang rape.The victim was either too drunk to consent to sexual intercourse or passed out and unable to consent.The assaults were witnessed by children who happened to be passing by.After Bear was observed assaulting the victim, the respondents moved her body to another location.Subsequent DNA testing showed Stewart’s semen in her vagina.[3]The trial judge was satisfied a conditional sentence was open to him because an earlier judgment out of the Court of Queens Bench imposed as such a sentence.The trial judge was of the view there would not be any problems in the community because the accused had been in the community since the convictions and he was not aware of any difficulties other than “Stewart having a charge of assault in respect of his wife”. The trial judge believed the fundamental problem was simply one of alcohol.He questioned the pre-sentence reports which indicated a medium – high risk to reoffend for Stewart and a medium risk to reoffend for Bear, because the accused had no prior convictions for a sexual offence and he had no evidence as to how the assessment standard was arrived at.He refused to take into account their prior convictions for assaults because they were not of a sexual nature.[4]We are all of the view that in the circumstances of these cases conditional sentences were not open to the trial judge.As I stated earlier, the offences were, in effect, a gang rape.Such violence usually warrants a penitentiary sentence to reflect the gravity of the offence, the need to denounce such activities and the need to protect the public.This is not to say that a conditional sentence is not open to a judge upon a conviction for sexual assault but in these circumstances the sentences were not fit.[5]We have taken into account the fact the respondents were sentenced August 27, 2000 and have considered their post-sentence behaviour as they described it to us. The respondent Bear, although arguing he has made significant improvement, has not complied with several of the conditions imposed, including community service, alcoholism counselling, and weekly reporting.It seemed obvious to us the respondent Stewart needed treatment. The Crown appeal is therefore allowed and we substitute for the sentence imposed below a sentence of a period of incarceration of two years less a day for each of the respondents."}

Of these, 28,052 were unique images. The rest were duplicates of those. He was also in possession of 3,032 videos which were child pornography. Of these, 1,144 were unique.[3]The images were downloaded from the internet by a file sharing application. Once downloaded, the files were available for sharing with other internet users until they were removed from that application’s folder and stored on another device or on another folder on the computer which was not accessible by the application. On March 8, 2016 the sharable folder on the defendant’s computer contained 75 unique files which were child pornography. On April 18, 2016 it contained 167 unique files.[4]The images and videos showed the most vile and depraved imagery imaginable, of children (mostly girls) ranging in age from 1 to 16 engaged in explicit sexual activity and posing images, the majority of which included penetration (vaginal, anal, and oral, by penises and objects), together with fellatio, cunnilingus, and bestiality.[5]The issue which I must determine is the appropriate sentence for those offences.[6]Defence counsel submits that a one year term of imprisonment on each count would be appropriate, with the two terms to run concurrently, followed by a period of probation of between 18 and 24 months.[7]Crown counsel submits that the appropriate sentence would be 4 ½ years of custody.Part 2: Law relating to sentencing for child pornography(a)Statutory range[8]The Crown having elected to proceed by indictment, the minimum sentence for each offence is one year’s imprisonment. The maximum sentence for making child pornography available (or for transmitting, distributing, selling, advertising, importing, or exporting it, or possession for any of these purposes) is 14 years’ imprisonment. The maximum sentence for possession of child pornography is 10 years.(b)Purposes and principles of sentencing[9]The fundamental purposes of sentencing, as established by s. 718, are to denounce unlawful conduct and the harm done to victims and the community caused by it; deter the offender and others from committing offences; separate offenders from society where necessary; assist in rehabilitating offenders; provide reparations for harm done to victims or the community; and promote a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and the community.[10]The fundamental principle of sentencing is that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. A sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender.(c)Denunciation and deterrence are paramount sentencing objectives[11]Paragraph 718.2(1)(ii.1), enacted in 2005, provides that it is an aggravating circumstance if evidence establishes that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a person under the age of eighteen years.[1] Section 718.01, enacted at the same time,[2] requires me to give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence when imposing a sentence for an offence that involved the abuse of a person under the age of 18 years. While Mr. Inksetter did not himself directly abuse children, there can be no doubt that thousands of children were abused so that the images and videos in this case could be created.[12]The importance of denunciation and deterrence when sentencing for possession of child pornography was recognized by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Nisbet, 2011 ONCA 26 (CanLII) at paragraph 1:Sadly, possession of child pornography facilitated through the internet is on the rise. It is an abhorrent crime that victimizes the most vulnerable members of our society and hence the need for sentences to reflect denunciation and deterrence.[13]The Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal recently explained how a sentencing court should approach a sentence to which s. 718.01 applied. In R. v. Branton, [2013] N.J. No. 408, Hoegg J.A. wrote:24The approaches taken by the Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Alberta courts of appeal[3] to the application of section 718.01 to a case involving the abuse of a person under the age of 18 can be described as requiring a court to give substantial weight to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence when weighing and balancing the objectives of sentencing that best reflect the facts of a case and the circumstances of the offender. I agree with this approach, but hasten to add that this does not mean that either denunciation or deterrence trumps other sentencing objectives. It does mean, however, that there must be a focus on ensuring that denunciation and deterrence are properly vindicated as sentencing objectives in the balancing exercise.25This focus on denunciation and deterrence requires an appreciation of these objectives in the context of the facts of the case being decided, which involves an appreciation of the seriousness of the particular offence and the offender's degree of responsibility. It also involves an appreciation of how and why denunciation and specific and general deterrence are important in the context of the particular case. For example, if the abuse is of a minor nature in circumstances which are unlikely to repeat themselves, the degree of emphasis given to deterrence and denunciation would be less. On the other hand, if the abuse is more serious and the offender has a history of committing such offences, deterrence and denunciation would require greater emphasis. In summary, giving \"primary consideration\" to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence requires a meaningful assessment of how the facts of the offence and the circumstances of the offender relate to denunciation and deterrence and an acknowledgement that substantial weight must be given to these objectives so that they are properly vindicated in the sentencing process.[14]This is the approach implicitly approved of by the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Schan, 2002 CanLII 41613 (ON CA), [2002] O.J. No. 600, in which the Court allowed the offender’s sentence appeal and reduced the sentence for possession of child pornography to 18 months conditional. The Court held that, although the offence required deterrence and denunciation, the sentencing judge had erred by not focusing to a greater extent on the particular circumstances of the case before her. The appellant had downloaded the images from the internet for his own use and did not distribute any of the material. The charges had caused the appellant’s marriage and relationship with his children to end, and he had suffered serious depression and had attempted suicide.(d)Changes in sentencing for child pornography[15]I cite Schan not to suggest that the sentence imposed would be appropriate today, but to explain that giving primary consideration to the principles of denunciation and deterrence does not mean either ignoring the circumstances of the offence and the offender or not considering the other purposes and principles of sentencing.[16]It is clear that a conditional sentence would not be appropriate in this case, even if it were available.[4] As Feldman J.A. wrote in R. v. D.G.F., 2010 ONCA 27 (CanLII):21Over the last two decades, courts have been on a learning curve to understand both the extent and the effects of the creation and dissemination of child pornography over the internet and to address the problem appropriately: see, for example, R. v. Sharpe, 2001 SCC 2 (CanLII), [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45; Kwok. A number of relatively lenient sentences had been imposed in cases where child pornography was downloaded or distributed, there was no sexual abuse or making of child pornography involved, and there were many mitigating circumstances: see for example, R. v. Schan (2002), 2002 CanLII 41613 (ON CA), 155 O.A.C. 273; R. v. Weber (2003), 2003 CanLII 28579 (ON CA), 175 O.A.C. 138; R. v. Kim (2004), 2004 CanLII 32118 (ON CA), 181 O.A.C. 88. However, in cases that involved making child pornography and child sexual abuse, significant custodial sentences were imposed: see, for example, R. v. Jewell; R. v. Gramlick (1995), 1995 CanLII 1897 (ON CA), 100 C.C.C. (3d) 270 (O.C.A.); R. v. R.W., [2001] O.J. No. 2810.22Unfortunately, the incidence of this behaviour appears to be increasing and expanding as technology becomes more sophisticated, encouraging the production of child pornography and greatly facilitating its distribution. The victims are innocent children who become props in a perverted show, played out for an ever-wider audience not only of voyeurs but of perpetrators.[17]Prior to November 1, 2005, there was no minimum sentence for either possession of or making available child pornography. On that date, the Criminal Code was amended to provide for a minimum sentence of 45 days (with the maximum of 5 years remaining the same) for possession of child pornography where proceedings were by indictment. The same amending statute established a minimum sentence of one year for making child pornography available (with the maximum of 10 years remaining the same) where proceedings were by indictment.[5][18]In 2012, the Code was amended to increase the minimum sentence for possession of child pornography to 6 months (with the maximum of 5 years remaining the same) where the proceedings were by indictment.[6] The sentence for making child pornography available where the proceedings were by indictment was not changed.[19]In 2015, the Code was amended yet again to increase the minimum sentence for possession of child pornography to 1 year from 6 months and the maximum sentence to 10 years from 5 years where the proceedings were by indictment, and to increase the maximum sentence for making child pornography available to 14 years from 10 years where proceedings were by indictment, leaving the minimum sentence at 1 year.[7][20]As Arbour J. noted at paragraph 75 of R. v. Morrissey, 2000 SCC 39 (CanLII), [2000] 2 S.C.R. 90, mandatory minimum sentences must be read consistently with the general principles of sentencing and, in particular, the principle of proportionality – that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. Consequently, when Parliament enacts a minimum sentence, the effect is that it acts as an inflationary floor, raising the range. This is particularly true, in my view, where the low point of the pre-amendment range was lower than the new mandatory minimum.(e)Sentencing ranges for these offences[21]The principle of parity – that, as s. 718.2(b) states, “a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances” – requires me to consider sentences imposed by courts for this and similar offences in other cases. In conducting this analysis, however, it must be remembered that, as the Supreme Court of Canada held in R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII) at paragraph 60, sentencing ranges are primarily guidelines, and not hard and fast rules. Wagner J. wrote at paragraph 58 of that case, on behalf of the majority of the Court:There will always be situations that call for a sentence outside a particular range: although ensuring parity in sentencing is in itself a desirable objective, the fact that each crime is committed in unique circumstances by an offender with a unique profile cannot be disregarded. The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a highly individualized exercise that goes beyond a purely mathematical calculation. It involves a variety of factors that are difficult to define with precision. This is why it may happen that a sentence that, on its face, falls outside a particular range, and that may never have been imposed in the past for a similar crime, is not demonstrably unfit.[22]Determining the appropriate range requires primary consideration to be given to decisions of the Court of Appeal.[23]D.G.F., cited above at paragraph 15, is a 2010 case which included not only possession of child pornography, but also distributing child pornography, 3 counts of making child pornography using the offender’s 4 year old daughter, and 2 counts of sexual assaults on that daughter. The offender transmitted a live feed to an internet pedophile chat room of him sexually assaulting his daughter together with other images of his daughter’s genitals and rectum and him sexually assaulting her. He possessed 3,454 child pornography images and 58 child pornography videos, some of which included bondage and explicit sexual activity. The offender was 35 years old and had no criminal record. He expressed profound remorse, regret, and shame. There was no psychiatric or psychological assessment. He pled guilty. The sentencing judge imposed a 4 year sentence. The Court of Appeal held that the sentence was manifestly unfit and sentenced the offender to 7 years’ imprisonment, the term sought by the Crown at the original sentencing. But for the original Crown submission, upon which the offender relied in making his guilty plea, the Court of Appeal would have imposed a higher sentence.[24]Justice Feldman, writing for the Court in D.G.F., referred to R. v. Kwok, 2007 CanLII 2942 (ON SC), [2007] O.J. No. 457, in which Justice Molloy of the Superior Court had imposed a sentence of one year’s imprisonment followed by 3 years of probation. Mr. Kwok had changed his plea to guilty mid-trial after some particularly damning evidence had been heard. He had over 2000 images and 60 videos of children being sexually violated. Many were graphic depictions of actual rape by an adult male of a small child, and of children – including little babies - under the age of five. He went on internet chatrooms frequented by pedophiles and distributors of child pornography. He made his computer and the child pornography it contained freely available to his multiple roommates. He was a 29 year old first offender. He had lost his job as a result of the charges. Other than the offence before the court, Mr. Kwok had been a person of good character. He had been accessing child pornography since he was 14 years old. Justice Molloy was not satisfied that he had any real insight about the nature of his attraction to child pornography or that he was genuinely remorseful. Although he had sought psychiatric treatment, she found that it was not directed towards his problems with child pornography. Justice Molloy sentenced Mr. Kwok to 12 months imprisonment followed by 3 years’ probation.[25]Feldman J.A. noted at paragraph 28 of D.G.F. that the circumstances in Kwok “were not at all similar” to those in D.G.F. She did not suggest that the range of 6 to 18 months identified by Justice Molloy in that case was inappropriate. Nor was Kwok on the list of 3 cases identified by Justice Feldman at paragraph 21 of D.G.F. in which “relatively lenient” sentences had been imposed. In those three cases, decided in 2002, 2003, and 2004, the Court of Appeal had upheld conditional sentences.[26]In R. v. Nisbet, 2011 ONCA 26 (CanLII), the year after D.G.F.was decided, the Court of Appeal dismissed a defence appeal against a 6 month sentence for possession of child pornography involving 28 images and 43 videos showing children aged between 4 and 14 years old involved in various sex acts with other children and with adult males, including masturbation, fellatio, and both anal and vaginal intercourse. The sentencing judge had held that the most important sentencing consideration was general deterrence. The Court, composed of Feldman, Moldaver, and MacFarland JJ.A., held that the sentencing judge had committed no error in principle and that the sentence imposed was not inappropriate. It stated, in a brief oral judgment:Sadly, possession of child pornography facilitated through the internet is on the rise. It is an abhorrent crime that victimizes the most vulnerable members of our society and hence the need for sentences to reflect denunciation and deterrence.[27]In R. v. Saliba, 2013 ONCA 660 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal dismissed a defence appeal from the trial judge’s imposition of a 2 ½ year sentence for possession of child pornography, to be served consecutively to a 2 year sentence for sexual activity with a girl under 16. The Court held that both convictions merited “significant” jail terms, consecutive sentences were appropriate, and the totality of the two sentences was within the range.[28]In R. v. Tweedle, 2016 ONCA 983 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal dismissed a defence appeal from a sentence of 20 months for convictions for possession of child pornography and making child pornography available.His computers and equipment held 29 videos and 431 images of child pornography, as well as chat logs in which someone using the offender’s name discussed his strong interest in child pornography and abusing children. The Court held that the 20 month sentence was “well within the appropriate range, took into account the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, and was not demonstrably unfit.”[29]In R. v. Carlos, 2016 ONCA 920 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal dismissed the offender’s appeal from a sentence of 3 years for possession of child pornography and making child pornography available. He was convicted after trial. He was in possession of 50 videos of child pornography. The police downloaded a number of videos from his IP address through a file-sharing program. He had conducted hundreds of searches for child pornography on an almost daily basis over a 5 month period. He had not been compliant with the house arrest which had been imposed as a condition of bail. He had no criminal record and had been steadily employed. A psychiatrist concluded that he was at very low to low risk for re-offending. He was likely to be deported following his sentence.[8]The Court of Appeal found that the sentence was within the range, and that “there is no basis to interfere with her decision on this issue to which considerable deference is owed.”[30]Decisions from trial courts in this province show a wide range. I will refer to only some examples.[31]In R. v. Lysenchuk, 2016 ONSC 1009 (CanLII), Shaw R.S.J. imposed a 9 month sentence, to be followed by 3 years’ probation, for possession of child pornography. The offender had 5,920 photographs and 588 videos involving pre-pubescent and early pubescent children. Mr. Lysenchuk was 65 years old, with no criminal record. He had been employed with the same company for 38 years and had no alcohol, drug or mental illness issues. He had been assessed as at low risk to offend in a sexual manner involving contact with or direct visualization of children and a low to moderate risk to re-offend in the sphere of pornography. He had expressed remorse, was embarrassed and remorseful, had shown insight into his conduct, and had stated his willingness to participate in sexological treatment.[32]In R. v. John, 2017 ONSC 810 (CanLII), Woolcombe J. imposed a sentence after trial of 10 months imprisonment (less credit for house arrest on bail) and 2 years’ probation on two counts of possession of child pornography. The offender had 89 videos and 50 unique images that were child pornography. They showed girls aged from 4 to 10 being penetrated anally or vaginally by an adult penis or sex toy, together with oral sex with girls as young as 2 or 3. The offender was a 31 year old first offender with a spotty employment record who had been suffering from and been treated for depression for the past six years. He had received some psychotherapy, but had not been assessed by a psychiatrist or psychologist, and there was no evidence of his likelihood of re-offending. Nor was there evidence as to his insight, if any, as to his offence.[33]In R. v. Johnson, an unreported decision of this court on Nov. 18, 2015, Webber J. sentenced the offender to 12 months in custody after a plea of guilty to one count of possession of child pornography. 622 images and 20 movies of child pornography were found on his computer. They showed sexual activities, including fellatio, bondage, anal and vaginal intercourse, forced sex,group sex, and explicit violence, with boys and girls as young as 3 and 4 years of age. The offender was 53 years old, and lost his job as a result of the charge. He voluntarily submitted to the sexual behaviours assessment at the Royal Ottawa Hospital, and was diagnosed as a pedohebephile in partial remission. He voluntarily attended and took part in treatment, to which he had responded quite well. He was deeply remorseful and accepted full responsibility for his conduct. He had supportive family and friends and had had candid discussions with his wife, children and others about his conduct. Justice Webber noted that the appropriate sentencing range was between 9 months and 4 years.[34]Three cases, R. v. Dumais, 2011 ONSC 276 (CanLII), R. v. Dean, [2010] O.J. No. 5305, and R. v. Lynch-Staunton, 2012 ONSC 218, all decided by Ratushny J. of the Superior Court, are illustrative of the range of appropriate sentences for these offences.[35]In Dumais, Justice Ratushny sentenced the offender to 9 months of incarceration and 1 year of probation after he had pled guilty to possessing child pornography. He had 170 images and 44 movies of child pornography, depicting fellatio, penetration and voyeurism of intimate parts of young female bodies. The minimum sentence in 2009, the date of the offences, was 45 days imprisonment and the maximum sentence was 5 years. Mr. Dumais was 39 years old, with no prior criminal record, no history of suffering any kind of abuse, no problems with anger, drugs, alcohol,significant medical illnesses or sexual dysfunctions. He had been a respected elementary school teacher for 8 years. He claimed that he had downloaded the materials out of curiosity, did not want to hurt children, and had never wanted to engage in sexual relations with a child. He was attending the Sexual Behaviours Unit at the Royal Ottawa Hospital and a psychiatric assessment, together with test results, showed that he was primarily aroused by adult women in consensual sexual scenarios. A psychiatrist placed him in a “low risk” category to re-offend.[36]Justice Ratushny noted the significant mitigating factors in this case, including a guilty plea at the first reasonable opportunity, no prior record, support of family and friends, compliance with strict bail conditions for 21 months, voluntary attendance for the sexual behaviours assessment, compliance with the psychiatrist’s recommendations, attendance at ongoing therapy sessions, expression of sincere remorse, and acceptance of full responsibility for what he had done. She found that punishment, specific deterrence and rehabilitation had already been accomplished and did not require any more incarceration of Mr. Dumais. However, denunciation and general deterrence are paramount considerations and the enormity of the crime required more punitive consequences so as to denounce and deter others.[37]In Dean, decided 3 months before Dumais¸ Justice Ratushny sentenced the offender to 3 years (less pre-sentence custody) after he pled guilty to possession of child pornography. His computer contained 1,061 videos and 288,742 pictures (of which 30,764 were unique images), depicting a wide range of sexual depravity, including children between the ages of 2 and young teens, and depicting sexual activity between children and other children, adults, foreign objects and animals. Mr. Dean explained his possession of child pornography as research for a study on child abuse. He denied obtaining gratification from viewing the images. He refused to admit culpability. Justice Ratushny found that he had a complete lack of appreciation of why possession of child pornography is a serious criminal offence. As she put it, “He should be horrified that he has participated in the continued sexual abuse of children. Instead, he persists in his “self deceptive enhancement””.[38]She noted mitigating factors of a guilty plea, his otherwise good character and apparently law-abiding life, and a low risk of re-offending. The huge volume of the collection, his “curious” explanation for it (which she found had scant credibility) and his complete lack of insight and remorse were, however, aggravating factors which placed him outside the upper limit of the normal 6 to 18 month range of sentences.[39]In Lynch-Staunton, decided 1 year after Dumais, Justice Ratushny sentenced the offender to 5 years (less pre-sentence custody) after he had pled guilty to both possession and distribution of child pornography. She allocated 3 years for distribution and 2 years consecutive for possession.[40]The offender had engaged in online conversations and emails with an undercover police officer which had begun in a “family sex chat room” on the internet and progressed to emails at home and work. The offender distributed images and written materials which were child pornography, pictures of his penis, and stories of sex with adults and children, including incest, to the officer. He had 17 different devices on which was stored 2,097 pictures, 1,763 stories, and 574 movies, all of which were child pornography. All his pornography was organized into folder and file structures. These included separate “youth” folders which contained child pornography created and added to on different dates. His computers showed a long history of him accessing and referring to child pornography between 1998 and 20007 He was a very frequent user of internet newsgroups, forums, chatrooms, and family sex channels. He had chatted with over 700 different users in one forum. He sent others pictures of child pornography with the note that he had acquired them from “years of looking on news groups”. In another message, he said that he was interested in having sex with daughters of some nudist friends aged 12 to 13. He had advocated and counselled incest and all kinds of sexual acts with children, including bestiality.[41]The offender was 56 years old, with no prior criminal record. He had a good employment record, having worked for 12 years as a software programmer. He said that the material on his computer “wasn’t pornography, it was erotic nudity”. He described his online activity as simply an expression of his sexuality. He said he had engaged in online sex chats for years as part of a “study” of the reaction of early pubescent females to images and scenarios on the internet. He showed no remorse or regret for the victimization of the children in the material he had downloaded, saying “I’m a nudist. I download pictures.” He saw himself as a victim. He refused to go through phallometric testing, saying that he had recently become more involved with his faith and being exposed to pornography would be contrary to the dictates of his church. Dr. Gray, of the Royal Ottawa Hospital Sexual Behaviours Clinic, did not find his expressed motivation and versions of events to be credible. He noted a progression of behaviour from more indirect contact with under-aged females to more and more direct involvement. He also noted that in many of the internet chats he had had with teens as young as 13 he appeared to counsel them to engage in sexual acts and sent some of them illegal pornographic material. Dr. Gray found the offender to be in either the lowest or second lowest of five risk categories for sexual re-offence with a potential for improvement with treatment.[42]Justice Ratushny noted aggravating circumstances of the gravity of the offences; the offender’s lack of insight into the harm he has caused; the possibility that he was an untreated pedophile; the focus on younger children in the pornography; the acts of violence of full intercourse and penetration; depiction of babies, very young children and incest; his dissemination of child pornography; his encouragement of illegal acts; and his extensive participation in chatrooms and encouragement of child pornography. She did not believe his explanations for declining phallometric testing around his motivation for gathering the pornography. The only mitigating circumstances she noted were the plea of guilty, although entered the day before the scheduled trial, and his absence of a criminal record.[43]Justice Ratushny held that the normal sentencing range for possession of child pornography was between 9 months and 4 years of incarceration. I note that this was an increase from what she had held in Dean, decided 15 months earlier, of a range of 6 months to 18 months.[44]This increase in sentencing range is consistent with the Court of Appeal’s indication in D.G.F.in 2010 that the courts have been on a “learning curve” with respect to these offences. The increase in the range is also a reflection of the increase in the minimum sentence established by Parliament.[45]I conclude that the range of sentences for these offences, particularly after the 2015 amendments which increased the minimum penalty for possession from 6 months to a year, is 1 year to 4 years. This, of course, is subject to the caveats about ranges which I have already dealt with.(f)Aggravating and mitigating circumstances[46]The exact sentence, of course, is dependent on the circumstances of the offence and the offender. That requires a consideration of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances present in this case. Justice Molloy of the Superior Court set out a thorough list of such circumstances in R. v. Kwok, 2007 CanLII 2942 (ON SC), [2007] O.J. No. 457 at paragraph 7. She wrote:Generally speaking, any of the following are considered to be aggravating factors: (i) a criminal record for similar or related offences; (ii) whether there was also production or distribution of the pornography; (iii) the size of the pornography collection; (iv) the nature of the collection (including the age of the children involved and the relative depravity and violence depicted); (v) the extent to which the offender is seen as a danger to children (including whether he is a diagnosed pedophile who has acted on his impulses in the past by assaulting children); and (vi) whether the offender has purchased child pornography thereby contributing to the sexual victimization of children for profit as opposed to merely collecting it by free downloads from the Internet. Generally recognized mitigating factors include: (i) the youthful age of the offender; (ii) the otherwise good character of the offender; (iii) the extent to which the offender has shown insight into his problem; (iv) whether he has demonstrated genuine remorse; (v) whether the offender is willing to submit to treatment and counseling or has already undertaken such treatment; (vi) the existence of a guilty plea; and (vii) the extent to which the offender has already suffered for his crime (for example, in his family, career or community).Part 3: Circumstances of the offence[47]The images which Mr. Inksetter had in his computer system were of the worst kind of child pornography. They showed children in the most vile circumstances imaginable – bondage, oral sex, bestiality, fellatio, cunnilingus, and anal and vaginal penetration with penises and objects. The children involved were as young as 1 year old. I was shown 5 images and 5 videos. No purpose would be served by describing them here other than to say that they illustrated the terrible depths of depravity to which humans can descend.[48]It must be remembered that while these are images, they are of real persons, children who will be scarred forever by what they were forced to endure to produce this filth. As McLachlan C.J. wrote at paragraph 92 of R. v. Sharpe:The link between the production of child pornography and harm to children is very strong. The abuse is broad in extent and devastating in impact. The child is traumatized by being used as a sexual object in the course of making the pornography. The child may be sexually abused and degraded. The trauma and violation of dignity may stay with the child as long as he or she lives. Not infrequently, it initiates a downward spiral into the sex trade. Even when it does not, the child must live in the years that follow with the knowledge that the degrading photo or film may still exist, and may at any moment be being watched and enjoyed by someone.[49]The size of the collection is material. While not the largest collection in the case law – there were more than twice as many images in Dean – its sheer volume (133,000 images and 3,000 videos), and the number of children who were abused to produce the images in the collection, put this offence among the most serious for circumstances of the offence of possession of child pornography.[50]The collection was very well organized, with the images and videos stored in hundreds of folders, all named in a way which was consistent with the contents. This shows that Mr. Inksetter dealt with, and was aware of, the contents and images.[51]Mr. Inksetter told Dr. Gray that in the last year he was much less careful about his internet activity and did not care if he was caught. He left applications on that would continuously download videos or images while he was out of town. He said he was only interested in viewing pornography of any sort when under the influence of marijuana, and was spending about $1,000 a month to buy marijuana.[52]He denied contacting other people on the internet for the purpose of sharing illegal videos with them. He denied ever trying to contact an underaged person over the internet. He denied any sexual contact with an underaged person in his life. The Crown did not attempt to disprove any of these things.[53]While the material he downloaded was available to other persons so long as it remained in the shared folder on his computer, he did not take any steps to actively distribute it.Part 4: Circumstances of the offender[54]Mr. Inksetter has a degree in Information Technology from Lakehead University. He has worked for the Canada Revenue Agency in the IT field since 2002.[55]He has no criminal record.[56]Mr. Inksetter is 51 years old. He never married. He told Dr. Jonathan Gray, the psychiatrist at the Sexual Disorders Clinic at the Royal Ottawa Hospital who carried out his sexual behaviours assessment, that he began to look at pornography as a result of the breakdown and emotional turmoil in his relationship with a woman with whom he was involved beginning in 1992. At the time, he was 27 years old. They moved in together in Ottawa shortly after the relationship began. Soon after, his girlfriend’s mental health deteriorated. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Their sexual relationship came to an end. She became homeless. He remained emotionally attached to her and, over the years, came to her aid on a number of occasions as she lived in the street, became pregnant on three occasions, and had to be admitted to hospital at least once.[57]In approximately 2000, while he was trying to help his estranged girlfriend, he started using pornography regularly, always in conjunction with marijuana, as an escape. He found that this caused him to feel “emotionally dead”. He initially focussed mainly on adult pornography but he started to become bored with these images and he strayed to view other images that would make him feel “horrified”. Over time, especially in the last two years, he started to look at child pornography out of curiosity. He also started looking at images which involved torture and beheadings. He said that he did so to develop a “morbid detachment” from reality, and that watching them made him feel “worse. I was punishing myself.” He said that he was aware that they were depicting actual abuse or violence, but that he felt emotionally deadened with the marijuana.[58]I was given letters from Mr. Inksetter’s parents, sisters, friends, and present partner. It is clear from those letters that Mr. Inksetter has told all in his circle the circumstances of his offence. The letters speak of Mr. Inksetter’s empathy, intelligence, and willingness to help others. They also speak of his clear remorse for what he has done and the efforts he is making to deal with it. I conclude that he has a very supportive network of family and friends.[59]Shortly after these charges were laid, Mr. Inksetter started seeing Dr. Drew Kingston, who is the Senior Psychologist and Director of Groups and Program Evaluation at the St. Lawrence Valley Correctional and Treatment Centre, Integrated Forensic Program, Royal Ottawa Health Care Group. He has particular expertise in the area of atypical sexual interests and behaviour. I received two reports from Dr. Kingston.[60]In his first report, dated October 27, 2016, he noted that Mr. Inksetter had seen him 20 times. He was remorseful about his past behaviour and extremely motivated to continue with counselling. He noted that Mr. Inksetter had demonstrated improved insight regarding his risk factors which precipitated his behaviour.[61]Dr. Kingston told Dr. Gray that, in his opinion, Mr. Inksetter’s primary motivation to collect and view the child pornography appeared to be “numbing out reality” as a dysfunctional coping mechanism for his feelings of lack of control over his ex-girlfriend’s symptoms.[62]In his second report, dated June 29, 2017, Dr. Kingston noted that Mr. Inksetter had seen him 41 times. He continued to be remorseful about his past behaviour and extremely motivated to continue with counselling. He had shown considerable improvement in his skills in addressing his specific risk factors in a more appropriate manner. He wrote:Although I have targeted a number of treatment needs, Mr. Inksetter demonstrated considerable deficits in his ability to emotionally self-regulate in an appropriate and healthy manner. Indeed, this is one of the key etiological paths toward problematic internet use. Mr. Inksetter is now better able to monitor fluctuations in his mood and he has developed more effective coping strategies in regulating his affective states.[63]Dr. Kingston shares Dr. Gray’s opinion, which I will set out in more detail shortly, that Mr. Inksetter presents a very low risk to commit a future violent offence, contact sexual offence, or child pornography offence. He concluded that treatment was unlikely to reduce his risk any further, but counselling could benefit his skills with respect to emotion regulation and effective coping with stress.[64]Dr. Gray conducted the sexual behaviours assessment under s. 21 of the Mental Health Act, to which Mr. Inksetter consented.He conducted a battery of tests, including questionnaires and interviews. Among those tests was one designed to measure the degree to which he may not have been honest in his responses to questionnaires. That test suggested that Mr. Inksetter was not consciously trying to portray himself in an over-positive light to test administrators and his responses could be taken as an accurate reflection of reality. Phallometric testing produced no positive evidence of his experiencing sexual arousal in response to situations involving prepubescent males or females.[65]Dr. Gray concluded that “despite the presence of a large collection of child pornography in his possession, in my opinion a diagnosis of pedophilic disorder is unlikely for Mr. Inksetter.” He also concluded that Mr. Inksetter’s explanation for his behaviour – that by exposing himself to horrific material while emotionally deadened by the effects of heavy use of cannabis he was able to socially disengage – “has an air of reality”.[66]Dr. Gray did not recommend that Mr. Inksetter continue to be followed at the Sexual Disorders Clinic. He did, however, recommend that he continue treatment with Dr. Kingston after any period of incarceration. He wrote:As explained above, it is my opinion that Mr. Inksetter’s offences were not motivated out of a paraphilia, but rather a maladaptive coping mechanism to ongoing stressors. Therapy with a psychologist in the community could help Mr. Inksetter develop more functional ways of dealing with his emotional problems and I would recommend that he be required to see a counsellor on release from incarceration.[67]I asked Mr. Inksetter whether he wished to say anything during the sentencing hearing. He told the court that he took full responsibility for his actions; that there was no excuse for his behaviour and he was deeply shamed by it; and that he wanted to apologize to the victims of the abuse which he had seen and who are re-victimized by the proliferation of the images over the internet. He said that he had been working with the psychologist for over a year now and wanted to continue this to better manage his mental state. He recognized the necessity to have better contact with his family.[68]I was told by defence counsel, and accept, that it is likely that Mr. Inksetter will lose his job as a result of these charges and this sentence.Part 5: Analysis[69]In considering the list of aggravating and mitigating circumstances set out by Justice Molloy in Kwok, I note that: Mr. Inksetter did not have a criminal record; although he has been convicted of making child pornography available (which is an aggravating factor in the total sentence) he was not involved in producing or actively distributing the material (or discussing child pornography and related subjects on chat rooms or by other means on the internet); the collection was extremely large (and organized, indicating that it was carefully reviewed by the offender); the contents of the collection were at the extreme end of the spectrum, including the most vile acts imaginable with children as young as infants; he is not seen as a danger to children and has not assaulted children in the past; and he did not purchase child pornography (although there is no doubt that downloading “free” images from the internet contributes to the sexual victimization of children by adding to the demand).[70]It is also an aggravating factor, as I have made clear, that these crimes involved the abuse of thousands of children, whose lives have undoubtedly been ruined by the depravity forced upon them.[71]Mr. Inksetter has been of otherwise good character; he has shown insight into his crime; he has demonstrated what I find to be genuine remorse, not only to the court but to his psychologist; he has submitted to treatment for over a year and wishes to continue the treatment; he pled guilty at the first reasonable opportunity; and he will in all likelihood suffer for his crime by losing his job.[72]Mr. Inksetter’s case can be usefully compared to the trilogy of decisions of Justice Ratushny in Dean, Dumais, and Lynch-Staunton. Justice Ratushny sentenced Mr. Dean to 3 years in 2010, Mr. Dumais to 9 months in 2011, and Mr. Lynch-Staunton to 5 years in 2012. While Mr. Inksetter’s collection was extremely large like Mr. Dean’s, Mr. Dean showed a complete lack of remorse and insight into his offence. Mr. Dumais, like Mr. Inksetter, showed real remorse and insight, voluntarily attended assessment and therapy sessions, and accepted full responsibility for what he had done. Furthermore, unlike Mr. Lynch-Staunton, who Justice Ratushny sentenced to 2 years for possession and 3 years for distribution, Mr. Inksetter has not been a user of internet newsgroups, forums and chatrooms and has not advocated or counselled incest and vile sexual activities with children.[73]I conclude that Mr. Inksetter’s situation is more like that of Mr. Dumais than eitherMr. Dean or Mr. Lynch-Staunton. I find that, as like Mr. Dean’s situation, specific deterrence and rehabilitation have already been accomplished to a significant extent. Like Mr. Dean’s case, however, denunciation and general deterrence are paramount considerations and the enormity of the crime requires more punitive consequences so as to denounce and deter others.[74]Mr. Dean received a sentence of 9 months in custody. Since then, the minimum punishment for possession has been increased twice by Parliament and the appropriate range of sentence for these crimes has increased. Mr. Inksetter’s collection was significantly larger than Mr. Dean’s and contained more vile images. Furthermore, Mr. Dean was convicted of only possession of child pornography, not both possession and making it available as has Mr. Inksetter.[75]If the sentence was greater than two years, it could not include a period of probation. In my view, probation will be of significant assistance because it will ensure that Mr. Inksetter receive the counselling in emotion regulation and dealing with stress that was recommended by both Dr. Gray and Dr. Kingston. Furthermore, a period of incarceration followed by a lengthy probation will allow control and supervision of Mr. Inksetter for a longer period of time than would the 4 ½ year sentence sought by the Crown.Part 6: Conclusion: Sentence and ancillary orders[76]In all of the circumstances, I conclude that an appropriate sentence for Mr. Inksetter on the possession of child pornography charge would be two years less a day in custody, to be followed by a period of probation of three years. On the charge of making child pornography available, I sentence him to one year in custody, to be served concurrently.[77]The terms of the probation will include a requirement to attend and participate in assessment and counselling for deviant sexual behaviour, emotion regulation and stress, including continuing with counselling with Dr. Kingston.[78]I asked counsel for submissions on an appropriate term of probation or a s. 161 order. They agreed that it would be appropriate to include a term in any such order that:(a)Mr. Inksetter be required to provide access to his electronic devices to the Ottawa Police Service upon demand for the purpose of searching for material related to child pornography; and(b)that he is not to possess and/or utilize any encryption capable software.[79]Those terms will be part of the probation order, with the right of access to his electronic devices be given to either the Ottawa Police Service or the police service in the municipality in which he resides.[80]A number of ancillary orders are appropriate.[81]Possession of and making available child pornography are both primary designated offences within the meaning of paragraph (a) of the definition of that term in s. 487.04. ConsequentlyI order Mr. Inksetter to(a)provide a sample of his DNA for analysis and registration under s. 487.05(1); and(b)comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act.[82]Because the maximum terms of imprisonment for these two offences are 10 and 14 years respectively, s. 490.013(2.1) provides that the latter order is for life.[83]I order that the computer and related equipment seized by the police, upon which was found the child pornography, be forfeited to the Crown under s. 164.2.[84]I prohibit Mr. Inksetter, under s. 161, from:(a)attending a public park or public swimming area where persons under the age of 16 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, or a daycare centre, schoolground, or playground;(b)seeking, obtaining, or continuing any employment, whether or not the employment is remunerated, or becoming or being a volunteer in a capacity that involves being in a position of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 16 years; or(c)using the Internet or other digital network unless he:(i)agrees in writing, before any such use, to provide access to his electronic devices to the Ottawa Police Service (or the police service in the municipality in which he lives) upon demand for the purpose of searching for material related to child pornography, and(ii)does not possess and/or utilize any encryption capable software.[85]I urge the Ottawa Police Service to use this authority to monitor Mr. Inksetter’s use of computers and the Internet.[86]The term of the s. 161 order is for life.Released:August 22, 2017Signed: Justice P.

C.Q._____________________________________________________________________________TheQUEENProsecutorv.JamessonLAUTUREAccused_____________________________________________________________________________JUDGMENT(Sentence)_____________________________________________________________________________[1]On 27 November 2014, Mr. Lauture pleaded guilty to three counts concerning events on 9 March 2014: armed robbery,[1] conspiracy (armed robbery)[2] and aggravated assault.[3]The prosecution proposes a sentence of sixty months.The defence, taking into account the offender’s guilty pleas, remorse and age, proposes a sentence of thirty-six months.The sentence must also take into account the preventive detention since 11 March 2014, for a credit of 623 days.[2]For reasons explained below, it is probable that the collateral consequences of this decision will be far more severe for Mr. Lauture and his family than for any person born in Canada.[3]The gravity of the offences is apparent and the degree of Mr. Lauture’s responsibility for them is complete.The crimes were committed in a calculated and opportunistic manner and with total disregard for others.The victim of the assault suffered aggravated injuries that are physical, mental and enduring.He lives in fear.His academic studies have been interrupted and compromised.His professional aspirations are suspended.Mr. Lauture’s pleas, his remorse and his age will never diminish the gravity of the offences or his responsibility for them.The consequences for the victim will remain.As a result, a proportionate sentence in the circumstances of this case must privilege denunciation and deterrence by isolating the offender from society.The parties agree.This does not exclude consideration of rehabilitation, social reintegration and promoting an enhanced sense of responsibility in the offender.But the other principles and objectives must give priority to denunciation and deterrence.The parties agree and the jurisprudence is plainly to the same effect.[4]A sentence between three and six years is appropriate in this case.Such a conclusion takes into account proportionality and the totality principle.The gravity of these offences, however, requires a sentence at the higher end of the range to reflect the degree of the offender’s responsibility for them.I accept that Mr. Lauture has accepted his responsibility and recognises that the seriousness of these crimes, considering his young age and the consequences for the victim, do not allow substantial reduction of the total.[5]There will be a sentence of forty-eight months.From this figure will be substracted 623 days for pre-sentence custody.[6]Mr. Lauture is nineteen years old and immigrated to Canada from Haiti at the age of eight.He is not a Canadian citizen but a permanent resident.He lives with his mother, who is the only other member of his family in this country.As a consequence of the sentence imposed today, Mr. Lauture is liable to be excluded from Canada under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.If he is subject to an exclusion order, he will have no right of appeal against that decision.Thus Mr. Lauture will be separated from his mother if she chooses to remain here after his removal; or she will leave Canada to remain with her son if he is removed.It is for this reason that the sentence imposed today will likely have adverse consequences for Mr. Lauture that are more severe than for a person born in Canada.[7]There is nothing that can be done in this court to address these collateral consequences.Only a sentence of less than six months would preserve Mr. Lauture’s right of appeal against an adverse exclusion order.In Pham[4], the Supreme Court explicitly concluded that collateral consequences could be taken into account but only on the proviso that doing so would not result in a disproportionate sentence.A sentence of less than six months would be unreasonable and disproportionate to the gravity of the offences and the degree of Mr. Lauture’s responsibility.[8]An unresolved question is whether the collateral consequences concerning exclusion orders would be engaged where there is a conditional sentence of more than six months.As the Supreme Court has described a conditional sentence as a term of imprisonment, it would appear that the answer is yes, even though a conditional sentence may be granted solely if the sentencing court concludes that the offender poses no danger to others.[9]The collateral consequences under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act[5] are significant but this court is plainly not an appropriate forum in which to examine them in the circumstances of this case.Such an examination could only occur in a forum where the operation of those provisions is directly in issue.Where such is the case it might be expected that it might be questioned whether those measures precisely because the different treatment of persons born in Canada and persons not born in Canada is a question of status before the law.Persons born in Canada cannot be banished.FOR THESE REASONS, Mr. Lauture, the sentence in this matter is as follows:Imprisonment for four years, concurrent on the three counts, minus the preventive detention (calculated at a ratio of 1.5) of 623, for a total of 837 days from today;An order according to section 109 of the Criminal Code prohibiting you to possess any weapons for a period of ten years;An order according to section 487.051(1) for a sample of DNA.__________________________________PATRICK HEALY, J.C.Q.MeDannie LeblancFor the prosecutorMeLouis-Philippe RoyFor Mr. LautureDateof hearing:27November 2014[1]Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.

Schuler, at Fort Providence, in the Northwest Territories, on September 11th, A.D. 2003.APPEARANCES:Ms. C. Carrasco:Counsel for the CrownMr. H. Latimer:Counsel for the AccusedCharge under s. 271 Criminal Code of CanadaBan on Publication on Complainant/ Witness Pursuant to Section 486 of the Criminal CodeTHE COURT:Robert Louis Sayine has been found guilty today by a jury of sexually assaulting the victim in this case, who was in bed with her boyfriend when this occurred.Obviously, from the verdict, the jury must not have believed Mr. Sayine’s evidence and must have believed the evidence of the victim and her boyfriend and have been satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the assault occurred as they said. In other words, that Mr. Sayine entered the bedroom and had sexual intercourse with the victim while she was sleeping; that she woke up while he was doing that; she grabbed her boyfriend, who then pulled Mr. Sayine off the bed. It is tragic that a young woman cannot sleep safely and undisturbed even with her boyfriend and even after putting a table against the door to prevent intruders.Unfortunately, this is yet another example of the many cases like this that this Court hears about where in a small community like Fort Resolution, as in this case, a young girl or young woman is not safe in circumstances where she should have been safe and she should have been able to feel safe. She was, as Crown counsel has pointed out, a vulnerable victim because she was sleeping, and that is an aggravating factor.Mr. Sayine is 34 years old now. So at the time of the offence he was 32 and the victim was 15.I have reviewed the victim impact statement that[Page 1]was filed. The victim expresses feelings similar to those of so many other victims of sexual assault; that she is uncomfortable, hurt, humiliated and upset when she sees Mr. Sayine. Now, that statement appears to have been completed in October, 2001. However, even now, as the victim testified, it is clear that the memory of what happened upsets and hurts her. With the support of her family and friends, perhaps she can move forward with her life now that the trial is over and in some way deal with this terrible experience.As I said, Mr. Sayine is now 34 years old. He is Metis. I accept that he is of Aboriginal background. From the character witnesses I heard at trial and on the sentencing and the character references submitted, I accept that he is a good worker, that he is well thought of by his supervisors at Renewable Resources, and that he is highly regarded by his family and very caring towards his grandmother and helpful to her.He has, from the information provided, had a difficult family life in some respects. He has also lived a traditional life for much of his youth with his grandparents. I also must take into account that Mr. Sayine does have a criminal record. The only related conviction was 10 years ago in 1993, that being assault with a weapon, for which he received a fine and probation. His only other convictions are all in 1995 and are for what we would term somewhat minor and[Page 2]unrelated offences.I referred to the fact that Mr. Sayine is Aboriginal. However, I also note that there is no evidence that it is because of that or because of his background that he is here in court on this charge. There is no indication that there are any systemic or other factors that bring him before the Court, and with an offence of this nature, his being Aboriginal does not mean that he should be treated any differently from others who might commit this type of offence.It is very clear, and it’s been said many, many times by this Court and others, that the principles that apply in sentencing in a case of this nature, the main principles that apply are denunciation and deterrence, meaning that the sentence that is imposed must show how society, how the community denounces, condemns this type of behaviour, and, also, that the sentence should aim at deterring others from committing similar offences.Mr. Sayine did speak briefly at this sentencing. He said that he did not do anything. It is clear from that that he does not accept the jury’s verdict and does not show any remorse. Nevertheless, I do take into account that he did waive the Preliminary Inquiry, which meant that the Complainant did not have to testify on that occasion. As defence counsel has pointed out, the length of time that this case has[Page 3]taken is because the first trial ended in a hung jury, which is not because of anything that Mr. Sayine or anyone else, for that matter, involved in the case did.I accept that this offence is out of character for Mr. Sayine, who seems to have made an effort to be responsible to his family and his community in the last several years. The fact that he had a lot to drink on the night in question is, of course, not an excuse. There cannot be anyone who does not know that when people consume a lot of alcohol, they do things that they might otherwise not do. The only solution, of course, is simply not to drink like that.Although there were no physical injuries to the victim, there was obviously psychological injury to her, as there always is in these cases. Her testimony was that there was intercourse, and, accordingly, this is a serious sexual assault, a serious violation of her personal and sexual integrity.It is regrettable when people who are generally good and responsible commit serious offences, and sentencing such people is always difficult, as is sentencing generally. It is often said that it is one of the most difficult tasks that a Judge has.I have considered the submissions that have been made. The Crown seeks a term of imprisonment of three years, which I think it is fair to say is generally the[Page 4]range that is imposed for offences of this nature in this jurisdiction. The defence seeks a term of two years less a day and a period of probation.I thought very carefully about those submissions and where an appropriate sentence would lie. I do have to take into account that when Mr. Sayine committed this offence he was not a kid. He was a mature man.Stand up, please, Mr. Sayine. First of all, with respect to the order requested under section 109 of the Criminal Code, the firearm prohibition order, I am going to grant such an order. But in light of the evidence that I have heard about Mr. Sayine’s hunting activities, and I am satisfied that it is an important part of his existence, I am also going to make an order under section 113 that the Chief Firearms Officer may issue a permit or license or registration certificate to Mr. Sayine for sustenance or employment purposes.With respect to the DNA order requested, I note that this is a primary designated offence, and having heard no submissions as to why such an order ought not to be made, I am satisfied that it should, and so such an order will go, as well.With respect to the sentence in this case, every case is different. There does have to be some consistency in sentencing, and, in my view, considering other similar cases and considering the particular facts of this case, an appropriate sentence is three[Page 5]years’ imprisonment.The victim of crime surcharge will be waived in the circumstances.You may sit down, Mr. Sayine. Is there anything else, counsel, that I need to deal with?MR. LATIMER:I was just wondering about a recommendation that it be served in the Northwest Territories.THE COURT:Yes. I am sorry. I had meant to do that. I will direct the Clerk to endorse the warrant that the sentence be served in the Northwest Territories.MS. CARRASCO:As far as the exhibits are concerned, can there be an order that they be released after the appeal period?THE COURT:That would be the usual order. I take it, Mr. Latimer, that would --MR. LATIMER:Yes.THE COURT:-- be satisfactory to you? All right. There will be an order, then, that the exhibits be held -- they are all paper exhibits, aren’t they?MS. CARRASCO:Yes.THE COURT:All right. They be held by the Court until the expiry of the appeal period or the determination of any appeal that is taken.Is there anything further that I need to do?MS. CARRASCO:No, Your Honour. I don’t believe[Page 6]so.THE COURT:Mr. Latimer?MR. LATIMER:No, there’s nothing.THE COURT:All right.

NUMBERPUT IN ON PAGE**********TRANSCRIPT ORDERED:.............................TRANSCRIPT COMPLETED:.............................ORDERING PARTY NOTIFIED:.............................S E N T E N C I N GTHE COURT:These are my reasons for sentence in the matter of Albert Rosenberg.Mr. Rosenberg appeared before me in custodyon September the 30th, and pled guilty to eight counts of fraud, one count of possession of proceeds of crime, and one count of assault.On the sentencing hearing the Crown seeks a penitentiary sentence in the upper end of the range of 4 to 6 years.Mr. Rosenberg is self-represented.He presents as an intelligent and articulate individual.His criminal history confirms his experience with court proceedings.He has represented himself in these sentencing proceedings, and has been very direct in his acceptance of responsibility for these offences, and in fact has expressly conceded that a penitentiary sentence is appropriate.He asks me to consider a sentence less than that sought by the Crown, something in the range of 4 to 5 years.Mr. Rosenberg is, to put it bluntly, a serial fraud artist.His criminal record is filed as Exhibit 3 in the proceedings.In summary, in 1988 he was sentenced to a total of 4 years with respect to certain fraud convictions.In 1991, he was again convicted of a collection of frauds and sentenced to a consecutive 3 year term.He was apparently paroled in 1994, and about 5 months later, again, sentenced to 2 years for crimes of dishonesty, and re-committed to the penitentiary.Shortly thereafter, a few months later, he was convicted of further fraudulent offences, and received a further sentence.The sentences would appear to all merge, but resulted in his release from the penitentiary in 2005, but in 2006 he was re-committed on a 3 year sentence for fraud, and related convictions.He was released in the summer of 2009.Re-committed for a statutory release violation in February of 2010.A summary of the facts which were acknowledged on the plea, and on the sentencing hearing are filed before the court and marked as Exhibit 2 in these proceedings.The facts set out are essentially the summary contained in the Record of Arrest.They were expressly agreed to by Mr. Rosenberg on his plea.In brief, Mr. Rosenberg created a fictional persona as a member of the Swiss nobility, and the heir to a large fortune.He presents himself successfully as a sophisticated financial advisor, and promises potential investors and contractors great success and great returns on their investments.He cultivated a network of moneyed individuals prepared to invest with him, and, in fact, to refer others.In the crimes before me, the most direct victims of his constellation of schemes begins with Michaela Zavoianu, who he met on a dating website in 2009.They dated for a few months, until the relationship was interrupted by Mr. Rosenberg beingre-committed to the penitentiary for a paroleviolation.He told Ms. Zavoianu that he was in jail for unpaid taxes.When he was released, the relationship continued.They moved in together, and over the next year, or so, he set up a holding company.He made her the President, Director of the Company, and convinced her to cash her retirement savings and turn over a total of $80,000.00 to him for investment.Not only did the money disappear, but, in a sense, so did Mr. Rosenberg because during this time he struck up a relationship with another woman, Antoinette Larizza.This charade was essentially the same.He was a wealthy Swiss Baron, who would show her the good life, convinced her to sell her home and move in with him, to turn over the proceeds of the sale of this home to invest in a trust fund which would be for her benefit.Ms. Larizza eventually became aware that all was not right.There was another woman's name on the corporate documents of the holding company.She made further inquiries and discovered, it would seem gradually, that Mr. Rosenberg was a fraud.Prior to discovering the whole truth, she confronted Mr. Rosenberg.He reacted physically.In anger, he squeezed her arm sufficiently to leave bruising.As part of these proceedings, he has pled guilty to this domestic assault.Ms. Larizza's total loss financially is listed as $155,000.00.Ms. Larizza delivered a Victim Impact Statement orally in court at the sentencing hearing.It is entered in written form as Exhibit 5 in the proceedings.Her comments were articulate and compelling, and her statement illustrates the deep psychological injury that is, quite frankly, often overlooked when the courts consider sentencing in so-called \"property offences.\"Considering all that Ms. Larizza has been through as a victim, no one can question that the damage done by these offences for all the victims, but in particular Ms. Larizza, goes deeper and further than mere dollars and cents.The frauds here were perpetrated against vulnerable individuals, and are crimes of considerable gravity.These two frauds are breaches of trust.They must be responded to by the courts with meaningful consequences.In addition to the frauds perpetrated on these two women, and over the same period of time, Mr. Rosenberg has committed a variety of commercial frauds, which are the subject of the other counts.There is a chart filed as Exhibit 1 in these proceedings setting out those victims and their respective financial losses.The total taken together is a million dollars.CBRE is described as a project management company, which Mr. Rosenberg retrained to assist in setting up the head office for his holding company.They suffered a loss of just over $20,000.00.John Hunt was retained to set up a trust fund for Mr. Larizza.He was convinced to invest $300,000.00 of his own in the holding company.The money is gone.HOK Designs was hired to provide design services for this supposed head office.Their out-of-pocket loss was over $150,000.00.Italinteriors was to make custom-made furniture for the office.They suffered a loss of over $340,000.00.Vincent Zaffino placed money with the accused for investment.His loss is listed as $100,000.00.It is agreed as part of the facts that none of these funds were invested or applied to the uses for which they were solicited, but were rather spent by the accused to support his lavish lifestyle.At the time of his arrest, he was in possession of $2,509.96, and a Porsche sports car, and those assets have been seized and forfeited.Section 718 of the Criminal Code now provides a convenient frame-work for consideration of the applicable purposes and principles of sentencing.The fundamental principle is that a sentence must be both proportionate to the gravity of the offence, and the degree of responsibility of the offender.The mandate of s.718 is to impose a \"just sanction,\" a sanction that advances the objectives of, amongst other things, adequately denouncing unlawful conduct, deterring an offender specifically, as well as other like-minded individuals generally, and to separate offenders from society where that is necessary.It is also one of the purposes of sentencing to try and facilitate the rehabilitation of offenders where there is potential to do so, and to provide reparations to victims when that is possible, and all of this, as well, to try and promote a sense of responsibility in the offender, and an acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and to the community.When crafting a sentence dealing with a constellation of offences that are intertwined, the court must also consider the totality of the consequences to the offender.The most serious offences before me here are, without question, the breach of trust frauds committed against Larizza and Zavoianu.The other more commercial frauds are, without question, matters of considerable gravity, as well.Section 380 of the Criminal Code deals with sentencing in fraud, and fraud-like offences.It provides a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment for each fraud over $5,000.00.The more recent subsection (1.1) now provides for a minimum mandatory jail sentence of 2 years, where the total subject matter of a fraud, or related frauds, exceeds 1 million dollars.That mandatory minimum came into existence during the currency of some of the fraudulent activity before me, but whether or not it actually applies to this accused is completely academic because clearly the appropriate range of sentence here is in excess of that mandatory minimum.But at the very least, the creation of that subsection evidences Parliament's intention that crimes of this magnitude be dealt with with an emphasis on denunciation.Section 380.1 prescribes certain statutorily aggravating circumstances to be considered in sentencing for fraudulent activities.That subsection codifies the common law, and prescribes that circumstances aggravating sentence include the, \"magnitude, the complexity, the duration, and the degree of planning\" in a fraud, as well as the number of victims, the degree of impact on the victims given their personal circumstances, and, again, expressly whether the value of the fraud exceeds 1 million dollars.The Crown has provided me with three reported cases for assistance in this matter.The case of R. v. Johnston, reported at[2013] O.J. No. 4087, involve an accused pretending to be an investment banker, and he gave a bad cheque for over $20,000.00 to pay his hotel bill.He had been staying at the hotel during the currency of his fraudulent activities.That accused was on bail at the time of the offence.He had a lengthy related criminal record.In fact, it would appear he was serving a fraud sentence at the time of the offence.He was characterized by the court as an \"incorrigible fraudsman,\" and he was sentenced to 4 years, and that was following a contested trial.The second case of R. v. Deutsch, reported at [2005] O.J. No. 5542, the Ontario Court of Appeal approved a sentence of 4 years imposed following a trial of a con-artist masquerading as a middle-man for Saudi oil interests, defrauding his victims of well over $100,000.00.That accused can also be characterized as a serial con-artist, from whom the public was in need of protection.The Court of Appeal characterized the 4 year sentence as \"not excessive\" but \"if anything lenient.\"The third case is the case of Patricia Downey.It's the decision of Justice Hill, sentencing an accused to a global 6 year penitentiary term for a variety of offences which are not terribly dis-similar to those before me.It is worth noting, as a bit of an aside, that this is a decision from back in 2003, and so pre-dates many of the statutorily aggravating circumstances and guidelines that Parliament has now moved into the Criminal Code.Patricia Downey passed herself off to her victims as a wealthy heiress with considerable assets.Those assets had been frozen in the wake of her husband's recent death.All of this was false, but believed by her victim, 85 year old Reginald, who tried to help her by providing her with an unsecured $239,000.00 loan.Ms. Downey had a history of strikingly similar fraudulent behaviour.In short, again, she was a serial con-artist.There were other victims in the proceedings before Justice Hill who lost life savings, together with the manifest psychological injury, loss of reputation, and dignity.It would also appear in that case, from the comments of Justice Hill, that there was some serious concern about Ms. Downey's mental well-being.As with all of these cases, which are marked with planning, pre-meditation, and sophistication, one is almost forced to conclude that beyond the simple explanation of greed, there must be some deep psychological disorder at play, explaining, at least to some degree, the behaviour of these incorrigible fraud artists.Beginning at paragraph 54 of the Downey decision, Justice Hill provides an analysis that is a useful framework for sentencing in cases such as this.Paraphrasing, he says the court should consider the nature and extent of the loss, the degree ofpre-meditation, the accused's conduct after the fact, history of prior convictions, personal benefits generated to the accused, and the trust existing in the relationship between the accused and the victim, and the motivation underlying the commission of the offence.He also notes that the relative gravity of the offence can depend on its sophistication and complexity.So these comments of Justice Hill back in 2003 really, in a sense, predict those factors being now codified in the provisions of the Criminal Code dealing with sentencing in cases such as this.With those general principles in mind, it has to also be emphasized, of course, that sentencing for a criminal offence is a highly individualized exercise.An appropriate sentence must be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the unique facts and circumstances of both the offence and the offender.There is great benefit to considering, and being guided by dispositions in similar cases.In addition to the three cases that the Crown has provided me with, that I have referred to, one of the benefits of Justice Hill's case is it, in fact, contains within it a series of cases summarized at paragraph 63 through 67.All of those cases contain far less aggravating circumstances than the one before me, and all resulted in penitentiary sentences.Amongst the aggravating circumstances in this case are the following:1.The accused before me is an incorrigibleserial con-artist.This is evidencedboth by his criminal history, and thecircumstances of these particularoffences.2.Although the accused was neither on bailnor parole at the time of these offences,he had only recently completed a lengthypenitentiary sentence for similaractivity.3.The frauds on Larizza and Zavoianuinvolve a significant breach of trust.4.There is, before the court, aconstellation of inter-related frauds.5.These frauds were committed withconsiderable thought and sophistication.6.These are frauds of considerablemagnitude and complexity, and involve acollective loss in excess of a milliondollars.7.Essentially no restitution has beenprovided.8.Both the financial and psychologicalimpact on the victims, as evidenced bythe Victim Impact Statements before me,and as I have already said, inparticular I reference the impact onAntoinette Larizza, who eloquentlyprovided significant insight into theinsult and psychological trauma inflictedon her by the accused.9.Mr. Rosenberg expressly acknowledged thathis motivation was greed.10. The proceeds went to underwriting alavish lifestyle.Balanced against these considerable aggravating circumstances, there are certain mitigating factors:1.Mr. Rosenberg has pled guilty at theearliest opportunity.2.He has accepted full responsibility forhis conduct.3.He has been direct and forthright in hiscooperation following his arrest.He hasin no way sought to deflect blame fromhimself.4.He has expressed remorse.5.He acknowledges the magnitude of hisculpability, and fully expects asignificant penitentiary sentence.6.He has expressed a willingness to makerestitution, but, at the same time,acknowledges that he has no presentability to follow through on that statedintent.In conclusion, and in consideration of all of the above, it is my assessment that a global sentence of 5 years in the penitentiary is appropriate.I hasten to add that taken in isolation, each of these offences might be dealt with in a different fashion, and I expressly have taken into account the fact that this is a constellation of activity, and therefore viewed it as a case where the global nature of the disposition, and the totality of it has to be considered in a significant fashion.Subject to submissions, I would propose to attribute the sentence as follows:With respect to the fraud against Antoinette Larizza, 5 years.With respect to the fraud against Zavoianu, 5 years concurrent.With respect to each of the other frauds, 3 year concurrent sentences.With respect to the proceeds, possession of the proceeds of crime, the cash, 6 months concurrent.With respect to the assault, 30 days concurrent, all of which I would consider to be an appropriate global sentence, as I said at the outset, of 5 years in the penitentiary[1].there.(Discussion of ancillary Orders for restitution and DNA data banking omitted)THIS IS TO CERTIFY that the foregoing is a true and accurate transcription of the recordings of MR.

Accordingly, the one-year sentence of incarceration for the sexual assault imposed by the trial judge is restored, to be followed by a three-month conditional sentence for the common assaults and three years probation imposed by the trial judge for the sexual assault.The service of the sentences should be stayed, however, as the offender has now served his nine-month conditional sentence in full.Per Lamer C.J. and Iacobucci J. (dissenting):The Court of Appeal was correct in holding that the accused was entitled to the benefit of the conditional sentencing regime on appeal.The accused is entitled to the benefit of any amendments to sentencing provisions in force at the time of the appeal that provide for a lesser penalty.Since a conditional sentence is less restrictive of liberty than incarceration, it constitutes a mitigation of punishment within the meaning of s. 44(e) of the Interpretation Act.Sentencing decisions of courts of appeal are entitled to some deference from this Court.The degree of deference to be given appellate courts is an issue that will arise only in exceptional cases, given that this Court rarely hears appeals relating to sentences.Accordingly, although the sentence imposed by the Court of Appeal appears to be somewhat lenient, it should not be interfered with given the Court of Appeal’s careful analysis of the relevant sentencing principles and review of the evidence.Cases CitedBy L’Heureux-Dubé J.Applied:R. v.

This case was heard together with the appeals in R. v. Proulx, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII); R. v. L.F.W., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 132, 2000 SCC 6 (CanLII); R. v.

Bunn, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 183, 2000 SCC 9 (CanLII).At issue in all of these appeals are the principles governing the pronouncement of conditional sentences in the new legislative scheme.These reasons are concerned primarily with the application of the principles set out in Proulx, supra.In addition, this case raises questions about the effects of changes in the law and in the facts between the pronouncement of the sentence by the trial judge and the hearing of the appeal.I.Factual Background2The respondent was convicted on May 2, 1996, of one count of sexual assault and two counts of assault committed against a former employee in her early twenties, who worked on his farm.I will rely on the Court of Appeal’s statement of facts ((1997), 123 Man. R. (2d) 91, at p. 96) which was endorsed by the parties in their written submissions before this Court:In November of 1990, the [respondent] was harnessing a horse in his barn when he cornered the complainant, placed his hands inside her pants and pulled her pubic hair.He then directed her into a box stall where he ordered her to lie down on the straw.He then proceeded to take off her pants and inserted his finger in her vagina, told her not to tell anyone and departed for breakfast.The second incident occurred in February of 1991 in the barn when the complainant was putting a halter on a horse.The [respondent] pulled on the halter so that she stumbled and fell.He placed one arm around her neck and put a finger up each of her nostrils and pulled quite hard causing her nose to bleed.The third assault occurred in the summer of 1991, when the [respondent] came into the garden where the complainant was working, telling her it was time to eat.He then grabbed her from behind by her wrists, had his two sons and a friend grab her feet and carry her to the house.When she struggled, the boys let go of her feet but the [respondent] dragged her by her wrists across a gravel driveway.During this incident, he told the [complainant] that she was fat and he laughed.He also told her that she had to go to eat when he told her.3The respondent was sentenced in June 1996 to one year of incarceration for the count of sexual assault and to fines for the two counts of assault.The respondent appealed the convictions and the sentences.After trial but prior to the appeal, the amendments to Part XXIII of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46 (An Act to amend the Criminal Code (sentencing) and other Acts in consequence thereof, S.C. 1995, c. 22 (“Bill C-41”)), came into force.II.Relevant Statutory Provisions4Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46718.The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and to the community.718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,(i)evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor,(ii)evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s spouse or child,(iii)evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, or(iv)evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal organizationshall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;(c) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.742.1 Where a person is convicted of an offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, and the court(a) imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years, and(b) is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2,the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions of a conditional sentence order made under section 742.3.III.Judgments BelowA.Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench (Reasons for Sentence), C.R. 94-03-0028, June 6, 19965The respondent was sentenced on June 6, 1996.At the time of sentencing, Bill C-41 was not yet in force.Accordingly, Schwartz J., the sentencing judge, did not have the option of imposing a conditional sentence.6Schwartz J. began by noting that the case had attracted a considerable amount of interest because of the high visibility of the respondent in his local community and the horse-racing community.He stated that the respondent was a valued and involved member of the community in which he resided.The respondent had a sound marriage and was a successful entrepreneur.In considering the appropriate sentence, Schwartz J. reviewed the various principles of sentencing.He found that in this case, the elements of general deterrence and denunciation seemed to be more important than the others.He was satisfied that the respondent would likely never re-offend, and that he was rehabilitated.If that were the only concern, he would not have been sent to prison.In order to deter others and to show the rest of the community that the respondent’s conduct was reprehensible, however, he found that a prison sentence was required.On the sexual assault count, Schwartz J. imposed a sentence of one year’s incarceration to be served consecutivelyto a term to which the respondent had already been sentenced for a prior conviction on two counts of sexual assault.The term of imprisonment was to be followed by three years of supervised probation.On the assault charges, the respondent was sentenced to pay fines of $10,000 and $2,000, and in default thereof, to serve one year and three months in jail respectively.B. Manitoba Court of Appeal (1997), 123 Man. R. (2d) 917The respondent appealed the convictions and the sentences.The convictions on the three counts were upheld by the Court of Appeal.8Prior to the hearing of the appeal, Bill C-41 came into force.The conditional sentence was now an option for offenders sentenced to less than two years of imprisonment.In addition to this change in the law, there was also a change in the relevant facts.At the time of the original sentencing, the respondent had just been convicted on two other counts of sexual assault in an unrelated case, for which two 10-month concurrent sentences of incarceration had been imposed.Shortly before the appeal, a different panel of the Manitoba Court of Appeal quashed these convictions: (1997), 118 Man. R. (2d) 37.In addition, by the time the appeal in this case was heard, the respondent had paid $10,000 to the complainant pursuant to a Manitoba Human Rights Board settlement.9The Court of Appeal found that the respondent was entitled to the benefit of the new sentencing provisions which came into force after his original sentencing.Given changes in both the law and the relevant facts, the Court of Appeal considered that in a real sense, this was an appeal de novo.10The court reviewed the various decisions under the conditional sentencing regime, and concluded that because of the confusion surrounding the provisions, they had been applied inconsistently.According to the Court of Appeal, the further amendment to s. 742.1(b)(Criminal Law Improvement Act, 1996, S.C. 1997, c. 18, s. 107.1), which came into force on May 2, 1997, appeared to clarify that judges should consider the principles of sentencing twice: first when determining if and for how long incarceration was required, and then again when determining whether that sentence should be served in the community.The court noted that notwithstanding the amendment, the main thrust of the legislation as a whole remained the crafting of sentences that treat imprisonment as a last resort, and that no offenders or offences were automatically precluded from the benefits of the new conditional sentencing regime, provided they met the benchmark of time and non-danger to the community.11In this case, the court felt that the respondent was a good candidate for a conditional sentence.He was unlikely to re-offend, and rehabilitation was not an issue.Most importantly, denunciation and deterrence would be effectively achieved if he were forced to live in his own small community, conspicuously confined by strict limitations as to his movement and endeavours.The only reason to put the respondent in prison would be to seek revenge or retribution for the totally unacceptable manner in which he treated his young and vulnerable employee.Nothing in the evidence suggested that the respondent was likely to be a danger to his community.In so finding, the court kept in mind all of the principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code, including the principle that an offender should not be deprived of his liberty if less restrictive sanctions are appropriate.The court concluded that the shame, the loss of respect, and the condemnation of the community, as well as the strict conditions to which the respondent would be subject, would be sufficient to forcefully impress upon him that his conduct was totally unacceptable and that there was a need for immediate and drastic change.12The court allowed the sentence appeal and imposed a nine-month global sentence made up of six months for the sexual assault, two months for the first common assault, and one month for the second common assault, to be served consecutively.The court found that this case warranted the application of s. 742.1 and therefore ordered the respondent to serve his sentence in the community.In addition to the mandatory conditions, the court ordered that the respondent complete 100 hours of community service within the first six months, that he complete a sexual offender course chosen by his supervisor, and that he be confined to his farm property at all times, subject to limited exceptions.IV.Issue13At issue in this appeal is whether the Court of Appeal erred in substituting a conditional sentence for the jail term imposed by the trial judge.V.AnalysisA. Benefit of the Conditional Sentencing Regime on Appeal14The Court of Appeal was correct in holding that the respondent was entitled to the benefit of the conditional sentencing regime on appeal.I rely on s. 44(e) of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-21, which provides that:44. Where an enactment, in this section called the “former enactment”, is repealed and another enactment, in this section called the “new enactment”, is substituted therefor,. . .(e) when any punishment, penalty or forfeiture is reduced or mitigated by the new enactment, the punishment, penalty or forfeiture if imposed or adjudged after the repeal shall be reduced or mitigated accordingly;15As my colleague Major J. held in R. v. Dunn, 1995 CanLII 149 (SCC), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 226, at para. 27:I conclude that s. 44(e) of the Interpretation Act resolves the question raised by this appeal.Where an amendment to a sentencing provision has been passed after the conviction and sentence by the trial judge, but before the appeal has been “decided”, the offender is entitled to the benefit of the lesser penalty or punishment.The same reasoning applies here.The respondent is entitled to the benefit of any amendments to sentencing provisions in force at the time of the appeal that provide for a lesser penalty, or, in the language of s. 44(e), a reduction or mitigation of punishment.16At trial, the respondent was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year.Pursuant to s. 742.1(a), a conditional sentence is now an option in circumstances where a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years is imposed, provided the other statutory prerequisites are met.Had the conditional sentencing regime and the additional sentencing provisions in Bill C-41 been in force at the time of sentencing, the trial judge would have given the possibility of a conditional sentence some consideration.This follows from s. 718.2(e) which provides that a court should consider all alternatives to incarceration that are reasonable in the circumstances.Since a conditional sentence is less restrictive of liberty than incarceration, it constitutes a mitigation of punishment within the meaning of s. 44(e) of the Interpretation Act.Accordingly, the respondent should be entitled to the benefit of the conditional sentencing regime on appeal.B. Review of Sentence Imposed by Court of Appeal17As a result of the intervening changes to both the applicable law and the relevant facts between trial and appeal, the Court of Appeal re-sentenced the respondent, as it was entitled to.This raises the issue of what standard of review this Court should apply to the sentence imposed by the Court of Appeal.18In Proulx, supra,the Court considered the standard of appellate review applicable to sentences imposed by trial judges.The Court reaffirmed its holding in R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, at para. 90, thatabsent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit.19As explained in M. (C.A.), supra, at para. 91, this deferential standard of review has“profound functional justifications”.Two of the justifications set out in M. (C.A.) are that sentencing judges, serving on the front lines of the criminal justice system, generally have more day-to-day experience in sentencing matters than many appellate court judges.Second, and more importantly, the sentencing judge will generally have a better knowledge of the community in which the offences occurred and is therefore in a better position to craft an appropriate sentence.20In light of the foregoing, it is my view that a sentence imposed by a court of appeal is not entitled to the same level of deference as that imposed by a sentencing judge.However, this is not to say that such a sentence is entitled to no deference whatsoever.Provincial appellate courts deal with appeals from sentence more frequently than this Court, which, as noted in Proulx, supra,at para. 2, rarely hears such appeals.And while a court of appeal is generally further removed from the community in which the offences occurred than a sentencing judge, it will almost invariably be closer to the community than this Court.21Therefore, I am of the opinion that sentencing decisions of courts of appeal are entitled to some deference from this Court.I hasten to add that the degree of deference to be given appellate courts is an issue that will arise only in exceptional cases, given that this Court rarely hears appeals relating to sentences.C. Application of the Principles Set Out in Proulx to the Case at Hand22I would not interfere with the sentence imposed by the Court of Appeal.I say this despite the fact that the Court of Appeal seems to have adopted a rigid two-step approach, in deviation from the approach set down in Proulx, supra.In reaching its decision, the Court of Appeal carefully considered the evidentiary record, noting that since the original sentencing, the respondent’s previous sexual assault convictions had been quashed and he had paid $10,000 to the complainant pursuant to a Manitoba Human Rights Board settlement.The court concluded that the safety of the community would not be endangered by the respondent’s presence there, as the respondent was unlikely to re-offend and his rehabilitation was not an issue.It considered the application of the principle of restraint in the use of incarceration and addressed the relevant objectives of sentencing.It found that the shame, the loss of respect, the condemnation of his community which the respondent has brought upon himself, together with the strict conditions to which he would be subject pursuant to his sentence would sufficiently vindicate objectives such as denunciation and deterrence.The Court of Appeal acknowledged the demeaning conduct of the respondent towards his employee, but decided that this did not constitute an absolute bar to a conditional sentence in the circumstances.It imposed a nine-month sentence with stringent conditions such as house arrest, community work and treatment for sexual offenders (to be chosen by the respondent’s supervisor).Although this sentence appears to be somewhat lenient and, had I been the sentencing judge, I might have imposed a longer conditional sentence or a term of incarceration, I am reluctant to substitute my opinion for that of the Court of Appeal for the reasons set out at paras. 20 and 21.VI.Disposition23Given the Court of Appeal’s careful analysis of the relevant sentencing principles and review of the evidence, I do not feel that I can interfere.I would dismiss the appeal.The judgment of L’Heureux-Dubé, Gonthier, McLachlin, Major, Bastarache and Binnie JJ. was delivered by24L’Heureux-Dubé J. -- This appeal turns on whether the Court of Appeal erred in sentencing the respondent, who was the complainant’s employer, to a globalnine-month conditional sentence for one count of sexual assault and two counts of common assault.Specifically, the sentence comprised:six months for the sexual assault, and two months and one month for the respective counts of common assault.With respect, I find that the Court of Appeal erred in imposing the six-month conditional sentence for the sexual assault.In doing so, it substituted a short conditional sentence for the one-year sentence of incarceration imposed at trial.Based on the sentencing principles set out in the companion appeal of R. v. Proulx, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), I find that the Court of Appeal’s sentence was unfit in light of the gravity of the offences committed and the respondent’s moral blameworthiness given his abuse of a position of authority.25I adopt the statement of facts and the judgments below set out by the Chief Justice and I agree with the law on the principles of sentencing as set out in Proulx, supra.In addition, I recognize that the respondent was entitled to the benefit of the new sentencing provisions enacted in Bill C-41 (now S.C. 1995, c. 22) in light of the majority’s decision in R. v. Dunn, 1995 CanLII 149 (SCC), [1995] 1 S.C.R. 226.26While the Court of Appeal was entitled to review the respondent’s sentence, it ought to have recognized that the trial judge’s finding that the fit and proper sentence for the sexual assault under the old provisions–one year’sincarceration plus three years’ probation –was a relevant reflection of the gravity of the acts in question and the need for denunciation and general deterrence in this case.(On the gravity of sexual assault as an offence and its pervasiveness in Canadian society more generally, see: R. v. Osolin, 1993 CanLII 54 (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595, at p. 669; R. v. Ewanchuk, 1999 CanLII 711 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330, at paras. 68 to 75, per L’Heureux-Dubé J.; on problems relating to sentencing in sexual assault cases, see: P. Marshall, “Sexual Assault, the Charter and Sentencing Reform” (1988), 63 C.R. (3d) 216.)27The Court of Appeal substituted a six-month conditional sentence for the one-year sentence of incarceration imposed at trial, thereby imposing a significantly more lenient sentence (see Proulx, supra, at para. 44).In my opinion, this showed a serious disregard for the need to give significant weight to denunciation and deterrence in cases such as this one.28The court suggested that, in this case, these objectives could be “effectively achieved if this prominent [respondent] is forced to live in his own small community, conspicuously confined by strict limitations as to his movement and his endeavours”((1997), 123 Man. R. (2d) 91, at p. 99). In my opinion, while service of the sentence in the community and house arrest might well achieve an appropriate measure of denunciation and deterrence in some circumstances, it did not send a sufficiently strong message in this case.29Schwartz J. recognized that there was little or no risk of re-offence and that with the support of family and friends, the offender would rehabilitate himself.Nevertheless, the record also shows that the trial judge was aware that many members of the respondent’s community supported him and tended to deny that the respondent could have committed the offence of which he was convicted.Taking into account these factors, he emphasized that in light of the gravity of the sexual assault and other assaults committed, the court needed to send the message to the community that this type of conduct was reprehensible and would not be tolerated.In his view, this meant that the objectives of denunciation and general deterrence were more important than the objective of rehabilitation in this case.In fact, he viewed the one-year sentence requested by the Crown for the sexual assault conviction as being at the “low end of the scale” and stated:The Court, on behalf of the community, denounces [conduct such assexual assault] in fixing the sentence.The more worthy of denunciation, the higher the sentence to show that the community will not accept that type of conduct by its members.(Man. Q.B., C.R. 94-03-0028, June 6, 1996, at p. 4 (transcript).)30The changes in the sentencing regime brought about by Bill C-41 entitled the Court of Appeal to re-weigh the objectives of denunciation, deterrence and rehabilitation in light of the new emphasis on restorative objectives.They also entitled the court to consider the possibility of imposing a conditional sentence.Although the Court of Appeal made no finding that the respondent showed voluntary signs of remorse or acknowledged responsibility for his acts, it did note that since the imposition of the original sentence, he had made a payment of $10,000 to the complainant pursuant to a settlement of the complainant’s proceedings before the Manitoba Human Rights Commission relating to the same incidents.This weighed in favour of restorative objectives and therefore of a conditional sentence.(See s.. 718(f) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, and Proulx, supra, at para. 113.)In my view, however, this factor was not so important as to outweigh the need for a one-year sentence of incarceration in order to provide sufficient denunciation and deterrence, as found by the trial judge.31I am mindful of the fact that the respondent’s prior convictions for sexual assault in two separate cases had been quashed by the Court of Appeal before it heard the appeal in this case.This removed one of the aggravating factors the trial judge weighed in his sentencing decision.However, I note that there were several other aggravating factors which remained, including:the abuse of a position of authority by an employer against his employee (see s. 718.2(a)(iii) of the Criminal Code); the violent and demeaning nature of the acts committed; the naïveté and vulnerability of the complainant; and the harm done to her career and family life.In my opinion, these remaining aggravating factors were sufficient to militate against the short conditional sentence imposed by the Court of Appeal.32The Court of Appeal erred in failing to take sufficient account of the key aggravating factor in this case: the offender’s abuse of his position of authority by assaulting the complainant in the workplace. (For an appropriate recognition of similar conduct as an aggravating factor, see:R. v. Boudreau, [1996] N.W.T.J. No. 107 (QL) (S.C.), at para. 18; for a general discussion of the meaning of “position of authority” and “position of trust”, see: R. v. Audet, 1996 CanLII 198 (SCC), [1996] 2 S.C.R. 171, at paras. 33-45; for recognition of the relationship of power and authority between employer and employee in the context of sexual harassment, see: Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Ltd., 1989 CanLII 97 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252, at p. 1281.)33In Proulx, supra, at para. 114, this Court stated:Where punitive objectives such as denunciation and deterrence are particularly pressing, such as cases in which there are aggravating circumstances, incarceration will generally be the preferable sanction.This may be so notwithstanding the fact that restorative goals might be achieved by a conditional sentence.The respondent’s abuse of his position of authority, combined with the demeaning and violent nature of the assaults, make the punitive objectives of denunciation and deterrence particularly pressing in this case.The Court of Appeal therefore erred in imposing a short conditional sentence, where asentence of incarceration was the preferable sanction.34For these reasons, I find that a six-month conditional sentence for the sexual assault was unfit in the circumstances of this case.As was the case in R. v. R.N.S., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 149, 2000 SCC 7 (CanLII), the Crown conceded in oral argument that it was not seeking further punishment now that the respondent has served his conditional sentence in full.Thus, I do not have to decide whether a longer conditional sentence with more stringent conditions might also have satisfied the new sentencing principles, as this would have no practical effect for this respondent.With respect to the common assaults, the Crown conceded on appeal that the fines imposed at trial were not appropriate.I would therefore defer to the Court of Appeal’s finding that conditional sentences of two months and one month respectively were appropriate for the common assaults.35I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the six-month conditional sentence imposed by the Court of Appeal for the sexual assault, and restore the one-year sentence of incarceration imposed by Schwartz J. for this offence, to be followed by a three-month conditional sentence for the common assaults and three years’ probation imposed by the trial judge for the sexual assault.I would nevertheless stay the service of the sentences in this case, based on the Crown’s concessions in oral argument before this Court.Appeal allowed, Lamer C.J. and Iacobucci J. dissenting.Solicitor for the appellant:Manitoba Justice, Winnipeg.Solicitors for the respondent:Taylor, McCaffrey, Winnipeg.Solicitor for the intervener the Attorney General of Canada:The Deputy Attorney General of Canada, Ottawa.Solicitor for the intervener the Attorney General for Ontario:The Ministry of the Attorney General, Toronto.*Cory J. took no part in the judgment."}

BrodaDate: 1983-07-11Docket: 1009Between:R.andBrodaBayda, C.J.S., Woods and Cameron, JJ.A.Counsel:C. Snell, for the Crown;C. Mervin Ozirny, for the respondent.[1]Bayda, C.J.S.: The accused, Sharon G. Broda, was convicted by a summary conviction court under s. 235(2) of the Criminal Code for refusing to provide a breath sample. The court imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 14 days to be served intermittently. She appealed both the conviction and the sentence to the Court of Queen’s Bench under s. 748 of the Code. The appeal came on before Mr. Justice Halvorson who allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction.[2]Because the conviction was quashed, there was no need for Mr. Justice Halvorson to make any rulings respecting sentence, and he did not do so. He chose, however, in his written reasons for judgment, to state his views on the two grounds of appeal that were apparently pleaded before him respecting sentence. Both grounds involved questions of law. Concerning the first ground, he said:Had the appeal against conviction not succeeded, I would have allowed the appeal against sentence for a second offence because there was no proof before the trial judge identifying the accused as the same person named in the conviction notice.[3]The second ground raised the issue whether there was sufficient proof that the party signing the conviction was “the clerk of the court in which the conviction was made” as required by s. 594(2) of the Code. The judge observed:If the conviction was in the provincial court and the certification is by the clerk of the court, there is an irresistible inference, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the clerk was of that court.[4]The Attorney General appealed to this court. The appeal was taken on two grounds to which this court gave effect. The appeal, accordingly, was allowed and the conviction restored. [see 1983 CanLII 2045 (SK CA), 22 Sask. R. 239].[5]The appeal to this court was under s. 771 of the Code on questions of law. The appeal was from the order quashing the conviction and in no way related to either the sentence imposed by the summary conviction court or to the appeal of that sentence to the Court of Queen’s Bench. Hence, when this court set aside the order by Mr. Justice Halvorson and restored the conviction, the sentence imposed by the summary conviction court -- subject to an incomplete appeal to the Court of Queen’s Bench -- was automatically reinstated. Put another way, the status prevailing before the order quashing the conviction was restored. Consequently, when the consideration of sentence came up, this court was faced, in effect, with an uncompleted appeal to the Court of Queen’s Bench respecting sentence. It seemed to us that the reasonable and logical thing to do was to remit the matter to the Court of Queen’s Bench to enable the judge to complete the sentence appeal. In our reasons for judgment we said: [see 1983 CanLII 2045 (SK CA), 22 Sask. R. 239]It will be necessary to remit to the Court of Queen’s Bench the issues in relation to sentence. Mr. Justice Halvorson’s comments in this respect were obiter, but in view of our decision, the issue he discussed will now have to be determined and a sentence imposed according to law. Accordingly the matter is remitted to the Queen’s Bench for sentence.[6]When the matter came before him, Mr. Justice Halvorson caused the following fiat to be made:[The] Trial Judge felt he had no jurisdiction in the matter of sentence under s. 613(4)(B)(ii) of the Code. The matter is referred back to the Court of Appeal.The disposition is unusual to say the least. The Attorney General has appealed from that order.[7]The order should not have been made for three reasons: In the first place, this court’s order did not direct or contemplate that the Queen’s Bench judge should dispose of the sentence issue pursuant to s. 613(4)(b)(ii). The observation that he had not jurisdiction under that section was accurate, but irrelevant. This court’s order contemplated that he complete the sentence appeal that he commenced; that he convert, as it were, his observations respecting the two questions of law that were apparently argued before him into findings, if he was still so minded, and based upon such findings, that he make a final disposition of the sentence appeal pursuant to ss. 748 and 614 of the Code (the latter through the operation of s. 755). In short, it was contemplated that he deal with the sentence as if he himself had originally dismissed the conviction appeal.[8]The second reason has to do with whether this court had jurisdiction to deal with sentence under s. 613(4)(b) (ii). Where a summary conviction court has not imposed a sentence, this court, acting under s. 771(2) of the Code, is empowered to pass sentence by invoking s. 613(4)(b)(ii). The court would not be required to do so but would be free to do so. The governing word in subsec. (4) is “may” and not “shall”. The material part reads as follows:Where an appeal is from an acquittal the court of appeal may . . . enter a verdict of guilty . . . and pass a sentence that is warranted in law.That the court is not required in these cases to pass sentence is exemplified by the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal in Serafini v. R., [1961] Que. Q.B. 912n and by the recent decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Courville, 2 C.C.C.(3d) 118. In this respect, it is also important to note subsec. 8 which reads as follows:613.(8) Where a court of appeal exercises any of the powers conferred by subsection . . . (4) . . . it may make any order, in addition, that justice requires.It follows that where a Court of Appeal enters a verdict of guilty and chooses not to exercise its power of passing a sentence, the court may make an order remitting the matter to a lower court for sentence if justice requires that to be done.[9]But, where, as in the present case, the summary conviction court has imposed a sentence and the sentence was appealed to the Court of Queen’s Bench but completion of the appeal was not possible or necessary, it is questionable whether this court has the power to vacate that valid subsisting sentencing order by invoking the power vested in this court under s. 613. The Court of Queen’s Bench is the only court that has power to review on appeal, as the first appellate court, a sentence imposed by a summary conviction court. Section 748 is clear on the point. Only after that first appellate court has made a final disposition of the sentence appeal can this court engage in a review of that disposition. There is no such final disposition before us. Moreover, any review that this court could conduct would have to be pursuant to the powers vested in it under s. 771 of the Code, that is, pursuant to the regular appeal provisions. (The appeal could only get to this court on a question of law.) I question whether these regular appeal provisions can be short-circuited through the invocation of s. 613(4)(b) (ii).[10]Even if this court did have the power to so short-circuit the regular appeal provisions, it would nevertheless have the power to remit the matter to the Court of Queen’s Bench under s. 613 (8). In that event, this indeed would be an appropriate case to exercise the power to remit. This court has not had the benefit of any argument whatsoever on the two grounds of law respecting sentence presented to the Court of Queen’s Bench. The questions were not raised in this court as there was no judgment on sentence to appeal. From the practical standpoint -- the legal standpoint aside -- this court was in no position to deal with the issues, If this court had jurisdiction respecting sentence, then it was in a position not dissimilar to that in which the Supreme Court of Canada found itself in Lowry and Lepper v. The Queen (1972), 1972 CanLII 171 (SCC), 6 C.C.C.(2d) 531. In that case, the court had authority to impose a sentence as it had done in an earlier case (Manchuk v. The King, 1938 CanLII 6 (SCC), [1938] S.C.R. 341) but instead remitted the matter of sentence to the intermediary Court of Appeal (the Court of Appeal for Manitoba) for the imposition of sentence after giving the appellants the opportunity to make submissions to that court on the matter. (It was the failure to give submissions to the court that gave rise to the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.)[11]The third reason for the inappropriateness of the fiat is simply this. In our hierarchical system of courts, while it may not be improper to question the correctness of any court’s decision regardless of the questioner’s place on the hierarchical ladder, it is wholly improper for a judge of a lower court to sit on appeal, in effect, on a higher court’s decision and instead of following the directions to him contained in that decision, to follow the dictates of his own analysis. The law and the tradition of our hierarchical system do not expect a trial judge, or a lower appellate judge, who has been overruled by a Court of Appeal, to follow the latter’s directions to him enthusiastically but they do expect him to follow those directions dutifully. Were it otherwise, judicial anarchy and chaos would ensue and the system would eventually self-destruct. And, I might add, unreservedly, that it is as much out of place for a trial judge or a lower appellate court to refer a matter “back to the Court of Appeal” as it would be for this court to refer a matter “back to the Supreme Court of Canada.”[12]In the result, the appeal is allowed, the order appealed from is set aside and the matter of sentence is again remitted to the Court of Queen’s Bench for disposition in accordance with the above.Appeal allowed."}

VavasourAppearing on behalf of the CrownMarcus A. Evans, Q.C.Appearing on behalf of the AccusedAuthorities Cited:STATUTES CONSIDERED:Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46REASONS FOR JUDGMENTHandrigan, J.:INTRODUCTION[1]The RCMP charged Thomas John Brown with causing a disturbance in a public place by fighting on Ville Marie Drive in Marystown, Newfoundland and Labrador on June 4, 2014, contrary to s. 175 (1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 and with assault causing bodily harm on the same date, contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code. The Crown proceeded by indictment on the assault causing bodily harm offence on August 15, 2014 and Mr. Brown elected on December 10, 2014 to be tried by a judge and jury. The causing disturbance charge is strictly summary conviction but was appended to the assault charge and the parties intended to try the two charges together.[2]Mr. Brown pled guilty on April 2, 2015 to causing a disturbance and the Crown withdrew the assault charge. The Crown read the facts into the record on the same day to support the charge to which Mr. Brown pled guilty and I found him guilty of the offence, based on the facts the Crown presented and his guilty plea. I set the matter over until June 30, 2015 to allow the Adult Probation Officer to file a pre-sentence report on Mr. Brown and to permit counsel to prepare for a sentencing hearing. I reserved my judgment on sentence for the causing a disturbance charge from June 30, 2015 until now.The IssueWhat is a fit and proper sentence for the offence?The Law[3]Section 175 (1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code provides that “[e]very one who (a) not being in a dwelling-house, causes a disturbance in or near a public place, (i) by fighting … is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction”. Section 787 of the Criminal Code provides that “[u]nless otherwise provided by law, everyone who is convicted of an offence punishable on summary conviction is liable to a fine of not more than five thousand dollars or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months or to both”.AnalysisBackground[4]The Crown submitted these facts to me on April 2, 2015, after Mr. Brown pled guilty to the charge:On June 4, 2014 at approximately 3:25 p.m., several reports were made to the R.C.M.P. at Marystown that there was a male lying on the ground, seriously injured and another male was standing over him with a baseball bat.Other people phoned the police to report a street fight involving weapons on Ville Marie Drive in Marystown.Several officers, Sargent Gale and Corporal Foley, amongst them, attended the scene and found four injured people there: John Brown; the accused, Thomas Brown; Bryan Adam Hillier; and Andrew Hillier.When R.C.M.P. members arrived the parties were still yelling at each other.John Brown had significant injuries to his head and face.He was on the ground when the police got there. Initial information indicated John Brown had been hit in the head with a baseball bat, another person had been hit with a long wrench and yet another person had been hit with a tire iron.The R.C.M.P. located the three weapons at the scene and seized them.John Brown had a knee injury and serious facial head injuries.The accused, Thomas Brown, had a bleeding cut on the top of his head.Bryan Hillier had a broken ankle and Andrew Hillier had a broken hand.The police determined, based on the statements they obtained, that the fight on that date resulted from an altercation that occurred the previous day between the accused, Thomas Brown, and Bryan Hillier, stemming from an alleged drug debt.On June 4, 2014, John Brown, the accused’s father, and the accused, travelling in separate cars, followed Bryan Hillier, to Andrew Hillier’s house, where the fight broke out.Thomas Brown, the accused, told the officers that Bryan Hillier had threatened to kill him on the earlier date and he told his father, John Brown; so John Brown, as he put it, decided, “to go down to deal with the matter”.When John Brown pulled up at Andrew Hillier’s residence, Thomas Brown advised the police that Andrew Hillier had a baseball bat and Hillier told John Brown to leave.And as John was getting into the car, he was hit with the bat.There were a number of statements, there were a lot of witnesses and there were several people in the vehicle with Thomas Brown who provided statements. In the result, there were a lot of contradictory reports in the statements.There were some common themes, however: Thomas Brown did not have a weapon during the incident; John Brown was hit in the head with a baseball bat and suffered a broken jaw and broken orbital bone; Andrew Hillier suffered a broken hand when John Brown hit him with a wrench; and Bryan Adam Hillier had a broken ankle, but he was unsure if the break resulted from fighting with Thomas Brown or Thomas’s brother.During the fight between Thomas Brown and Bryan Hillier, Mr. Hillier allegedly hit Thomas Brown’s head with a tire iron, causing the cut to the top of Mr. Brown’s head. Constable Jones obtained a cautioned statement from Thomas Brown on June 4, 2014, corroborating many of the facts. Thomas Brown said the fight was about $10.00 that he had owed Andrew Hillier; it led to an altercation the previous day at the Wal-Mart parking lot; and the dispute between them flowed over to the June 4th date when this incident occurred.The police arrested Thomas Brown on June 5th and provided him with his rights, which he understood.(Taken from the facts the Crown read into the record on April 2, 2015, with some editing).[5]Mr. Brown accepted the facts and I found him guilty of causing a disturbance based on them.Discussion[6]Thomas Brown was born September 18, 1995 and is 19 years old. He lives with his parents, John and Rosalind Brown, in Fox Cove-Mortier, Newfoundland and Labrador. Mr. Brown is the youngest of the Browns’ four children; his siblings, three brothers, are 27, 26 and 21 years old respectively. The other Brown children are either employed or study in post-secondary institutions and live away from home.[7]Mr. Brown graduated high school in 2013 and completed a scaffolding course at the College of the North Atlantic in Burin, Newfoundland and Labrador. He hopes to get work as a scaffolder but currently works in the fishing industry with Ernest Grandy of Garnish, Newfoundland and Labrador. Mr. Grandy describes Mr. Brown as a “hard working conscientious employee”, from whom he “…has experienced no problems…in any regard” (Pre-sentence report dated May 15, 2015, page five).Mr. Brown has been involved in an intimate relationship with a girlfriend for a little more than a year.[8]Mr. Brown has a criminal record, but the four convictions on it occurred on July 16, 2014, about a month after the incident from which the present charge arises, although it relates to events that pre-date it. The Crown submitted this record, which Mr. Brown acknowledged:OffenceDate (s) of Conviction/OffenceDispositionTrafficking in controlled drug or substanceJuly 16/February 6, 20146 month conditional sentence; forfeiture; 12 months’probation; 10 year firearms prohibition; and $100 surcharge.Possessing controlled drug or substanceJuly 16/February 6, 201412 months’ probation (concurrent); forfeiture; 1-dayjail sentence (time served); and $100 surcharge.Having open liquor in a vehicleJuly 16/February 6, 2014$250 fine.TheftJuly 16/February 15, 2014Conditional discharge; 12 months’ probation(consecutive); and $100 surcharge.[9]I note that Mr. Brown, who is now on probation, was not on probation when he committed the present offence. The author of the pre-sentence report supervised Mr. Brown during the conditional sentence that he received on July 16, 2014. He summarized Mr. Brown’s response to the sentence in his report: “Throughout that period the accused was in full compliance and appeared to participate in supervision fully and respectfully. The accused accepted responsibility for his behavior, identified the contributing factors and placed what was believed to be considerable effort into changing his lifestyle” (Pre-sentence report, page five).[10]It appears from the pre-sentence report that Mr. Brown’s propensity to abuse alcohol and drugs contributed heavily to his criminal behavior and that his drive to satisfy his addictive tendencies has been, until now at least, a dominant aspect of his young life. The author of the report commented on the influence that intoxicants have on Mr. Brown, and how they became established in his life: “The issue of alcohol and drugs was discussed with the accused. His use of same began in high school and escalated over the years. The accused acknowledged that by the time he graduated from high school his drug and alcohol use was excessive and out of control. He declared he would consume alcohol and drugs everyday if it was available. He experimented with any drug that was available to him at the time. His use lead him to sell drugs in order to support his habit” (Pre-sentence report, page six).[11]Mr. Brown has, to his credit, taken steps to understand and control his alcohol and drug usage. As the author of the pre-sentence report notes: “Once apprehended for trafficking and possession he stated he began to change his lifestyle. Following being placed on a Conditional Sentence he joined Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous and continues to be a member of both groups” (Pre-sentence report, page six). Elsewhere, in the same report, he adds:“The accused appears to have done well in his efforts to abstain from any use of drugs and alcohol. At this point he is committed to his goal and seems to have insight in regards to what his risks and triggers are. It seems he has placed considerable effort in self-changing his lifestyle and takes pride in how he has a more positive outlook on family and life in general” (Pre-sentence report, page six).[12]The author of the report “…considered [Mr. Brown] a suitable candidate for further community supervision should the court choose to impose it” (Pre-sentence report, page seven). He based his opinion on several factors:Mr. Brown complied with past supervision orders and cooperated in their implementation; he acknowledged the criminal behavior that led to the present offence; he expressed remorse; and he declared his willingness to comply any conditions imposed on him (Pre-sentence report, page seven).The Crown notes the following aggravating factors:•Mr. Brown has a record; and, although the convictions do not pre-date this offence, the events from which they arose happened before the present offence.•The present offence appears to have arisen from a drug-related debt and two of Mr. Brown’s convictions are for drug offences.•The offences of which Mr. Brown was subsequently convicted were before the court pending disposition when he committed the present offence.•The present offence arose from a serious altercation; it involved weapons (though Mr. Brown does not appear to have been specifically associated with them) and resulted in serious personal injuries to several people; and it happened midday, on a public road in a quiet residential area.•Mr. Brown was acting uncontrollably at the time, outside his own manageable limits and beyond his parents’ control or general civil authority.[13]Mr. Brown acknowledges that most of those factors pertain. But he points, in mitigation, the following:•He is still a young man, and “technically” a first offender.•He graduated high school, acquired a trade and has worked in the fishing industry for the last five years.•He is an industrious worker and his fishing employer values his services.•He has been involved in an intimate relationship for more than a year with a girlfriend who is a positive influence in his life and has helped him deal with his misuse of alcohol and drugs.•He is a member of both Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous and is committed to abstaining from alcohol and drug use.•He is remorseful for what he did, he pled guilty early in these proceedings and he acknowledges he acted wrongly.•His parents support him and they are committed to his welfare but condemn his criminal behavior.•He complied with past court orders requiring supervision, he introduced meaningful changes to his lifestyle since he was arrested in June 2014 and he remains open to any interventions that may be required in the future.[14]The Crown and Mr. Brown addressed all of the factors that I should consider in sentencing him, with one exception: On June 4, 2014, Mr. Brown and his father, John Brown, appear to have provoked the confrontation between them and the Hilliers, whatever may have happened between the two groups the day before or on earlier occasions. Let me explain.[15]As I noted above (and quoted almost verbatim) Crown counsel read the facts into the record to support the charge against Mr. Brown and he accepted them. Included in the summary, and I quote this verbatim of what Crown counsel said, was the following:On the date in question, John Brown who is the father of the accused, and the accused, travelled to two separate cars towards Bryan Hillier’s house, following Bryan Hillier to, sorry, to Andrew Hillier’s residence, which is where the fight broke out.The officers in speaking with Thomas Brown advised that there was, that Bryan Hillier had threatened to kill him on the earlier date and as a result, he had told his father this, John Brown.John Brown, as a result of this threat to the accused, decided to go down to deal with the matter as he put it.[16]Thus, the Browns, John, the father and Thomas, the accused, deliberately sought out the Hilliers to “deal with” a threat the accused says one of the other four participants made to him on an earlier date. The accused acted in a deliberate and calculated manner that led inevitably to the disturbance that occurred and the serious consequences that resulted. That said, I note that I am sentencing Mr. Brown for the summary conviction offence of causing a disturbance and that the maximum punishment for the offence is as stated in s. 787 of the Criminal Code.[17]Overall, I find that an appropriate sentence for Mr. Brown is a fine of $750. While Mr. Brown was not working when the author of the pre-sentence report filed it, he is employable and he has a commendable work record, despite his relative youth. I allow Mr. Brown nine months from this date to pay the fine to this court. In addition, I direct Mr. Brown to pay a victim surcharge of $100, which he will pay when the fine is payable.[18]Finally, I order that Mr. Brown comply with the following terms and conditions of a probation order for two years from this date:1.The compulsory conditions of probation that appear in s. 732.1(2) of the Criminal Code, and as to s. 732.1(2)(a.1), he will abstain from communicating directly or indirectly with Bryan Hillier and/or Andrew Hillier.2.Report to a probation officeri.Within five working days, andii.Thereafter, when and in the manner directed by the probation officer.3.Remain within the jurisdiction of this Court unless written permission to go outside this jurisdiction is obtained from this Court or the probation officer.4.Abstain from consuming drugs except in accordance with a medical prescription, alcohol or any other intoxicating substance.5.Provide, for the purpose of analysis, a sample of a bodily substance prescribed by regulation on the demand of a peace officer, a probation officer or someone designated under s. 732.1(9) to make a demand, at the place and time and on the day specified by the person making the demand, if that person has reasonable grounds to believe that Thomas Brown has breached the condition of this order that requires him to abstain from consuming drugs, alcohol or any other intoxicating substance.6.Provide, for the purpose of analysis, a sample of a bodily substance prescribed by regulation at regular intervals that are specified by a probation officer in a notice in Form 51 to the Criminal Code.7.Abstain from owning, possessing or carrying a weapon.Summary and Disposition[19]Thomas Brown pled guilty to causing a disturbance and appeared before court for sentencing. The Court fined Mr. Brown $750 for the offence and ordered him to pay a $100 victim surcharge, both within nine months; and placed him on supervised probation for two years with stated conditions._____________________________Garrett H.

Miller, for the ApplicantRoyal Bank of CanadaDavid M. McNevin, for the Respondent JohnYates and for Debra Yates))HEARD:May 2, 2007REASONS FOR DECISIONCUMMING J.Background[1]The Applicants obtained an Order and Judgment in their favour July 14, 2006. The Applicant Royal Bank of Canada (“Bank”) later brought a motion for contempt. Following upon three days of hearing, Reasons for Decision were delivered April 2, 2007 with a finding that both the Respondent John Yates and his spouse, Debra Yates, knowingly and intentionally contravened the terms of, and were in contempt of, the Order of this Court dated July 14, 2006 (“July Order”): Royal Bank of Canada v. Yates Holdings Inc., [2007] O. J. No.1264 (S.C.J.).[2]A hearing in respect of sentencing was fixed for April 18, 2007 in the final paragraph of the April 2, 2007 Reasons for Decision. Mr. and Ms. Yates did not appear April 18, 2007. Judgment was given for costs in respect of the proceedings to date and the sentencing for contempt was rescheduled for May 2, 2007.[3]Mr. and Ms. Yates appeared with counsel at the sentencing hearing May 2, 2007. At the outset of the sentencing hearing a motion was made by Mr. and Ms. Yates pursuant to Rule 37.14 of the Rules of Civil Procedure for relief, inter alia, to set aside the Costs Judgment dated April 18, 2007.[4]Mr. and Yates were self-represented in the Court proceeding July 14, 2006 and in the contempt proceedings until the May 2, 2007 hearing on sentencing (although they were represented by counsel prior to the July 14, 2006 hearing who advised counsel for the Applicants July 13, 2006 that his instructions were to not attend the July 14 hearing of the Application, this being the same counsel who attended the hearing May 2, 2007).The Motion to Set Aside the Costs Award[5]The Reasons for Decision in respect of the motion for contempt were released April 2, 2007. The reasons for Decision were sent by mail on that date to Mr. and Ms. Yates. As stated above, a date of April 18, 2007 was set for sentencing.[6]Mr. Yates claims in his affidavit of May 1, 2007 that he did not attend at the post office and receive the April 2, 2007 Reasons for Decision until April 19, 2007. Hence, he says, he did not know of the April 18, 2007 hearing until after the event. He claims (para. 10 of his affidavit) that he expected to receive the Reasons for Decision by e-mail. There is added confusion on this point by an incorrect reference to delivery by e-mail made by counsel for the Bank in her e-mail to Mr. Yates April 20, 2007. There is further confusion caused by the Order dated April 18, 2007 (drafted by counsel for the Bank) ordering that the sentencing hearing be adjourned to May 2, 2007 and ordering that the Bank send certain materials to Mr. and Ms. Yates electronically.[7]Mr. and Ms. Yates were not sent the Reasons for Decision of April 2, 2007 by e-mail but rather, by regular mail. I have no recollection whatsoever of any arrangement to have the Reasons for Decision to be transmitted to the Yates by e-mail. Counsel for the Bank states that no such arrangement was given.(The only arrangement as to communication by e-mail was between counsel for the Bank and Mr. and Ms. Yates in respect of their communications.). No transcript was available at the hearing May 2, 2007.[8]Given these unfortunate circumstances it was appropriate and fair to allow Mr. and Ms. Yates, through their counsel, to make submissions on the merits of the costs award April 18, 2007and to consider the disposition of costs anew, but without setting aside the costs award pending such reconsideration.[9]The inference reasonably made from the entirety of the evidentiary record in the proceedings at hand is that Mr. and Ms. Yates have attempted to avoid the Bank’s realization as a creditor of Mr. Yates by shifting assets into the name of Ms. Yates and hiding assets.[10]Because the contempt proceeding is against both Mr. and Ms. Yates it is apparent that the assets of Ms. Yates are subject to any judgment in respect of costs[11]The Bill of Costs submitted by the Bank on a full indemnity basis totals $91,620.92. Mr. and Ms. Yates submit that costs in the magnitude of $10,000.00 to $15,000.00 would be appropriate. The quantity of costs awarded is the main issue raised by counsel for Mr. and Ms. Yates May 2, 2007, in respect of the Bank’s motion for costs. Their counsel does not dispute that a costs judgment should be on a basis of joint and several liability in respect of Mr. and Ms. Yates.[12]In my view, and I so find, the Bill of Costs for $91,620.92 is fair and reasonable considering all the circumstances. A great deal of work was required of the Bank’s counsel in the course of bringing the motion for contempt and the hearing thereof.[13]It was made known to Mr. and Ms. Yates throughout the hearing October 11, November 28 and December 11, 2006 that the Bank would be seeking costs if ultimately successful.[14]The Bank has been billed for, and paid, the amount in question to its counsel. It is appropriate and fair that the Bank be awarded costs on a ‘full indemnity’ basis. The Bank should not be out-of-pocket for legal costs incurred and necessitated because of the contempt of Mr. and Ms. Yates in respect of the July Order.[15]Costs should normally follow the event, and in the circumstances of the matter at hand, on a full indemnity basis. Given the finding of contempt, the award of costs on a full indemnity basis is an appropriate and logical consequential result.[16]In my view, and I so find, costs are properly awarded to the Bank in the claimed amount of $91,620.92. I confirm the costs award of April 18, 2007 in this amount. The judgment for costs, confirmed hereby, is applicable nunc pro tunc and the Costs Judgment of April 18, 2007 entered in this Court remains in full force and effect.The Sentence for Contempt[17]My Reasons for Decision dated April 2, 2007, set forth in detail the nature of the contempt of Mr. and Ms. Yates.I have set forth at length elsewhere the principles to consider in dealing with a motion for contempt and in sentencing for contempt: see Sussex Group Ltd. v. 3933938 Canada Inc., 2003 CarswellOnt 2789 (Ont. S.C.J.); Sussex Group Ltd. v. 3933938 Canada Inc., 2003 CarswellOnt 2908 (Ont. S.C.J.); and Sussex Group Ltd. v. Sylvester, 2002 CarswellOnt 3893 (Ont. S.C.J.).[18]In my Reasons for Decision dated April 2, 2007 I set forth my reasons why I did not think imprisonment, requested by the Bank, would be an appropriate sanction in the situation at hand. The Bank now asks that a fine of $50,000.00 be imposed upon Mr. and Ms. Yates with the fine to be paid to the Bank.[19]In my view, a fine of $5,000.00 upon each of Mr. and Ms. Yates is a fit and appropriate sentence in the case at hand. These fines appropriately meet the objectives of specific and general deterrence, punishment and rehabilitation. The fines are properly payable to the Provincial Treasurer and not to the Bank. I also order and declare that pursuant to s. 178 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the fines shall survive any subsequent bankruptcy and discharge from bankruptcy of John Yates and Debra Yates.[20]Judgment will issue in accordance with these Reasons for Decision.___________________________CUMMING J.Released:June 26, 2007COURT FILE NO.:04-CL-5654DATE:20070626ONTARIOSUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICEB E T W E E N:ROYAL BANK OF CANADA andPRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS INC. in its capacity as Receiver of the property,assets and undertaking of Yates Holdings Inc.Applicants- and -YATES HOLDINGS INC., YATES FAMILY BUSINESS TRUST, JB FOODSERVICES INC. and JOHN YATESRespondentsREASONS FORDECISIONCUMMING J.Released:June 26, 2007"}

Hansen, 2005 NWTSC 65Date: 20050729Docket: S-1-CR-2004000076IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIESIN THE MATTER OF:HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN- and -JEREMY RYAN HANSENTranscript of the Oral Reasons for Sentence by the Honourable Justice J.E. Richard, sitting at Inuvik, in the Northwest Territories, on July 19th, A.D. 2005.APPEARANCES:Mr. B. Lepage:Counsel for the CrownMr. J. MacFarlane:Counsel for the Accused(Charge under s. 5(4) CDSA)THE COURT:Jeremy Ryan Hansen now pleads guilty to trafficking in marijuana contrary to section 5(4) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. His crime consists of participation in the transport of a quantity of marijuana from Edmonton, Alberta to Inuvik for purposes of resale here in Inuvik and in the Delta region in September, 2003.The RCMP in Inuvik acted on a tip and were able to seize the marijuana shortly after its arrival in Inuvik. This offender, Jeremy Hansen, was arrested. He gave a voluntary statement to the police in which he admitted that he agreed to receive the marijuana and to sell it in order to make money. He was hoping to make 1,000 to $5,000, which he said he intended to put into a special savings account for his young son.In his statement to police he said he expected that the unnamed supplier down south would send him one or two pounds of marijuana and that he was to pay a local drug dealer, Norman Walper, for it. What was shipped to him, however, was close to eight pounds of marijuana, or just under three kilograms. In September, 2003 that amount of marijuana would have a value at the dealer’s level of approximately $28,000 here in Inuvik.[Page 1]I am satisfied from my review of the voir dire evidence earlier this year that Jeremy Hansen was, indeed, taken in or taken advantage of by Norman Walper and/or others on the issue of the amount of marijuana they were going to transport into Inuvik with Jeremy Hansen’s involvement and participation. One of the lessons that I am sure Jeremy Hansen has learned from this experience is that you cannot trust anyone in the drug business.But Jeremy Hansen was no innocent dupe. Just as the other drug dealers took advantage of him, he himself took advantage of his employer, Northwest Transport, and his boss, Robin McConville, by using his employer’s business and his employment benefits of free freight privileges to bring what he knew to be illicit marijuana into Inuvik in a company truck with his boss’s permission.He admitted to the police that he used to sell joints when he was in high school and he did that then in order to have access to marijuana for his own use, but he said he stopped selling in high school when his mother told him the police were on to him and he got scared. But in September, 2003 he was given the opportunity to get involved in larger transactions which would[Page 2]see him make profits of up to $5,000, and he thought about it, he said, and he thought about it and he decided to do it, knowing the risks. As he said to the police, “You can’t get anywhere without taking chances.” So Jeremy Hansen took his chances and now he has had this serious charge hanging over his head for about two years and now today he has to pay the price.This young man has no criminal record. He is of Inuvialuit descent, born and raised here in Inuvik, 20 years old at the time of committing this offence in September, ‘03. He is a high school graduate and has maintained steady employment since leaving high school. He is married with a young child, owns his own home, makes the mortgage payments.His family and his in-laws, I am told, are supportive of him. His present employer and even his previous employer, Mr. McConville, whom he took advantage of, speak positively of him and of his work ethic. Upon his arrest, he was cooperative with the police and readily accepted responsibility for his role in this crime and stated that he was prepared to accept the consequences, including jail time.He exercised his right to a Preliminary Inquiry and he also exercised his right to[Page 3]challenge the validity of the RCMP seizure of the drugs and to challenge the admissibility of his statement to police. When these rulings went against him, he then indicated his intention to plead guilty.It cannot be said that his guilty plea yesterday is an early guilty plea or a guilty plea at the first opportunity, coming, as it does, some 22 months after he was charged. But I am satisfied that his apology to his family, to Mr. McConville, to the community and to the Court is genuine and that he is sincere in his acknowledgement of his own wrongdoing, of his taking responsibility for making a wrong decision. I have the clear sense that we will not see Mr. Jeremy Hansen in court again in the future.The maximum sentence for this crime is five years’ imprisonment.There are two aggravating features or circumstances. Firstly, there is the large amount of marijuana that was transported (and therefore trafficked) with his direct involvement. Secondly, there is the fact that in committing the crime he took advantage of his employer, in particular Mr. McConville, and got his employer involved or implicated in this[Page 4]illegal scheme.There are strong mitigating factors that must act to soften the sentence to be imposed. He is a youthful and a first-time offender. It appears he is otherwise of good character and he has the support of his family and others in the community. He maintains steady employment and provides for his wife and child. He accepts full responsibility for his wrongdoing and has already begun to rehabilitate himself.Taking into consideration all of these circumstances, in my view an appropriate sentence in this case is a sentence of 12 months.Through his defence counsel, the offender seeks a conditional sentence; that is, that he be allowed to serve his sentence in this community rather than in a jail cell in Yellowknife or Hay River.After much deliberation, I have decided that the prerequisites in section 742.1 for the granting of a conditional sentence are present in this case.There is no statutorily prescribed minimum sentence for this crime. The sentence to be imposed is less than two years’ imprisonment. Allowing this non-violent, first-time, youthful and remorseful offender to serve his sentence in[Page 5]the community would not endanger the community.Would a conditional sentence be consistent with the fundamental purposes and principles and objectives of sentencing? In my view, it would be consistent with the principle in section 718.2 that actual incarceration be imposed as a sanction of last resort only when other sanctions are not available or appropriate. In my view, a conditional sentence in this particular case would not offend the principles of parity or proportionality, because I view this case as rather unique. That is, I am unaware of a case of a similar offence and similar offender with the particular circumstances here and this offender’s particular degree of culpability or moral responsibility.The Crown, not unexpectedly, expresses a concern that a conditional sentence would not be consistent with the principle of general deterrence. But the Supreme Court of Canada stated in the Proulx decision that a carefully crafted conditional sentence can, indeed, reflect denunciation and deterrence.In my view, there will be a deterrent and denunciatory effect of a conditional sentence with strict conditions, such as a curfew or house arrest in a small community like Inuvik where the[Page 6]offender is well-known and where the sentence can be under the close scrutiny of a supervisor and, if necessary, the police. So although, as I say, it is not without some careful deliberation, that I have decided that in the particular circumstances, perhaps unusual circumstances of this case, and in the observations and conclusions I have drawn about the sincerity of this offender’s acknowledgement of wrongdoing that I will exercise my discretion by allowing him to serve his sentence in the community of Inuvik rather than in a correctional centre in Yellowknife or Hay River.Please stand, Mr. Hansen. Jeremy Hansen, for the crime that you have committed, it is the sentence of this Court that you serve a sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment. Pursuant to section 742.1 the sentence will be served in the community pursuant to the following conditions: You will keep the peace and be of good behaviour. You will appear before this Court when required to do so. You will report to a supervisor within two working days and thereafter as required by the supervisor. You will remain within the Northwest Territories unless written perrni3sion to go outside the jurisdiction is obtained from the Court or the supervisor. You will notify the[Page 7]supervisor in advance of any change of name or address and promptly notify the supervisor of any change of employment or occupation.You will perform 200 hours of community service work, 100 hours in each of the first and second six months of your sentence as directed by the supervisor, including participation in talks or counselling sessions for young persons as directed by your supervisor.You will be subject to a curfew at your place of residence. Can I have the residence, street address, please?MR. MacFARLANE:33 Kingmingya, sir.THE COURT:33 Kingmingya, from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. every day. The only exceptions will be for medical or other emergencies for yourself or your immediate family and with the express permission of the supervisor. You will not be in possession of illegal drugs at any time and you will attend whatever counselling, therapy or rehabilitation sessions as directed by your supervisor.There will be a victim fine surcharge of $100 to be paid within seven days.Mr. Hansen, I am going to ask your lawyer, Mr. MacFarlane, to explain to you after court, explain to you carefully the consequences to you[Page 8]of any breach of any one of these conditions during the 12-month sentence, because there are serious consequences.I want you to remain here after court until you have received a copy of the order and until the Clerk, with the assistance of Mr. MacFarlane, has explained to you in particular the provisions of section 742.4 and 742.6 of the Criminal Code.Now, Mr. Hansen, some people will say that I have been too lenient with you for the serious crime that you have committed, but I am satisfied you have already learned from your mistake, and also that a 12-month curfew in this small town will not be easy - so don’t let me down, don’t let your family down again, and show your community that you have learned from your mistake. Good luck to you.Certified to be a true and accurate transcript pursuant to Rules 723 and 724 of the Supreme Court Rules.Jill MacDonald, CSR(A), RPRCourt Reporter[Page 9]"}

(Orally)[1]Murray Joseph Quewezance appeared before Andrychuck P.C.J. at Yorkton on February 7, 2001.On that day he was facing a charge of stealing a vehicle contrary to s. 334(a) of the Criminal Code.He pled guilty to this offence.[2]In addition to this charge, by stealing a vehicle, Mr. Quewezance breached a previously imposed conditional sentence.On December 18, 2000, Bobowski P.C.J. had sentenced him to an 18-month conditional sentence on five charges:notably, two charges of breaking and entering contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code; two counts of failing without reasonable excuse to comply with a condition that he report to the R.C.M.P., contrary to s. 145(3) of the Criminal Code; and one count of failing, without lawful excuse, to comply with a condition compelling him to refrain from using, possessing or consuming alcohol, contrary to s. 145(3) of the Criminal Code.[3]With respect to the breaches of the conditional sentence imposed by Bobowski P.C.J., Andrychuk P.C.J., pursuant to the powers contained in s. 742.6(9) of the Criminal Code, terminated the conditional sentence order and committed Mr. Quewezance to custody until the expiration of the sentence.[4]With respect to the new charge of stealing a vehicle, Andrychuk P.C.J. imposed a six-month sentence to be served concurrently with the terminated conditional sentence order.[5]Mr. Quewezance appeals from these two decisions.The result of the two decisions is that he is required to serve what amounts to approximately 17 months in custody.[6]On the hearing of the appeal, Mr. Quewezance, who is nineteen years old, represented himself with the assistance of his father.His father filed letters of support from the Chief of his band and a teacher who are prepared to work with Mr. Quewezance.The Chief of the band indicated that he was not only prepared to assist Mr. Quewezance in overcoming his problem drinking, but was prepared to employ him and, in essence, to play an active role in supervising his conduct.[7]While we are not prepared to say the decisions under appeal were unfit, it appears to us that Mr. Quewzance is making some progress and that, in the circumstances, we should make certain modifications to encourage him, his family, and his band in their rehabilitation efforts.[8]Hence, we decided to allow the appeal in part by setting aside the decision to terminate the conditional sentence order in its entirety, and making this order.We order that the offender serve 10 months of the unexpired conditional sentence in custody and that the conditional sentence order resume on the offender’s release from custody. The six-month term of imprisonment for stealing the vehicle which commenced on February 7, 2001 will continue to run concurrently with the conditional sentence order.[9]In the result, Mr. Quewezance will serve the six months for stealing the vehicle, and four months for the breach of the conditional sentence.The appeal is allowed to this extent."}

In doing so I will refer to the facts as found by the jury, the victim impact statement, pre-sentence report information, sentencing principles and authorities, submissions of counsel.[2]First of all, in considering the facts as found by the jury none of us were in the jury room so none of us know exactly what it is that the jury has found. However, instruction is given under s. 724 of the Criminal Code related to sentencing for offences and s. 724(2) particularly applies where a jury has convicted an accused. Section 724(1) indicates that,“In determining a sentence, a court may accept as proved any information disclosed at the trial or at the sentencing proceedings and any facts agreed on by the prosecutor and the offender.”Subsection (2) which relates to jury findings,“Where the court is composed of a judge and jury, the court(a) shall accept as proven all facts, express or implied, that are essential to the jury’s verdict of guilty; and(b) may find any other relevant fact that was disclosed by evidence at the trial to be proven, or hear evidence presented by either party with respect to that fact.”[3]Based upon the evidence presented, I am satisfied that the following facts relevant to sentencing in this case have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt1. between June and July 31, 2002, L.R., then 6 years of age, was sleeping over with her grandmother and step-grandfather, the accused, at their home in [name of town omitted];2. that L.R. was sleeping in her grandparents’ bed in the bedroom;3. that during the night L.R. awoke when the accused put his hand under her pyjama pants and her underwear and touched her between her legs in her vaginal area; and4. there is one incident only complained of and there is no proof that there was any actual penetration into the vagina. The complainant referred to the accused moving his hand around between her legs. While there was medical evidence indicating possible penetration at some point in time, I am not satisfied that penetration was proven in this case beyond a reasonable doubt.The Victim Impact Statement[4]As previously stated, the accused and his wife were caring for their then 6 year-old granddaughter L.R. at that particular time. L.R., now 8 years of age, has provided some information to the victim services worker who has provided a victim impact statement. Some of that statement relates to what L.R. had to say and some relates to what her mother indicated to the victim services worker. I am satisfied from reading the victim impact statement that L.R. is a troubled young child. I do question whether or not this offence of itself is the sole cause of all of her problems but, for sure, what L.M.B. did to L.R. has not helped her and will not help her in the future. L.R. has expressed problems in her sleeping, this was confirmed by her mother, and she has expressed fear and sadness over this particular offence. Obviously the offence has had some negative impact upon her.Facts Relevant To Sentencing And The Pre-sentence Report[5]The accused is presently 48 years of age and he is the eldest of four children. From my reading of the pre-sentence report and the history given to the Adult Probation Officer who prepared the report, the accused had a positive family upbringing, although he did report that he was a victim of abuse as a child by a non-family member. It appears that he is now close to some of his family and not so close to others.[6]L.M.B. was previously married and has two daughters who are now 23 and 18 years of age. That marriage ended in the early 1990’s after the accused was charged and convicted of sexual assaults on his oldest daughter and his niece.[7]Subsequently L.M.B. had a common-law relationship in 1994-1996. After that time, he met his present wife and they were married in April 2000. I note from the presentence report that his wife remains supportive of him although this has caused and meant estrangement from many of her own family members, including from her granddaughter, L.R. I should also note that Mrs. L.M.B. testified at the trial in support of L.M.B. and it is obvious that her evidence was not accepted by the jury.[8]The accused has a prior criminal record dating back to 1975 including the convictions for sexual assault as were previously referred to. The other offences are not related and are property offences involving break and enter and thefts.[9]While incarcerated the accused did have an opportunity to attend a program for sexual offenders in 1993. Having completed the first level of that particular course, he was assessed as requiring more intervention at that time.[10]L.M.B. appears to have had a drug problem for some time and continues to have a drug problem to this day. He is presently unemployed and living on social assistance. This is mainly due, as I understand it, due to health issues, none of which are life-threatening and include problems involving high blood pressure, anxiety, osteoarthritis and the prostate.[11]I also note that L.M.B. has a Level II ARE education which was obtained when he was incarcerated on the last occasion in relation to the sexual assault offences. He also has completed cooking and carpentry courses but, as I have said, due to apparent health issues he is not presently employed.[12]The pre-sentence report also refers to the accused’s attitude towards this particular offence. I agree with the author of the presentence report that L.M.B.’s attitude is problematic. L.M.B. continues to deny commission of this offence and in fact blames legal authorities for “a set-up”. He expresses no indication of remorse and, more significantly, he expresses no empathy for L.R. He also has indicated in the pre-sentence report that he would refuse to voluntarily attend a sex offender program and would only entertain attendance in a substance abuse program if in fact he were to receive a communitybased sentence. This is reflective of an attitude that, as I said above, is problematic.Sentencing Principles And Analysis[13]While not at the higher end of the scale of seriousness for sexual offences, this offence nonetheless is a serious one as it involves an assault on a young child who was in the care of the accused and her grandmother at the time and it is a repeat of sexual deviance as towards innocent children.[14]In determining an appropriate sentence, I must take into consideration a number of factors. Section 718 of the Criminal Code of Canada sets out the purpose and principles of sentencing. In considering the principles of sentence, I must be mindful of the maximum term of imprisonment that is mandated by the Legislature or by the Parliament in this case. In this case the maximum sentence is ten years’ imprisonment. I must also bear in mind the purpose of any sentence as set out under s. 718, that purpose being the need to contribute to the maintenance and respect for the law and for a just and peaceful society. There are certain objectives which are tied to this. These include a need to denounce unlawful conduct, to deter offenders and others of similar mind, to separate offenders from society where it is necessary to do so, to assist in the offender’s rehabilitation, to provide reparation to victims and, finally, to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledge the harm done to the community and to victims.[15]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code requires that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. As I said earlier, this offence is obviously a very serious one. Section 718.2 of the Criminal Code discusses certain aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Most relevant here is the aggravating nature of the abuse in the position of trust or authority as related to the victim.[16]Consideration of such factors as uniformity in sentencing and less restrictive sanctions appropriate in the circumstances of the offence is also mandated by this section of the Criminal Code.[17]From the case law it is clear that deterrence and denunciation are the primary considerations in sentencing in relation to sexual offences. That is not to say that the principle of rehabilitation is to be forgotten, far from it. However, the primary focus of the Court has to be on deterrence and denunciation.[18]Any reference to sentencing case law for an offence such as the one committed by the accused in this case should start with a review of the relevant factors set out in R. v. Atkins (K.J.) (1988), 1988 CanLII 201 (NL CA), 69 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 99; 211 A.P.R. 99 (Nfld. C.A.). These factors are as follows:1. the extent of the assault;2. the degree of violence or force used;3. the impact on the victim, her family and the offender;4. the degree of trust involved;5. public abhorrence to the offence charged;6. the attitude of the offender to what he has done;7. the accused’s plea;8. any biological or psychiatric factors present;9. the need for specific and general deterrence;10. the possibility of rehabilitation;11. the accused’s age and antecedents;12. pre-trial custody, if any; and13. other sentences imposed by courts for similar behaviour.[19]As well, in the Atkins case it was stated that vengeance is not a factor to be considered no matter how abhorrent the offence. In other words, when sentencing the accused, it is not out of emotion, it is not out of trying to reap vengeance on the accused but rather to impose a reasonable and proper sentence considering all of the circumstances of the case.[20]Of specific importance to this offender is his prior criminal record, particularly as related to the prior convictions for sexual assault on his oldest daughter and his niece.[21]I will now consider all of these factors:1. Extent of the assaultAs indicated earlier, the sexual assault itself is not on the highest end of the scale of seriousness for such offences. That being said, the offence remains serious. This sexual assault involved the touching of this child’s genital area under her clothing on one occasion. The child was placed in his and his wife’s care. The offence occurred during the nighttime when the accused’s wife was present in the same bed and was asleep with the child. As such, it can be seen as a brazen act on the part of an obviously devious individual. It is also not the first time that the accused has engaged in this type of illegal activity involving young children.2. Degree of violence or force usedHere there is no evidence of physical violence or physical force being used.3. Impact on the victim, her family and the offenderClearly this offence has not helped in this child’s development. The loss of the child’s relationship with her grandmother may also be significant for L.R. As for the offender himself, aside from the public shame placed on him for the offence by the community in which he lives, there is no real impact on him as he fails to accept any responsibility for his actions.4. Degree of trust involvedAs alluded to earlier, there is a significant breach of trust involved in this case. The accused and his wife were trusted to protect this child and this they did not do [so].5. Public abhorrenceDenunciation of such behaviour is one of the primary principles to consider in cases involving sexual assault, particularly sexual assault wherein young children are the victims. Rightly so, the public is abhorred by such behaviour and quite reasonably expect the courts to respond in a manner that reflects the public’s disdain for such activity.6. Attitude of the offenderIn this case the accused continues to deny he committed the offence. A jury has found otherwise in what was a fair trial. The accused places blame on the legal authorities using such terminology as a “set-up” instead of displaying any sign of remorse or empathy towards the victim.7. Accused’s pleaHere the accused has pleaded not guilty. This was his right to do so. While a guilty plea can be considered as a mitigating factor in sentence, a not guilty plea cannot be said to be an aggravating factor. While a lack of responsibility by an offender after conviction may have a negative impact on sentence, I do not accept that the same can be said for a not guilty plea.8. Biological or psychiatric factorsIn this case there is no evidence of either a biological or psychiatric factor related to this offence or this offender. While the accused may well have been abused as a child, this does not provide any form of justification for this offence.9. Need for specific and general deterrenceAgain, as stated earlier, deterrence, both general and specific, are primary considerations in sentencing for an offence of this nature. The public must be assured that behaviour such as that found by the jury in this case will not go unpunished. As well, when a person has previously been convicted for offences of a similar nature, as is the case here, specific deterrence is that much more in issue.10. Possibility of rehabilitationRehabilitation prospects are never to be lost sight of in sentencing. While difficult to predict, some hope of rehabilitation of an accused person must be recognized. In this case the accused has repeated sexually deviant behaviour. I cannot be overly optimistic about his rehabilitation; particularly in view of the lack of remorse and the lack of acceptance of responsibility for this particular offence.11. Accused’s age and antecedentsThese have been previously referred to. The accused is obviously a middle-aged man who unfortunately has some non-life-threatening medical problems. He uses drugs and even though they were not involved in this particular offence, alleged drug use remains a serious problem for him. His lack of ability to accept counselling and treatment for his sexually deviant behaviour and drug problems is a further cause for concern.12. Pre-trial custodyThere was no pre-trial custody in this case that I am aware of. However, the fact that the accused has been in custody since his conviction on June 26th, a period of some 24 days, is a matter that I will consider in relation to the total sentence that I will impose.13. Other sentences imposed for similar behaviourBoth the Crown and defence counsel have put forward cases outlining a range of sentence for offences involving sexual assault on young children. None of these cases are exactly on point. In most cases, the nature of the sexual assault itself or the specific antecedents of a particular accused are different. As a result it is very difficult to find a case that would be totally similar to the one at hand. I have reviewed the cases provided by counsel, as well as a few others that I am aware of myself, in determining what I consider to be an appropriate sentence.[22]Although I have referred to the accused’s prior record, I wish to add something concerning this. Any sentence that I impose this afternoon must be proportionate to the criminal behaviour being punished. The existence of a criminal record, even if for similar offences, does not permit a sentencing judge to impose a sentence that is outside what is reasonable for the offence itself. In other words, I cannot sentence the accused for his prior criminal actions for a second time. Criminal behaviour generally results in punishment based upon a range of sentence. The existence of a prior criminal record can be reflected in movement towards the higher end of the range of sentence appropriate for the criminal behaviour being punished.[23]This has perhaps been better expressed by Steele, J.A., in the decision of R. v. H.J.P. (1995), 1995 CanLII 9875 (NL CA), 133 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 20; 413 A.P.R. 20 (Nfld. C.A.), where at paragraph 21 he stated as follows:“I understand the position to be simply this: a fit sentence anticipates punishment commensurate to the seriousness of the offence, to be determined, firstly, by recourse to the appropriate ‘range of sentence’ and, secondly, attuned by heedful reference to the generally accepted principles of sentencing. If the offender has a criminal record, particularly for offences that are the same or similar as the offence for which he is again to be sentenced, reasons for leniency ordinarily applicable (e.g. youth, guilty plea, rehabilitation possibilities, and the like) fade and vanish, the recidivist having forfeited prospects for compassion, the emphasis shifting more to the primary objective of protecting society. A criminal record will frequently invite a more stringent punishment, not because of the criminal record per se, but to re-enforce the deterrent factor, it being apparent that previous discipline and penalties failed. That being said, the proportionality principle - that the sentence be proportionate to the crime - still prevails, if for no reason other than it is essentially fair. In truth, it is assumed that the so called “range of sentence” and “fitness of sentence” are sufficiently adaptable and flexible in scope to permit, even encourage, sentences that will adequately protect the general public from repeat offenders who have become a menace to society.”[24]No matter how I may personally feel about the offence and the offender in this particular case, as a sentencing judge I must apply the principles of sentence in the manner prescribed by our law. These principles must be accepted as a reflection of the values of our society and as a judge, I must attempt to apply them to the best of my ability taking into account all of the circumstances of the particular case.Crown And Defence Counsels’ Positions[25]Crown counsel has suggested a sentence of between 16 and 30 months as being appropriate in this particular case. Crown counsel is also of the view that this sentence should not be served in the community pursuant to s. 742 of the Criminal Code of Canada.[26]Defence counsel has suggested a sentence in the range of one to eight months. In this case, defence counsel is suggesting that as the offence is at the lower end of the scale, a structured sentence, even one to be served in the community, is one that would be acceptable in the circumstances of this case.Accused’s Sentence[27]Having taken into account everything that I have just previously referred to, I feel that an appropriate sentence for the accused in this case is a period of ten months’ incarceration followed by a period of supervised probation for three years. Having considered the possibility of a sentence under s. 742 of the Code, specifically using the approach set out in R. v. Proulx (J.K.D.) (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 249 N.R. 201; 142 Man.R.(2d) 161; 212 W.A.C. 161; 140 C.C.C.(3d) 449 (S.C.C.), I am not satisfied that a sentence to be served in the community is appropriate in these circumstances. As well, I have also factored into this sentence that the accused has been in custody for 24 days, which basically I have given him two months’ credit for. In other words, absent any pre-sentence custody, I would have sentenced the accused to a period of twelve months’ imprisonment.[28]The accused will also be placed on supervised probation for a period of three years upon the following terms and conditions:1. keep the peace and be of good behaviour;2. report to the court as and when required to do so by the court;3. report to the Adult Probation Officer as and when required;4. participate and co-operate in all counselling or treatment recommended or arranged by the Adult Probation Officer;5. not to be in the presence of any person under the age of 16 years unless accompanied continuously by another adult person who is over 21 years of age;6. have no contact or communication of any kind, direct or indirect, with L.R. and her immediate family;7. abstain absolutely from the possession, consumption or use of any alcoholic beverages and non-prescription drugs.[29]As well, pursuant to the provisions under s. 161 of the Criminal Code of Canada the accused will be prohibited from(a) attending at any public park or public swimming area where persons under the age of fourteen years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, or a daycare centre, schoolground, playground or community centre;(b) seeking, obtaining or continuing any employment, whether or not the employment is remunerated, or becoming or being a volunteer in a capacity, that involves being in a position of trust or authority towards persons under the age of fourteen years; or(c) using a computer system within the meaning of section 342.1(2) of the Criminal Code for the purpose of communicating with a person under the age of 14 years.The duration of this order will be for life.[30]As s. 271 of the Criminal Code is a primary designated offence, s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code applies and an order is hereby granted permitting the taking of bodily substances for DNA analysis in accordance with that section.[31]In view of the accused’s present financial circumstances, a victim fine surcharge will be waived.[32]Pursuant to the mandatory provisions under s. 109 of the Criminal Code of Canada, the accused is prohibited from having in his possession any firearm, ammunition or explosive substance, cross-bow, etc., any of those things that are referred to in s. 109 of the Criminal Code for life.[33]L.M.B., your sentence is 10 months plus 3 years’ probation. As I say, your attitude displayed in the pre-sentence report is problematic. My only hope is that somehow, someway, you will refrain from any conduct of this nature in the future. Failure to do so will not only be detrimental to the victim and society generally, but will also lead to future significant curtailment of your liberty.[34]The clerk will advise you concerning the provisions related to what would occur in relation to a breach of probation or alternatively to apply for an amendment of a probation order. The s. 161(2) order will also be explained to you together with the possible repercussions if you fail to abide by that order. Accused sentenced."}

Rogozinski ….......................................................................for the CrownL. Galway................................................................................for the AccusedBARNES J.:Introduction[1] R. W. is a young person within the meaning of the Youth Criminal Justice Act. He pleaded guilty to the following offences:a)On or about the6th day ofFebruary, 2009, he unlawfully did have in his possession a loaded prohibited firearm, to wit: a hand gun without an authorization or licence to have the said firearm and without a registration certificate for the said firearm, contrary to the Criminal Code;b)On or about the 6th day of February, 2009, did have in his possession a firearm while he was prohibited from doing so by reason of an order made pursuant to section 51(1) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) at Oshawa on December 12th 2007;c)On or about the 6th day of February, 2009, while at large on a recognizance entered into before a justice and being bound to comply with a condition of that recognizance directed by the said justice fail without lawful excuse to abide with that condition, to wit: remain in your residence daily at all times except for employment purposes, medical emergencies, educational matters, court related matters, counsel matters or in the presence of your Children’s Aid Society Worker; or an adult approved of in writing by the Children’s Aid Society Worker dated and signed;d)On or about the 6th day of February, 2009, did carry a concealed weapon without being a holder of a permit authorization such possession;All offences occurred in the City of Toronto.Facts[2] At approximately 10.40 p.m.On June 30, 2008, members of the Toronto Police Anti-violence Intervention Strategy (T.A.V.I.S.) were patrolling some side streets in the city of Toronto. The officers observed R.W. and another young person on one of the side streets in the neighbourhood.R.W. was holding onto his waist area in a manner consistent with a person in possession of a firearm. The police approached the pair who then ran.[3] As R.W. fled he kept holding onto his waist area. The pair was apprehended by the police.R.W.’s companion apologized to the police and informed them that R.W. was in possession of a firearm.R.W. was in possession of a firearm with one bullet in the firing chamber and three bullets in the bullet chamber. This weapon was in the “ready to fire” mode.[4] At the time of these offences R.W. was on a judicial interim release stemming from an arrest on November 20, 2008, for Break and Enter. R.W. has no licence, permit or other authorization which permits him to legally possess the firearm.Mitigating Factors[5] These mitigating factors can be gleaned from the circumstances of theR.W. and circumstances of the offence:a)R.W. has pleaded guilty. He has accepted responsibility for the offence.b)By pleading guilty R.W. has saved the time and resources required to conduct a trial in this matter.c)R.W. has been in secure custody for seven and a half months awaiting the disposition of this matter. During that time he has been transferred to six different detention centres.d)Defence counsel’s assertion that conditions in some of these detention centres were poor, specifically the Hamilton Facility, and rampant with physical altercations, specifically the Roy McMurtry Centre,was unchallenged and therefore accepted for the purpose of sentencing as a mitigating factor.e)R.W. has made significant progress in his rehabilitation during his stay in secure detention. Reports from the Roy McMurtry Detention Centre indicate that R.W. “completes all his routines without any issue and participates well in activities both in the unit and at recreation....has been a positive youth on the unit...and has been working on assignments for school.....was a positive role model towards his peers......”f)During his time in detention R.W. has had no contact with his family. Distance from the detention facility has been a factor.g)R.W. was found in possession of a loaded firearm at a time of day when the area where he was located was thankfully devoid of any human traffic.h)At the time of the offence R.W. was not engaged in any threatening behaviour with the firearm.[6] These aggravating factors can be gleaned from the circumstances of the R. W. and the circumstances of the offence:a)R.W. has a criminal record with convictions spanning the period from April 2006 to September 2009. He has two convictions each for Assault and for Failing to Attend Court. One conviction each for Failing to Comply with a Youth Criminal Justice Act disposition, Escape Lawful Custody, Uttering Threats, Obstruct Peace Officer, Break and Enter and Theft Under.b)At the time of these offences R.W. was bound by a 2 year weapons prohibition issued pursuant to section 51(1) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act.c)R.W. was in possession of a loaded firearm in a public area, specifically a residential area. The risk of danger to R.W. and the public is obvious.d)R.W. fled from the police with a loaded firearm placed in his waist area increasing the risk of danger to himself and the public.e)At the time of these offences R.W. was bound by a recognizance which prohibited him from possessing a firearm.What is the maximum sentence available?[7] On September 9, 2009, R.W. was convicted and sentenced for Break and Enter and Theft Under. He received a custodial sentence and twelve months probation. The offence date for that offence is November 20, 2008.[8] Counsel jointly submitted that the maximum sentence that this Court can impose is two years. Had R.W. pleaded guilty to the November 2008 offences and the February 6, 2009 offences, before the same judge on the same day then pursuant to section 42(15) of the YCJA, the maximum sentence thatcould be imposed for both sentences would be one of three years.Section 42 (15):Subject to subsection (16), if more than one youth sentence is imposed under this section in respect of a young person with respect to different offences, the continuous combined duration of those youth sentences shall not exceed three years, except if one of the offences is first degree murder or second degree murder within the meaning of section 231 of the Criminal Code, in which case the continuous combined duration of those youth sentences shall not exceed ten years in the case of first degree murder, or seven years in the case of second degree murder.[9] Section 42(16) of the YCJA deals with the duration of youth sentences made at different times:Section 42(16) If a youth sentence is imposed in respect of an offence committed by a young person after the commencement of, but before the completion of, any youth sentences imposed on the young person,(a) the duration of the sentence imposed in respect of the subsequent offence shall be determined in accordance with subsections (14) and (15);(b) the sentence may be served consecutively to the sentences imposed in respect of the previous offences; and(c) the combined duration of all the sentences may exceed three years and, if the offence is, or one of the previous offences was,(i) first degree murder within the meaning of section 231 of the Criminal Code, the continuous combined duration of the youth sentences may exceed ten years, or(ii) second degree murder within the meaning of section 231 of the Criminal Code, the continuous combined duration of the youth sentences may exceed seven years.[10] Section 42(15) YCJA applies in cases where the Youth Justice Court is imposing, at the same time, more than one youth sentence with respect to different offences (the maximum would be three years except for murder cases) and section 42(16) YCJA deals with youth sentences imposed at different times, which is the case here, but only applies where the second sentence is imposed for an offence committed after (not before) the commencement of the sentence imposed for the other offence.[11] Section. 46 YCJA applies. The section states that where the young person who is already serving a youth sentence is sentenced for an offence committed before the commencement of the youth sentence he is now serving, that the custodial portion of the merged youth sentence cannot exceed 6 years. Therefore, there is no statutory bar to imposing a total combined sentence of four years in this case.Exception when youth sentence in respect of earlier offence46.The total of the custodial portions of a young person’s youth sentences shall not exceed six years calculated from the beginning of the youth sentence that is determined in accordance with section 43 if,(a) a youth sentence is imposed under paragraph 42(2) (n), (o), (q) or (r) on the young person already serving a youth sentence under one of those paragraphs; and(b) the later youth sentence imposed is in respect of an offence committed before the commencement of the earlier youth sentence.[12] The defence submits that this creates unfairness because if a sentence for the two sets of offences were imposed by the same jurist in the same sentencing proceeding, section 42(15) would apply effectively limiting the maximum sentence for both sets of charges, in this case, to two years. Counsel for R.W.submits that the effect of sections 45(15) and 46, on the particular circumstances of this case, is to undermine the overall purpose of the YCJA set out in section 3 of the YCJA and the purpose of sentencing articulated in section 38 of the YCJA.[13] Section 3:3. (1) The following principles apply in this Act:(a) the youth criminal justice system is intended to:(i) prevent crime by addressing the circumstances underlying a young person’s offending behaviour,(ii) rehabilitate young persons who commit offences and reintegrate them into society, and(iii) ensure that a young person is subject to meaningful consequences for his or her offence in order to promote the long-term protection of the public;(b) the criminal justice system for young persons must be separate from that of adults and emphasize the following:(i) rehabilitation and reintegration,(ii) fair and proportionate accountability that is consistent with the greater dependency of young persons and their reduced level of maturity,(iii) enhanced procedural protection to ensure that young persons are treated fairly and that their rights, including their right to privacy, are protected,(iv) timely intervention that reinforces the link between the offending behaviour and its consequences, and(v) the promptness and speed with which persons responsible for enforcing this Act must act, given young persons’ perception of time;(c) within the limits of fair and proportionate accountability, the measures taken against young persons who commit offences should:(i) reinforce respect for societal values,(ii) encourage the repair of harm done to victims and the community,(iii) be meaningful for the individual young person given his or her needs and level of development and, where appropriate, involve the parents, the extended family, the community and social or other agencies in the young person’s rehabilitation and reintegration, and(iv) respect gender, ethnic, cultural and linguistic differences and respond to the needs of aboriginal young persons and of young persons with special requirements; and(d) special considerations apply in respect of proceedings against young persons and, in particular:(i) young persons have rights and freedoms in their own right, such as a right to be heard in the course of and to participate in the processes, other than the decision to prosecute, that lead to decisions that affect them, and young persons have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms,(ii) victims should be treated with courtesy, compassion and respect for their dignity and privacy and should suffer the minimum degree of inconvenience as a result of their involvement with the youth criminal justice system,(iii) victims should be provided with information about the proceedings and given an opportunity to participate and be heard, and(iv) parents should be informed of measures or proceedings involving their children and encouraged to support them in addressing their offending behaviour.Act to be liberally construed(2) This Act shall be liberally construed so as to ensure that young persons are dealt with in accordance with the principles set out in subsection (1).[14] The principles and purpose of sentencing under the YCJA are articulated in section 38(1):Section 38 (1) The purpose of sentencing under section 42 (youth sentences) is to hold a young person accountable for an offence through the imposition of just sanctions that have meaningful consequences for the young person and that promote his or her rehabilitation and reintegration into society, thereby contributing to the long-term protection of the public.Sentencing principles:(2) A youth justice court that imposes a youth sentence on a young person shall determine the sentence in accordance with the principles set out in section 3 and the following principles:(a) The sentence must not result in a punishment that is greater than the punishment that would be appropriate for an adult who has been convicted of the same offence committed in similar circumstances;(b) the sentence must be similar to the sentences imposed in the region on similar young persons found guilty of the same offence committed in similar circumstances;(c) the sentence must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the young person for that offence;(d) all available sanctions other than custody that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all young persons, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal young persons; and(e) subject to paragraph (c), the sentence must:(i) be the least restrictive sentence that is capable of achieving the purpose set out in subsection (1),(ii) be the one that is most likely to rehabilitate the young person and reintegrate him or her into society, and(iii) promote a sense of responsibility in the young person, and an acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and the community.Factors to be considered(3) In determining a youth sentence, the youth justice court shall take into account:(a) the degree of participation by the young person in the commission of the offence;(b) the harm done to victims and whether it was intentional or reasonably foreseeable;(c) any reparation made by the young person to the victim or the community;(d) the time spent in detention by the young person as a result of the offence;(e) the previous findings of guilt of the young person; and(f) any other aggravating and mitigating circumstances related to the young person or the offence that are relevant to the purpose and principles set out in this section.[15] The defence argument may have been an interesting issue to delve into hadit been framed in terms of an appropriate constitutional challenge however, when considered within the context framed by counsel, I conclude that there is nothing unfair about the operation of sections 45(15) and (46). In my view, it is open for the sentencing judge under such circumstances to impose concurrent sentences if such a sentence will adequately address the general principles and purpose of sentencing articulated in sections 3 and 38 respectively.The Availability of a Custodial Disposition[16] Section 39 of the YCJA prohibits the imposition of a custodial disposition in youth sentencing unless the circumstances outlined in that section are applicable.39. (1) A youth justice court shall not commit a young person to custody under section 42 (youth sentences) unless:(a) the young person has committed a violent offence;(b) the young person has failed to comply with non-custodial sentences;(c) the young person has committed an indictable offence for which an adult would be liable to imprisonment for a term of more than two years and has a history that indicates a pattern of findings of guilt under this Act or the Young Offenders Act, chapter Y-1 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985; or(d) in exceptional cases where the young person has committed an indictable offence, the aggravating circumstances of the offence are such that the imposition of a non-custodial sentence would be inconsistent with the purpose and principles set out in section 38.Alternatives to custody(2) If any of paragraphs (1) (a) to (c) apply, a youth justice court shall not impose a custodial sentence under section 42 (youth sentences) unless the court has considered all alternatives to custody raised at the sentencing hearing that are reasonable in the circumstances, and determined that there is not a reasonable alternative, or combination of alternatives, that is in accordance with the purpose and principles set out in section 38.Factors to be considered(3) In determining whether there is a reasonable alternative to custody, a youth justice court shall consider submissions relating to(a) the alternatives to custody that are available;(b) the likelihood that the young person will comply with a non-custodial sentence, taking into account his or her compliance with previous non-custodial sentences; and(c) the alternatives to custody that have been used in respect of young persons for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.Imposition of same sentence(4) The previous imposition of a particular non-custodial sentence on a young person does not preclude a youth justice court from imposing the same or any other non-custodial sentence for another offence.Custody as social measure prohibited(5) A youth justice court shall not use custody as a substitute for appropriate child protection, mental health or other social measures.Pre-sentence report(6) Before imposing a custodial sentence under section 42 (youth sentences), a youth justice court shall consider a pre-sentence report and any sentencing proposal made by the young person or his or her counsel.Report dispensed with(7) A youth justice court may, with the consent of the prosecutor and the young person or his or her counsel, dispense with a pre-sentence report if the court is satisfied that the report is not necessary.Length of custody(8) In determining the length of a youth sentence that includes a custodial portion, a youth justice court shall be guided by the purpose and principles set out in section 38, and shall not take into consideration the fact that the supervision portion of the sentence may not be served in custody and that the sentence may be reviewed by the court under section 94.Reasons(9) If a youth justice court imposes a youth sentence that includes a custodial portion, the court shall state the reasons why it has determined that a non-custodial sentence is not adequate to achieve the purpose set out in subsection 38(1), including, if applicable, the reasons why the case is an exceptional case under paragraph (1)(d).[17] It is conceded by both parties that given the nature of R.W.’s criminal record the “custody door” is open in this case.Sentence Analysis[18] R.W. has served 7 and one half months in pre-trial detention. He has been in secure custody. The Crown seeks a custodial sentence in the range of 15 to 17 months followed by a probationary period of 8 months.It is the position of the Crown that a period of one for one credit should be given for pre-trial custody.[19] The defence seeks a sentence of 12 months followed by 12 months probation. The defence submits that credit of 1.5 to 1 should be given for pre-trial custody.[20] The sentenced imposed must be one that contributes to the long term protection of the public by holding R.W. accountable for his actions. Accountability in this sense involves the imposition of meaningful consequences designed to facilitate R.W.’s rehabilitation and reintegration into society. It does not involve the imposition of a sentence designed to address any notion of deterrence: R v. A.O. 218 C.C.C.3 (d) 409 at. para42.[21] In R v. T.R. [2007] O.J. No. 4074, T. R. was found guilty after trial of several offences including possession of a weapon, obstruction of justice and breach of probation. Forster J. sentenced T.R. to a sentence of 12 months custody followed by 12 months. 8 months of which are to be served as open custody and the remaining four months in the community.[22] T.R. was observed smoking marijuana in a subway station. During a search of his backpack an antique handgun with a bullet taped to fit in the firing chamber was found. He lied to the Toronto Transit Commission Officer about his name and was also found in possession of a small quantity of cocaine and a flick knife.[23] T.R was on bail at the time; he was subject to a curfew and was prohibited from possessing a weapon. His Pre-sentence report indicated that he would benefit from community support and he had no criminal record.[24] In R v. M.J [2007] O.J. No. 2696, Wong J. sentenced M.J to an 8 month open sentence followed by 4 months of community supervision and 12 months probation. M.J. pleaded guilty to careless storage of a restricted weapon, possession of a weapon dangerous to the public peace and being the occupant of a motor vehicle in which he knew there was a restricted weapon.[25] M.J was operating a motor vehicle with his grandfather as a passenger. He was transporting a firearm with the serial numbers scratched off. His grandfather had no idea that M.J. was in possession of the firearm. The firearm was loaded with six rounds of ammunition in the chamber. M.J. was also found in possession of a flick knife.[26] M.J had no criminal record; M.J. was 17 years of age at time of the offence and 18 years at time of sentencing; he stated that he had the gun on his person to defend threats against his life; he expressed remorse; had good family support; had some prospects for rehabilitation and had been on very restrictive bail conditions for 16 months without incurring any new charges.[27] In R v. C.W. [2007] O.J. No. 4829, Bloomenfeld J. sentenced C.W. to serve six months deferred custody and supervision order followed by 18 months probation. C.W. pleaded guilty to careless storage of a firearm, possession of a loaded restricted firearm, careless storage of ammunition and being an occupant in a vehicle in which he knew there was a firearm. C.W. had a criminal record with drug convictions, theft and breach of recognizance.[28] There was evidence that C.W. had a supportive family; C.W. was diligent in complying with the terms of his bail. C.W. has spent several months under a curfew and house arrest without incident; he was remorseful, accepted responsibility for his actions; his Pre-sentence report was positive and included a recommendation for a community based sentence. Blommenfeld, J. concluded that C.W. had made a conscious decision and effort to turn his life around.[29] R.W. is the principal perpetuator of the offence. His act of possessing a loaded firearm in “ready to fire mode” in a public place was a planned and deliberate one and risk of harm to himself and others is obvious.[30] As the principal actor he bears primary responsibility for this offence. His prospects for rehabilitation are good. R.W has made significant progress in his rehabilitation since he has been in secure detention awaiting the disposition of this matter.It is clear that R.W. strives in a secured and structured environment.[31] There is no basis to conclude that R.W. does not have good family support even though the extent of his family’s involvement is unclear. R.W. has not seen his family since he has been in custody although distance from the detention centre has been proffered as an explanation, it is uncertain what types of family support will be available to R.W. upon his release from custody.[32] Unlike M.J. and T.R., R.W. comes before this court with an extensive criminal record and unlike C.W. his criminal record includes findings of guilt for offences of violence. Also unlike C.W, R.W. has a history of non-compliance with court orders.[33] No alternatives to custody were raised at R.W.’s sentencing hearing and, in any event, given R.W’s history of non-compliance with previous court orders, a non-custodial sentence will not be appropriate.Under all the circumstances a non-custodial sentence will not satisfy any of the principles of sentencing set in section 38 of the YCJA.[34] After considering the personal circumstances of this young person, the circumstances of the offences as well as the aggravating and mitigating factors in this case, I conclude that the sentence that is proportionate to his degree of involvement; hold him accountable; provide meaningful consequences for his actions and promote R.W’s rehabilitation and reintegration into the community is a total sentence of 16 months followed by 8 months probation. C.W. will receive credit for the 7 and half months he has spent in pre-trial custody.Pre-trial Credit[35] The Crown submits that the period of pre-trial custody should be accorded 1:1 credit. The defence submits that the pre-trial custody should be accorded 1:1.5 credit.[36] A sentencing judge has broad discretion with regard to how much pre-trial credit should be given: R v. Wust (2000), 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 129 and A.O. supra, at para. 76.[37] These are serious offences committed at a time when R.Wwas on a judicial interim release prohibiting the possession of a weapon; R.W. has been moved to at least six youth detention centres; there have been allegations of poor conditions in at least one facility and instances of violence in another and I conclude that thefrequent transfer has been detrimental to R.W.’s rehabilitation; distance from the correctional institution has also adversely impacted R.W’s ability to have contact with his family.[38] R.W. has been participating in programs run by the Syl Apps Youth Centre during his current tenure at the Roy McMurtry Youth Detention Centre and in that secure setting R.W. has began to make significant progress toward his rehabilitation as previously described. Upon balancing the seriousness of the offence, the personal circumstances of the offender, the aggravating and mitigating factors of the offences including the circumstances surrounding his stay in the detention centre as well as his performance while in youth detention, I conclude that the appropriate amount of credit for pre-trial custody is 1.3:1.Disposition[39] In the result, R.W.’s 228 days of pre-trial custody is to be noted. R.W shall receive a credit of 1.3:1 for the period of pre-trial custody. In effect he has served 296 days. He is sentenced to an additional 176 days. 117 of which shall be served in secure custody and 59 days under community supervision. These sentences are to be served concurrently on all counts. This sentence is to apply consecutively to any sentence R.W. is currently serving.[40] Following his custodial sentence R.W. is placed on probation for a period of 8 months with the following conditions:a)Keep the peace and be of good behaviour;b)Report to your probation officer once and thereafter as required;c)Make reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain employment or attend school on a full-time basis and show progress reports to your probation officer or designate;d)You shall not acquire or possess any firearm, crossbow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition or explosive substance;e)You shall not own, possess or carry any weapon defined in the Criminal Code orcarry any knives when outside your residence;f)You shall attend and participate actively in such assessments/treatment/rehabilitation programs as recommended by your probation offence;g)You shall sign any releases to enable your probation officer to monitor your participation, attendance and completion of any counselling/treatment programs.[41] A weapons prohibition pursuant to section 51(2) of the YCJA is imposed for a period of three years. On consent there a forfeiture order for the destruction of all weapons and ammunition seized.[42] The Crown’s request for a DNA order was not opposed. On a review of the circumstances of the offence, the offender, his criminal record, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances in this case and the minimal intrusion of such an order on R.W’s privacy interests and the security of his person, I conclude that it is in the best interest of the administration of justice to obtain a sample of his DNA as an investigative tool and therefore a sample of R.W’s DNA will be taken.Released:April 19, 2010_____________________________Justice K.

(Oral):This is your sentence.First,there will be a lifetime firearm and ammunition prohibition.You must surrender, immediately, to the police any weapons or firearms you own or possess.I am going to make an order that you provide a sample of your DNA as soon as possible.[2]While the victim can never be compensated for her losses, I am going to render a compensation order in the name of the victim for $1000 to cover all the property damages that were noted in the victim impact statement.These compensation orders, Mr. Jacob, can be filed as a civil action and follow you through whatever work you do.I hope that as a genuine sign of your sense of responsibility, this minimal amount, you will pay as soon as you can in whatever amounts you can accumulate.[3]Determining the appropriate jail sentence was a very difficult task for me in this case.Certainly, if I based a jail sentence solely on the offence, a jail term of in excess of 10 years would be appropriate.[4]The defence acknowledges that a penitentiary term is appropriate.In relying principally on your youthful nature, the absence of any prior sexual offences, and on cases that impose sentence in the range of two to four years, they are suggesting that four years is an appropriate sentence.The cases that they rely on, in my written reasons, I will distinguish from the facts of this case.[5]The Crown, in turn, relying principally on the horrific factual circumstances of this offence, calls for a sentence of seven years.I believe that the overall principle, that no more jail than is necessary be imposed in combination with all the other mitigating circumstances, leads to the conclusion that a sentence in a range submitted by the Crown is appropriate.[6]I cannot even hope to imagine measuring the number of years that I am going to impose upon you, in any way, shape or form, can be matched to the injuries that you caused to the victim, and I do not intend to try to make that kind of comparison.[7]While the sentence is stiff, it is important, as I have said, not to completely give up on you.I am trying to fit a sentence that will not break your will to change, that will not leave you hopelessly locked up in institutions for the rest of your life.Trying to fashion a sentence that recognizes the responsibility you must take for the savagery you imposed on your victim, as well as shape a sentence that says to you, we all recognize that ultimately you are coming back to this community and if you work hard that might be sooner than later, has been difficult.[8]In the written reasons I will be saying, to the parole officers, if you aggressively pursue the treatment I recommend, when you have completed the treatment, parole will be considered.Equally, I am going to say in my written reasons, if you do not, I aggressively recommend that you serve the full sentence.[9]The sentence in this court is going to be recorded as eight years.That will go down in your record as an eight-year sentence.With the period of one year for remand, you are going to serve a sentence of seven years.[10]I have taken that time out of your life; use it well.You can shape a different future, or some other judge, somewhere else down the road, is going to sentence you to a similar term if you do anything that warrants a sentence like this again.[11]All of us ought to hope that whatever else you do, you never give up on the treatment that is available for you in the institutions you will serve out your sentence._____________________________STUART,C.J.T.C."}

The matter was adjourned for sentencing and this is the decision on sentence.FACTSA.Circumstances of the Offence[2]The facts in this matter are fairly straightforward. On March 4, 2014, at a gas bar in north Regina, Mr. McHale was found in the care and control of a motor vehicle. Subsequently, he complied with a breathalyzer demand and had readings of .150 milligrams and .130 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.B.Circumstances of the Offender[3]Mr. McHale was born in Limerick, Saskatchewan on February 20, 1947. He was the youngest of two children. At the age of five, he moved with his parents and brother to Regina. Mr. McHale’s brother, Ron, has since passed away from a heart attack. Mr. McHale reports having a close relationship with his family and especially with his brother. Mr. McHale states that at the present time, he does not have any immediate family as they have all passed away. Mr. McHale reported no abuse of any kind in the family home. Mr. McHale was married but has been divorced for some time. He has two children with his former spouse but he has minimal contact with his children. Mr. McHale’s former spouse indicated that part of the reason for the breakdown of their relationship was Mr. McHale’s alcohol use but also the fact that he worked away from home. Mr. McHale reports having no supports in the community.[4]Mr. McHale reports that he is in poor physical health. He has hada right hip replacement and is currently on a waiting list for a replacement for his left hip. He reports he has pain in his shoulders, wrist and foot. Mr. McHale reports being in good mental health and is not taking any medications that may interfere with sentencing.[5]Mr. McHale reports that he first began using alcohol as a teenager and that over some years in his life, he had a problem with alcohol, identifying specifically the 1970s and 1980s as being a period in which he had particular difficulties with alcohol. According to the pre-sentence report, Mr. McHale claims that presently he does not have the money to drink, but that if he had money, alcohol would be a problem for him. He identified to the pre-sentence report author that at present he uses alcohol to the point of intoxication about once a week.[6]Mr. McHale reports having completed grade 12 at Balfour Technical School in Regina. He has accreditation for a high pressure pipe welder. Mr. McHale has been living off his pension for the past five years. Prior to that, worked off and on.[7]Mr. McHale has a fairly significant criminal record dating back to 1964. His record consists of the following:1964-04-15(1) BE \u0026 Theft(1-2) Susp Sent 2 YrsRegina SaskSec 292(1)(B) CCon $300 Bond(2) Att B \u0026 ESec 406-292(1)(B) CC1974-02-11(1) Assault Peace Officer(1) $500 I-D 3 mosNew WestminsterSec 246(2)(A) CC(2) $200 I-D 1 moBC(2) Cusing [sic] aConcDisturbanceSec 171(A)(1)CC1988-11-09Driving While Ability14 daysWeyburn SaskImpaired Sec 237(A) CC(RCMP Weyburn88-0470)1989-02-02Fraud Sec 380(1)CCSusp Sent \u0026Weyburn Sask(02 Chgs)Probation18 mos\u0026 60 hrs CommunityService Work\u0026Restitution $3517.72(RCMP Weyburn 88-0770)1991-01-31Driving with more than24 days \u0026Saskatoon Sask80 mgs of alcohol inProbation 6 mosblood Sec 253(B)CC\u0026 Proh Dri 1 Yr(Saskatoon PD 49800)1994-05-30Driving with more than$600 I-D 30 daysSaskatoon Sask80 mgs of alcohol in\u0026 Surcharge $25bloodSec 253(B)CCI-D 3 days \u0026 Proh(Saskatoon PS 49800)Dri 6 mos1997-10-10Driving with more than$600 I-D 13 daysRegina Sask80 mgs of alcohol in\u0026 Probation 9 mosbloodSec 253(B)CC\u0026 Proh Dri 6 mos(Regina PS 11768)1997-10-27Driving with more than60 days intermittentPrince Albert Sask80 mgs of alcohol in\u0026 Probation 1 YrbloodSec 253(B)CC\u0026 Proh Dri 6 mos(Prince Albert PS 97-0421)2000-04-05(1) Driving with more than(1) 4 mos \u0026 ProhRegina Sask80 mgs of alcohol inDri 1 YrbloodSec 253(B)CC(2) Driving while dis-(2) 4 mos Concqualified Sec 259(4)CC(Regina PS 11768)2002-05-27(1) Driving with more(1) 6 mos \u0026Regina Saskthan 80 mgs of alcoholProh Dri 1 Yrin bloodSec 253(B)CC(2) Driving while dis-(2) $1000 I-DqualifiedSec 259(4)CC19 days(Regina PS11768)[8]Mr. McHale has seven prior convictions for driving while impaired. Mr. McHale has had some previous intervention with respect to alcohol. He completed a day program in June, 2000 offered through Addiction Services.[9]At the present time, Mr. McHale, despite his seven previous impaired driving convictions, has expressed to the pre-sentence report author that he has not struggled with any substance abuse issues. Mr. McHale communicated to that writer that he has no intention or motivation to attempt sobriety. He appears, according to the pre-sentence report, to demonstrate little insight into the potential risk to himself or others when driving under the influence.[10]The pre-sentence report author assessed Mr. McHale’s level of risk of reoffending using the Saskatchewan Primary Risk Assessment tool to provide a probability of criminal recidivism in relation to Mr. McHale. Mr. McHale’s overall risk for re-offending generally was assessed to be medium. This means compared to the remainder of the Saskatchewan offender population, Mr. McHale was assessed to be in the twenty-fourth percentile with seventy-six percentile of Saskatchewan offenders were assessed as having more risk factors.POSITION OF CROWN AND DEFENCE ON SENTENCE[11]The Crown served notice of its intention to seek a greater punishment by reason of the fact that Mr. McHale had been previously convicted. The Crown takes the position that Mr. McHale should be subject to a period of incarceration of 15 to 18 months followed by 18 months’ probation, including conditions that he report to a probation officer and attend and complete an assessment for addictions. The Crown relies on the cases of R v Paskimin, 2006 SKCA 141 (CanLII); R v Pawliw, 2006 SKCA 51 (CanLII), 289 Sask R 1 and R v Ewenin, 2014 SKCA (SentDig) 12 in suggesting that a period of incarceration in the range of 15 to 18 months followed by 18 months’ probation plus a driving prohibition is warranted.[12]Counsel on behalf of the defence suggests that while a period of incarceration may be warranted, it should be a period that would be for 90 days or less, which would allow Mr. McHale to serve his sentence intermittently. Defence counsel argues to the “gap principle” and points out that there is a significant gap in Mr. McHale’s record, in particular he has not had a conviction since 2002.[13]Defence counsel relies on the decision in the R v R.L., 2013 SKPC 80 (CanLII), 422 Sask R 311, andR v Doucette, 2015 PECA 5 (CanLII), 365 NFLD \u0026 PEIR 173.THE PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[14]Section 718 of the Criminal Code sets out the key objectives of sentencing, which include denouncing unlawful conduct, deterring the offender and other persons from committing offences and where necessary, separating the offender from society. Key objectives also include rehabilitation of offenders, providing reparation for harm done to the victim and the community and promoting a sense of responsibility in the offender.[15]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code states that a fundamental principle of sentencing is that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. Section 718.2 sets out that a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances; that similar sentences should be imposed for similar offences and similar offenders and that the least restrictive sanction should be identified. It is clear from the jurisprudence that denunciation, deterrence and protection for the public are the primary principles involved in sentencing individuals who consume alcohol and have care and control of a vehicle.[16]The defence has argued the “gap principle” as indicated. The “gap principle” is a concept that suggests the court should take into consideration the rehabilitative efforts of individuals who have long periods of time between criminal offences. In R v Littlecrow, 2011 SKQB 393 (CanLII) at para 21, 384 Sask R 289, Justice Gabrielson stated:21 …This appears to be a case where the \"gap principle\" would apply when considering Ms. Littlecrow's previous record. In the text Clayton C. Ruby, Sentencing,7th ed. (Markham: LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2008) at para. 8.83, Mr. Ruby refers to what he calls \"the gap principle\" and states:§ 8.83 Since both sentencing and crime are human endeavours, it is natural for the courts to give credit to someone who has made an honest effort to avoid conflict with the criminal law. In the nature of things, an effort such as this will not always be completely successful, but if a substantial period of time passes without convictions, this is often a matter which will be taken into consideration. ...[17]Mr. McHale’s last conviction was in May 2002. He has gone close to 12 years without any offences. This is a substantial period of time passing without any conviction and should be taken into consideration.[18]Parity of sentences must also be taken into consideration. I have reviewed cases dealing with similar sentences for similar offenders in similar circumstances including the ones provides by the Crown.[19]The court must also take into account the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. It is aggravating that Mr. McHale has a serious previous criminal record and one which has some seven convictions for previous drinking and driving offences. There are mitigating factors. Mr. McHale pled guilty and had indicated from the outset that he was prepared to take responsibility for his conduct. Mr. McHale has some numerous health problems. It has also been some 12 years since Mr. McHale has had a previous conviction.ANALYSIS[20]It is incumbent upon the court to sentence in accordance with the principles of sentencing. It is clear that denunciation, deterrence and protection of the public are the primary objectives in sentencing in a case like this. Considering other sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences, the range does appear to be incarceration for a period of 15 months to 18 months. However, the offenders in those cases have more significant criminal records and none had the kind of a significant gap in their offending behavior that Mr. McHale displayed. Unfortunately for Mr. McHale, a sentence that would allow Mr. McHale to serve the sentence intermittently is well below the range of sentences set by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal.[21]In considering all of the circumstances, the nature of the offence, the circumstances of the offender, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and the sentences imposed in similar circumstances, I am of the view that a fit and proper sentence for this offence is a sentence of 12 months incarceration followed by 18 month’s probation with conditions.CONCLUSION[22]For all of these reasons, I sentence Mr. McHale to a period of incarceration of 12 months in a provincial correctional facility followed by 18 month’s probation with the following conditions:a.That you keep the peace and be of good behavior;b.That you appear before the court when required to do so by the court;c.That you notify the court and the probation officer in advance of any change of name or address and promptly notify the court or the probation officer of any change of employment or occupation; andd.That your report to a probation officer within two working days after release from custody and thereafter when required to do so by the probation officer in a manner cited by the probation officer.[23]I also order the further conditions that you participate in an assessment for addictions and complete programming as required to do so by the probation officer.I further order that you not attend any place where the consumption or purchase of alcohol is the primary business.[24]I also order that you be prohibited from driving for a period of four years.[25]Mr. McHale shall pay a victim surcharge of $200.00 payable forthwith.J.C.

Wilford)for the Respondent-and -))Chambers motion heard:)November 29, 2007G.(J. A.)))Decision pronounced:(Accused) Applicant)November 30, 2007MacINNES J.A.1The accused moves for an order for judicial interim release pending determination of his appeal from his custodial sentence imposed November 14,2007.2Pursuant to s. 679(4) of the Criminal Code, the accused must satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that:(1)the appeal has sufficient merit that, in the circumstances, it would cause unnecessary hardship if he were detained in custody;(2)he will surrender himself into custody in accordance with the terms of a release order; and(3)his detention is not necessary in the public interest.3Counsel advised that there is no dispute with respect to the second and third factors which the accused is required to establish under the section.The contentious issue on the motion is whether the accused’s appeal has sufficient merit such that, in the circumstances, would cause him unnecessary hardship if he were detained in custody.4The accused was charged December 27, 2004, with repeated sexual interference during the period October 29 to November 11, 2004.He pled guilty to that charge July 5, 2006, and, as previously stated, was sentenced on November 14, 2007, to incarceration for a period of two years less one day, to be followed by two years’ supervised probation.5An agreed statement of facts placed before the court was as follows:It is agreed that the touching for a sexual purpose happened approximately 10 times and that the accused fondled the then eight-year-old complainant’s “pee-pee” about six times with his hand and placed his penis against her bum approximately four times.It is admitted that the latter act hurt the complainant, and while doing so the accused made sounds.It is admitted that the accused told the complainant not to tell anyone but made no threats.6As a result of negotiation between Crown and defence counsel, the Crown agreed to seek a penalty of provincial time, not penitentiary time.The Crown thus sought a sentence of two years less one day actual incarceration, while defence counsel sought a conditional sentence order.7In addition to the statement of agreed facts placed before the court, the court received both a pre-sentence report prepared by a probation officer and a psychological assessment prepared by a forensic psychologist.Both the probation officer and the forensic psychologist testified on the sentence hearing.As well, victim impact statements were provided.8The sentencing judge stated that the victim impact statements gave a picture of a child who was happy-go-lucky and carefree prior to these incidents, but who since has suffered from nightmares, has trouble trusting people and is fearful of people and of going to school.In addition, the incidents have created intra-family conflict.9The sentencing judge found the accused to be in a position of grandparent, a step-grandfather to the eight-year-old victim.She said he could be considered to be in loco parentis to the child when the child was with him and was in a position of trust to her.10The accused is 77 years of age, with no prior record.The reports of both the probation officer and the forensic psychologist, confirmed by their viva voce evidence, assess the accused as a low risk to reoffend.The probation officer described the accused as a suitable candidate for community supervision.The accused has family support and demonstrated a modicum of remorse.11The sentencing judge concluded that this offence constituted a major sexual assault in a family relationship.She thus concluded that the focus of sentencing was denunciation and deterrence, as distinct from rehabilitation.Thus, while accepting counsel’s position as to duration of the incarceratory penalty, she concluded that such penalty should be served in custody rather than on a supervised basis within the community.12In his notice of appeal, the accused advances six grounds.The first five are that the sentence is demonstrably unfit and/or manifestly excessive given the circumstances of the offence and the accused’s circumstances and that the trial judge erred in applying the proper principles of sentencing, in classifying the offence as a major sexual assault, in failing to properly consider a conditional sentence and in overemphasizing the principles of denunciation and deterrence.13On the motion before me, the accused’s argument essentially focussed upon what is alleged to be an error on the part of the sentencing judge in classifying the offence as a major sexual assault.But that aside, however, the accused also argues that, in all of the circumstances, the sentence is demonstrably unfit and/or manifestly excessive.Defence counsel asserts that had the sentencing judge not erred in classifying the offence as a major sexual assault, and further had she properly considered the circumstances of the offence and the accused’s circumstances, she would have concluded that a conditional sentence was appropriate.14The Crown’s position is that the sentencing judge did not err in finding this to be a major sexual assault and that, in the circumstances, both as regards the offence and the accused, the sentence was fit and proper.15As previously stated, the accused must satisfy me on a balance of probabilities that the appeal has sufficient merit that, in the circumstances, it would cause unnecessary hardship if he were detained in custody.16The phrase “sufficient merit” has been interpreted as meaning “arguable merit.”See R. v. Ewanchuk (S.B.), 2000 ABCA 303 (CanLII), 271 A.R. 118 at paras. 6-8, R. v. Cooper, 1999 ABCA 249 (CanLII), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 292 at para. 5, and R. v. Colville (D.), 2004 ABCA 342 (CanLII), 357 A.R. 34.17As regards consideration of the factor of unnecessary hardship to the accused if he were detained in custody, courts have concluded that if there is sufficient merit in an appeal, detaining an accused in custody pending an appeal where, in the event of success, his time in custody would exceed that which justice requires would amount to unnecessary hardship.In this case, the accused is in custody serving his sentence of two years less a day pending his appeal.If he is successful in his appeal such that a conditional sentence is substituted for his custodial sentence, he will then have served time in custody, whereas under a conditional sentence he would not be required to serve time in custody at all – clearly an unnecessary hardship.18In a nutshell, the question here is whether the accused’s appeal has sufficient merit; that is, arguable merit.In the circumstances of this offence and this offender, the accused has satisfied me on a balance of probabilities that the appeal has sufficient merit that, in the circumstances, would cause unnecessary hardship if he were detained in custody.Accordingly, I order the judicial interim release of the accused pending determination of his appeal.19My order is conditional, however, upon Crown and defence counsel reattending before me at the earliest available date to speak to the conditions to be attached to the accused’s release._____________________________ J.A."}

Savchenko, [2000] N.J. No. 213 (S.C.).STATUTES CONSIDERED: The Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985.JUDGMENT OF GORMAN, P.C. J.(SENTENCE)INTRODUCTION:[1]Mr. Morgan has pleaded guilty to the offences of assault and forcible entry into real property, contrary to sections 73 and 266 of the Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985.[2]The offences involved Mr. Morgan having forcibly entered the victim’s residence and assaulting him.Mr. Morgan was under the impression that the victim (Mr. Morgan Hodder) was providing his wife, who was described at the sentence hearing as having addiction issues, with drugs. Though I am satisfied that Mr. Morgan believed this, it must be clearly stated that no evidence was presented to establish the accuracy of Mr. Morgan’s belief in relation to either his wife or Mr. Hodder.[3]The sole issue for determination is the imposition of an appropriate sentence for these offences. The Crown proceeded by way of summary conviction in relation to each charge and sought the imposition of a conditional period of imprisonment.I have concluded that this is an appropriate case for sentence to be suspended and for Mr. Morgan to be placed on probation for a period of twelve months.I have reached this conclusion because of Mr. Morgan’s lack of any prior convictions and the isolated nature of his offences.Let me explain my reasons for this conclusion in further detail by commencing with a review of the circumstances of the offences committed by Mr. Morgan.THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCES[4]On November 17, 2015, Mr. Morgan and his wife were at home.Mr. Morgan fell asleep and when he awoke his wife was no longer present.Mr. Morgan suspected that she had gone to Mr. Hodder’s residence.Mr. Morgan believed that Mr. Hodder was supplying her with drugs.[5]Mr. Morgan went to Mr. Hodder’s residence.He forced his way into Mr. Hodder’s residence and assaulted Mr. Hodder by punching him more than once.Mr. Hodder received a laceration and lump to his head, a bloody nose and bruised ribs.[6]Mr. Morgan’s wife was present at Mr. Hodder’s residence.She told her husband to stop fighting with Mr. Hodder and to leave.[7]Much of the detail concerning Mr. Morgan’s view of the nature of the relationship between his wife and Mr. Hodder was provided through Mr. Goudie’s submission.The Crown took no objection to this information being provided and thus I am willing to consider it.However, a note of caution.As recently pointed out by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Pahl, 2016 BCCA 234 (CanLII), counsel cannot “give evidence”:Counsel’s podium is not the equivalent of the witness box.In speaking to sentence counsel make submissions, they do not give “evidence”:R. v. Cousins (1981), 22 C.R. (3d) 298 at 301 (Nfld. C.A.); R. v. Gobin (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 484 (Man. C.A.). However, this does not mean that sentencing judges can never accept information provided through submissions as factually accurate.Sentencing judges routinely accept and act on information counsel provide to them through submissions.I agree with Mr. Pahl that it would unduly burden the courts to require proof of every factual assertion counsel make at a sentencing hearing.However, it is not open to a judge to accept as fact an assertion made by counsel that is disputed and unsupported by any admissible evidence. Put otherwise, a judge is entitled to accept a fact advanced solely through submissions only if that fact is non-contentious:R. v. Asp, 2011 BCCA 433 (CanLII) at para. 34, 278 C.C.C. (3d) 391; Cousins at 301.[8]In R. v. Lundrigan, 2012 NLCA 43 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal indicated that a “fit sentence” is one “that takes account of the circumstances of the offences and the offender.”In R. v. Freckleton, 2016 ONCA 130 (CanLII), the Ontario Court of Appeal noted that “sentencing, an offender’s individual circumstances must be taken into account.”THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER[9]Mr. Morgan is forty-three years of age.He has no prior convictions and is employed on a full time basis.[10]Mr. Morgan advised the author of the pre-sentence report that he had “a positive upbringing.” Mr. Morgan indicated that his father “was the primary income earner in the family – he worked in carpentry/construction and the family enjoyed a level of financially stability. Mrs. Morgan was primarily a homemaker, but when the children became independent began working in respite care. Mr. Morgan reported positive relationships within the family unit.He reports no abuse of any kind within the family, no marital discord or substance abuse.”[11]The pre-sentence report notes that Mr. Morgan “expressed remorse for his actions. He noted fear and concern for his wife as motivation for attending Mr. Hodder’s residence. He was polite and cooperative with the presentence report process.”THE PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[12]In R. v. Knott, 2012 SCC 42 (CanLII), it was held that \"the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code are meant to take into account the correctional imperative of sentence individualization.\"[13]In R. v. Bosco, 2016 BCCA 55 (CanLII), the British Columbia Court of Appeal held, at paragraph 29, that the “fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute to respect for the law and to maintain a just, peaceful and safe society.To meet this purpose, judges determine and impose ‘just sanctions’ upon those convicted of committing crime.Sanctions are just when they are tailored to the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the offender, bearing in mind a wide array of sentencing goals and principles.Their overarching purpose is to protect society and affirm its shared values.”[14]Section 718 of the Criminal Code states that the fundamental purpose of sentencing \"is to contribute...to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society.\"This is to be achieved by imposing sentences which have, among other objectives, the objectives of:-separating offenders from society, where necessary;-denouncing unlawful conduct;-general deterrence;-rehabilitation; and-the promoting of a \"sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims or to the community.\"[15]Section 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code states that \"a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.\"[16]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code states that any sentence imposed must be \"proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\"In R. v. Cluney, 2013 NLCA 46 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal, at paragraph 16, indicated that the “principle of proportionality applies to sentencing for all criminal offences…The appropriate range of sentence is related to the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.”[17]In R. v. Hamlyn, 2016 ABCA 127 (CanLII), the Alberta Court of Appeal asked:“What is meant by “gravity of the offence”? The Court of Appeal provided the following answer (at paragraph 9):This concept is directed to what the offender did wrong. It includes two components: (1) the harm or likely harm to the victim; and (2) the harm or likely harm to society and its values. What influences that analysis apart from the degree of injuriousness inherent in the crime itself? The answer lies in s 718.2: R v Arcand, 2010 ABCA 363 (CanLII) at para 57.[18]Section 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code indicates that a \"sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender.\" In R. v. Briand, 2010 NLCA 67 (CanLII), [2010] N.J. No. 339 (C.A.), the Court of Appeal stressed the importance of considering an offender's personal circumstances in applying section 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code.[19]Section 718.2(d) states that \"an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances\" and section 718.2(e) states that \"all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.\" In Bosco, the British Columbia Court of Appeal indicated that sections 718.2(d) and (e) “reflect the restraint principle. This principle encourages caution and moderation in the imposition of custodial sentences. Pursuant to the principle of restraint, the sentencing judge should treat imprisonment as a sanction of last resort and limit any custodial period imposed to the lightest term reasonable in the circumstances.The purpose of such restraint is to reduce Canada's historically high incarceration rates and avoid sentences that are unduly harsh” (at paragraph 35).[20]In R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, the Supreme Court of Canada, at paragraph 36, indicated that “imprisonment should be the penal sanction of last resort. Prison is to be used only where no other sanction or combination of sanctions is appropriate to the offence and the offender.”In R. v. Johnson, 2003 SCC 46 (CanLII), [2003] 2 S.C.R. 357, at paragraph 28, the Supreme Court indicated that a sentencing judge “must consider the possibility that a less restrictive sanction would attain the same sentencing objectives that a more restrictive sanction seeks to attain.” In R. v. Pham, 2013 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2013] 1 S.C.R. 739, the Supreme Court indicated that \"when two possible sentences are both appropriate as regards the gravity of the offence and the responsibility of the offender, the most suitable one may be the one that better contributes to the offender's rehabilitation\" (at paragraph 11).THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIESTHE CROWN:[21]The Crown sought the imposition of a conditional period of imprisonment followed by a period of probation.Mr. Sparkes Q.C. characterized Mr. Morgan’s offences as “serious”, but also noted that he has no prior convictions.[22]The Crown also sought the imposition of a DNA order and the issuing of a section 110 Criminal Code weapons prohibition.MR. MORGAN:[23]On behalf of Mr. Morgan, Mr. Goudie acknowledged the seriousness of the offences.However, Mr. Goudie submitted that the offences occurred in a “unique” set of circumstances in which Mr. Morgan was attempting to assist his wife with her purported addiction issues. Mr. Goudie argued that considering these circumstances and Mr. Morgan’s lack of any prior convictions, the principles of sentencing can be satisfied through the imposition of a suspended sentence and probation.THE RANGE OF SENTENCE[24]In R. v. Oake, 2010 NLCA 19 (CanLII), [2010] N.J. No. 94, the Court of Appeal indicated that a judge has a duty \"to impose sentences in line with precedent, noting always that for each offence and each offender some elements are unique.\"In Cluney, the Court of Appeal indicated that while sentencing ranges “are merely guidelines rather than hard and fast rules, a judge ordering a sentence outside the regular range should explain how it is in accordance with the principles and objectives of sentencing.”[25]In addition, in every case in which sentence is imposed, in this Province, the sentencing judge must initially determine if a “prescriptive” or “descriptive” range of sentence applies (see R. v. Johnston, [2011] N.J. No. 303 (C.A.)).SENTENCING PRECEDENTS-ASSAULT[26]The range of sentence for the offence of assault is extremely broad.In R. v. Norman, [2011] N.J. No. 214 (P.C.), I had the opportunity to consider a number of sentencing precedents for the offence of assault. I summarized them in the following manner:In summary, these precedents illustrate a range of a conditional discharge [Koc, [2008] N.J. No. 161, for striking the victim in the face with a glass]; a suspended sentence [S.G., [2006] N.J. No. 266, for forcing the victim against a wall and Wells, [2011] N.J. No. 140, for punching a person on the side of his head]; 20 days imprisonment [Coleman, [2010] N.J. No. 87, for grabbing the victim by the hair]; 3 months imprisonment [Newman, [2009] N.J. No. 201, for throwing the victim against a wall]; 5 months imprisonment [Manning, 2009 CanLII 33466 (NL PC), [2009] N.J. No. 167, for striking the victim in the face]; to 6 months imprisonment [Hickey, [2010] N.J. No. 88, for making a gesture \"with his arm across his neck when he uttered the threat\" and Lyver, [2010] N.J. No. 92, for having assaulted the victim on two occasions after forcing his way into her residence while having his face concealed].[27]In R. v. Wall, 2015 NLTD(G) 125, the offender committed the offence of assault by punching his brother in the face. Sentence was suspended and the offender was placed on probation for a period of one year.[28]In R. v. Crocker, [2015] N.J. No. 379 (P.C.), the accused, a correctional officer, was convicted of assaulting an inmate. The accused struck the inmate in the face on two occasions.Sentence was suspended and the accused was placed on probation for a period of twelve months.[29]In R. v. L.H., [2016] N.J. No. 136 (P.C.), the offender, who was subject to a probation order at the time, assaulted the victim by punching her in the face three times and banging her head against a door.The victim had bruises to her forehead and had two black eyes.I suspended sentence and placed the offender on probation.SENTENCING PRECEDENTS-FORCIBLE ENTRY[30]In R. v. M.G., [1995] N.J. No. 254 (C.A.), two offenders were convicted of forcing their way into the apartment of an elderly woman, cutting the telephone wires and confining her there for approximately twelve hours while they ransacked the apartment and terrorized her in the process.One of the offenders was raised to adult court and sentenced to seven years imprisonment.In upholding the sentence, the Court of Appeal concluded (at page 4):One is always loath to discount the factor of rehabilitation and reformation, particularly with a young person, but, as stated by the trial judge, \"the psychiatric and social information provided [indicates that] the prospects for reformation and rehabilitation for Mr. R. are not good\".While even for an adult a seven year prison term is a severe one, in our view the sentence of a total of seven years for the crimes committed by the appellant were not excessively high given all the circumstances of this case, and should not be interfered with by this Court.[31]In R. v. Savchenko, [2000] N.J. No. 213 (S.C.), the accused was convicted of assault with a weapon, uttering threats, unlawful entry and unlawful confinement. The offences involved him entering the victim's apartment and taking him for a drive after threatening him with a knife.The trial judge imposed a period of eighteen months imprisonment to be served in the community. The trial judge concluded that the accused was a low risk to re-offend and he was not a danger to the community.ANALYSIS[32]In Bosco, the British Columbia Court of Appeal indicated that the “process of determining a sentence requires full consideration of the offence's gravity, including the harm caused, and the offender's degree of responsibility, including his or her moral blameworthiness. Moral blameworthiness is determined, in part, by considering the intentional risks undertaken by the offender.The degree of harm caused by the offence is also considered, as is the degree to which the conduct deviates from acceptable standards of behaviour...The offender's age, mental capacity or motive for offending may also bear upon his or her moral blameworthiness. The gravity of the offence concerns its circumstances, including the harm or likely harm caused to the victim, society and societal values...” (at paragraph 32).[33]In this case, Mr. Morgan forcibly entered Mr. Hodder’s residence and assaulted him.As I indicated earlier, I accept Mr. Morgan’s explanation for his actions, but I do not see his explanation as a mitigating factor in sentencing. Mr. Morgan’s wife was free to associate with whomever she wished and Mr. Morgan is not a law onto himself.Having said this, Mr. Morgan has no prior convictions. What occurred on November 17, 2015, was an isolated incident which occurred based upon a set of circumstances which are unlikely to be repeated.Mr. Morgan does not constitute a danger to the community.[34]I conclude, primarily because of the isolated nature of Mr. Morgan’s behavior, that in the circumstances of this case there is a reasonable alternative to the imposition of a period of imprisonment.I conclude that a suspended sentence with a probation order for a period of twelve months will protect Mr. Hodder and satisfy the principles of sentencing.THE TERMS OF THE PROBATION ORDER[35]In addition to the statutory conditions which apply (which pursuant to section 732.1(2)(a.1) of the Criminal Code prohibits Mr. Morgan from “communicating directly or indirectly” with Mr. Hodder) Mr. Morgan must:-report to a probation officer in person as required;-comply with all directions received from his probation officer;-refrain from communicating directly or indirectly with Mrs. Morgan unless she consents to such communication;-make a contribution of $300.00 to a food bank chosen by his probation officer. This contribution must be paid to the Provincial Court within fourteen days; and-attend all counselling or treatment sessions arranged by his probation officer.A VICTIM SURCHARGE[36]Mr. Morgan must pay a total of $200.00 in victim surcharges to the Provincial Court within thirty days of today’s date.A DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID ORDER[37]Section 265 of the Criminal Code is a secondary designated offence.Thus, I may issue an order authorizing the taking of bodily substances from Mr. Morgan if satisfied that it is in the best interests of the administration of justice to do so.Section 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code indicates that in determining whether or not to issue a DNA order, I must consider the offender's \"privacy and security.\"[38]There are significant societal interests involved in the collecting of DNA samples, but the issuing of such an order is neither mandatory nor absolute.In this case, Mr. Morgan has no prior convictions, but considering the nature of the assault committed by him and the circumstances involved, I am satisfied that it would be in the best interests of the administration of justice to issue a DNA order.A WEAPON/AMMUNITION PROHIBITION[39]Section 110 of the Criminal Code allows for a weapon/ammunition prohibition to be issued if the offender has committed an offence “in the commission of which violence against a person was used, threatened or attempted.”The provision requires that the sentencing judge be satisfied that \"it is desirable, in the interests of the safety of the person or of any other person, to make an order.\"[40]As we have seen, Mr. Morgan has committed an offence contrary to section 265 of the Criminal Code in which violence against a person was used.Though Mr. Hodder has no history of violence the seriousness of his offences satisfies me that a section 110 prohibition should be issued.I have concluded based upon Mr. Morgan’s circumstances and the circumstances of the offences committed that a prohibition for a period of two years should issue.CONCLUSION[41]For the reasons provided, sentence is suspended and Mr. Morgan is placed on probation for a period of twelve months.[51]Judgment accordingly."}

Wilson of the Ontario Court of Justice sitting without a jury.ENDORSEMENT[1]The appellant appeals his sentence solely on the basis of the credit he received for pretrial detention of one year. The trial judge at p. 35 of his reasons said:Having considered the evidence I am not persuaded in the circumstances of this case that there is anything exceptional about Mr. Werth’s pretrial custody that would merit an enhanced credit.It is the use of the word “exceptional” that gives rise to this appeal.[2]The appellant concedes that two and one-half years is a fit sentence, but on the basis of this court’s decision in R. v. Summers, 2013 ONCA 147 (CanLII), 114 O.R. (3d) 641 says that he is entitled to credit of 1.5 to 1 as opposed to the 1 to 1 which the trial judge gave him. It is true that in Summers, supra, it was held that the word “exceptional” does not appear in the language of the statute nor should it be read into the language.See para. 81, Summers, supra.Here the trial judge erred and used the wrong test.[3]Before us both Crown and the appellant concede that two and one-half years is a fit sentence.Accordingly, the credit to be applied is then calculated against that sentence. Based on the sentencing submissions and the record before him, there was information that supports enhanced credit being given. This includes his likely eligibility for early release.The appellant committed no breach of his bail when he was on bail, he was well behaved while in custody, and he did nothing to delay his time in pretrial custody.See also Summers, supra, paras. 123 and 125.[4]In our view, enhanced credit was justified in the circumstances. The appellant should have been credited on the basis of 1.5 for the year he spent in pretrial detention.[5]In the result, the sentence of 30 months should be reduced by 18 months to leave a net sentence of incarceration of 12 months.Additionally there was a term of two years’ probation.“K.

J.T.S.Date: 1999-03-22J.S. Natuik, for the appellant;S. Zaman, for the respondent.(AY 98-30-04021)[1]Helper, J.A.: The Crown appealed from the sentence imposed upon this young offender on one count of robbery and one count of assault. The sentencing judge ordered two years’ supervised probation on the robbery charge and one year supervised probation on the assault charge, the global sentence reaching the three-year maximum.[2]This court pronounced its decision granting leave to appeal and allowing the Crown appeal at the conclusion of the hearing. The appeal was allowed to the limited extent of adding curfew provisions to the existing probation order. These are the reasons for the decision.[3]In this case, the Crown accepted a guilty plea on only one count of robbery when, in fact, the accused admitted participation in two different robberies on the same day. On November 3, 1997, this young man, together with four other accused, committed a robbery at a Domo gas bar and later that same evening, at a Subway eatery. (These are the same robberies in which the youthful offender M. (M.) was involved.) All the accused wore disguises.[4]The police arrested all the offenders soon after the robberies took place and recovered all the stolen money. Upon his arrest, the accused admitted his involvement and was released on a promise to appear. The subsequent assault charge arose on November 27, 1997, when the accused, along with two other individuals, severely beat the complainant. The Crown proceeded with a simple assault charge against this accused, although, on the undisputed facts, the Crown would have been entitled to lay the more serious charge of assault cause bodily harm. He was also released from custody following his arrest on the assault.[5]On November 24, 1998, a year later, the accused appeared for sentencing. The sentencing judge heard submissions from counsel and remanded the accused into custody pending disposition. She did so because she was seriously considering a custodial disposition. She required time to reflect on the appropriate sentence. On November 30, 1998, the sentencing judge imposed the two probation orders.[6]There is no question that given the circumstances of these offences, the sentence imposed was a lenient one. The question for this court is whether the sentence is so lenient that it is unfit or clearly unreasonable.[7]The sentencing judge did as she was directed to do by ss. 3(1)(c.1) and 24(1) of the Young Offenders Act and by the pronouncements of this court in R. v. M.J.B. and S.K.H. (1998), 126 Man.R.(2d) 291; 167 W.A.C. 291 (C.A.), and R. v. A.M. (1998), 1998 CanLII 17786 (MB CA), 131 Man.R.(2d) 55; 187 W.A.C. 55 (C.A.). She closely examined the prospects for rehabilitation of this accused. She imposed a sentence which incorporated the principles of deterrence and denunciation, that provided direction and guidance for the accused, and that would not require him to be institutionalized.[8]The sentence under appeal comes as close to one that meets the description of “unfit” or “clearly unreasonable” as this court has been asked to review. My observation is based on this accused’s spate of criminal behaviour and his involvement in a serious assault within weeks of being released from custody on a promise to appear.[9]However, an appellate court is not entitled to substitute its view of the appropriate sentence for that of the sentencing judge. The Supreme Court has directed appellate courts to interfere in sentencing only where the sentence pronounced is “clearly unreasonable.” See R. v. Shropshire (M.T.), 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227; 188 N.R. 284; 65 B.C.A.C. 37; 106 W.A.C. 37, and R. v. McDonnell (T.E.), 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948; 210 N.R. 241; 196 A.R. 321; 141 W.A.C. 321. If the sentencing judge has applied the wrong principles or the sentence is clearly excessive or inadequate, then appellate intervention is warranted. Absent those findings, this court must defer to the sentencing judge.[10]As I noted earlier, the accused’s participation in an assault shortly after being released on a promise to appear weighs heavily towards the imposition of a custodial term. And the sentencing judge was clearly of that view when she remanded the accused into custody to allow her to consider the appropriate sentence. She correctly found that the accused’s criminal re-involvement constituted an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes. Ultimately, however, she concluded that the ends of justice could “be met by something short of a custodial disposition.” She concluded that restrictions on the accused’s liberty in the community would bring home to him the seriousness of his actions and that with the proper supervision, he could be directed towards rehabilitation.[11]I am not persuaded that she erred in imposing a non-custodial sentence.[12]In support of that conclusion, I look to the sentences imposed on this young man’s co-accused on the robberies. The adult co-accused was given a conditional sentence. N. (K.) was sentenced to time served, which was approximately three months, and placed on probation. M. (M.) was placed on probation. R. (J.) had a prior record and was on bail at the time of the commission of the offences. He was sentenced on these and other charges to a total of 30 months’ secure custody.[13]This accused is a first-time offender. The pre-disposition report indicates that he certainly has not done all that he could do to demonstrate a movement towards rehabilitation. However, there is some evidence of his potential for rehabilitation.[14]The accused’s sister addressed the court on behalf of his parents. She indicated that the accused has his family’s support. She stated that he had undergone many changes at home. His attendance at school had improved, although it was far from ideal, and he had maintained a part-time job during the school term. The accused himself indicated to the sentencing judge that his six days in custody caused him to reflect upon his actions and brought home to him the repercussions of his criminal behavior.[15]The pre-disposition report indicates that while the accused did express some remorse for having committed these offences and for the victims of the offences, there appeared to be some superficiality to that remorse. He appeared to focus more on how these offences have had an impact on his life, rather than on the victims’ lives. However, before the sentencing judge, the accused appeared to express genuine remorse.[16]This accused requires strong, consistent supervision in the community. With that in mind, the sentencing judge imposed a probation order which required him to attend school regularly and/or to seek employment, to attend counselling as directed by the probation officer, to complete 200 hours of community service within six months, and make restitution of $25. She made a firearms prohibition pursuant to s. 100(1) of the Criminal Code for a period of ten years and ordered no association with his co-accused. What the sentencing judge failed to do was impose a curfew on this accused and ensure that he abide by that curfew.[17]To ensure that the accused does have his liberty in the community curtailed, the probation order will be varied to include a provision that during the first 18 months of his probationary period, he will reside with his parents and he will obey a curfew from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., except when he is required to attend at his place of employment. He will appear, when required, for all curfew checks. To that limited extent, leave to appeal was granted and the appeal allowed. In all other respects, the sentence imposed at trial is confirmed.Appeal dismissed."}

Giovannetti for the RespondentAppeal Heard: September 13, 1995Judgment Delivered: October 10, 1995THE COURT:Leave to appeal refused, per reasons for judgment of Pugsley, J.A., Freeman and Jones, JJ.A. concurring.PUGSLEY, J.A.:E.N.H., 20 years of age, while represented by counsel, and after five court appearances, pleaded guilty to robbery of a branch of the Hong Kong Bank of Canada in Dartmouth, on October 27, 1994, contrary to s. 344 of the Criminal Code, as well as the unlawful use of a handgun employed during the course of the robbery, contrary to s. 85(1) of the Code.He was sentenced, on February 10, 1995, to a total of six years' imprisonment, five years for the robbery, and one year consecutive for the firearms offence.He applies for leave to appeal and, if successful, appeals the sentence.Section 85(1)©) of the Code provides that:\"Everyone who uses a firearm... whether or not he causes or means to cause bodily harm to any person as a result thereof, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment(c) in the case of a first offence, except as provided in paragraph (d) for not more than fourteen years and not less than one year...\". [emphasis added]The appeal then is confined to a consideration of whether the sentence of five years for robbery is manifestly excessive.Mr. E.N.H. was unrepresented and conducted his own appeal.The following issues were stressed by him during the course of his submissions:1.He is a first-time offender, is impulsive by nature, and his involvement in the subsequent activity was the result of a \"spur of the moment\" decision. The sentencing judge failed to give appropriate consideration to these considerations, as well as the importance of rehabilitation.2.The sentencing judge failed to give appropriate weight to the factor that \"need\" rather than \"greed\" compelled him to commit the offence.3.The sentencing judge failed to give consideration to his remorse for the commission of the offence.It is helpful to review the facts:-At 1:55 p.m., on October 27, 1994, one Webber, carrying asawed-off shotgun, and Mr. E.N.H., carrying a handgun,entered the bank, then occupied by two clerks and acustomer;-E.N.H.'s face was covered so that only his eyes were visible,and Webber wore dark glasses;-Upon entry, Webber ordered the three within the bankpremises to \"hit the floor and give us your money\". He thenordered one of the clerks to place the cash in her till in a bagwhich he threw at her. The clerk cleaned out the cashdrawer, placing approximately $6,000 (including markedmoney) in the bag;-Mr. E.N.H. approached the other clerk and, referring to herdesk, demanded: \"open your drawers\". The clerk complied;As the duo left the bank, one of them stated:\"Don't (expletive) follow me or you're dead\";-The intrusion into the bank lasted less than three minutes. Acar and driver were waiting for the two and immediatelydeparted the scene. Webber and the driver were arrestedshortly thereafter, and strong circumstantial evidence led toE.N.H.'s arrest the following day;-The shotgun, when recovered by the police, was loaded. Thehandgun was never recovered but defence counselrepresented that it was unloaded at the time of the robbery;-Webber, who had robbed the same branch a month earlier,was sentenced to a total of twelve years' imprisonment for thetwo robberies.This conviction is Mr. E.N.H.'s first in which violence has been involved and also his first as an adult.During the course of his submissions on sentence, Crown Counsel advised the trial judge that Mr. E.N.H. had been convicted of thirteen offences under the Criminal Code, mostly for theft-related matters.Six of these convictions occurred prior to 1991.Defence Counsel made no objection to the reference to Mr. E.N.H.'s complete criminal record as a young person, indeed, Counsel agreed with the details stated.The Court should not consider Mr. E.N.H.'s record as a young person before 1991 as his prior record is deemed to have expired, ss. 36 and 45 of the Young Offenders Act, R.S.C. (1985), c. Y-1, (R. v. B.F.R. (1995), 1995 CanLII 4303 (NS CA), 139 N.S.R. (2d) 215 (N.S.C.A.)).The trial judge, in the course of his sentencing remarks, made no comment concerning Mr. E.N.H.'s record.The post-1990 record of convictions, in my opinion, has some relevance and could appropriately be considered by this Court.Mr. E.N.H.'s age, while a factor, should not materially lessen the length of the sentence. The Court must, of course, consider the importance of reclaiming the individual when fashioning a sentence but that laudable objective must, in cases of this kind, yield to the primary object of protection of the community.Chief Justice MacKeigan, on behalf of this Court, stated in R. v. Hingley, [1977] 19 N.S.R. (2d) 541, at 544:\"We must begin with the premise that armed robbery and robbery with violence require strongly deterrent sentences of imprisonment. Only where such an offence is isolated, minor, and committed, perhaps impulsively or drunkenly, by a very young person or one of previously good character, should sentences as low as two or three years' imprisonment be considered.\"Chief Justice MacKeigan cited with approval the following comments of Tysoe, J.A., in R. v. Nutter, Collishaw and Dulong (1972), 7 C.C.C. (2d) 224 (B.C.C.A.):\"I do not think the age of a person makes much difference when they are committing these violent crimes. Young men who persist in committing crimes of this sort cannot expect that their ages will be regarded as mitigating circumstances... Crimes of this sort will not be stopped if men who commit them run the risk of only comparatively short terms of imprisonment. The judges owe a duty to the community and to the vast majority of law-abiding citizens who comprise it to protect it as best they can and to impose sentences that will constitute real deterrents. I stress the word \"real\" deterrence not only to the persons who have committed the crimes, but to persons who might tend or be disposed to think about committing them.\"A review of the cases reveals that bank robbery attracts some of the highest sentences imposed for the offence of robbery. Even when committed by first offenders, they attract penalties of from six to ten years R. v. Leet (1989), 88 N.S.R. (2d) 161 N.S.C.A.).Banks, by necessity, as is well known, carry large amounts of currency. The media have reported a substantial increase in bank robberies in the Halifax-Dartmouth area in the past year. The courts should play their part to discourage this type of activity by the imposition of significant sentences, expressive of general deterrence.Mr. E.N.H. acknowledged that he was an \"active participant\" in the crime.The evidence bears out that admission. Even if one assumes that the handgun that he carried was unloaded, Mr. E.N.H. used it in such a manner as to convey the impression to the staff and customer that it was loaded. The sense of peril to the members of the public must have been both immediate and real.It is a reasonable inference that Mr. E.N.H. knew that Mr. Webber had successfully robbed the same branch a few weeks earlier and that the shotgun which Webber carried was loaded. E.N.H., in my opinion, played an integral role in an escapade that had the potential to result in serious injury or death to a number of innocent persons.Mr. E.N.H. submits that he was the sole support of his four siblings, that in order to provide the necessities of life for his and their survival, he sold off his car, his tools, and other possessions; that they survived without heat or water for two weeks prior to the offence, and that he has a promise of a job to assist him in providing for his family, including his girlfriend, who was four months pregnant at the time the offence was committed.Mr. E.N.H., who appeared both articulate and poised in his submissions to this Court, referred to Ruby, Sentencing, Fourth Edition, 143. He presumably was relying upon the following comment by that author:\"Crimes motivated by certain personal circumstances of a temporary nature are often viewed as mitigating. Financial difficulties, marital and family problems, emotional problems, medical problems, all have been accepted in mitigation of sentence. Of particular importance are the \"twin plagues\" of domestic misfortune and sorry economic conditions.\"The personal economic difficulties experienced by Mr. E.N.H. are no justification for the commission of the offence of armed robbery. While they may constitute a factor to be considered, they are not entitled to much weight in view of the circumstances surrounding the commission of this crime. (See comments of Nemetz, C.J., on behalf of the Court in Regina v. Belmas, Hansen and Taylor (1986), 1986 CanLII 1158 (BC CA), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 142 at 153 (B.C.C.A).)Mr. E.N.H. knew that he was associating with an experienced and sophisticated bank robber who had personal experience with the branch in question. The details of the robbery were well planned as is evidenced by the very short period of time that the participants were required to spend on the bank premises.At the sentencing hearing, Mr. E.N.H. stated in part:\"I wish I had another chance to take back what I have done. I know I have hurt people unnecessarily. I have never hurt anyone intentionally in my life and I feel angry with myself knowing what I have done. Almost every night I lay in my bed wishing I could go see the people I have hurt and apologize to them. Even though they would probably not forgive me, it might give me some satisfaction knowing I tried.\"On the hearing of this appeal, Mr. E.N.H. introduced a letter addressed to the employees of the bank expressing his remorse.One cannot help but view this communication with scepticism. The letter was prepared shortly before the matter was heard by the Court and almost ten months after the commission of the offence.Genuine remorse is of course an appropriate factor to be taken into account but the remorse expressed by Mr. E.N.H. should not have been a major factor affecting sentence by either the trial judge, or the review by this Court.While Mr. E.N.H.'s guilty plea is a matter that should have some mitigating effect, it should be borne in mind that it was entered on the fifth court appearance when it was clear that the circumstantial evidence linking Mr. E.N.H. to the crime was compelling. The plea might be characterized as a \"recognition of the inevitable\". R. v. Fauld (1995), 1994 CanLII 770 (ON CA), 20 OR (3d) 13).In the course of his argument, Mr. E.N.H. directed the attention of this Court to a decision of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal R. v. Meads, King, Hoffman (1986), 60 Nfld and P.E.I.R., 65). Three female accused were sentenced to four months' imprisonment plus two years' probation for armed robbery. The Newfoundland Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal and increased the term of imprisonment to nine months for each of the offenders.The case, in my opinion, is clearly distinguishable. The respondents were aged 18, 19, and 20, had no previous records, and no firearm was used in the course of the robbery.The comments of Mifflin, C.J. on behalf of the Court are pertinent to the present case:\"Like any other case the sentence imposed in armed robbery cases must depend on the circumstances of each case, and the several principles governing sentences must be applied.The trial judge referred to the principles of deterrence and reformation and rehabilitation, and stated that in the case of young people who were first-time offenders, that appeal courts say that rehabilitation has to be emphasized. If by that the trial judge means that rehabilitation and reformation must transcend the principle of general deterrence in armed robbery cases where youthful first offenders are involved, then, with respect, I must disagree. In the case of first offenders the principles of rehabilitation must always be taken into consideration as well as individual deterrents. However, in my respectful opinion, in the case of armed robbery, general deterrence must be the principal consideration and a term of imprisonment of sufficient severity must be imposed to reflect society's abhorrence of this crime and to warn likeminded people of the grave consequences of such criminal activity.\"Mr. E.N.H. has been incarcerated at Springhill penitentiary since October of 1994. He read to the Court a progress report prepared by one of the supervisors at that institution which indicates that he has excellent motivation, is conscientious in his work, and is trying to maintain a positive attitude.It is obvious from his presentation and appearance before us that he is intelligent and has potential. His progress at Springhill is to be commended and, hopefully, he will use his talents, upon release, to enhance society.The sentence imposed, in my opinion, was, if anything, lenient, and most certainly, not manifestly excessive.I would decline to grant leave.Pugsley, J.A.Concurred in:Freeman, J.A.Jones, J.A.CANADAPROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA1995501531501537IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIAon appeal fromTHE PROVINCIAL COURTHER MAJESTY THE QUEENversusE.N.H.HEARD BEFORE:The Honourable Judge John G.

Marleyfor the appellantChristine Tierfor the respondentHEARD \u0026 RELEASED ORALLY:February 25, 2005On appeal from the conviction entered on October 10, 2003 and the sentence imposed on December 15, 2003 by Justice John H. Brockenshire of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury.E N D O R S E M E N T[1]The appellant appeals his conviction for sexual assault following a jury trial presided over by Brockenshire J.He also seeks leave to appeal his sentence of nine months followed by two years probation.[2]Although the appellant should have been present on the two occasions in issue, we are satisfied that he suffered no prejudice as a result of his absence.In our view, the respondent has satisfied the burden of establishing that, notwithstanding the errors made by the trial judge, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice was occasioned as the appellant sustained no prejudice as a result of his brief absence from the courtroom and from the pre-charge conference.Concerning the second ground of appeal, the record does not support the appellant’s contention that he did not have a fair trial because the jury, which took nine hours to reach its verdict, rushed its deliberations so that it would not have to deliberate during a holiday weekend.On the record before us, we are satisfied that the appellant received a fair trial.Consequently, in the circumstances of this case it is appropriate to apply the proviso and to dismiss the appeal from conviction.[3]With respect to sentence, we are prepared to grant leave to appeal.The trial judge sentenced the appellant to nine months, which exceeded the term recommend by the Crown.The trial judge recommended that the sentence be served in the Ontario Correctional Institute where he hoped that the appellant would receive appropriate sexual offender treatment.He assumed that a sentence of nine months was required to ensure that treatment was obtained.However, the trial judge had no evidence as to whether such treatment was available at the Ontario Correctional Institute and, if so, the length of a sentence necessary to provide effective treatment.In our view, exceeding the Crown’s submission without an adequate evidential foundation constituted an error in principle.As well, no evidence was provided to this court with respect to the nature of treatment, if any, available at the Ontario Correctional Institute.[4]In our view, the term of four to six months imprisonment recommended by the Crown was reasonable and should have been given effect by the trial judge.However, a conditional sentence is in our view inappropriate as this was the second offence of sexual assault upon a young girl committed by the appellant.The appellant served one month of the sentence subsequent to conviction.We would allow the sentence appeal and vary the sentence to one of four months, one month of which has been served.In addition, the appellant will be on probation for two years on the statutory terms.An additional term of probation is that he shall attend for treatment at the Windsor Sex Offenders Treatment Program, or such program as will be arranged by his probation officer.“S.

Schuler, at Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, on Tuesday, August 10, A.D., 2004.APPEARANCES:Mr. S. Hinkley:Counsel for the CrownMr. G. Watt:Counsel for the AccusedCharge under s. 271 of the Criminal Code of CanadaBan on Publication of Complainant/ Witness Pursuant to Section 486 of the Criminal CodeTHE COURT:Mr. Casaway, before I sentence you, is there anything you would like to say? If there is you may stand and say it.THE ACCUSED:Thank you, Your Honour, I’ve realized that being in court is not a pleasant thing, whether you are the accused or I would more imagine more so being a victim, and having said that I leave myself at the mercy of Your Honour.THE COURT:All right. Thank you.Marc Casaway has been convicted by me after a trial on a charge of sexual assault. The facts very briefly are that on April 21, 2003, he put his finger in the vagina of a then 11-year-old girl who was sleeping in the living room with another young girl. Mr. Casaway was going out with the victim’s mother at the time and from time to time would stay overnight at her apartment, which is where he was that night and where the sexual assault occurred.The relationship between Mr. Casaway and the victim’s mother was, from the evidence at trial, an off-and-on one and there is no evidence that he acted as a parent in any way to the victim. He was, however, an adult approximately 47 years old at the time of the offence and a guest in the victim’s home and she said in her evidence that she trusted him.There is an element of breach of trust in this case in the sense that any adult in a home where there[Page 1]is a child has at least a moral obligation to ensure the child does not come to harm. So that element of trust and accordingly breach of that trust is an aggravating factor in this case.Mr. Casaway is 47 years old and originally from Fort Resolution. It is clear from what has been said by his counsel that he had a very difficult family background with involvement by Social Services and much disruption in his home life. He has, however, pursued education and has had good and steady employment, although twice he has lost employment due to drinking.It has also been said that he has a drinking problem, that he describes himself as an alcoholic. note, however, as was conceded by defence counsel, that there was no evidence at all that at the time of the offence he was under the influence of alcohol.Mr. Casaway has a criminal record which is quite dated but is related in that it contains convictions for assault causing bodily harm in 1982, assault in 1986 and more importantly two convictions for sexual assault in 1990. The assaults are related in that they are of fences against the person.With respect to the sexual assault convictions, counsel has advised that these were for fondling his minor niece in 1987. The sentences imposed were seven days’ intermittent on each charge consecutive and reflect -- and I infer from them that the offences must[Page 2]have been at the less serious end of the scale of sexual assault offences.The evidence at trial revealed that Mr. Casaway made apologies to the victim and her mother and led them to believe that he was going to plead guilty to this charge and he did waive his preliminary hearing. However, he did not plead guilty and this matter did proceed to trial. The law is clear that he cannot be treated more severely because he pleaded not guilty. He simply does not get the usual mitigating benefit of a guilty plea.As far as whether any credit should be given for the apologies that he made, I think the effect of them is to a large extent simply cancelled out by the fact that he did go to trial. Certainly there is some mitigation in the fact that he waived the preliminary hearing because it did mean that the victim did not have to testify twice.I have been told on this hearing that the victim did not wish to complete a Victim Impact Statement and of course that is completely her choice. She did testify at trial that she felt ashamed and she was clearly upset at points during her testimony. In any event, the effects of child sexual abuse are well documented and although nothing specific has been put forward in this case it is a fair assumption that she will have some difficulties at least as a result of[Page ]this event.Defence counsel advised that Mr. Casaway himself was sexually molested by a baby-sitter as a child. Unfortunately that is not a very unusual circumstance. Sadly people who are molested as children sometimes do go on to in turn molest children when they become adults. The main significance I think of that is that Mr. Casaway would know the troubling effects and would know the suffering that he would cause a child by doing to her the type of thing that had been done to him.I want to note here that neither counsel referred in their sentencing submissions to the proposed similar fact evidence which I ruled inadmissible at trial so I will just say so that it is clear that having ruled it inadmissible at trial I am not considering it on the sentence.The cases that have been filed by counsel, which are very helpful, refer to a wide range of sexual activity and offenders in a wide range of personal circumstances. Each case has its own mitigating and aggravating factors. It is obvious that sexual abuse of children is a problem in our society, not just here in the Northwest Territories but all over Canada, and it is obvious that it must be dealt with by significant sanctions.That the governing principles are denunciation and deterrence has been reiterated many times by many[Page 4]courts. In this case individual deterrence is also a factor and, in my view, it is a significant factor in that Mr. Casaway has a prior record for sexually assaulting another young girl. The record is old, the offences having occurred approximately 17 years ago. He was a mature man then. Now, even older, he has yet again sexually assaulted a young girl and more seriously this time than the last.He has never sought professional help despite having repeated the behaviour and having told the victim’s mother in a telephone call on April 21st, 2003, that he had to deal with his problem. I, of course, don’t know exactly how serious his problem is or what kind of help he needs or whether the help he needs is available to him here in the Northwest Territories.Crown counsel seeks a custodial sentence in the range of 30 months - in other words, two and a half years - to four years. Defence seeks a custodial sentence of nine months to a year and a lengthy period of probation. I think that on the facts of this case and considering Mr. Casaway’s background, I have to be concerned about whether he is a danger to the community and in particular what I mean by that is young girls. There is no evidence before me that there have been any incidents in the interim - in other words, between 1987 and 2003 - and I am not presuming that there have been,[Page 5]but it is clear to me that having once done this type of thing - in other words, sexually assaulted a young girl - having gone to court for it, been sentenced for it, Mr. Casaway obviously had a problem then and he has now repeated it again in 2003. SO the problem is still there.In my view, the circumstances require that there be a custodial sentence. I will recommend as part of that -- I will have the warrant endorsed to recommend that he get counselling. I hope that he will avail himself of that. With Mr. Casaway’s age and considering that he hasn’t yet chosen to get help I don’t think a probation order is really suitable in the circumstances.Stand please, Mr. Casaway. In all the circumstances, the sentence I impose on you is two years in gaol. The warrant will be endorsed with a recommendation that you receive any counselling that the correctional authorities can make available to you and that is appropriate to sexual offenders. You can sit down.I have signed the DNA order, counsel. Having not heard any submissions and understanding that it is on consent, it is appropriate that that order issue.With respect to a firearm prohibition order, I do take into account that Mr. Casaway is aboriginal, that he does stay, it appears, for some periods of time at a[Page 6]camp, that although close to Yellowknife is a camp out in the bush. I take into account that there was no firearm used in the commission of this offence and that he has no firearm offences on his record.In the circumstances I am satisfied that he may require a firearm for purposes of sustenance when he is at his camp. There will be a firearm prohibition order for a period of time that commences today and expires 10 years from his release from imprisonment, but under section 113 of the Criminal Code I will authorize the chief firearms officer and the registrar to issue such authorizations and other documents that are mentioned under section 113 as Mr. Casaway may need for sustenance purposes, and if he does have any firearms they are to be surrendered forthwith to the RCMP. The victim fine surcharge will be waived in the circumstances.MR. HINKLEY:Just one final piece of housekeeping. I believe that there was a publication ban with respect to a number of items. I would just like to have that reiterated by the court for the record.THE COURT:Yes, there is a ban on publication of the name of the complainant in this case and any information that might identify her.MR. HINKLEY:Thank you very much, Your Honour.THE COURT:Is there anything further from you,[Page 7]Mr. Watt?MR. WATT:No, Your Honour.THE COURT:All right. Thank you both for your conduct of the case. Close court.(AT WHICH TIME THE PROCEEDINGS CONCLUDED)Certified to be a true and accurate transcript, pursuant to Rules 723 and 724 of the Supreme Court Rules.Janet HarderCourt Reporter[Page 8]"}

Budgell, for Jhadiel MichaelRyan))A NON-PUBLICATION AND NON-BROADCAST ORDER HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS PROCEEDING UNDER THE CRIMINAL CODE OF CANADAREASONS FOR SENTENCEHOURIGAN J.[1]Jhadiel Michael Ryan pleaded guilty to one count of sexual assault and one count of failure to comply with a probation order.Circumstances of the Offences[2]A synopsis of the circumstances of the offences was filed on consent and reads follows:The victim and the accused were dating between November 2009 and April 2010.The victim ended the relationship however they would occasionally communicate through computer and telephone contact.On May 19th, 2010 while communicating over telephone text messages, the accused arranged to meet with the victim.The accused picked the victim up in his vehicle at approximately 7:15 p.m. and the pair drove around for a short time.The accused took the victim to his residence at C[…] Way in the City of Milton.The victim and the accused went to his bedroom and closed the bedroom door.The accused told the victim to stand up from his bed.He began to caress the victim’s arms and legs.The victim told him to stop and pushed him away.The accused pushed the victim on to his bed, turned her onto her stomach and handcuffed her hands behind her back.The accused removed the victim’s pants and pushed her tops aside.He began to kiss her body.The victim told the accused to stop.The victim began to cry and the accused told her to stop, or his mother (who was present in the home) would hear and he’d get into trouble.The accused placed a pillow over the victim’s face.The accused held a camera and the victim could hear a click as though a picture was being taken, however she did not see a flash.The accused released her from the handcuffs and kept her on the bed.The accused told the victim that if she gave him oral sex she could leave.The victim refused and kept her head turned away from the accused.The accused pushed the victim to her knees, and removed her underwear.The accused knelt beside the victim and penetrated the victim’s vagina with his penis.The accused forced sexual intercourse on the victim.The accused did not use a condom and it is unknown if he ejaculated.The accused stopped the assault and told the victim to re-dress.The accused insisted on driving the victim home.The victim refused and the accused walked the victim partial way home.The accused insisted the victim give him a hug and then “high fived” the victim.The victim called her mother and continued on her way home.At approximately 9:30 p.m. the police were contacted and the victim attended the hospital and had a Sexual Assault Evidence Kit collected.The victim provided a voluntary statement to police outlining the above incident.The accused was subsequently arrested by Halton Regional Police.The accused was provided his Rights to Counsel and Cautions and was afforded the opportunity to speak with Counsel in private.The accused declined to provide a statement to police.A search warrant was executed on the accused’s bedroom.Police seized the handcuffs used in the assault, along with the keys and case.In addition, several cameras, computers and cellular phones were seized as well as the accused’s bedding.A forensic examination was done on the electronics seized from the accused’s bedroom which initially did not reveal any images related to the sexual assault of the victim.Immediately after the preliminary hearing, one of the camera memory cards was forensically examined a second time, using newly acquired, more up to date hardware suitable for high capacity cards.This search revealed a video of the initial part of the offences, depicting the victim handcuffed, crying and begging to be let go.In addition, samples from the SAEK done at the hospital were sent to CFS for testing.Forensic DNA testing resulted in confirming the presence of semen in the vaginal swab taken from the complainant.Comparison revealed that this was the accused’s DNA.On March 2nd, 2009 the accused, Jahdiel Ryan, was placed on a valid probation order for the offence of Sexual Assault.This Probation order was signed by Justice R.J. LeDressay of the Ontario Court of Justice in the City of Burlington and included several conditions including:Keep the Peace and be of Good behaviour.On May 19th, 2010, while bound by said order, the accused failed to comply with this Probation Order when he sexually assaulted this victim and confined her to his room.The accused was subsequently charged with Fail to Comply Probation Order, section 733.1(1).[3]A description of the content of the videotape was also filed on consent and reads as follows:The video is 1 minute and 2 seconds in length.The victim V.T. is on the accused’s bed is wearing only a bra and underwear.VT:“Why are you doing this to me?”Accused:“This is what you wanted from me.”VT:“No, it’s not, honestly I only wanted to talk.I didn’t want anything else.”Video then pans to her face and it appeared her eyes were closed, she then turned her head sideways.Upset and crying.Accused:(inaudible)“You look good, turn and look at me.”VT:Turns her head and says “no”.In obvious distress.Accused:“Look at me, baby.”VT:“No, I can’t do this.Why are you doing this to me?”Accused:“Shhh, this is what you wanted.”VT:“No it’s...inaudible...”Accused:“Shhh, don’t scream, don’t scream.”VT:“Just let me go please, Ryan please, just let me go!”Accused:“Shhh, baby, shhh.”VT:“Let me go.I will never speak to you again.”Accused:“Shh, don’t worry, turn around.”VT:“No, don’t do this to me.”She is now crying loudly.Accused:“I love you so much, you have no idea.”VT:“If you did you wouldn’t be doing this.”You can now see the victim’s back and her hands are handcuffed.“Please don’t.I don’t want this.”Video ends.Circumstances of the Offender[4]Mr. Ryan was born in North York, Ontario, in 1983.According to his presentence report, Mr. Ryan had a stable childhood and continued in school to grade 11 when he left school due to a lack of interest in academics.From the time of leaving school Mr. Ryan has been in the work force, however, he has not had any long-term viable employment.[5]According to the presentence report, since his arrest on the charges herein, Mr. Ryan has continued to reside with his mother and worked at casual employment with the Rogers Centre in Toronto as an event usher.In this position, he works a few days per month and earns between one hundred and two hundred dollars per month.He is also attempting to start his own Internet-based music business.[6]Mr. Ryan’s mother stated that she had encouraged Mr. Ryan to return to college for training, but that he has been unwilling to do so.Mr. Ryan did attend a six-month employment preparation program through Ontario Works which was completed in November 2011.[7]There is no indication of any alcohol abuse on behalf of Mr. Ryan.Similarly, although Mr. Ryan admits to occasional use of marihuana in the past, there is no concern regarding drug use by any of the collateral sources contacted during the preparation of the presentence report.[8]Mr. Ryan was convicted on March 2, 2009 of sexual assault against an adolescent female.He received a 90-day jail term followed by two years probation.Mr. Ryan continued throughout the probation period to deny any offending behaviour.The probation period expired on April 29, 2011.[9]During the course of his probation, Mr. Ryan was referred for a risk assessment test conducted by Bruce Cook, a clinical psychologist.He was diagnosed as afflicted with adjustment disorder and anti-social and paranoid personality traits.According to the presentence report, counselling was recommended to him to address stressors in his life and the denial of anti-social behaviour, but he was not assessed as a suitable candidate for specific sex offence counselling because of his extreme state of denial.At the time he was assessed as a moderate high risk to re-offend.According to the presentence report, Mr. Ryan did attend counselling sessions, but was not enthusiastic about participating and did not develop significant insight into his behaviour.[10]The author of the presentence report noted that during his interview for the report Mr. Ryan did acknowledge responsibility for the current offences and displayed insight into underlying anger and control issues.The author of the report concluded:While the Offender has expressed some insight into his pattern of offending, he has done little in life to address his personality deficits.He has not sought any further counselling and has done little to address his employment or lack of independence.In addition to his sexual deviancy and power and control issues, these personality deficits leave the Offender at high risk to re-offend.Impact on Victim[11]A victim impact statement was filed at the sentencing hearing. The victim reported that the sexual assault has caused her emotional harm, including stress, trust issues and has adversely impacted her relationship with her boyfriend.She is now seeing a therapist and was placed on medication to control her anger.[12]The victim also reports that she received a sexually transmitted disease, Trichomoniasis, as result of the assault.[13]The victim states that as result of the assault she has moved back in with her mother because her mother’s residence is more secure. She also eventually dropped out of school because she was missing classes due to a lack of sleep. Finally, she was forced to purchase a car so that she would not have to walk anywhere at night.Position of the Crown[14]The Crown submits that a period of incarceration of between five and five-and-a-half years is appropriate in the circumstances.The Crown also seeks a section 109 order, a Sexual Offender Information Registry Act order and a forfeiture order.[15]The Crown acknowledges Mr. Ryan’s guilty plea as a mitigating factor.However, the Crown submits that there are a series of aggravating factors that should be taken into account.First, is the fact that the victim was handcuffed and a pillow was placed over her head so that Mr. Ryan’s mother would not be alerted.Second, is that during the initial part of the offence Mr. Ryan videotaped the victim.Third, the accused had a prior conviction for sexual assault and was still on probation for that offence at the time of this offence.Fourth, the Crown submits that this was a breach of trust as the victim was formerly involved in an intimate relationship with Mr. Ryan and that is why he had the ability to commit the offence.Finally, the Crown notes that the accused did not use a condom during the offence.[16]The Crown acknowledges that the case law relied upon is not on all fours with the situation in this case.She submits that normally the conduct in this case would warrant a sentence of three to four years incarceration, relying upon the following authorities: R v. M.K., [2005] O.J. No. 127 (Ont. C.A.), R. v. J.S., [2011] O.J. No. 4684 (Ont. S.C.J.), R v. Parker, [2012] Q.J. No. 5739 (Court of Que.), R v. Barton, [2002] O.J. No. 4105 (Ont. C.A.) and R v. R.D.C., [2005] O.J. No. 2922 (Ont. C.A.). However, she submits that the sentence should be increased because of the aggravating circumstances referred to above.Position of the Defence[17]The defence submits that an appropriate sentence is in the range of three years incarceration.[18]Defence counsel submits that Mr. Ryan is in the early stages of acknowledging that he has a problem.Counsel notes that her client attended follow-up sessions with Bruce Cook, but stopped taking counselling after his probation ended.[19]Defence counsel points to Mr. Ryan’s guilty plea as a mitigating factor.She also notes there was no prior abuse in the relationship and that Mr. Ryan was fully compliant with the terms of his bail.[20]With respect to case law relied upon by the defence, counsel concedes that there is nothing directly on point, but she submits that a sentence of incarceration of three years is within the appropriate range.She relies on the decision of Justice Croll in R. v. J.R. [2005] O.J. No. 4825 (Ont. S.C.) wherein the accused pleaded guilty to sexual assault and uttering a death threat.He was sentenced to a two-year penitentiary term concurrent on both counts.[21]The defence also relies on R. v. Bridgemohan, 2009 ONCA 577 (CanLII).In that case, the appellant appealed his conviction by a jury of sexual assault and his sentence of four-and-a-half years in custody.On appeal, the court reduced the sentence to three years.The defence notes that in that case there was previous convictions for sexual assault and forcible confinement.[22]The defence relies on R. v. Quesnelle.In that case, the accused was sentenced following a conviction on two counts of sexual assault and two counts of assault.Both victims who were sexually assaulted were punched in the face or on the jaw and then forced to engage in anal intercourse.The accused was sentenced to three years on the first sexual assault and three-and-a-half years on the second sexual assault, to be served consecutively.[23]Finally, the defence relies on R. v. Thomas, 2011 ONSC 4050 (CanLII).In that case, Justice Spies sentenced the accused for two counts of sexual assault, attempt to obstruct justice and breach of recognizance.The accused was sentenced to 22 months.[24]Defence counsel submits that every sexual assault case has aggravating factors and that a sentence in the range of three years is well within the range.She submitted that she has no issue with the ancillary orders sought, but submits that the camera and media card in the camera should not be subject to a forfeiture order.Analysis[25]The general principles of sentencing were summarized by Justice Trafford in R. v.Palantzas (2009), unreported:Under s. 718 of the Code, the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing a just sanction.Any such sanction must, looking at the case as a whole, be the result of a fair and balanced consideration of the need to:•denounce the unlawful conduct;•deter the offender, and others, from committing such an offence;•separate the offender from society, where necessary;•assist in the rehabilitation of the offender;•provide reparation for harm done to \"victims\", or the community;and•provide a sense of responsibility in the offender, while acknowledging the harm done to the \"victims\" and the community.Section 718.1 of the Code requires the sentence to be proportionate to the offence and the degree of the offender's responsibility.An offender is not to be deprived of his liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances of the case.All available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances must be considered for all offenders.It is to be emphasized that these principles of sentencing do not include a principle of revenge.Offenders are not incarcerated for the purpose of establishing an equivalence between the loss of the victim, or victims, and the sanction imposed by the Court.Rather, the Court is required to recognize the inherent worth and dignity of the offender and, having balanced the principles provided by the Code, determine a fit sentence in the circumstances of the case.This is the Canadian tradition, a tradition that enjoys a long and respected history in Canada and other free and democratic societies like it throughout the world.[26]Given Mr. Ryan’s relatively young age, any sentence cannot stymie his ability to be rehabilitated, but I note that Mr. Ryan has failed in the past to make use of opportunities for rehabilitation.[27]In my view, a sentence in the range of approximately three to four years incarceration is appropriate in circumstances where the offender has a previous conviction for sexual assault, has pleaded guilty and has expressed remorse for his actions.However, regard must be had to the aggravating factors in this case.I disagree with the assertion made by defence counsel that all sexual assaults by their nature contain aggravating factors and thus those factors should not be considered in fashioning an appropriate sentence.[28]In this case at bar, the most significant aggravating factors are the videotaping of the initial stages of the offence and the fact that the victim was handcuffed.Both of these actions were undertaken as a means of asserting control over the victim and as part of an effort to degrade and humiliate her.[29]Turning first to the videotaping, neither counsel was able to provide me with any authority where the impact of the videotaping of a sexual assault was considered by our courts.It is a reasonable inference that the videotaping was done for the purpose of later use for the offender’s sexual gratification and/or for subsequent distribution.[30]We live in a digital age where information may be uploaded to the Internet in a matter of seconds and thereafter its use and distribution will be beyond the control of any party.In the case of a sexual assault, the potential for such a video to be uploaded means that a victim may be revictimized countless times as the video is downloaded in the future.I acknowledge that in the case at bar that there is no evidence that the video has been disturbed, but the potential for distribution certainly was there at the time the video was made. The possible future use of the video for the offender’s sexual gratification also leads to a potential of revictimization.[31]The handcuffing of the victim during the assault is also a significant aggravating factor. This action demonstrates a need on the part of the offender to exercise control over the victim and to humiliate her.Disposition[32]I conclude that a fit sentence in all of the circumstances is 54 months of incarceration on the count of sexual assault.I conclude that a fit sentence for the count of fail to comply with a probation order is 6 months incarceration.These sentences shall be served concurrently.[33]Sexual assault is a primary designated offence and a DNA order is mandatory unless the offender has brought himself within the exception.Mr. Ryan did not do so and, accordingly, a DNA order will go.[34]Similarly, an order for compliance with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for a period of twenty years is mandatory unless the offender bring himself within the exception.Mr. Ryan did not do so. That order will go for a period of twenty years. I make this order because Mr. Ryan has committed a very serious sexual offence and I do not conclude that the order will have a disproportionate impact on his privacy or liberty interests.[35]The forfeiture order sought by the Crown will also go.This order was not opposed by the defence, with the exception of the camera and the media card.Those items were integrally involved in the commission of the sexual assault and I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that they are offence-related property.I order that those items are subject to my forfeiture order.[36]A section 109 weapons prohibition order for life will also issue.HOURIGAN J.Released: January 14, 2013CITATION: R. v.

Haines of the Superior Court of Justice dated October 6, 2004.A P P E A LB O O KE N D O R S E M E N T[1]In our view, the sentence of six months imprisonment plus one year probation imposed by the trial judge was woefully inadequate. This was a case of forced sexual intercourse by a twenty-four year old man on a vulnerable seventeen-year-old complainant. The respondent persisted in the sexual assault despite knowing, from the night before, that the complainant was not interested in having sexual relations with him and despite the complainant’s attempts to resist the respondent, including her verbal protestations, her crying and her efforts to physically remove him. The complainant at the time of the offence was particularly vulnerable and the humiliation and degradation she suffered was no doubt exacerbated by the presence of the respondent’s friend Y throughout the event.[2]In short, this was a serious crime and it called for a substantial period of incarceration.While a penitentiary term would not have been inappropriate, in all of the circumstances, including the respondent’s prior unblemished background and the fact that he is presently incarcerated in the provincial system, we are of the view that a fit sentence is one of two years less a day plus probation for one year on the terms and conditions imposed by the trial judge.[3]Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted and the sentence is increased to two years less one day. In all other respects, the sentence imposed by the trial judge shall remain the same."}

No. 2/2012Judicial Centre:Prince AlbertBETWEEN:HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN- and -DANIELLE NADINE CHAMAKESECounsel:Cameron B. Scottfor the CrownGreg A. Chovinfor the accusedSENTENCING JUDGMENTR.S. SMITH J.February 11, 2014[1]Danielle Chamakese has been found guilty of leaving the scene of an accident contrary to s. 252(1.3) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C‑46, and dangerous driving causing death contrary to s. 249(4) of the Criminal Code. These are very serious charges.[2]The convictions arise from a tragic incident which took place in the early hours of September 19, 2010, at the corner of 14th Street West and Second Avenue West, in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.[3]I reviewed the facts in detail when I delivered my judgment. There is no need to do it again. Suffice it to say, that in those terrible minutes, Ms. Chamakese’s driving constituted a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in those circumstances. Additionally, she knew that she had hit someone and decided she could not face that reality and fled the scene. Shortly thereafter, she left Prince Albert to return to her First Nation in northern Saskatchewan.[4]I say to Daniel Carter’s family and his friends that the law will be served today. What I cannot do, what no judge can do, and what the law cannot do is fill the void in your lives by reason of Daniel’s loss.[5]I am well aware of the impact this incident has had on the lives of the Carter family. It is tragic and unspeakable. There is no question that everyone would like nothing more than to turn back the clock to those horrific moments of September 19, 2010, and undo the consequences of that awful night. Of course, that cannot be done.[6]I can only respectfully counsel that you continue to do what you have articulated in your victim impact statements. You are to hold onto Daniel’s memory tightly and close to your heart. “Time heals” is a cliché, but my observation is that it is also the truth. I wish you nothing but the best.[7]My obligation at law, as the sentencing judge, is to impose a sentence that is just and fair and is consistent with previous judicial decisions in this jurisdiction. This requires me to consider both the circumstances of the individual accused and the offences that she has committed.[8]Ms. Chamakese is First Nation, and thus the Gladue [1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, 171 D.L.R. (4th) 385] considerations are engaged. These are embodied in s. 718.2 of the Criminal Code. I will factor them into my conclusion. It is interesting to note, however, that the Gladue factors that are often invoked are not present in Ms. Chamakese’s life. Ms. Chamakese comes from a supportive family. She graduated from Grade 12 and has no previous criminal conviction.[9]At the time of the accident, Ms. Chamakese was 19 years old. She is now 22 and has a 10‑ or 11‑month old baby and lives with the child’s father. In short, there are factors which prompt me to mitigate the sentence.[10]However, it can also be said that there are aggravating factors. The conviction of leaving the scene of an accident to escape criminal responsibility is, in and of itself, an aggravating factor. The fact that Ms. Chamakese did not have a valid driver’s license at the time is an aggravating factor. Her escape to Pelican Lake Reserve, hoping things would blow over, is an aggravating factor.[11]The Criminal Code provides a list of objectives that I must consider when imposing a sentence. The Criminal Code admonishes me to address the questions of punishment, prevention, deterrence and rehabilitation of a particular offender.[12]Ms. Chamakese has returned to her reserve and lives with her partner and together they are raising their child.[13]The pre‑sentence report lists Ms. Chamakese as “low risk” to re‑offend. I think Mr. Chovin makes a reasonable observation when he says the probation officer had to say “low risk” because he is not allowed to say “no risk”. I also observe that Ms. Chamakese has not driven since the date of the accident in 2010.[14]Both the Crown and the defence have approached the issue of sentencing with intellectual honesty. As a result, they are not far apart in their suggested sentences. Counsel on behalf of the Crown asks for a sentence of 30 months as well as the usual DNA order and a three‑year driving prohibition.[15]Mr. Chovin submits that 24 months is appropriate. I add that Mr. Chovin opts for the full 24 months rather than two years less a day so that Ms. Chamakese might benefit from some of the programs available in the federal penitentiary system.[16]The sentencing suggestions of the Crown and the defence are both within the range articulated in the authorities counsel have filed with the Court. Within that range, there is no perfect decision. As is so often the case, there is only the need for a decision.[17]With respect to Count No. 3, dangerous driving causing the death of Daniel Carter, after reflecting on all of the factors, including the Gladue factors, I order the following:1.I sentence you, Danielle Nadine Chamakese, to a term of incarceration of 26 months in the federal penitentiary system;2.I order under s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code that you provide to a peace officer or a person acting under the authority of a peace officer a number of samples of your bodily substances that are reasonably required for forensic DNA analysis;3.I order under s. 259(3.3)(d) of the Criminal Code that after the completion of your sentence, you are prohibited from driving for a period of one year.[18]With respect to Count No. 1, leaving the scene, the sentence is nine months, to be served concurrently with the sentence on Count No. 3.[19]I respectfully offer for consideration by the federal penitentiary officials that Ms. Chamakese should be considered for entry into the Okimaw Ohci Healing Lodge in Maple Creek, Saskatchewan. I respectfully submit to the officials that Ms. Chamakese would benefit from that program and may well prove an asset for other prisoners in the program.[20]I now turn to the relatively recent legislation entitled Increasing Offenders’ Accountability for Victims Act, S.C. 2013, c. 11. This requires, in the face of a conviction of an indictable offence, a $200.00 surcharge. The Act provides for no judicial discretion to waive the surcharge. This has caused upset in some judicial precincts.[21]There is no doubt that reasonable legislators, lawyers and judges can have substantial disagreement and differences as to the appropriateness and merit of this legislation. Time will sort out which side is correct in that debate, at least I hope.[22]The justice system in Canada is not perfect. However, in global terms, it is viewed with envy by most. I posit that one of the reasons it works well and is seen as fair is that each of the constituent elements of the justice system knows the limits of their jurisdiction and, more to the point, respects them.[23]It is the job of a trial judge to apply the law, not to make the law. This is so, even if I regard the law’s inflexibility as likely, in some instances, to create circumstances where reasonable citizens would see the result as gratuitously harsh. Notwithstanding that assessment, the law must be applied by judges unless it is unconstitutional or offends the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. A $200.00 fine placed on someone guilty of an indictable offence is not unconstitutional nor is it offensive to the Charter.[24]Accordingly, Ms. Chamakese, I assess you a victim surcharge fine of $200.00, the same to be paid within 90 days after you are released from prison.J.R.S. Smith"}

Code, ss. 660(1), 662(1)(a).A notice of application to have accused declared an habitual criminal and for the imposition of a sentence of preventive detention \"in addition to\", instead of \"in lieu of\", the sentence imposed for the substantive offence is not defective. Even if it were defective the Court of Appeal can and ought to amend it, pursuant to s. 589(3) of the Criminal Code, where the notice clearly sets out the essential object and nature of the application, and complies with all other requirements, and the accused was in no way misled.Since an amendment to s. 660(1) of the Code, enacted by 1960-61 (Can.), c. 43, s. 33(1), a Court has no power to impose a sentence of preventive detention \"in addition to\" the sentence for the substantive offence, and such words in the notice constituted mere surplusage and were simply a result of using an old form.In any event the proceedings are in the nature of an inquiry, rather than a trial where guilt or innocence is in issue, and strict rules of procedure which should be followed at trials are not applicable, and in the absence of any statutory provision as to the form of application it is only necessary to consider whether the form adopted sets out the essential matters required to be set out by s. 662(1)(a) of the Code.Criminal law -- Habitual criminals -- Procedure -- Adjournments -- Accused convicted and sentenced for substantive offence in County Court Judge's Criminal Court -- Subsequent application for sentence of preventive detention as an habitual criminal -- Application traversed to next sittings of Court in January -- Application not coming before Court until following June -- No adjournments meanwhile -- County Court Judge's Criminal Court a continuing Court and application not requiring adjournments to remain effective -- In any event proceedings not a trial and therefore not lapsing by reason of any failure to obtain adjournments.APPEAL by the Attorney-General of Canada from an order of Rogers, Co.Ct.J., quashing an application for sentence of preventive detention under s. 660, Cr. Code.The judgment of the Court was delivered by [R. v. Wixalbrown and Schmidt, [1964] 1 C.C.C. 29, 43 W.W.R. 449, 41 C.R. 113, refd to] P.S. Duffy,(SECTION)ie for A.-G. Can.Miss Vera Parsons, Q.C., for respondent.Porter, C.J.O.:-- This is an appeal by the Attorney-Generalof Canada under the provisions of para. (a) of s-s. (1) of s.584 of the Criminal Code, against an order of His Honour JudgeRogers, a Judge of the County Court Judges' Criminal Court ofthe County of York quashing an application by the Attorney-General to have imposed on the above-mentioned accused asentence of preventive detention under the provisions of s. 660[am. 1960-61, c. 43, s. 33(1) \u0026 (2)] of the Code.Thesection reads as follows:660(1) Where an accused has been convicted of an indictableoffence the court may, upon application, impose a sentence ofpreventive detention in lieu of any other sentence that mightbe imposed for the offence of which he was convicted or thatwas imposed for such offence, or in addition to any sentencethat was imposed for such offence if the sentence hasexpired, if(a) the accused is found to be an habitual criminal, and(b) the court is of the opinion that because the accusedis an habitual criminal, it is expedient for theprotection of the public to sentence him to preventivedetention.(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an accused is anhabitual criminal if(a) he has previously, since attaining the age ofeighteen years, on at least three separate andindependent occasions been convicted of an indictableoffence for which he was liable to imprisonment forfive years or more and is leading persistently acriminal life, or(b) he has been previously sentenced to preventivedetention.(3) At the hearing of an application under subsection (1),the accused is entitled to be present.At the opening of the hearing of this case counsel for therespondent moved to quash the appeal.This Court dismissedthis motion.On February 14, 1962 the accused was convicted of theindictable offence of trafficking in narcotic drugs and twodays later was sentenced to ten years imprisonment by HisHonour Judge Forsyth sitting as a member of the County CourtJudjes' Criminal Court for the County of York.A notice ofappeal from his conviction was served by the accused.On April10th of that year the Attorney-General for Ontario consented,pursuant to s. 662 of the Code to the bringing of anapplication to have a sentence of preventive detention imposedupon the accused.The application was made by the Attoreny-General of Canada.In due course a notice of intention tothat effect was served upon the accused.In it the applicantasked that the Judge impose a sentence of preventive detention\"in addition to the sentence of ten years given by HisHonour Judge Forsyth on February 16, 1962 on the ground thatyou are an habitual criminal. . .\"The application was postponed in June pending the result ofthe accused's appeal against his conviction.Subsequently thatappeal was heard and dismissed.Time for an application forleave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was extended toOctober 2, 1962, but on that day that application wasdismissed.On December 10th counsel for the Attorney-Generalof Canada asked that the application for preventive detentionbe \"traversed to the next sittings of the court of competentjurisdiction\" and his request was acceded to.Counsel for theaccused did not object or consent to such a disposition.Because of the lack of accommodation at the City Hall, theapplication was left unheard during the spring of 1963, despiterepeated efforts of Crown counsel to have it entertained.Finally on June 20th it came before His Honour Judge Rogers whoquashed the application.He held, first, that the notice ofapplication was defective in that it asked for a sentence ofpreventive detention in addition to the sentence imposedfollowing the trial.In drafting the notice in this way, theCrown apparently was following the wording of the predecessorof s. 660 which had been repealed in the 1960-61 Statutes.Secondly, the learned Judge decided that he was deprived ofjurisdiction because the matter had not been dealt with by theCounty Court Judges' Criminal Court for the County of York inJanuary 1963, and consequently the application had expired.We are of the opinion that the learned trial Judgemisapprehended the nature of these proceedings.Theproceedings are not a trial of the accused.He had alreadybeen tried and convicted by His Honour Judge Forsyth.Thelearned Judge also imposed a sentence of ten years upon him, nodoubt bearing in mind the circumstances before him and thevarious considerations applicable to a sentence for a crime ofthis nature.The function of the Court in the proceedingsbefore us is to hold an inquiry restricted to a determinationof two questions, viz.:(1) whether the accused is an habitualcriminal and (2) if so, whether it is expedient for theprotection of the public to sentence him to preventivedetention.Subsection (2) defines an habitual criminal.Ifthe Judge finds that the accused is an habitual criminal andthat it is expedient that he should be sentenced then the Courtmay sentence the accused to preventive detention:cf s. 659.Section 662(4) [enacted 1960-61, c. 43, s. 35(2)] provides thatthe application shall not be heard by the Judge or Magistratewho sentenced the accused, but may be heard by any other Judgeor Magistrate who might have held or sat in the same Court. Theproceedings being in effect an inquiry rather than a trialwhere the guilt or innocence of an accused is in issue, thevarious sections of the Code relating to the strict rules ofprocedure which should be followed at trials would not beapplicable.The proceedings in this case might be of a lessformal kind, so long as the accused is given a fair hearing.In this case he was represented by counsel from the time thatthe application was made.We do not agree with the contention of counsel that thenotice of application is defective.Under ss. 660(1) and662(1)(a)(i) [rep. \u0026 sub. sub. 1960-61, c. 43, s. 35(1)], andapplication to have a convicted person subjected to preventivedetention may be brought by any one with the approval of theAttorney-General for the Province.If the applicationsucceeds, the Court hearing the same may impose a sentence ofpreventive detention (1) in lieu of any other sentence thatmight be imposed for the offence for which the respondent wasconvicted, or (2) in lieu of the one that was imposed for suchoffence, or (3) in addition to any sentence that was imposedfor such offence if the sentence has expired.It is obviousthat because Judge Forsyth had already sentenced the accused,the application must have been under either (2) or (3) above.It could not have been under (3) becuase Gordon is stillserving the sentence for which he was convicted.Accordingly,since the application was for \"a sentence of preventivedetention\" it must have been under that part of the sectionnumbered (2) above.Since these proceedings do not involve a trial, but ratherare in the nature of an inquiry and there is no statutoryprovision as to the form of application that must be used weshould consider whether it was adequate under thecircumstances.Section 662(1)(a)(ii) [rep. \u0026 1960-61, c. 43,s. 35(1)] provides that the accused must be served with astatement specifying the previous convictions and the othercircumstances upon which it is intended to found theapplication.In this case the notice of application compliedfully with that requirement.The essential notice to the accused is that the applicant isseeking to have imposed a sentence of preventive detention andthat was clearly set out in the notice of application in thiscase.We are of the opinion that the words which suggest thatthe preventive detention is to be added to the sentence imposedby the trial Judge were mere surplusage.They do notmaterially add to or detract from the basic notice which iscontained in the document and to which reference has just beenmade.The prisoner would not have been prejudiced by the formof the notice had the application proceeded for he was therebyinformed of the essential objective to have preventivedetention imposed upon him.Moreover, since the Court couldnot at this time have added the preventive sentence to the onealready imposed, whatever success the application might havehad, it was bound to be something less than that which appearedto be sought by the notice.We think, therefore, that thelearned Judge ought to have embarked upon the inquiry presentedto him by virtue of that notice.If, however, the notice is defective, then it can and oughtto be amended by this Court, regardless of whether the learnedJudge might have been able to do so.Accordingly, we shouldgrant the amendment mentioned by counsel for the Attorney-General by simply changing the expression \"in addition to\"to \"in lieu of\".This power is vested in us, in our view, byvirtue of the provisions of s - s. (3) of s. 589.In thisregard, reference might also be had to the case of R. v.Wixalbrown and Schmidt, [1964] 1 C.C.c. 29, 43 W.W.R. 449, 41C.R. 113.Again the prisoner will not be prejudiced for thehearing of the application has not yet commenced.Thesituation is not, therefore, like other cases where harmfulimproprieties occurred during the course of the injuiry.As to the second main contention on behalf of the accused, wethink that the learned Judge was not precluded fromentertaining the application by reason of the fact that therehad not been weekly adjournments granted in the period fromJanuary to June of 1963.There was presented at the hearing toquash, some evidence to the effect that a Court calendar isprinted and distributed which contains in it the following:\"County Court Judges' Criminal Court Weekly Sittings\".Counsel for the accused argued, therefore, that once the matterwas not disposed of by a Judge of the appropriate Court at \"thesittings\" held in January, the application under s. 660 was atan end.We do not agree with this argument.It is our opinionthat by reason of the provisions of the County Court Judges'Criminal Courts Act, R.S.O. 1960, c. 75, and until the contraryis made to appear, that Court is a continuing Court despitewhat might be contained in the unofficial calendar printed forthe convenience of counsel and others, and notwithstanding MissParson's contention that the evidence suggests that there is asittings of that Court each week.We are under the impressionthat there is no evidence that \"sittings\" as such are legallyor formally stipulated, and it being a continuing Court,adjournments from time to time were not necessary to keep theapplication alive.Even assuming, however, that the Court was not a continuingCourt, we do not think that the proceeding, being an inquiryand not a trial, would lapse by reason of any failure to obtainadjournments.The proceedings do not begin until the Courtbecomes seized of the case.The learned Judge by holding thathe had no power to proceed, did not become seized of the case.We are of the opinion that the learned Judge erred.The application should be remitted to a Judge of the CountyCourt Judges' Criminal Court for the County of York other thanJudge Forsyth, for inquiry and disposal.Appeal allowed."}

(Orally):Mr. Y. pled guilty to incest with his sister, V.Y., as alleged in count number four, and a four day judge alone trial was held in relation to the remaining counts on the indictment.The accused, M.E.Y., testified at his trial, and was found guilty by me on December 8th and 12th, 2011: count number one, committing a sexual assault on his great-niece, K.Y., contrary to section 271 of the Criminal Code of Canada; count two, for a sexual purpose, touching his great-niece, K.Y., a person under the age of 16, directly with a part of his body, his hands, contrary to section 151(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada; count number four, of having sexual relations with his sister, V.Y., contrary to section 142(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada; and count number five, in committing a sexual assault on his niece, J.Y., contrary to section 246.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.The charge in relation to count number three was stayed by the Crown.J.Y. is V.Y.’s daughter and Mr. Y.’s niece.K.Y. is V.Y.’s granddaughter, and Mr. Y.’s great-niece.My detailed factual findings in this case can be found in my Reasons for Decision given December 12th, 2011.Mr. Y., now 74 and in poor health, was found by me to have committed these four offences in a timeframe spanning 46 years, from February 8th, 1963, to March 31st, 2009.The timeframe for the offences can be broken down into three periods, summarized as follows:(i)Incest committed between February 8th, 1963 and February 7th, 1965.While growing up at home, Mr. Y. was found to have consensual sexual relations with his younger sister, V.Y., over a two year period, when his sister was 16 to 18 years of age.Mr. Y., at that time, was 25 to 27 years of age.(ii)Sexual assault between February 21st, 1984, and February 20th, 1986.Mr. Y. was living in his sister V.Y.’s home with her husband and children.Mr. Y. and his niece, J., slept upstairs in close proximity to one another.Mr. Y. was found to have regularly touched J.Y.’s breasts when J. was between 17 to 19 years of age.Mr. Y. left sexually provocative notes under J.’s pillow and told her he wanted to go to bed with her.Mr. Y., at that time, was 46 to 48 years of age.(iii)Sexual assault and touching for a sexual purpose, a person under the age of 16 years between December 31st, 2008 and March 31st, 2009.Mr. Y. was found to have performed oral sex and digital penetration on his great-niece, K.Y., on four occasions when K. was 14 to 16 years of age, paying her $20 each time for letting him do that to her.He had given her a sexually provocative business card, telling her he wanted her to come to his place, and what he wanted to do to her, and he would give her money, which he knew she needed.Mr. Y., at that time, was 71 to 73 years of age.The Offender:Mr. Y. was born […], and is 74 years of age.He lives with his cat in a one bedroom, geared-to-income apartment in Napanee, and has been on judicial interim release conditions for the past three years, without incident.He was previously married for a period of two years, and then divorced, and has no children.He has never had another relationship.After 22 years on the job, Mr. Y. retired as a construction worker in 1995.He has also worked in a garage, driven a taxi, and delivered pizza.His only current source of income is his old age pension.Mr. Y. is an unsophisticated, uneducated individual.There can be no question that his upbringing was disadvantaged.Mr. Y. has a dated criminal record for an impaired driving conviction on June 28th, 2005, for which he received a $600 fine and was prohibited from driving for a period of one year.A pre-sentence report was ordered by me and prepared by Kelly Rathwell of the Napanee Probation and Parole Office.I find that the report is negative in its overall finding.The report concludes that Mr. Y. has no remorse for his actions, and that he has no insight into the effect of his sexual behaviour on his victims.Mr. Y. was born and raised in Napanee.He is the eighth child of 13 children born to his parents, A. and E.Y..Currently he only communicates with his sister, V.Y., and one other sibling.He was sexually abused as a five year old child by his brother.Incest was rampant within the entire family.The family had multiple interventions by the Children’s Aid Society.Mr. Y. was placed in foster homes, where he was beaten by one of his foster fathers, and prevented from going to school.He stayed there until he could leave at the age of 15.He has little or no formal education, and he reads and writes enough to get by.He is not a drug user.He has consumed alcohol excessively throughout his life.He has been sterile since he was 18 as a result of an accident.He has been unable to get an erection since he was 42.Mr. Y. is a very sick man, and is in poor health.His family doctor confirms that he has inoperable lung cancer.Mr. Y. has refused to have any palliative chemotherapy treatment done by the medical cancer specialist assigned to his care.He is currently asymptomatic and not in pain.He takes no medication for his cancer.Mr. Y. has vascular issues in his legs, for which he was treated and for which he had surgery on in October of 2011.He has recovered well from that procedure, but still reports ongoing pain in his legs.He has not been referred back to the vascular specialist, as nothing more can be done.His high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and his anxiety are treated with prescribed medications.He sometimes uses a cane or a scooter to assist him in getting around because of the pain in his legs.In the pre-sentence report, Mr. Y. minimized his behaviour with his sister, which he knew was wrong.He stated that he gets along well with V., who is not angry with him, and does not want to see him go to jail.Mr. Y. denied the other sexual offences and demonstrated no remorse.He spoke harshly to the probation officer when discussing the sexual aspects of his life and about the matters before the Court.Mr. Y. made flippant and disrespectful comments about sexual relationships to the probation officer, who concluded that Mr. Y.’s lack of insight into how his behaviour has affected victims is very concerning.The probation officer found that Mr. Y. had no insight into his behaviour, nor did he care to gain any insight into his behaviour.His behaviour is a serious problem that his victims will have to deal with for the rest of their entire lives.The Impact of the Offender’s Behaviour on the Victims:J.Y. filed her victim impact statement with the Court.She described the offences committed by her uncle, Mr. Y., as ruining her whole childhood and adulthood.J. is scared of men and embarrassed about her body, which she covers up by wearing two or three shirts.She suffers from memory loss, and has been severely depressed all her life, for which she has to take medication.She is angry with her mother and with herself for not putting a stop to the abuse.J. suffers from panic and anxiety attacks, and she has a severe social phobia about being around people.She feels that the family has been torn apart and hurt.I accept that J. suffers from a great loss of self-esteem and is ashamed of her own body.V.Y. and K.Y. chose not to file victim impact statements.V.Y., now 64 years old, testified at the trial, and is still very close to her brother, M.Y..She is fully supportive of him.K. also testified at the trial by closed-circuit television.It was obvious that she had a great deal of difficulty discussing these events.K. continues to live with her mother, J.Y..J. testified that K. rarely leaves the house and spends most of her time in her room.She does not work or go to school.K. presented at trial as a very troubled young woman, who will have many issues to overcome in her adult life.J.’s victim impact statement included a comment that, in J.’s view, the abuse has ruined her daughter’s life, and has impacted and hurt the whole family.I accept that K. has suffered loss of self-esteem, and has become socially withdrawn.The long-term consequences of sexual abuse are well known.As outlined in R. v. D.D., 2002 CanLII 44915 (ON CA), [2002] O.J.No.1061 (C.A.) by Muldaver J. A., “A child who has been abused will never be able, as an adult, to form a loving, caring relationship with another adult of the opposite sex.A sexually abused child as an adult will treat a child or children as he or she was treated as a child, in that they may abuse a child sexually.”I am satisfied that these long-term consequences are a legitimate concern for both K. and J..Position of the Defence:The defence seeks a conditional sentence, to be served in the community, in relation to count number four, incest; and to count number five, sexual assault, pursuant to section 246.1(1)(a), the defence submits that a conditional sentence of two years less one day is appropriate, with strict conditions, including a significant period of house arrest.The defence position is that Mr. Y. is not a threat to society, and that denunciation and deterrence can be met by way of a conditional sentence.Counsel for the defence also seeks a conditional sentence on count number one for sexual assault.Defence counsel argues that R. v. Proulx,2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61 (S.C.C.) makes it clear that a conditional sentence can apply to any offence, except those with a minimum term of imprisonment.The Crown has prosecuted count number one by way of indictment.I find that at the time R. v. Proulx (supra) was decided, the offence of sexual assault was not an excluded offence for which a conditional sentence was not available.After the R v. Proulx (supra) decision in the year 2000, section 742.1 was amended by Bill C-9.The Bill was assented to on May 31st, 2007, and came into force six months later.The 2007 amendments broaden the number of offences for which a conditional sentence is not available, including sexual assault pursuant to section 271.The amended section 742.1 excludes a conviction for a serious personal injury offence as defined in section 752 of the Criminal Code of Canada, from consideration of a conditional sentence.The definition of a serious personal injury offence includes the offence of sexual assault, pursuant to section 271.I find that a conditional sentence is therefore not available on count number one.Count number two, sexual interference, section 151(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada, has a minimum sentence of 45 days in custody, and is also excluded from consideration of a conditional sentence.The defence seeks a 45 day intermittent sentence, to be served on weekends, in relation to count two.Position of the Crown:The Crown seeks a global sentence of three years in penitentiary, together with ancillary orders for an order for prohibition in relation to weapons, pursuant to section 109 of the Criminal Code of Canada, an order for prohibition in relation to parks, playgrounds, and employment, pursuant to section 161 of the Criminal Code of Canada, an order that a sample of DNA be taken from the offender, pursuant to the relevant sections in the Criminal Code of Canada, and an order that the offender comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, pursuant to section 490.01(3) of the Criminal Code of Canada for life.The Crown’s position is that a conditional sentence on the facts of this case is fundamentally inconsistent with the principles of sentencing in relation to sexual abuse of children under the age of 18 years.The Sentencing Purposes and Principles:I have carefully considered all of the purposes and principles of sentencing set out in Part XXIII of the Criminal Code of Canada.In particular, section 718 of the Criminal Code of Canada states that “The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, due respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society, by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committed offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offender;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and to the community.”The fundamental principle of a sentence as set out in section 718.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada, is that it must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and to the degree of responsibility of the offender.Section 718.2 provides that “A sentence shall also take into account:(i)the principles of the sentence shall be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, without limiting the foregoing in subsection 718.2(a)(ii.1);(ii)evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a person under the age of 18 years; and(iii)evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances.”When an offence is committed that involves the abuse of a person under the age of 18 years, section 718.01 of the Criminal Code of Canada requires that the Court shall give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence of such conduct.Mitigating Factors:The mitigating factors in relation to this offender are as follows:(a)He has no related criminal record for sexual offending.His criminal record for impaired driving in 2005 is dated.(b)He has complied with the terms and conditions of his judicial interim release order for the past three years.(c)He is in poor health.He has asymptomatic inoperable lung cancer for which he has refused treatment and for which he currently takes no medication.He has vascular issues in his legs, which has been treated with surgery and nothing more can be done.He has pain in his legs.He uses a cane and a scooter to assist him with walking.He has high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and anxiety, all of which are treated with medications and are stable.(d)He is 74 years of age.(e)He pled guilty to the offence of incest with his sister, V..Aggravating Factors:The aggravating factors in relation to this offender are as follows:(a)He abused children under the age of 18 years.For the offence in relation to V., she was 16 to 18 years old, he was 25 to 27 years old.For the offence in relation to J., she was 17 to 19 years old, he was 46 to 48 years old.For offences in relation to K., she was 14 to 16 years old, and he was 71 to 73 years old.(b)There were multiple victims.The victims were his sister, V., his niece, J., when he lived with V.’s family, where J. also resided, and K., his great-niece, whom he persuaded to come to his apartment.The conduct in relation to both J. and K. took place at the offender’s place of residence, and within the close family unit.(c)The offender was in a position of trust to his victims, being part of a close family relationship.(d)There was an element of grooming in relation to J., by leaving her sexually provocative notes under her pillow, and by making sexual remarks to her on a regular basis.(e)There was an element of grooming in relation to K., by leaving her a graphic card where he told her what he wanted to do to her, invited her to his apartment, and offered her money in return for oral sex.(f)Each offence included multiple acts of the offending behaviour.(g)The offences against children under the age of 18 years old have occurred over a time-span of 46 years, from February the 8th, 1963, until March 31st, 2009.(h)The offender shows no remorse or insight into his offences and does not wish to gain any insight.(i)Because of his lack of insight into his sexual conduct, the offender, I find, continues to pose a risk to the community for sexual offences with children, not involving intercourse, as he does not consider anything but intercourse to be criminal in nature.(j)The offender’s conduct has had a substantial impact on J. and K., both of whom suffer from social issues and loss of self-esteem.The long-term consequences of the sexual abuse perpetrated on them are noted.J., in particular, was sexually assaulted 28 years ago and is still suffering the consequences of that conduct today.(k)The offender’s conduct has torn this family apart.What is the Appropriate Range of Sentence?Sexual abuse of children by adults must be met with a sentence that reflects the seriousness of the crime.The crime is grave and reflects a high moral blameworthiness of the offender.The sentence imposed must reflect this Court and this community’s abhorrence of the sexual abuse of children by adults.Denunciation and deterrence of this offender and any like-minded offender must be the Court’s primary consideration in the imposition of a sentence on this offender.Both counsel have submitted case law in support of their respective positions on sentence, which I have read and considered.Not surprisingly, there are no cases submitted that are totally factually consistent with the facts of this case.The principles of sentencing in the various cases, however, can be of great assistance in the determination of a fit and proper sentence.I find that a conditional sentence is not a fit sentence in this case.Considering the gravity of these offences involving children, the repeated nature of the offences, the number of complainants, and the time span over which these offences were committed, a conditional sentence would ignore important principles of sentencing.The sentence in this case must reflect denunciation and deterrence as its primary consideration.The offender continues to pose a risk to the community.A conditional sentence would also have no significant impact on Mr. Y., as he is retired and lives alone in his apartment.A conditional sentence on the facts of this case, I find, would be totally inconsistent with the basic principles and purposes of sentencing, as provided in the Criminal Code of Canada.In R. v. D.D.,(supra) at paragraph 44, Muldaver, J. A., as he then was, held that “When adult offenders in a position of trust sexually abuse innocent children on a regular and persistent basis over substantial periods of time, they can expect to receive mid to upper single digit penitentiary terms.If the abuse involved intercourse that is accompanied by other acts of physical violence, threats of physical violence or other forms of extortion, upper single digit to low double digit penitentiary terms are appropriate.”In that case, the offender committed several acts, including intercourse, when he was 25 to 32 years of age, on four boys aged five to eight years old, over a seven year period.The offender was sentenced to eight years, one month, after credit was given for one year, to reflect pretrial custodial time.The case law has held that there is a distinction to be made in cases where actual intercourse has occurred, and those cases where it has not.In R. v. A.G.,2004 CanLII 36065 (ON CA), [2004] O.J. No.4563 (C.A.) sexual intercourse was not involved.Rosenberg, J.A. held, at paragraph 29, that “The circumstances of that case required a penitentiary sentence of two years for the attempted rape and one year concurrent for indecent assault.”The offender was the child’s uncle and the sexual assaults occurred in the child’s home.The events happened 30 years ago when the offender was 37 years of age and the child was 12 years of age.At the time of the sentencing, the offender was 67 years of age, in frail health, but he had taken steps to rehabilitate himself and he was not a danger to the community or children.He had also served a nine month conditional sentence for other offences committed on the same child, and all of the offences were committed 30 years ago.The range of sentence for incest involving intercourse by a person in a position of trust has been established in the case law to be three to five years in penitentiary.For sibling incest in R. v. W.W.M.,2006 CanLII 3262 (ON CA), [2006] O.J. No.440 (C.A.) the offender was sentenced to four years in a penitentiary for a conviction of incest in relation to his two half sisters.The Court of Appeal in that case confirmed the principle, that lapse of time does not in any way render inapplicable the principles of denunciation and deterrence, but is a factor that the Court can consider.In another case of sibling incest, R. v. C.O.L.,[2010] O.J. No. 2820 (S.C.J.) Coe, J. imposed a sentence of three and a half years in penitentiary.Incest between siblings has been held by the court of appeal to be a breach of trust.The incest in that case was non-consensual.In Mr. Y.’s case, the incest was consensual.The offence of incest prohibits consensual and non-consensual intercourse between blood relatives as specified to protect the integrity of the family.I have given due consideration in this case to the fact that the sexual relationship between Mr. Y. and his sister, V., was consensual as opposed to non-consensual, but nonetheless, a criminal offence.In R. v. J.B.,[2012] O.J. No.630 (S.C.J.) R. J. Smith, J., sentenced the offender to four years in penitentiary.The offender was in loco parentis to the child and forced the child to perform fellatio on him.No intercourse or other vaginal touching or digital penetration was involved.I find that the oral sex performed on K. and the digital penetration of K. by the offender to be only minimally less aggravating than intercourse.The impact on K. has been most serious.The offender did, of course, have full sexual intercourse with his sister, V., over a two year period, which is an aggravating factor.I have also considered the long-term impact of these offences in relation to J..J. still suffers daily because of the sexual abuse committed against her by Mr. Y..Mr. Y. has inflicted his offences on three female members of his immediate family over a 46 year period.While admitting his guilt to having sexual intercourse on the incest charge with his sister, he vehemently denies his culpability on the other sexual charges, including touching of breasts, oral sex, and digital penetration, of which he has been convicted.Mr. Y. understands sexual assault to only involve intercourse.When it was suggested to him by the probation officer completing the pre-sentence report that sexual arousal does not always have to include an erection, he simply dismissed the comment.V., J., and K. had the right to expect that Mr. Y. would treat them with respect.After all, he was a trusted close family relative.Mr. Y. was significantly older than they were when these offences were committed.All of these offences took place within the close confines of the family unit, which should be a place of safety and comfort to any child within the family.The offences occurred mostly where Mr. Y. resided.V., J., and K. had the right not to have their bodies sexually violated by Mr. Y..They had the right not to have a loss of self esteem, and not to have a lifetime of consequences as a result of Mr. Y.’s reprehensible conduct.Mr. Y., I find, was in a position of trust to his victims and was in a close family relationship with them.Mr. Y. used grooming techniques to attempt to gain the trust of J..He had easy access to J., as her sleeping quarters were next to his room.The family trusted him, even V., not to sexually assault their daughter.J. knew of the history of incest between her mother and Mr. Y., but V. trusted him enough to have him live with them in the house.J.’s eventual disclosure got Mr. Y. thrown out of the house by V..Mr. Y. used grooming techniques, including an offering of money to K., to lure her over to his apartment and let him perform oral sex on her and to digitally penetrate her for money.He also offered her alcohol.She was immature and naïve.He gave the business card to K. without her mother’s knowledge.The business card was most sexually graphic and crude.I find these grooming techniques were used to cultivate a relationship of trust with K. to facilitate the commission of the sexual offences that were perpetrated upon her.The sexual assaults have happened over a span of 46 years.The charges against K. are current, having taken place between December 31st, 2008, and March 31st, 2009.These charges involve serious abuse of a child by the offender, and have had a serious impact upon the victims.I have considered Mr. Y.’s age of 74 years.It cannot be said that Mr. Y. has lived an otherwise exemplary life when his offences before the Court span 46 years, and three generations of women within his immediate family.I have considered Mr. Y.’s health.I am satisfied that all of his health concerns can be addressed and treated within an institutional setting.I am aware and have taken into full account that Mr. Y.’s cancer may in the not too distant future, require Mr. Y. to be treated as a palliative patient.I have also considered Mr. Y.’s plea of guilty to the offence of incest.This family has been torn apart by the harm done by the offender.The lives of J. and K. in particular have been irretrievably damaged.V., now 64, maintains a close relationship with the offender, which puts her in conflict with her daughter, J., and her granddaughter, K., who want nothing to do with the offender.I accept that a range of three to five years on all the facts of this case is appropriate, as submitted by the Crown.Without a consideration of the offender’s current mitigating circumstances, a sentence in the upper end of that range would have been a fit sentence.As recently as September of 2011 in R v. Woodward,2011 ONCA 610 (CanLII), [2011] O.J. No. 4216 (C.A.) the Court of Appeal confirmed the importance of the principles laid out in the earlier Court of Appeal decision of R. v. D.D.(supra).Muldaver, J. A., at paragraph 45, held that “The harm caused by sexual offenders is a cause for grave concern.Children are robbed of their youth and innocence.Families are often torn apart or rendered dysfunctional.Lives are irretrievably damaged and sometimes permanently destroyed.Because of this, the message to such offenders must be clear.Prey upon innocent children and you will pay a heavy price.”After due consideration of all of the above factors, the principles and purposes of sentencing as set out in the Criminal Code of Canada, the case law as submitted by counsel, the facts of this case, the circumstances of the offence, Mr. Y.’s age and his current terminal health condition, all of the mitigating and aggravating factors, the age of the complainants, the position of trust, the historical nature of the charges in relation to V. and J., the plea of guilty to the charges involving V., the grooming of J. and K., the nature of the offences committed, the lack of insight of the offender, the risks that the offender still poses to the community, the time span of the convictions, the number of complainants, the current nature of the charges involving K. being in 2009, the lack of remorse, and the damage inflicted, I find, for all of the reasons set out herein, that the appropriate global sentence for these charges is three years in the penitentiary.Mr. Y., will you please stand up.Mr. Y., in relation to count number one, the offence in relation to K., I sentence you to three years in the penitentiary.In relation to count number two, the offences again in relation to K., I sentence you to three years in the penitentiary.Count four, the offence of incest in relation to V., I sentence you two years in the penitentiary.Count number five, I sentence you to one year in the penitentiary.The sentences on counts two, four, and five, shall run concurrently to the three year sentence imposed in relation to count one.You can sit down for the rest of the matter, Mr. Y.; thank you.I also order the ancillary orders, as requested by the Crown.There will be an order of prohibition in relation to weapons, pursuant to section 109, an order for prohibition, as requested, in relation to section 161, an order that a sample of DNA be taken, and an order that Mr. Y. comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, pursuant to section 490.01(3) of the Criminal Code for life.I accept the Crown’s submission that that section can be read that way, and that the appropriate time is for life, as opposed to 20 years.The indictment shall be endorsed with the above disposition as to sentence.I also will endorse the indictment that Mr. Y. must be medically assessed immediately upon his arrival into custody to ensure continuity of his care.I direct that his medical reports that were filed earlier in this proceeding be attached to his warrant of committal.So, Mr. Scott, have I covered all the issues in relation to the Crown?MR. SCOTT:Just with respect to the 109 and 161 Orders, I am not sure, I may have missed it, but there was no length associated with it.THE COURT:There was what?MR. SCOTT:No length.I didn’t hear Your Honour.THE COURT:Sorry.MR. SCOTT:With respect to the 109, given that he has no previous prohibition orders, I would suggest that it’s just the ten year order.With respect to the 161, I am not sure if anyone made submissions with respect to how long the appropriate order would be.I am in Your Honour’s hands with respect to how you deal with that.THE COURT:Any comment on that, Ms. Christie?MS. CHRISTIE:No comment, Your Honour.THE COURT:All right; thank you.Thank you.I will make the section 109 order for ten years, as will be the section 161 order.Is there anything else, Mr. Scott?MR. SCOTT:No thank you, Your Honour.THE COURT:Ms. Christie?MS. CHRISTIE:No, Your Honour.THE COURT:Thank you very much.I do appreciate counsel’s preparations and briefs in this most difficult case, particularly a most difficult sentencing.Thank you.****I, Bonnie Cain, certify that this document is a true and accurate transcript of the recording of R. v.

(2d) 205STATUTES CONSIDERED:Criminal Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46REASONS FOR SENTENCEBRAZIL, P.C.J.:INTRODUCTION[1]On March 27, 2017, Kevin Roberts entered guilty pleas and I convicted him of the following five offences (“the subject offences”):(1)Armed robbery, contrary to 343-344(1)(b) of the Criminal Code;(2)Possessing a weapon dangerous to the public, contrary to section 88(1)-88(2);(3)Having his face masked with the intent to commit an indictable offence, contrary to 351(2);(4)Assault with a weapon, contrary to section 267(a); and(5)Breach of recognizance, contrary to section 145(3)(a).THE FACTS[2]On November 17, 2015,the offender entered Pharmacy Solutions in the Goulds.His was wearing a ski mask and carrying a knife and a steel pipe.The store clerk left the premises and ran to a nearby business to call police.The pharmacist, Mr. O’Keefe, who was 72 years old at the time, confronted the accused and attempted to remove his mask.The accused struck Mr. O’Keefe in the head with the pipe, causing a laceration to his forehead and an abrasion on his chin.Mr. Roberts then held a knife to Mr. O’Keefe’s side and ordered that he open the narcotics safe.While he was opening the safe, the accused was uttering threats to Mr. O’Keefe.The knife and the pipe were left at the scene.The offender arrived at and left in a white Pontiac G6 car with black rims.A partial license plate number was obtained for the vehicle before it left the scene.[3]Later that night, Mr. Roberts was arrested.The arresting officer searched a bag that the offender had been carrying just before the arrest and found over 20 pill bottles and a clear plastic bag of pills. The pills matched the narcotics that had been stolen earlier that day from Pharmacy Solutions.He was driving a white Pontiac G6 and the licence plate matched the partial plate number obtained during the robbery.The accused did not admit to the armed robbery from earlier that day and he was not charged with the robbery.He was charged with driving while prohibited and breaching a recognizance.[4]A recognizance to which the accused was subject on the date of these offences and dated April 1st, 2015 was entered by consent.The recognizance confirms that at the time of the subject offences Mr. Roberts had outstanding charges, including another armed robbery charge (“the Hayloft Lounge Robbery”).THE LAW[5]The relevant sentencing provisions are set out in section 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code:718 The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect society and to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct and the harm done to victims or to the community that is caused by unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims or to the community.718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor,(ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s spouse or common-law partner,(ii.1) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a person under the age of eighteen years,(iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim,(iii.1) evidence that the offence had a significant impact on the victim, considering their age and other personal circumstances, including their health and financial situation,(iv) evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal organization,(v) evidence that the offence was a terrorism offence, or(vi) evidence that the offence was committed while the offender was subject to a conditional sentence order made under section 742.1 or released on parole, statutory release or unescorted temporary absence under the Corrections and Conditional Release Actshall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;(c) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and(e) all available sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances and consistent with the harm done to victims or to the community should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders.[6]At the sentencing hearing, the following cases were submitted for my review:(1)In the 2014 decision of R. v. MacCauley, [2014] N.J. No. 70, the accused, a drug addict, entered guilty pleas and was convicted and sentenced to 8 years, 3 months for two armed robberies which occurred 5 days apart.He was also sentenced for having his face covered during one of the robberies and possessing a weapon dangerous to the public during the other robbery.The first robbery occurred at gas bar and the second at a pharmacy.Like Mr. Roberts, the offender had a lengthy criminal record but unlike Mr. Roberts, his record included four prior convictions for armed robberies.(2)In the 2015 decision R v. Squires, the accused was sentenced after trial to 5 1/2 years for armed robbery and for other offences committed during the robbery, including, having his face masked, threatening bodily harm to one of his victims, breaching a recognizance and breaching a probation order.Mr. Squires had a lengthy criminal record.Unlike in Mr. Roberts’ case, the court held that no mitigating factors were present.(3)In the 2015 decision of R v. Healey, the accused was convicted of robbery, having his face covered while committing an indictable offence, possession of a weapon dangerous to the public and breaching a probation order.He entered a pharmacy masked and armed with a knife, demanded that the narcotics safe be opened and robbed a large amount of narcotics.After trial, the accused also pleaded guilty to offences under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, two assaults that occurred at Her Majesty’s Penitentiary, breaches of recognizance, impaired driving and driving while disqualified.The accused had a lengthy criminal record.Orr P.C.J. imposed a sentence of 4 years for the robbery conviction and an overall sentence 5 years and 270 days.(4)In the 2012 decision from our Court of Appeal of R v. Hutchings, the accused pleaded guilty to and was convicted of two counts of armed robbery and one count of attempted armed robbery.He also pleadedguilty to wearing a mask with intent to commit an indictable offence and breach of probation.The sentencing judge imposed a sentenced of 4 years’ imprisonment for the first robbery, 3 years concurrent for the attempted robbery, 3 years consecutive for the second robbery less 141 days of pre-trial custody, 1 year concurrent for wearing a mask and 1 day consecutive for each breach of probation.The accused successfully appealed from the sentence.Using the analysis as set out in paragraph 84 of the decision, the Court in Hutchings reduced the total sentence to 5 years and 6 months less 141 days for pre-trial custody.(5)In the 2010 decision of R v. Power, the accused entered guilty pleas to ten offences that occurred on four separate occasions.The most serious of these offences were armed robbery and arson.The accused had a lengthy criminal record that included one prior conviction for armed robbery.He was on parole and on probation when he committed the offences.As mitigating, the sentencing judge took into consideration his guilty pleas, his addiction issue and his effort to address them, his childhood victimization and his mental health struggles.A sentence of 6 years was imposed for the robbery and an overall sentence of 7 years, 3 months.ANALYSISAggravating Factors:[7]In recent years, there has been a marked increase in armed robberies on the Northeast Avalon of the Province.The facts supporting the subject convictions are serious and quite violent.It was not a convenience store robbery where a small amount of money or items were stolen.Two weapons were used and over $3500 worth of narcotics was stolen.It warrants repeating that in committing the armed robbery, Mr. Roberts attacked and injured a 72 year old man with a pipe, held a knife to his victim’s side and ordered him to empty the narcotics safe.[8]The offender’s criminal record is an aggravating factor.His Provincial Court record is 19 pages long and spans a period between 1999 and 2016.It contains 68 convictions.His record includes driving offences – driving while disqualified, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, impaired driving – fraud, assault, being unlawfully at large, failure to attend court, break and enter into a premises other than a dwelling, break and enter into a dwelling, theft, public mischief, mischief relating to property, breaches of probation orders and breaches of recognizances and undertakings.As already noted, he was also convicted in Supreme Court Trial Division of the Hayloft Lounge armed robbery, driving while disqualified, mischief and breaches of recognizance.[9]It is also aggravating that the accused was released on conditions for the Hayloft Lounge offences when he committed the subject offences.Mitigating Factors:[10]There are mitigating factors present in this case, factors that are in stark contrast to the offender’s criminal record and the subject offences.Mr. Roberts pleaded guilty and he expressed sincere remorse for his offences, particularly with respect to his victimization of the pharmacist, Mr. O’Keefe.He accepted responsibility shortly after he was charged with the offences.He called the police, requested that an officer meet with him at Her Majesty’s Penitentiary (HMP) and confessed.He did this knowing that he was already serving a sentence for armed robbery and that it would likely attract more jail time.[11]I also accept that the offender has made concerted attempts to rehabilitate.Since his incarceration, he has taken courses and participated in group and one-on-one counselling sessions.He is reported to be a model prisoner and has become involved with the Salvation Army Church.He expresses a wish to become a Salvation Army officer and to fulfill his ministry by working with other prisoners.He has not abused drugs since November of 2015 and credits his ability to remain drug free and his ability to take responsibility for his criminal behavior with his new-found spirituality.[12]Captain Kevin Hoddinott and former Provincial Court Judge Robert Smith testified for the offender at the sentencing hearing.Captain Hoddinott was chaplain at HMP for a period of time and he met Mr. Roberts through his participation in several counselling programs. After his completion of the programs, the offender was invited back in a leadership/mentorship role to other counselling programs.Captain Hoddinott described the offender as having a peaceful approach to the other inmates.Mr. Roberts became a range representative and was well respected and liked by correctional officers and other prisoners.Captain Hoddinott testified that he worked with approximately 200 prisoners during his time as Chaplain at HMP and that Mr. Roberts and one other prisoner were two people who stood out as making sincere attempts to atone for their offences and avoid future criminal activity.[13]Judge Smith worked with Mr. Roberts in a counselling program.The offender was an active participant.Judge Smith testified that the criminal he heard described at the sentencing hearing bore no resemblance to the kind, peaceful person he met at HMP.He testified that while there are no guarantees, he believed Mr. Roberts to be earnest in his efforts to rehabilitate and to assist with the rehabilitation of other prisoners.He concluded his evidence by stating that the offender was either sincere or he was deserving of an Academy Award.[14]Mr. Roberts was suffering from a Percocet addiction when he committed the subject offences.In the R. v. Hutchings, 2012 NLCA 2 (CanLII), [2012] N.J. No. 12 decision, Chief Justice Green acknowledged that an offender’s addiction can be mitigating.At paragraph 108 he stated:Mr. Hutchings suffers, as noted by the sentencing judge, from a drug problem, a circumstance that often fuels the type of behavior for which he was sentenced.Some of the cases cited previously (e.g. Sheppard, Butt, Power) recognize addictions, such as gambling and alcohol dependency, or emotional or psychiatric illness as factors that may mitigate the severity of a sentencing disposition.[15]I accept that Mr. Roberts’ addiction is mitigating.He was withdrawing from Percocet when he committed the subject offences and more importantly, he has acknowledged his problem and has made significant efforts to address his addiction.SENTENCE[16]In the context of these offences and the circumstances of offender, what is the appropriate sentence?The Crown seeks a sentence of 5 years.The defence argued that based on the totality principle and because Mr. Roberts is already serving a 4 year sentence for the Hayloft Lounge offences, another 18 months of custodial time is sufficient to address the principles of sentencing.[17]In support of its sentencing submission, the Crown referred me to the following quote from the Healey decision:In R. v. Clarke (1995), 126 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 116, Judge Goulding held that small businesses in general are particularly vulnerable to robberies. I accept this view and further find that this risk is perhaps even greater for pharmacies. Many pharmacies are open long hours in locations often away from other retail premises. Pharmacists are required to handle large amounts of narcotics which while they may have a relatively modest retail price can often have a street value rivalling the amount of money that can be realized only from a bank or other large financial institution. This fact is made clear in this case as Capitol Pharmacy had, as a result of the threat of robbery, and despite being located in a busy part of town with nearby businesses, employed a buzzer system so that customers had to buzz to be admitted to the store. And as an additional precaution [they] kept the narcotics separately in a safe. This all emphasizes that these types of robberies must be met with the imposition of a substantial term of imprisonment.[18]A lengthy period of custody is typically required to meet the principles of sentencing for crimes of this nature.I must consider all the principles of sentencing set out in section 718 of the Criminal Code and place particular emphasis on the principles of denunciation, specific deterrence and general deterrence.[19]However, strong mitigating factors exist and I accept that the offender is a good candidate for rehabilitation. At paragraph 9 of her decision (R. v. Roberts, [2016] N.J. No. 167) Justice Marshall made the following comments on the issue of rehabilitation when she sentenced Mr. Roberts for the Hayloft Lounge offences:With respect to the prospects of rehabilitation, I accept that Mr. Roberts has indeed made recent efforts, while incarcerated, to deal with his issues.This is clear by the content of the report from the psychologist, as well as by his participation in programs, including Alcoholics Anonymous and anger management programs.At 34 years of age, Mr. Roberts is not too old to turn his life around; and the prospect of rehabilitation must be considered by the Court.However, in my view, deterrence, both general and specific, as well as denunciation must take priority.[20]Because Mr. Roberts has been convicted of multiple offences, I must complete an analysis as set out in paragraph 84 of Hutchings.I will first decide the appropriate sentence for each offence.[21]More particularly:(1)Armed robbery, contrary to 343-344(1)(b) –4 years(2)Possessing a weapon dangerous to the public, contrary to section 88(1)-88(2) – 18 months – (see R. v. Squires, 2014 NLTD(G) 162)(3)Having his face masked with the intent to commit an indictable offence, contrary to 351(2) – 18 months – (see R v. Hutchings; R v. Squires)(4)Assault with a weapon, contrary to section 267(a) – 18 months(5)Breach of recognizance, contrary to section 145(3)(a) – 3 months[22]This sentence totals 8 years, 9 months.[23]I must now decide whether the sentences should be served consecutively or concurrently “on the ground that they constitute a single criminal adventure.”The four substantive offences occurred during the robbery and will be served concurrently.However, following our Court of Appeal in R. v. Murphy, 2011 NLCA 16 (CanLII), the sentence for the breach of recognizance conviction shall be served consecutively.This sentence totals 4 years, 3 months.[24]I must now consider the totality principle and “take one last look at the combined sentence to determine whether it is unduly long or harsh, in the sense that it is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the responsibility of the offender.”The principle of totality is a component of the principle of proportionality.It is codified in section 718.2(c) of the Criminal Code which states that “where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh.”[25]Defence counsel submits that the Hayloft Lounge offences should inform my totality analysis on the subject charges because the police were tardy in laying the subject charges.She argues that if the subject charges had been laid sooner, the sentencing may have proceeded on both armed robberies at the same time.A review of the chronology is necessary in order to understand this argument:(1)On September 23, 2014, the offender committed the Hayloft Lounge offences ;(2)On November 17, 2015, the offender committed the subject offences.At the crime scene, DNA material was found on the pipe used to assault Mr. O’Keefe;(3)Later on November 17, 2015, the accused was charged with driving while prohibited and breaching a recognizance but he was not charged with the subject offences;(4)On January 29, 2016, the offender was convicted of the Hayloft Lounge offences, as well as for other offences.(5)On March 22, 2016, the lead investigator was advised that the DNA material found on the pipe was not matched with any samples registered at the National DNA Databank.(As confirmed by his criminal record, the offender had been ordered to provide and had provided a DNA sample when he was sentenced for an earlier offence in 2009.)(6)On April 18, 2016, the investigator was advised that the DNA sample found on the pipe matched the offender’s DNA and that the information that had been provided on March 22 was erroneous.(7)On April 27, 2016, the sentencing hearing pertaining to the Hayloft Lounge armed robbery proceeded.(8)On May 17, 2016, the offender was sentence for a total of ten offences that occurred on two separate offence dates.Justice Marshall gave consideration to the totality principle and imposed a sentence of 4 years.Included in that sentence was a sentence of 3 years, 6 months for the Hayloft Lounge armed robbery.(9)On the basis of the information that the offender’s DNA sample was found on the pipe used to assault Mr. O’Keefe, the police obtained a DNA warrant ordering the offender to provide a sample of his DNA on June 2, 2016.(10)On July 29, 2016, the DNA warrant was executed and the offender provided a DNA sample.(11)On August 26, 2016, the police were advised that the sample taken from Mr. Roberts in July matched the DNA matter obtained from the pipe used in the subject armed robbery.(12)On September 14, 2016, while he was at the St. John’s lock-up, the offender was charged with the subject offences.(13)On October 5, 2016, the offender requested to meet with police and confessed to the subject offences.[26]In the 2012 decision of R. v. Barrett, [2012] N.J. No. 234, in the context of totality, our Court of Appeal considered whether a sentence could be informed by a prior sentence presently being served by an offender.While the court held that a totality analysis typically considers only offences that are before the sentencing judge, if the facts of a particular case warrant it, consideration can be given to an existing sentence being served by the offender.The Court referenced its earlier decision of R. v. Penney, 2005 NLCA 31 (CanLII) wherein it relied on the Manitoba Court of Appeal decision of R. v. Saran (1996), 113 Man.R. (2d) 205:… the sentencing tribunal should, as always, take into account the totality of the sentences to be served by an accused in determining whether a particular sentence is a fit and proper one.In doing so, the court must bear in mind, if the facts be so, that there is an unexpired portion of a previous sentence still to be served by the accused.[27]At paragraph 24 of Barrett, Hoegg, J.A. stated:A totality analysis pursuant to section 718.2(c) does not expressly address consideration of offences which are not before the sentencing court.In ordinary circumstances, a judge who is imposing sentence for multiple offences conducts his or her totality analysis on considerations relating to sentencing for the multiple offences which are before him or her and does not usually consider a sentence previously imposed by another judge.This is not to say that consideration of an offender’s past convictions and sentences is not relevant to his sentencing for the current offences.The circumstances of an offender are always relevant to sentencing, notably with respect to the principle of rehabilitation, and the fact that an offender is incarcerated and for how long is a factor which could be considered by a sentencing judge.The issue is how consideration of this factor can be addressed when the circumstances of the case engage a totality analysis.[28]At paragraph 37, the Court went on to say:The trial judge must assess whether an offender’s incarceration for previous offences is a factor which, with all of the other factors bearing on a totality analysis, warrants a downward adjustment in sentence, and if so, explain why.[29]I am satisfied that the facts of this case fall within the type of cases contemplated by our Court of Appeal in Barrett and that the sentence for the Hayloft Lounge offences “warrants a downward adjustment in sentence…”I do not accept the Crown’s position that Mr. Roberts could have taken responsibility for these offences and been sentenced for them when he was sentenced for the Hayloft Lounge offences.I agree with defence counsel that a person should not be expected to plead guilty to offences for which he has not yet been charged. Neither do I accept that the DNA analysis could not have been completed before the May 17 sentencing hearing when the chronology shows that it took less than a month to complete the analysis.The DNA sample was obtained from Mr. Roberts on July 29 and the police were informed about the results of the analysis on August 26.Alternatively, even if the DNA analysis had not been completed by May 17, 2016, if police had sought the warrant in a more timely fashion, even after being notified of the hit at the DNA databank on April 18, 2016, and had executed that warrant on the offender before his May 17 sentencing for the other offences, at least Mr. Roberts would have been on notice that he was a suspect in the subject offences and he may have attempted to postpone his May sentencing.Because the police did not act expeditiously, the offender was not given that opportunity.[30]And irrespective of whether the DNA warrant prevented the offender from being sentenced at the same time for the Hayloft Lounge offences and the subject offences, if the offender received a sentence of 3 ½ years for the Hayloft robbery and a sentence of 4 years for the subject robbery, it would be crushing.It would be unduly harsh and it would impede the progress the offender has made with respect to rehabilitation.Supporting Mr. Roberts’ rehabilitation is in his best interest and in society’s best interest.A prior existing sentence is relevant to the circumstances of the offender and to ignore it ignores the fundamental purpose of the totality principle.Irrespective of whether an offender is presently serving a sentence for earlier offences or whether he or she is about to be sentenced for multiple offences, the period of incarceration being imposed engages the totality principle.It is the total amount of jail time that impacts rehabilitation and informs the analysis of whether the sentence is “unduly long or harsh.”[31]When I consider the delay in executing the DNA warrant and the offender’s existing sentence in the context of all the other aggravating and mitigating factors, I am satisfied that the principles of sentencing can be met with a sentence of 21 months for the armed robbery and a total sentence of 24 months for all the subject offences, to be served concurrent to the Hayloft Lounge offences; it balances the principles of specific and general deterrence, denunciation and rehabilitation.[32]In summary, I impose the following sentence:(1)Armed robbery – concurrent to his existing sentence – 21 months;(2)Possessing a weapon dangerous to the public – 18 months concurrent;(3)Having his face masked with the intent to commit an indictable offence – 18 months concurrent;(4)Assault with a weapon – 18 months concurrent;(5)Breach of recognizance – 3 months consecutive.[33]Both the offences of robbery and assault with a weapon are primary designated offences as set out in section 487.04 of the Criminal Code.The Crown sought and I am ordering a mandatory DNA order pursuant to section 487.051 of the Criminal Code.In compliance with that order, the offender is compelled to provide samples of bodily substances reasonably required for the purposes of forensic DNA analysis.[34]Pursuant to section 109 of the Criminal Code, the offender has also been convicted of an indictable offence “in the commission of which violence against a person was used, threatened or attempted and for which the person may be sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years or more.”I am therefore ordering a mandatory firearms prohibition.Because this is a subsequent offence, pursuant to section 109(3), the firearms prohibition shall be for life.[35]A Victim Fine Surcharge of $200 shall be imposed for each conviction.____________________________Judge Jacqueline BrazilProvincial Court Judge"}

C-46REASONS FOR SENTENCESKANES, PCJ:INTRODUCTION[1]On September 19, 2013, a trial commenced in the within matter with the accused charged with having committed the following indictable offences:Count No. 1On or about the 23rd day of August, A.D., 2012, at or near St. John’s, in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, did unlawfully operate or have the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the motor vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug and thereby caused bodily harm to William Hilliard, contrary to Section 255(2) of the Criminal Code.Count No. 2On or about the 23rd day of August, A.D., 2012, at or near St. John’s, in the Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, did unlawfully operate or have the care or control of a motor vehicle having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood and caused an accident resulting in bodily harm to William Hilliard, contrary to Section 255(2.1) of the Criminal Code.[2]The court heard from Constable Shaw and the complainant, Bill Hilliard.After hearing from these witnesses, the accused conceded the essential elements of the offence under s. 255 of the Criminal Code and a conviction was entered.The matter was then set over for sentencing.[3]Of note here is that the issue which had forced the matter to trial was that there was no medical evidence disclosed by the complainant to the Crown and therefore no pretrial disclosure of any medical evidence to the accused which would have allowed for an informed plea of guilt to be entered.Once the evidence of the complainant was heard, the accused immediately accepted that the grounds for “bodily harm” were made out and a conviction was entered on Count 2. Count 1 was dismissed.[4]Due to the manner in which the matter unfolded, the sentencing is approached as if a guilty plea had been entered at the earliest opportunity.[5]The facts upon which the conviction was entered are generally that on August 23, 2012, the complainant was walking his dog in the area of Airport Heights in the City of St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador.As he crossed the road near Roncalli School and having first pressed the button for the crosswalk light, a vehicle came from his right and stopped to allow him to cross in the crosswalk.As he proceeded past the stopped vehicle, another vehicle came from his right, having passed the stopped vehicle and struck him.The complainant says that as he fell back his foot was under the driver’s side front tire of the accused’s vehicle.He says that he called out for the accused to get off his foot and the accused slowly backed off.[6]The complainant was taken by ambulance to the hospital.The hospital records indicate that he was complaining of “++pain” and he had extensive bruising to his foot.Although the records indicate that Hilliard was diagnosed with a soft tissue injury to his foot, in his testimony the complainant indicated that on follow up x-rays a fracture was noted.He was then prescribed a boot which he says he wore for a month or so and occasionally thereafter.He also indicated that he has had ongoing problems with his foot which have required him to see an orthopedic surgeon for an injection and he has also required physiotherapy.[7]Constable Show testified that he attended the scene on August 23, 2012.The accused did not exhibit any difficulty with speaking or walking, however, there was a faint smell of alcohol.An ASD demand was made which registered a fail.The accused was then read his rights and caution and the breathalyzer demand was given.The accused agreed to provide breath samples.The readings obtained were 110 and 100 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood at 2030 hours and 2050 hours respectively.A charge was laid based upon the readings exceeding 80 mg/100 ml and this charge was ultimately upgraded to an over 80 causing bodily harm charge. The accused was also issued a traffic ticket for failing to yield to a pedestrian in a crosswalk.[8]The accused, who is 69 years old, testified at his sentencing hearing and indicated that he was driving along the roadway, with which he was very familiar, when he saw a vehicle stopped ahead of him with its left turning indicator flashing.He says he pulled out around and up even with this vehicle when the complainant connected with the left front fender of his car.He says he backed up and went over to help the complainant up and waited till the ambulance and fire department got there.POSITION OF THE PARTIES RE SENTENCING[9]The Crown is seeking a period of imprisonment of 90 days.[10]The defence proposes that an elevated fine will meet the objectives of sentencing pertinent to this case.RANGE OF SENTENCE AVAILABLE[11]The maximum sentencing for an offence under s. 255(2.1) is a term of imprisonment of not more than 10 years.It is of note that this offence is straight indictable. The Crown and Defence have agreed that a conditional sentence is not available.[12]In R. v. Oxford, [2010] N.J. No. 232 (NLCA), the court provided guidance with respect to sentencing in the context of a joint submission.In the instant case, I am not dealing with a joint submission and Oxford is not an impaired or over 80 case, but I have been referred to some of the general comments made in respect of sentencing and, in particular:75It must be remembered that notions of proportionality and determinations of appropriate ranges of sentence are protean concepts. In R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII) LeBel J. made the following comments about the sentencing process:[43] The language in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Code is sufficiently general to ensure that sentencing judges enjoy a broad discretion to craft a sentence that is tailored to the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the offender. The determination of a \"fit\" sentence is, subject to some specific statutory rules, an individualized process that requires the judge to weigh the objectives of sentencing in a manner that best reflects the circumstances of the case ...[44] The wide discretion granted to sentencing judges has limits. It is fettered in part by the case law that has set down, in some circumstances, general ranges of sentences for particular offences, to encourage greater consistency between sentencing decisions in accordance with the principle of parity enshrined in the Code. But it must be remembered that, while courts should pay heed to these ranges, they are guidelines rather than hard and fast rules. A judge can order a sentence outside that range so long as it is in accordance with the principles and objectives of sentencing. Thus, a sentence falling outside the regular range of appropriate sentences is not necessarily unfit. Regard must be had to all the circumstances of the offence and the offender, and to the needs of the community in which the offence occurred.76If, therefore, a sentence not involving a joint submission and falling outside the regular range of appropriate sentences is not necessarily an unfit sentence, then a fortiori a jointly-submitted sentence will not necessarily be unfit and certainly will not bring the administration of justice into disrepute simply by virtue of the fact that it falls outside the normal range.77In R. v. Bernier, 2003 BCCA 134 (CanLII), a five person panel of the British Columbia Court of Appeal, emphasized:[40] As to the term \"range\", in sentencing cases its proper use ... is only as a short way of describing what the court has done in previous appeals in which the offence and the offender were similar to those in the case at bar. The reason is this: no division of this court has the power to bind other divisions on future sentence appeals....[42] A \"range\" does not preclude on grounds of deterrence or denunciation or the gravity of the particular offence a sentence different from that \"range\". Nor does a \"range\" preclude a lesser sentence if some special circumstances warrant such a course....[74] This system of establishing ranges is imperfect ... They are guidelines, not rules. They are not, nor could they be, mandatory minimum and maximum sentences which demand compliance by trial judges.78As noted in Bernier, an identified range does not preclude a lesser sentence if \"special circumstances\" warrant such a course. Such special circumstances could include the existence of a plea bargain where an offender gives up his right to a trial in return for leniency in sentence and the Crown believes, on properly grounded reasons, that there is benefit to the prosecution of crime in agreeing to such a bargain. There is nothing inappropriate or contrary to the sentencing regime in approaching the notion of proportionality, in the context of a joint submission, by taking into account the fact that a plea bargain has been reached between Crown and defence counsel who are more familiar with the detailed factual underpinning of the case, its evidentiary strengths and weaknesses as well as other factors impinging on a successful prosecution or defence when determining whether the sentence is proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.[13]I have also been referred to the decision in R. v. Anstey, 2013 CanLII 1942 (NL PC), 2013 CanLII 1942 (NLPC) in which Gorman P.C.J. endorsed a joint submission imposing a period of 90 days imprisonment (intermittent), an 18 month driving prohibition and two years’ probation, along with a $500.00 victim fine surcharge, for an offence under s. 255(2.1) – causing bodily harm while driving with a blood alcohol over 80 mg/100 ml.At paragraph 29 of Anstey, Gorman P.C.J. noted that:[29]I have been unable to locate any sentencing precedents from this Province in relation to section 255(2.1) of the Criminal Code.The only sentencing precedent I have been able to locate is R. v. Harrington, 2012 ONSC 5363 (CanLII), [2012] O.J. No. 4545 (S.C.).In that case the offender had, while operating his motor vehicle in the wrong lane, collided head-on with another vehicle causing serious and life threatening injuries to the driver of the other vehicle.A period of nine months imprisonment and a three year driving prohibition were imposed.[14]After determining that case law with respect to sentencing for impaired driving causing bodily harm would be applicable, and after summarizing various decisions, Gorman P.C.J. noted that:[45]These precedents illustrate that significant periods of imprisonment have routinely been imposed for the offence of impaired driving causing bodily harm.The periods of imprisonment imposed have ranged from ninety days, intermittent (Fancy), to four months (Campbell and Mercer), to nine months (Harrington and Moore), to eight months (Clark), to nine months (Colombe), to ten months (Squires), to twelve months (Melanson), to fifteen months (Pittman), to sixteen months (Power and Mischaud), and two years (Gregoire and O’Keefe). The decisions which most closely resemble what occurred here are Moore (nine months), Squires (ten months) Power (sixteen months) and O’Keefe (twenty-four months).A prescriptive range has not been set.In R. v. Junkert, 2010 ONCA 549 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 3387, the Ontario Court of Appeal suggested that in “recent years there has been an upward trend in the length of sentences imposed for drinking and driving offences. The reasons for this trend can be attributed to society's abhorrence for the often tragic circumstances that result when individuals choose to drink and drive, thereby putting the lives and safety of others at risk.”[15]Aside from Anstey itself, the lowest sentence noted by Gorman P.C.J. was in the decision of R. v. Fancy, 207 CarswellNfld 179 (NLPC), in which Gorman P.C.J. had imposed a period of 90 days intermittent where there had been a blood alcohol reading of 221 mg/100 ml and the passenger on his motorcycle suffered a broken vertebrae in her neck when the accused drove the motorcycle off the road and into a ditch.Gorman indicated that:36In this particular case, considering Mr. Fancy's blood-alcohol level, the sentencing principles of general deterrence and rehabilitation, the consequences of his offence for Ms. Saunders and the sentencing principle of totality (see R. v. Spellacy (1995), 1995 CanLII 9898 (NL CA), 131 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 127 (N.L.C.A.)), a period of imprisonment in the range of nine to twelve months would be appropriate. However, considering Mr. Fancy's age, his lack of any previous convictions, his excellent prospects for rehabilitation and, in particular, the Crown's submission on sentence, I have decided to impose a period of imprisonment of a length which would not normally be imposed. The length of the period of imprisonment that I am about to impose will allow for it to be served on an intermittent basis in order to promote Mr. Fancy's rehabilitation by allowing him to maintain his employment.[16]Aside from these decisions, I have been referred to a number of decisions from other provincial jurisdictions where fines have been imposed for offences of impaired driving causing bodily harm.These include:•R. v. Murray, [1997] O.J. No. 6196 (ONCtGD) - $1,500 fine and 12 months probation•R. v. Weisgerber, [2009] S.J. No. 546; 2009 SKPC 107 (CanLII), 340 Sask.R. 298 (SKPC) - $2,000 fine and 3 years probation•R. v. Riddell, 2011 SKQB 378 (CanLII), [2011] S.J. No. 616; 2011 SKQB 378; 384 Sask.R. 52 (SKQB) - $2,500 fine and 3 years probation•R. v. Audy, [2011] M.J. No. 13; 2010 MBPC 55 (CanLII), 261 Man.R. (2d) 95 (MBPC) - $1,000 fine and 18 months probation•R. v. Rowan, [2003] O.J. No. 5922 (ONCtJus) – affirmed [2004] O.J. No. 3719; 2004 CanLII 22935 (ON CA), 190 O.A.C. 342 (ONCA) - $1,200 fine and 2 years probation[17]I was also referred to R. v. Henderson, [2012] M.J. No. 30; 2012 MBCA 9 (CanLII), 275 Man.R. (2d) 168; 279 C.C.C (3d) 406; 2012 CarswellMan 36; 26 M.V.R. (6th) 173 (MBCA) where the imposition of a suspended sentence was upheld by the Manitoba Court of Appeal. The summary provides that:Appeal by the Crown from a suspended sentence and two years' probation imposed on Henderson following her guilty plea a charge of impaired driving causing bodily harm. On her way home after drinking at a bar, Henderson drove into the back of a City of Winnipeg street-cleaning truck, pinning a City employee, Pacheco, between her car and the truck. Pacheco suffered severe injuries to his legs, from which he would never fully recover. The trial judge concluded that Henderson had demonstrated \"exceptional circumstances\" arising from the side effects of the drug Mirapex, which Henderson had been prescribed several weeks prior to the collision for the medical condition known as \"restless leg syndrome.\" The trial judge accepted the uncontested medical evidence filed by Henderson and found that the drug \"caused her to drink compulsively that day\" and that her choice to drive \"was an impaired choice by someone who had not chosen to become impaired.\" The trial judge concluded that this case was out of the ordinary because the side effects of the drug led Henderson to drink compulsively and affected her judgment, including her decision to drive in her intoxicated state. On appeal, the Crown argued that the trial judge made palpable and overriding errors of fact with respect to the side effects of Mirapex, erred in principle when she found that the circumstances were exceptional, and imposed an unfit sentence.HELD: Appeal dismissed. While a jail sentence was normally imposed for impaired driving causing bodily harm, even for a first offender, Parliament had not imposed a minimum sentence for the offence. A jail sentence was called for unless there were exceptional circumstances that permitted the judge to impose a non-custodial sentence. The trial judge made the following crucial findings of fact for determining that there were exceptional circumstances: Henderson did not normally drink alcohol; shortly before the collision she was put on Mirapex for restless leg syndrome; Mirapex was linked with compulsive behaviour; Mirapex caused Henderson to drink compulsively that day; and her choice to drive was an \"impaired choice\" by someone who had not chosen to become impaired. The trial judge accepted the uncontested medical evidence that Henderson's \"alcohol use and poor judgment, i.e., driving while intoxicated, was underlied [sic] by the administration of Mirapex.\" Given the evidence before her, and particularly the uncontested medical evidence, the trial judge was entitled to make the findings of fact that she did. In concluding that there were exceptional circumstances, the sentencing judge focused on the reason behind Henderson's drinking and her subsequent impaired choice to drive. Both of these, on the evidence, were impacted by what for Henderson were the unknown side effects of Mirapex. By doing so, the trial judge was addressing Henderson's moral blameworthiness for this serious offence and the principle of proportionality. Given the uncontested medical evidence before her, the trial judge did not err in finding that Henderson's drinking was caused by the drug Mirapex and that her level of intentional risk taking by driving while impaired was lessened as a result. The trial judge made no error of law in determining that there were exceptional circumstances that permitted her to consider a non-custodial sentence for Henderson. The sentence was not unfit.[18]I was also referred to the decision in R. v. Lommerse, [2013] Y.J. No. 44 wherein the Yukon Territorial Court imposed a $1500 fine upon conviction for the s. 255(2.1) offence of causing an accident resulting in bodily harm while driving with blood alcohol over the legal limit. Between the time that I was referred to that decision and when I heard final submissions in the instant case, the decision was overturned by the Yukon Territory Court of Appeal in R. v. Lommerse [2013] Y.J. no. 89 (YKCA).The original sentence was determined to be unfit and the offender was sentenced to a period of 4 months imprisonment. In coming to this decision the appeal court stated:19 In my view, the judge understated the risks inherent in Mr. Lommerse's decision to drive while impaired, and consequently understated the level of moral culpability involved.20 It is true that driving an ATV in a parking lot entails different risks than driving an automobile on a public road. Mr. Lommerse was unlikely to injure members of the general public, for example. On the other hand, the ATV was an inherently unstable vehicle with limited protection for its occupants. Further, the nature of the driving - which was intended to provide thrills for the vehicle occupants - made impaired driving particularly risky. I do not see that the need for a sentence directed at general deterrence is in any way mitigated by the nature of the activity involved.21 As the British Columbia Court of Appeal recently emphasized in R. v. Smith, 2013 BCCA 173 (CanLII), deterrence and denunciation are important goals in sentencing for impaired driving offences. These offences are often committed by individuals who are normally law-abiding and have sympathetic backgrounds - but it is just such individuals who must be deterred from impaired driving. For that reason, custodial sentences are the norm for impaired driving causing bodily harm and impaired driving causing death.22 The parties accept that the ordinary range of sentence for impaired driving causing bodily harm in Yukon starts at four months. The sentence in this case - a moderate fine and a period of probation with limited conditions - is not a fit sentence.23 I would grant leave to appeal, set aside the sentence imposed, and substitute a sentence at the low end of the usual sentencing range - that is, one of four months imprisonment. The driving prohibition imposed by the trial judge is appropriate and should remain in place. (Emphasis added)[19]It would be difficult to reconcile the cases outside of our jurisdiction where a fine was imposed, with the reported cases in our province.Certainly the range of sentences outlined in Anstey seems to accord with the range noted in Lommerse to apply in the Yukon with the low end of the range being at about the 4 month imprisonment mark. This is not to say that there could never be a proper s. 255 (2.1) conviction for which a fine could be imposed - the Criminal Code itself does allow for the imposition of such a penalty - but there would clearly have to be exceptional circumstances for such a sentence to be fit.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCE AND THE ACCUSED[20]I will say that neither of the cases to which I have been referred have factors which could be said to be on all fours with the instant case.Indeed, all of the cases referenced are significantly more serious in many ways.Here the blood alcohol reading at 100 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood is much lower than any of the cases to which I have been referred.It is also of note that there were no indicia of impairment noted by the officer who testified.This is not to suggest that the accused was not impaired just that he did not appear to be grossly so. The roadside breath demand was based upon the odour of alcohol.Although there was a Highway Traffic Act offence of failing to yield right of way to a pedestrian at a crosswalk, the offender was not driving at any great speed or he would not have been able to stop as quickly as he did – albeit he did drive onto the victim’s foot.Finally, although the offender had an outstanding charge at the time of this offence, he is being sentenced here as a first offender.[21]Evidence was called from Curt Hillier, a registered psychologist, who testified that he has diagnosed the offender with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which he indicates to have arisen from the offender’s time in the military.Hillier testified that sentencing this offender to a term in jail would be a particularly harsh punishment for this offender.[22]In response, the Crown refers to the decision in R. v. Branton, 2013 NLCA 61 (CanLII), where it is noted:[32]In her sentencing decision, the judge stated at paragraphs 75 and 78:The accused has behavioural and medical issues which have been well documented for years.All of the professionals indicate that if his issues are not addressed, the likelihood that he will reoffend will increase.He has not been properly treated and the scenario that was predicted by the experts appears to be the exact one that is evolving.…At present, the accused is 20 years old and has expressed a desire to take counseling and medications to keep himself on the straight and narrow.I must seriously consider his expressed desire to rehabilitate which, in my opinion, will provide the best protection for society against him re-offending …[33]In so deciding, the judge relied on this Court’s decisions in R. v. Peters, 2000 NFCA 55 (CanLII), 2000 NFCA 55, 194 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 184; Edmunds, and R. v. Lundrigan, 2012 NLCA 43 (CanLII), 2012 NLCA 43, 324 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 270 to support her view that because Mr. Branton was suffering from mental health issues, he required support to assist in his rehabilitation.[34]The general principle articulated in Peters, Edmunds and Lundrigan is that an offender’s mental health issues are a relevant factor in his or her sentencing when there is an established connection between an offender’s mental health issues and the commission of his or her crimes.[35]Mental illness covers a broad spectrum of behaviours, and it does not, by itself, absolve an offender of responsibility for an offence (outside of the provisions of section 16 of the Criminal Code) or automatically justify a lighter sentence than would otherwise be appropriate.When an offender has mental health issues, treatment can sometimes be provided to him or her while incarcerated and if probation is ordered, through the imposition of conditions directing that the offender seek medical assistance, participate in treatment programs, and so forth.Such conditions are designed to assist in the offender’s rehabilitation and supervise him or her with the objective of preventing him or her from reoffending.These probationary conditions are “blunt tools”, as Crown counsel put it in argument, and they do not guarantee results.…[38]In summary on this issue, Mr. Branton’s medical diagnoses are part of his personal circumstances and were therefore a legitimate consideration for the sentencing judge in the same way an offender’s health is often a sentencing consideration.However, they were overemphasized and afforded great weight when there was no connection established between them and the offences committed, and no recognition that Mr. Branton had been assessed and counselled in relation to his behaviours in the past and that despite same, he has continued to offend. (emphasis added)[23]Given Branton, although I accept that the PTSD from which the offender suffers is a personal characteristic which I can take into account, I must be careful not to over-emphasize it, particularly as there is no evidence that it was a factor leading to or diminishing his responsibility for the offence for which he has been convicted.[24]The fact that the PTSD is not suggested to have been a cause or contributing factor in the accused’s drinking or his driving while doing so distinguishes the instant case from the Manitoba Court of Appeal decision in Henderson where the accused was given a suspended sentence in the situation where the commission of the offence was found to be partially due to an underlying medical condition and the treatment for that condition.SENTENCE IMPOSED[25]In all of the foregoing, including: that this offence is at the low end of the spectrum for seriousness given the offender’s relatively low blood alcohol reading, the degree of seriousness of the injury to the victim and the offender’s good antecedents, I find that a sentence at the low end of the range is appropriate for this offender; however I do not feel that the objectives of sentencing would be properly satisfied through the imposition of a fine. Further, I do not find there to be the exceptional circumstances necessary to properly allow for the imposition of a lesser sentence than imprisonment. Given the personal circumstances of this accused I find that a period of imprisonment for 90 days is a fit and proper sentence. It is unfortunate that I do not have the authority to allow the sentence to be served conditionally given the PTSD from which the offender suffers however the term of imprisonment may be served intermittently. There will be a period of probation in force for the period during which the intermittent sentence is being served. Additionally there will be a 3 year driving prohibition consecutive to any other such prohibition to which he may be subject._________________________LOIS J. SKANESProvincial Court Judge."}

Pollard................................................................................................................for the CrownM. Caroline...........................................................................................................for the accusedCOLE J.:Reasons for Sentence[1]The 37 year-old accused has entered a plea of guilty to a single charge of conspiring to traffick 28.75 grams of crack cocaine. An Agreed Statement of Facts was filed in support of the plea, the salient portions of which read as follows:Between February 1, 2011 and March 22, 2011 Michelle Dzienis resided in Kitchener, Ontario. During that time she was in regular contact through telephone conversations and texting with a male known to her by the name of “Dukes”. Ms. Dzienis had been addicted to crack cocaine for approximately six years and had purchased for her personal use from “Dukes” on occasion….Over the course of twenty-two days in February and March 2011 Dzienis and Dukes were in regular contact with each other using text messages and phone calls. In each case Dzienis was the attempted purchaser of crack cocaine and Dukes was the seller. The police intercepted and recorded 133 of these contacts.On March 8, 2011, Dzienis texted Dukes “hey hun, just wanted you to know that am clean now and trying hard to stay that way”. Dukes responded “That’s da way ta go”.That same day Dzienis texted Dukes - “lookin’ for up” and “hard” - she stated she was willing to drive to him if she could get a “Cuban for 4” - a ¼ ounce, or 7 grams - for $400. If he could agree to the sale “it’s gone” because “that’s what her boy wants”. Dukes responded telling her he did not have that amount available. He had “B” for which he wanted “2,4” which meant he would sell her a 1/8 ounce of crack cocaine for $240. A meeting was arranged to make the purchase.On March 11, 2011 Dzienis texted Dukes “Need 14 how much”- referring to a half ounce of cocaine. She then placed a telephone call to Dukes. He told her he was ready anytime. Dukes asked if she wants a “half” - referring to a half ounce of cocaine - and that it would be“8,5” meaning $850. Dzienis wanted to know if she could do the deal right away; Dukes said “yes but she has to have wheels”. Dukes suggested they meet at Sports World in Kitchener.On March 22, 2011 Dzienis contacted Dukes by text message for the purpose of purchasing crack cocaine for a friend of hers…. Dzienis told Dukes that her friend will take a “whole for 16”, meaning an ounce of crack cocaine, for $1600.00, and that “he is one of her biggest guys”. Dukes stated he “can do that”. Dzienis asked Dukes to tell her “it’s good” referring to the quality of the crack cocaine. Dukes said “it is”. They discussed where to meet to complete the transaction. They agreed that since they both have cars they would meet at Sports World where she will jump into his car. Approximately half an hour later Dzienis placed a telephone call to Dukes advising him she was on the expressway and would be there soon. Dukes responded that he was 15 minutes away.A few minutes later Dzienis placed a telephone call to Dukes telling him that she was at McDonald’s on Sportsworld Drive and that she was in a grey Sunfire.At approximately 6 pm in the McDonald’s restaurant parking lot on Sportsworld Drive, Dzienis exited a Pontiac Sunfire, which remained occupied by two other individuals, and entered a black Cadillac. The Cadillac left the parking lot and drove to [a stash house] where it remained for a few minutes before returning to the Tim Horton’s at Sportsworld Drive and King Street. The Cadillac entered the parking lot where the Pontiac Sunfire was now parked. Dzienis exited the Cadillac, and the Cadillac then left the area.Police arrested Dzienis for conspiracy to traffick in crack cocaine as she was walking towards the Sunfire. At the time of her arrest Dzienis was searched.She had a baggie containing a bulk piece of crack cocaine weighing just under 28 grams.She also had a crack pipe with traces of crack cocaine….Subsequent to her arrest Dzienis advised police she had received the crack cocaine from Dukes and it was intended for one of the individuals who had been with her in the Sunfire.[2]In his submissions on sentence defence counsel particularly drew my attention to one portion of this Agreed Statement of Facts, namely that at a time when Ms Dzienis could not have known that her communications with Dukes were being intercepted, she texted him that she “just wanted you to know that am clean now and trying hard to stay that way”. Counsel invites me to infer that this is a clear indication that Ms Dzienis’ efforts toward reformation – however imperfect[1] – had started prior to her arrest, and that I should see the steps she has taken since her arrest in that context.[3]For his part Crown counsel submitted that the agreed facts demonstrate (a) that Ms Dzienis is so knowledgeable as a “drug broker” that her purchaser trusted her to negotiate price and quantities as well as to sample the product(s) before purchase (b) that her willingness to traffick at the ½ oz. to 1 oz. level was both ongoing and was certainly above the minimal “piece” level common to addict-traffickers as disclosed in the case law, and that (c) given the level of drug dealing disclosed by the wiretaps, and given her criminal record, she is “a moderate to high risk to reoffend”.[4]Ms Dzienis spent five days in pre-sentence custody before her release on what is commonly known as a “house arrest bail”. By the time sentence is imposed, she will have been subject to those bail conditions for about 15 ½ months, apparently without incident.THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES[5]Defence counsel’s principal submission was that I should impose a conditional sentence. Rather than making a specific proposal as to the length of the conditional sentence that might be appropriate, he suggested a methodology that I could and should apply. He argued that the ultimate length of the conditional sentence should be determined according to the credit I would be prepared to give for some 15 ½ months she has spent subject to this “house arrest bail”. His preference would be that I should credit this at a 1/2:1 rate i.e. that I should determine the appropriate length of the conditional sentence and then reduce the actual conditional sentence by approximately 8 months.[6]Defence counsel argued in the alternative that if I were to come to the conclusion that an actual custodial sentence should be imposed, I should credit the period of time spent subject to house arrest at a 1:1 rate i.e. that I should reduce any custodial period by one day for each day spent on bail subject to house arrest.[7]Though the Court of Appeal has said on several occasions that a sentencing judge has discretion to make an allowance for some credit for time spent under restrictive bail conditions by way of some reduction of sentence, the Court has been equally clear that a sentencing judge should have some evidence that the terms and conditions of release have been particularly onerous. In other words, the mere fact that, as here, an offender has been subject to “house arrest” for many months does not give rise to any presumption that there should be any allowance made. After all, the offender is not in custody (see R. v. Downes (2006) 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 488; R. v. Panday (2007) 2007 ONCA 598 (CanLII), 226 C.C.C. (3d) 349; R. v. Ijam 2007 ONCA 597 (CanLII); R. v. Lindsay 2009 ONCA 532 (CanLII); R. v. M.G. 2007 ONCA 837 (CanLII); R. v. Junkert 2010 ONCA 549 (CanLII)). With respect, defence counsel called no evidence to support his submission that the accused’s time subject to a “house arrest bail” has been particularly onerous. In fact, when the accused exercised her right to speak to sentence, she told me that house arrest has actually been beneficial to her because it has kept her away from entering into situations where she might have been tempted to revert to drug abuse. I do not therefore consider that any sentence I might impose should be reduced by some form of pre-sentence credit for time spent on bail subject to house arrest. Further, since the 5 days she spent in custody pending her release on bail was so brief for an experienced offender, I do not propose to reduce the ultimate sentence by that amount (or by some other fraction).[8]Defence counsel did not address enforcement mechanisms that might accompany a conditional sentence – such as electronic monitoring of house arrest - nor did he propose any other specific optional conditions that might be attached to a conditional sentence. Similarly, he did not address whether there should be any probationary term to follow any carceral or conditional sentence I might impose.[9]Crown counsel took the position that an actual custodial sentence in the two years less a day to two years range would prima facie be called for in the circumstances of this case, considering (a) the level of the offender’s drug dealing (b) the offender’s previous record – particularly given that she was still on probation until a few days before her arrest date - and (c) appellate case law which has considered the appropriate approach to “addict traffickers”. However, given Ms Dzienis’ relatively early guilty plea, her express agreement to implicate “Dukes” through testimony (should the Crown require it as his case proceeds through the courts), and her efforts towards her rehabilitation since arrest, Crown counsel argued that the appropriate sentence should be one of 15 months actual incarceration.[10]Crown counsel further suggested that upon release from confinement Ms Dzienis should be subject to a two-year period of probation. According to my notes, he did not propose specific optional terms of probation.THE BACKGROUND OF THE OFFENDER[11]In addition to the Agreed Statement of Facts and the submissions of defence counsel, I directed that a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) be prepared. That report, much of which has been confirmed through collateral sources, discloses a dreadful childhood of ongoing parental physical and emotional neglect (fuelled by alcoholism and drug abuse), frequent episodes of dire poverty (rural and urban), physical and attempted sexual abuse by at least one of mother’s abusive boyfriends, and recurrent admissions to Children’s Aid care. Her biological father is now deceased, and she has little or no contact with her mother.[12]Because I believe it is particularly relevant as part of measuring the steps the offender has taken towards rehabilitating herself in recent months, it will be useful to summarize those parts of the PSR that relate to the offender’s own children, given that a CAS caseworker told the writer of the PSR that her children “have written their mother off at times”. Her daughter Linda M. (now 20) was born when Ms Dzienis was 15 years old.[13]Some months later Ms Dzienis had a brief sexual relationship with her friend and current surety John V. This produced a son Jason V., now 18 years old. Initially Ms Dzienis had custody of both her children but because of her drug use at the time[2], both children were apprehended by the local Children’s Aid Society. John V. gained custody of his son when the child was three years old, and has raised him to adulthood. John V. and Ms Dzienis maintained intermittent contact over the years, so she would see her son during those contacts. When she was charged with the current offences John V. agreed to act as her surety, and they now live together in a platonic relationship, which he reports is “very positive and caring”. Jason V. lives in the same house as his parents, and, though he was not interviewed by the writer of the PSR, he is reported as apparently now having an amicable relationship with his mother.[14]Interestingly, about a year ago Linda M. moved in with her mother, stepbrother and John V. Linda reported to the writer of the PSR that “her mother is becoming more of a mother and confidante to her”. She and John V. concur that Ms Dzienis “has maintained her sobriety regarding drug use since being arrested on this charge. [Linda] says her mother thinks more clearly and is more patient than she has ever been. Therefore, she is becoming more of the mother she should have been many years ago”.[15]From 1997-2007 Ms Dzienis was involved in an “on again, off again” relationship with Kenneth Dzienis, whom she married in 2005. She reports that it was he who introduced her to crack cocaine, which she concedes she has frequently used since that time. Not surprisingly, the offender began to come to the attention of local police departments in London, Woodstock, Kitchener and Guelph. Though she has no actual convictions for drug offences, defence counsel was entirely candid that her 17 previous adult[3] convictions – for thefts, various types of mischief, being in possession of stolen property, failing to comply with various forms of court orders - are all related to her drug abuse. Her record starts in 2006, when she was 21 years of age. She has served several short periods of incarceration, the longest of which was 30 days. As her record grew, she found it more difficult to obtain bail, so she has served periods of approximately the same length in pre-sentence custody.[16](I pause in the narrative to point out that the absence of any drug convictions on Ms Dzienis’ record is important for another reason, that being that the statutory presumption in favour of a custodial term indicated in s.10 (2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act does not apply here).[17]Many of the various sentences imposed have been accompanied by orders of probation. Apart from a one-year hiatus, she was on probation continuously from May 4, 2006 until March 17, 2011. She is thus well known to the Woodstock and Kitchener probation authorities. The writer of the PSR, who knows her well, summarized her response to community supervision as follows:“Probation and Parole Services records state her reporting habits were sporadic until her last period of probation. She reported well on the most recent Order. Her lifestyle was described as transient over the span of all the Orders she served. She lived with numerous boyfriends over the past six years, with friends or with others she would meet and briefly stayed with.Probation officers assigned to her case over the first five Probation Orders referred her to numerous community resources from counselling for her emotional health and addictions issues. She either did not attend, or reoffend and spend time in jail so that she could not attend or attended for up to a couple of sessions with a counsellor and then cease to continue to attend….The subject completed two conditions of community service during the first five Orders despite the fact that she continued to struggle with her addictions to crack and oxycontins. She readily admitted that despite her effort to cease her use of these drugs, she continually relapsed. She associated with people who had criminal records and were engaged in criminal activity including drug use. She even reoffended with her ex-husband, Ken Dzienis.”[18]Despite this gloomy picture, the writer of the PSR noted some positive changes in addition to Ms Dzienis’ reconciliation with her adult children. During her last period of probation Ms Dzienis was either referred to or voluntarily started seeing her physician Dr. P. Kugler, in whom she apparently has confidence[4]. After being released on bail on the current offence, she continued to see Dr. Kugler. At his suggestion she consented over a three month period to undergo drug screening. Dr. Kugler writes (Exhibit 3) that “I have 6 urines on record all negative for cocaine”[5]. Dr. Kugler then referred her to a local psychiatrist, a step approved of by Probation because Ms. Dzienis reports that “her failure to follow through with [group] counselling and treatment seems to be related to her fear of actually facing her traumatic past”. The writer of the PSR fairly concludes: “[d]espite her history, there are signs that she is making an effort to maintain positive changes in her lifestyle”.[19]At the conclusion of oral argument, I reserved judgment so that I could provide written reasons given the thoroughness of counsel’s submissions. This also afforded an opportunity to see whether Ms Dzienis’ efforts at rehabilitation would continue. I therefore requested that a supplementary PSR be prepared, directed to two issues: (a) a further report on her progress up to the sentencing date (b) in the event I determined that a conditional sentence should be imposed, whether the “house arrest” component usually attached to an order could be enforced by way of electronic monitoring. I have now received two reports from Probation authorities. The first, entitled “Addendum to Pre-Sentence Report” confirms that Ms Dzienis continues to obey the “house arrest” conditions of her bail, including that she not leave her residence unless accompanied by her surety Mr. V. He in turn reports that because he has been working 10-hour days six days per week, he has been unable to accompany her to meetings and appointments. She has however recently been able to connect with a counselling agency in Kitchener, and has had an initial intake meeting with a counsellor. She told the writer of the PSR that she intends to work with this counsellor on “grief issues, her victimization of abuse (sic) and mental health issues”.[20]The second report from Probation, entitled “Electronic Supervision Technological Report” (Exhibit 6), confirms that her [new] “residence can accommodate ESP technology if required”.[21]Before discussing some of the case law referred to by counsel, I wish to comment on two aspects of Ms Dzienis’ current living situation that appear to relate to her rehabilitative efforts and prospects. The first is that through a combination of support from Ontario Works and casual employment she is able to work from home putting together spring mechanisms for Hydro boxes. Her current employer, for whom she has worked for over a year, provided a letter indicating that she “is a very conscientious worker and takes pride in doing her job, which is always done well and on time. I would have no hesitation in recommending Michelle as I have found her to be a very satisfactory employee”. While the writer of the letter may not have known that it would be used for court purposes, the writer of the PSR was shown a pay stub from that employer, so it does appear that Ms Dzienis is working legitimately.[22]The PSR notes that Ms Dzienis was supported by Ontario Works while doing home-based part-time work of the same nature from 2007 on, during some of which time she was obviously fuelling her addiction and supplementing her income through drug trafficking. It could thus be objected – though Crown counsel did not place much reliance on this – that her living arrangement did not deter or discourage her from continuing to engage in illegal activities. However, when Ms Dzienis exercised her right to address the court under s.726 of the Code I asked her if she felt she could live up to the terms of a “house arrest” conditional sentence of considerable duration. In simple language that I felt had a ring of truth to it, she told me that she is now entirely content to work from home both because she is able to interact with her children, but also because being at home makes it easier for her to avoid individuals and environments that could lead her back into physical and psychological addiction. Furthermore – and this is the second point I draw about her rehabilitative prospects drawn from her current living arrangement - Mr. V. told the court (through counsel) that even when his commitments as a surety are concluded he “wouldn’t have the slightest hesitation” in demanding that she leave the house immediately if he (or her children) considered that she was “even beginning to deteriorate”. I inferred from what counsel told me that Ms Dzienis’ daughter (and likely her son) share the same sentiments.CASE LAW CITED BY COUNSEL[23]Defence counsel cited some 27 cases, 21 of which were decided by Ontario courts, in which conditional sentences have been imposed for trafficking various drugs where there has been evidence of extensive efforts towards rehabilitation by the time sentence was being considered. While Crown counsel accepted that there is (both pre- and post-Proulx) a considerable body of precedent in favour of the position being advanced by defence counsel, he pointed out that the accused in many of those cases were either first offenders, or had either minor or very dated criminal records[6]. He argued that Ms Dzienis’ very recent and quite extensive history of criminal behaviour disentitles her to making a claim for mitigation of sentence to the extent of reducing the penalty below one of actual incarceration. His submission was that such mitigation as she can claim derives from the positive factors outlined in paragraph 9 supra, namely her relatively early guilty plea, her express agreement to implicate “Dukes” through testimony, and her efforts towards her rehabilitation since arrest.[24]Crown counsel based a considerable portion of his argument on the 1983 decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Holt [1983] O.J. No. 8, which he submitted still governs the approach a trial judge should take to the sentencing of an “addict trafficker”. In that case the offender was a long-time heroin addict who sold an undercover officer two ounces of that drug, which, if “cut” to the street level quality available in Toronto at that time would have an (approximate) street value of $72,000.00. The disposition of the case had been delayed for some 2 ½ years to give the offender an opportunity to rid himself of his drug dependency, which had been achieved by the time he ultimately pleaded guilty. Obviously impressed by the offender’s progress, and influenced by Ontario and other case law (see paragraph 6 of the judgment), the trial judge considered the case to be “exceptional” and imposed a suspended sentence and three years probation. On appeal by the Crown the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had erred. Weatherston J.A. wrote for the Court:“I do not deduce from those cases that any principle has been established that a convicted drug trafficker should ordinarily be released from custody and his sentence suspended if he persuades the Court that he has rid himself of his own dependency on drugs and is apparently rehabilitated. These are not exceptional circumstances….I do not preclude the possibility that a suspended sentence might be proper if there are the additional factors that the trafficking has been casual and has been done solely for the purpose of and limited in quantities sufficient only to support the accused’s own dependency.In the present case, the evidence merely discloses that the respondent was addicted to heroin and that he trafficked in heroin. There is no evidence showing or even indicating a causal connection between the respondent’s addiction to heroin and his trafficking in it. There is no evidence that the addiction was a contributing cause, let alone the sole cause or even a substantial cause of his involvement in this business. Nor is there any evidence that his trafficking was limited to trafficking for the purpose of satisfying his own addiction.…[T]he respondent was, commendably, able apparently to rid himself of his addiction to heroin. It was right for the trial judge to take that into consideration, but it did not lessen the seriousness of the offences. Nothing about the circumstances of the offences, or the subsequent conduct of the respondent constituted “exceptional circumstances” so as to justify suspended sentences.” (paras. 7-8; 11)While Crown counsel was prepared to concede that the evidence in the case at bar is somewhat more favourable to Ms Dzienis, in the sense that he generally accepted that her addiction was the main factor motivating her drug trafficking, he nevertheless argued that Holt continues to be the law in Ontario to the extent that the only relief granted by the Court of Appeal in that case was to reduce what the court considered would be an otherwise merited penitentiary term down to a reformatory term of two years less a day. By analogy, he argues that Ms Dzienis’ entitlement to a reduction of sentence to mark her rehabilitative efforts to date should result in a reduction of a custodial sentence from around the two-year mark to one of 15 months.[25]I agree with Crown counsel that there does not appear to be any appellate decision in Ontario that directly modifies or challenges the holding in Holt. To that extent I agree with him that Holt has not been overruled or otherwise found to be inappropriate to apply in cases involving addict traffickers whose criminal activities are more than “casual and…done solely for the purpose of and limited in quantities sufficient only to support the accused’s own dependency”. However, through the good offices of one of my judicial colleagues, I have been made aware of a very brief judgment[7] of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Greene (May 27, 2002, Ct. File #C37307 per Rosenberg, Cronk \u0026 Armstrong JJA.), which expressly adopts the thrust of the important decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Preston (1990) 79 C.R. 3d) 61 revising that Court’s approach to sentencing “addict traffickers”.[26]Ms Preston was a long-time heroin addict, 41 years of age by the time the appeal was heard. Before the charges under consideration by the appeal court, she had “amassed a total record of 23 convictions, including eight for narcotics offences, four of which were for trafficking in heroin, five soliciting or other prostitution related convictions, and an assortment of escape, unlawfully at large, failing to appear and breach of probation convictions. Apart from concurrent sentences of two years less one day on three counts of trafficking in heroin, imposed in 1976, her longest sentences have been 18 months on a charge of confinement, also in 1976, and 18 months for another heroin trafficking conviction in 1985. All other sentences imposed on her have been for 90 days or less”.[27]Not surprisingly, Ms Preston again found herself before the court servicing the Vancouver Downtown East Side about to be sentenced for three charges of possession of not insignificant quantities of heroin, arising from three separate incidents. Counsel for the Crown, stressing the importance of deterrence and the protection of the public, submitted that in light of the nature of the offences and her previous criminal record Ms Preston should be sentenced to imprisonment[8]. Defence counsel pointed to several steps Ms Preston had been taking to rid herself of her addiction. Considering the offender’s efforts to be “genuine”[9], the sentencing judge considered that there was a reasonable chance of rehabilitation, and declined to incarcerate Ms Preston. Sentence was suspended and she was placed on probation for a period of two years with an order for drug counselling as directed by her probation officer.[28]The Crown appealed to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. In a somewhat unusual step the court of its own motion decided to convene a panel of five judges in order that it might “take this opportunity to reconsider, free from the constraints that may be seen to be imposed by any of its previous decisions”. In result the court concluded that the trial judge had not erred “when he considered the rehabilitation of the respondent to be of greater importance than any deterrent value that a sentence of incarceration might have”. The Court went on:“Underlying much of the argument of counsel for the Crown was the suggestion that that to approve the disposition of the trial judge in this case would be to “decriminalize” heroin. Nothing could be further from the truth. A court would only be justified in giving more weight to the possibility of rehabilitation, rather than deterrence, where there is a reasonable basis for believing that the motivation for such change is genuine and there is a reasonable possibility that it will succeed. There will undoubtedly be many cases in which no such prospect exists, and in such cases it would be an error in principle to allow the factor of deterrence to be overshadowed by the illusion of rehabilitation.” (at 72; emphasis added)[29]In Greene the Ontario Court of Appeal was asked to consider the appropriateness of a sentence of two years less a day for a charge of break and enter, where the offender broke into a residence and stole a computer to fuel his cocaine addiction. He had:“…an appalling criminal record including over one hundred convictions for break and enter. The appellant is of aboriginal descent. He had a very difficult childhood marked by abuse within the family. He was also sexually abused at a training school. He developed a substance abuse problem in his teenage years and he has been unable to break out of the addiction, except for a few short periods. He has attempted some drug rehabilitation programmes. Not surprisingly, given the length and seriousness of his abuse problems he has not succeeded to date. His drug addiction is the root of his problems with the law. The appellant has had some success in writing endeavours and is hopeful of attending McMaster University.” (para. 3)[30]In reducing the sentence to one year custody, the Court of Appeal quoted with approval the appellate decision in Preston:“Indeed, to expect a perfect result would be unrealistic, for it seems unlikely that a pattern of conduct and a lifestyle that has persisted for over 20 years can be changed overnight. There are bound to be relapses on the long road to recovery from any substance addiction.” (at 74)The Court continued:“The courts must not be overly critical of an offender in the position of this appellant. What is important is that he has made and continues to make efforts at curbing his addiction. A recent report from the John Howard Society of Canada suggests there is some reason for optimism.” (para. 6; emphasis added)[31]I infer from this decision that the Ontario Court of Appeal has now said that an addict trafficker need not be incarcerated where (a) there is evidence that they are making “genuine” efforts to deal with their substance addiction, and (b) there is evidence that there is a “reasonable possibility” that those efforts will be successful.[32]Crown counsel relied on R. v. Tahal 1999 CanLII 2517 (ON CA), [1999] O.J. No. 2563 as support for the proposition that, absent highly exceptional circumstances, a significant custodial term should normally be imposed for trafficking in crack cocaine. In that case a 15 month sentence was imposed at trial for (a) selling .16 grams of crack to an undercover officer, and (b) being found in possession of another 1.12 grams of crack for the purpose of trafficking. The Court of Appeal said that such a sentence would have been appropriate, but varied the sentence to a conditional sentence of 14 months. The court wrote:“Manifestly, the principle of general deterrence must take precedence over the other recognized principles of sentencing in cases of this nature. However, in all of the circumstances, that principle is adequately met by the imposition of a conditional sentence.” (para. 22)The Court listed the seemingly inordinate amount of time the case had taken to be heard by the appeal court (6 years) as one of the factors that led it to conclude that a conditional sentence was now appropriate. While the Court did not expressly characterize the offender as an addict trafficker, it said:“[The offender] has faithfully abided by the terms and conditions of his release orders and he has not reoffended. This is cogent evidence of his rehabilitation and it leads us to believe that the appellant does not pose a continuing danger to the community.” (para. 21; emphasis added)[33]After submissions were made in this case, the Court of Appeal released its oral judgment in R. v. Lazo 2012 ONCA 389 (CanLII), a case involving an addict trafficker who sold $40 worth of crack cocaine to an undercover officer. While it is clear that the Court of Appeal’s main reason for allowing the appeal was that the sentencing judge had wrongly rejected a joint submission for a conditional sentence for a first offender, I find it noteworthy that Gillese J.A. went on to say for the court:“Moreover, although the sentencing judge acknowledged the appellant’s participation in [an addiction treatment program], in my view it was an error on his part to fail to consider that the appellant met the program’s expectations and successfully completed it. In so doing, the appellant demonstrated a genuine effort and progress toward his rehabilitation….The public interest is served by diverting individuals in the appellant’s situation into drug treatment programs that address the addictions which fuel their criminal activity.” (paras. 7 \u0026 8; emphasis added)[34]Holt was a case about the appropriateness of a suspended sentence for trafficking in heroin. The Court of Appeal decided such a sentence should be imposed extremely rarely. Given the fact that the conditional sentence regime did not exist at the time Holt was decided, and given that a suspended sentence is not be proposed by defence counsel in the case at bar, I do not see how Holt applies here. In light of Greene and Lazo I do not think that Crown counsel’s submission to the effect that Holt continues to reflect the Court of Appeal’s view of how addict traffickers should be dealt with is the law today, at least, as here, where the level of trafficking is not sophisticated or particularly high[10].[35]Crown counsel’s further argument was that Ms Dzienis continued involvement in criminal activity over the past several years militates against a conditional sentence, in that I cannot be “satisfied that the service of the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community” (s. 742.1). I agree that Ms Dzienis presents some risk to reoffend. (Interestingly, so too does Ms Dzienis). But as I read the general case law on conditional sentences, combined with the case law on addict traffickers I have just referred to, I consider that the risk she presents is manageable given her demonstrated motivation and her ongoing co-operation with medical and probation authorities. In this regard there is one other brief quote from Lazo that I have found to be of assistance. Gillese J.A. noted:“[The offender’s] steps towards rehabilitation will be encouraged by a conditional sentence given the likelihood of incarceration in the event of a breach.” (para. 7)[36]In sum, given that the Court of Appeal has now said on several occasions that conditional sentences can serve to address deterrence and denunciation in cases of drug trafficking[11], I am of the view that an appropriately designed conditional sentence can adequately balance deterrence and denunciation, while at the same time acknowledging the progress the offender has made to date and putting in place support and enforcement mechanisms that will hopefully assist in her continuing rehabilitation.[37]I wish to return briefly to R. v. Tahal. As one of the optional conditions of the conditional sentence imposed by the Court of Appeal, the offender was ordered to perform 100 hours of community service (para. 23). Though the report of the case contains no apparent rationale for the imposition of this condition, it seems to me that this is consistent with numerous other trial and appellate decisions where community service is seen to be an opportunity for the offender to pay (or repay) her obligations to the community. In the drug context, defence counsel’s casebook cites the decision of Glithero J. in R. v. Tran [2001] O. J. No. 5764, where, in sentencing “a busy low-level [non crack-using] street trafficker” 100 hours of community service was imposed in the hope of creating a “disincentive for those similarly inclined”. Defence counsel also cites R. v. Richards [2007] O.J. No. 3209, where, without articulating any rationale for so doing Spies J. imposed an order for the performance of 250 hours of community service as part of a conditional sentence. His casebook also cites R. v. Martin [2011] O. J. No. 3013, where, similarly without articulating a rationale, Ratushny J. imposed 240 hours of community service as part of a conditional sentence order. My rationale for imposing community service hours is as a form of “secular penance”, to quote the sentencing scholar Prof. Duff[12].DISPOSITION[38]The offender is sentenced to a conditional sentence of 18 months, the first 6 months of which are to be served subject to the electronic monitoring program.[39]For the first 12 months of this conditional sentence order, the offender is to remain confined at her own residence (house arrest) except for the purposes of school attendance, employment, medical appointments, religious services, and legal obligations regarding compliance with this conditional sentence order.The offender shall provide the supervisor with proof of her schedule of school/work hours, medical appointments and religious services.The supervisor will incorporate these into a written letter of permission to be out of the residence and that letter shall be carried by the offender on her person at all times while out of the residence. The offender may obtain from the supervisor written permission to be absent from her residence for any other reason deemed appropriate by the supervisor. Such written permission shall be carried by the offender on her person at all times while out of the residence.[40]In addition to the compulsory conditions contained in any conditional sentence order imposed in this province, the following optional conditions are imposed:1.Abstain from the purchase or consumption of drugs except in accordance with a medical prescription;2.Participate in such rehabilitative counselling as may be directed by your conditional sentence supervisor;3.Sign such releases as may be necessary to authorize your conditional sentence supervisor to communicate with your treating therapist(s);4.Not to associate with any person known to you to have a criminal record (family members excluded);5.During the last six months of the conditional sentence, obey a curfew: be in your place of residence between the hours of 2200 and 0600 unless permission in writing is obtained from the conditional sentence supervisor;6.During the last six months of the conditional sentence, perform 60 hours of community service, at a rate of no less than 10 hours per month, all community service to be completed no later than 15 days prior to the expiry of the conditional sentence.[41]For the purpose of enrolment in the electronic monitoring program she shall report today to the Conditional Sentence Liaison office located at the Adult Probation office in this courthouse, and thereafter as directed. The conditions of the 6-month Electronic Supervision Program (ESP) will be attached to the Conditional Sentence Order as Appendix A. In addition to the compulsory conditions contained in any order of electronic monitoring, the following optional conditions are imposed:1.The offender will answer the phone at any time during house arrest;2.The offender will present herself to Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services staff, police services and/or persons who are authorized by Minister of Community Safety and Correctional Services staff associated with the Electronic Supervision Program at the door of your residence at any time during the period of house arrest for the purpose of confirming her presence and compliance.[42]Upon the expiry of the conditional sentence, the offender is placed on probation for a period of two years. In addition to the compulsory conditions common to all probation orders, the following further optional conditions are imposed:1.Abstain from the purchase or consumption of drugs except in accordance with a medical prescription;2.Participate in such rehabilitative counselling as may be directed by your probation officer;3.Sign such releases as may be necessary to authorize your probation officer to communicate with your treating therapist(s);4.Not to associate with any person known to you to have a criminal record (family members excluded);5.Report as directed to your probation officer;6.Reside at premises known to and approved of by your probation officer;7.Perform 180 hours of community service, at a rate of no less than 10 hours per month, all community service to be completed no later than 17 ½ months from the commencement of the period of probation.[43]It is directed that this conditional sentence order and probation order shall be transferred to Kitchener, Ontario.Released:July 9, 2012Signed: “Justice D.P. Cole”[1] I say this because while not expressly contained in the Agreed Statement of Facts, counsel were in agreement that the accused told Dukes that she had been able to reduce her usage to “ a 60 piece per week” (less than ½ gm.).[2] The PSR does not specify the drug(s) of choice being used by the offender at the time. It appears not to have been crack cocaine.[3] Though the offender conceded that her drug abuse went back to her teenage years, she appears to have no youth record.[4] The PSR notes that she has been Dr. Kugler’s patient at least since 2008. In addition to her addictions issues, Dr. Kugler has diagnosed her as suffering from “a bi-polar disorder”, for which he has been treating her with various medications.[5] The lab reports submitted to supplement Dr. Kugler’s letter (Exhibit 2) suggest that over the same time period, she did not test positive for any other common illegal drugs.[6] Crown counsel cited R. v. Radassao 1994 CanLII 779 (ON CA), [1994] O. J. No. 1990 where the Ontario Court of Appeal declined to interfere with a 12-month sentence imposed on a 33 year-old first offender convicted of trafficking ½ ounce of cocaine for $750. I would distinguish that case on two bases. First, unlike Ms Dzienis the accused in that case did not enter a plea of guilty. Second, that case was decided before the conditional sentence regime came into effect.[7] Perhaps because the decision arose from an “in writing” appeal (meaning that there was no oral argument) the case is not available on the Court of Appeal website, nor on other databases.[8] The appellate judgment does not indicate what length of imprisonment was being sought by either trial or appellate Crown.[9] As in the case at bar, Ms Preston’s efforts at rehabilitation had commenced prior to the offence dates for which she was sentenced.[10] I have in mind here cases such as the decision of the Court of Appeal in R. v. Speziale [2011] O.J. No. 3957, and the recent decision of my colleague Green J. in R. v. Reis [2012] O. J. No. 2623, as examples where courts have declined to impose conditional sentences despite some quite considerable rehabilitative efforts on the part of the offenders, because the offending behaviours were simply at too high a level to be addressed by conditional sentences.[11] In his casebook defence counsel cites the Ontario Court of Appeal decisions in R. v. Kerr 2001 CanLII 21142 (ON CA), [2001] O.J. No. 5085; R. v. Morrison [1999] O.J. No. 2655; R. v. Ploumis 2000 CanLII 17033 (ON CA), [2000] O. J. No. 4731; R. v. Veljkovic [2000] O. J. No. 1327; R. v. Hayes [2001] O. J. No. 684.[12] That appears to have been what the Judge who sentenced Ms Preston had in mind when he ordered (at 68) that she perform 50 hours of community service."}

C-46; and (2) unlawful possession of a controlled substance (cocaine) for the purpose of trafficking contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, chap. 19.Both offences were committed on August 14, 2011, in the City of Toronto.[2]In the early morning hours of August 14, 2011, the accused was found in unlawful possession of a fully loaded firearm, a box of ammunition, significant quantities of cocaine, marihuana and cash, and two cell phones.It was just after 3:00 in the morning, and the accused had wandered into the backyard of a townhouse residence that the police had under investigation in connection with an earlier 911 emergency call.The police found the loaded handgun in the accused’s waist band, and the drugs and ammunition in his pants pockets.[3]At the time of the offences the accused was 22 years old, and had no prior criminal record.While he is now 24 years old, he is still a youthful first offender.He spent some 6½ months in pre-trial custody prior to his release on bail, and then spent another 13 months on relatively strict judicial interim release conditions.[4]The Crown seeks the imposition of a penitentiary sentence of approximately 4 to 4½ years duration.Defence counsel argues, on the other hand, that an appropriate sentence would be a reformatory term in the range of 22 months imprisonment.Defence counsel argues that the offences committed by the accused justify a sentence of approximately 3 years imprisonment, but once the appropriate credit is given in relation to the pre-sentence restrictions on the accused’s liberty, a reformatory sentence should result.Defence counsel notes that, if such a custodial sentence were imposed, it could be productively combined with a term of probation.B.The Facts of the Offences[5]In the early morning hours of August 14, 2011, two police officers with the Toronto Police Service were dispatched to investigate a 911 emergency call connected to a townhouse unit in a Toronto Housing Authority complex on Grandravine Drive.When they arrived, no one answered the door.As they waited nearby for the arrival of a security guard to let them into the premises so they could continue their investigation, the accused arrived on the scene on foot.From their nearby location, the officers watched as the accused walked into the fenced back yard of the townhouse unit under investigation.He was talking on a cell phone.When approached by the officers, the accused denied any connection to the townhouse, and explained that he was just waiting for a ride.The accused’s girlfriend arrived in her vehicle almost immediately thereafter.[6]Not satisfied with the explanation proffered by the accused, the officers detained the accused.While they were checking his driver’s license, the accused began to act suspiciously.He was seen tapping his right hip with his right wrist, and “blading” himself to the officers so that his right side was furthest away from them.When his documentation was returned, the accused received it awkwardly by holding his right elbow tightly to his right hip.[7]Reasonably suspecting the accused was carrying a weapon, the police decided, in the interests of their own safety, to conduct a “pat-down” search of the accused for weapons before releasing him.When the accused refused to permit this search and tried to flee, he was quickly taken to the ground by the officers and subdued.The police officers discovered, almost immediately, that the accused was in unlawful possession of a loaded firearm, ammunition and drugs.More particularly, on the person of the accused the police discovered:•A fully loaded .22 calibre “Bersa” model semi-automatic handgun, a restricted firearm, containing 11 rounds of .22 calibre ammunition, with one bullet already in the firing chamber.•1.31 grams of crack cocaine;•7.7 grams of marijuana;•A box of 9 mm. Remington Centerfire cartridges, containing 40 rounds of ammunition;•Canadian currency totaling $275.•Two BlackBerry cell phones.[8]The Crown argued that this physical evidence, viewed in its totality, established that at the time of the offences the accused was engaged in the business of drug trafficking.[9]On the pre-trial application to determine the admissibility of the results of the police search of the accused, Mr. Peterkin offered an alternate explanation for his possession of this collection of items.The accused testified that he had been given all of this contraband earlier in the evening by a man named “Mike.”When the accused had contacted Mike to buy some marihuana, Mike had offered to give him his marihuana purchase for free if the accused would deliver the contraband articles to another individual.The accused agreed and was, in fact, on his way to meet this nameless third party to deliver the contraband when approached by the police.He was going to ask his girlfriend to drive him to the arranged location at the back of a shopping mall.See: R. v. Peterkin, 2013 ONSC 165 (CanLII), at para. 42-45.[10]I do not accept the explanation offered by the accused for his possession of this collection of contraband.Nor does it cause me to have any reasonable doubt as to why he had this contraband in his possession.Indeed, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was, in fact, engaged in the business of drug trafficking on the night of his arrest.He was certainly in possession of all of the “tools of the trade” of a drug trafficker.He was walking through a high crime neighbourhood at 3:00 a.m. in the morning, talking on one of his two cell phones.He had a fully loaded, unlicensed, restricted semi-automatic firearm in the waistband of his pants (not to mention a box of ammunition) for his protection.The accused carried with him two different kinds of illicit drugs, namely, crack cocaine and marihuana, individually packaged, in sufficient quantities for commercial sale.He also had $275 in cash in his pocket.The accused had no explanation for why he had such a significant sum of money.At the time, he was on financial assistance and admitted that he did not usually carry such a large amount of cash.While the accused denied that this $275 was from selling drugs, I find as a fact that selling drugs was precisely how the accused secured this money.[11]Indeed, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the entire story about “Mike” is pure invention on the part of the accused, offered to try to more innocently explain his possession of all of this drug trafficking paraphernalia.In short, I accept that the Crown has established, with the requisite degree of certainty, that at the time of these offences, the accused was, in fact, engaged in the business of drug trafficking.See: R. v. Gardiner (1982), 1982 CanLII 30 (SCC), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 477 (S.C.C.).C.The Personal Circumstances of the Accused[12]Defence counsel did not request the preparation of a Pre-Sentence Report in this case, but rather sought to helpfully provide me with some of the personal circumstances of the accused.The accused was born on September 12, 1988.As I have indicated, he is now 24 years of age.He was 22 years old at the time of the commission of these offences.He is a Canadian citizen with no prior criminal record.He is involved in a long-term romantic relationship with his 22 year old girlfriend, Chereta Palmer.[13]The accused has grown up in the area of Grandravine Drive and Driftwood Avenue in Toronto.His mother and father are both employed, but are separated.The accused does not have much interaction with his father, who is a painter.The accused is the middle child among eight other siblings.[14]The accused has, essentially, a grade 10 education.He quit school in 2009.He tried night school, and passed two of the classes, but school was not a priority for him.He did not appreciate how an education might assist him in the future, and saw little point in pursuing any further education.[15]Since leaving school, the accused has worked periodically doing general labour and maintenance work in his local neighbourhood.He has also worked, for at least a few months, as a painter as part of a job development program in the area. His last job was working for a clothing manufacturer.However, he lost this job while on judicial interim release pending the trial of this matter.He has been unemployed since June of 2012.[16]According to the two “character reference” letters that were filed on the sentencing hearing, the accused has been involved, for a number of years, in youth mentoring programs in this area.Since April of 2012, the accused has been involved, more specifically, in a mentoring program called “Breaking the Cycle,” wherein he talked to other young people about the experience of going through the court system.He has been a successful and valued participant in these programs.The accused has been described by others as “extremely smart and resourceful,” and as “cooperative, polite and respectful.”He has also been described as a “very quiet person” who “enjoys working independently,” who is “determined to move his life forward in a positive manner,” and who is “determined to stay of out trouble” and not “repeat the mistakes of his past.”[17]As to his future, I understand from defence counsel that the accused has a strong interest in music, and the role of computers in music.More specifically, the accused now hopes to secure his high school equivalency, and then perhaps go to college to study electronic music.The accused has, however, to-date, taken no concrete steps toward the pursuit of these stated career objectives.D.The Governing Sentencing Principles[18]According to s. 718 of the Criminal Code, the “fundamental purpose” of sentencing is to contribute to “respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society” by imposing “just sanctions” that have one or more of the following objectives, namely: (a) to denounce unlawful conduct; (b) to deter the offender and others from committing offences; (c) to separate offenders from society where necessary; (d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders; (e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or the community; and (f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and the community.[19]According to s. 718.1 of the Code, the “fundamental principle” of sentencing is that a sentence “must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.”[20]Section 718.2 of the Code also dictates that, in imposing sentence, the court must also take into account a number of principles including the following:•A sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender;•A sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;•Where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;•An offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and,•All available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.E.The Appropriate Sentence (Before Any Credit is Applied)[21]According to s. 95(2)(i) of the Code, the accused is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence, in relation to his offence of unlawful possession of a loaded restricted firearm, of three years imprisonment.The accused has not attacked the constitutional validity of the legislation.Therefore, that is the minimum sentence which the accused must receive.Given that the accused is a youthful first offender, however, and there is still reason for optimism about his prospects for rehabilitation, in my view this mandatory minimum sentence is an appropriate sentence, in all of the circumstances of this case, for the firearms offence.[22]The unlawful possession of loaded firearms in the Toronto region is a very serious problem, and periodically results in tragic consequences.Accordingly, such offences must be met with custodial sentences that are proportional to the sheer gravity of the crime, and which appropriately stress the need to denounce and deter such crimes and adequately protect the public.See: R. v. Danvers (2005), 2005 CanLII 30044 (ON CA), 199 C.C.C. (3d) 490 (Ont.C.A.) at para. 78; R. v. Brown, 2010 ONCA 745 (CanLII), at para. 14; R. v. Chambers, 2012 ONSC 817 (CanLII), at para. 15-17; R. v. Scarlett, 2013 ONSC 562 (CanLII), at para. 13.[23]This firearms offence was not, however, the only offence committed by the accused.He was also found in possession of commercial quantities of cocaine and marihuana and the other typical trappings of the drug trafficking trade.In my view, this changes the complexion of the case and renders the criminal conduct of the accused significantly more serious.Indeed, whether the accused’s drug offence, namely, the unlawful possession of a controlled substance (cocaine) for the purpose of trafficking, is treated as an aggravating circumstance of the firearms offence, or requires the imposition of a separate consecutive sentence, in my view, this offence must increase the effective custodial sentence on the accused by at least a year.The combination of illegal loaded firearms and the sale of illicit drugs is a very dangerous and toxic mix that requires the imposition of serious penitentiary terms of imprisonment.See: R. v. Grant, 2006 CanLII 18347 (ON CA), [2006] O.J. No. 2179 (C.A.) at para. 82; Varied: 2009 SCC 32 (CanLII), [2009] 2 S.C.R. 353; R. v. Brown, [2007] O.J. No. 5338 (S.C.J.) at para. 34-38; R. v. Dass, [2008] O.J. No. 1161 (S.C.J.) at para. 19-33; R v. Manning, [2007] O.J. No. 1205 (S.C.J.) at para. 16; R. v. Williams, [2007] O.J. No. 1354 (S.C.J.) at para. 34; R. v. Duhamel, 2013 ONSC 1340 (CanLII), at para. 39.[24]Accordingly, in my view, before taking into account any credits to which the accused may be entitled by virtue of the various restrictions on his pre-sentence liberty, the proper application of the applicable principles of sentencing, in all of the circumstances of this case, results in a 4 year term of imprisonment for the accused.See: R. v. Velez-Lau, 2011 ONSC 4805 (CanLII); R. v. Harutyunyan, 2012 ONSC 58 (CanLII).[25]This sentence is at the bottom of the range of sentence suggested by the Crown.However, in my view this somewhat more lenient sentence is appropriate in light of the fact that the accused is a youthful, first offender, being but 24 years old and without any prior criminal record.His potential rehabilitation must remain a key consideration in sentencing.That said, the three year sentence suggested by defence counsel, before taking into account any credits for pre-trial restrictions on the accused’s liberty, is well beneath the appropriate range of sentence for a case of this nature.Indeed, such a sentence would not reflect that the accused was convicted of a drug-related offence as well as a firearms offence.The drug offence is a separate, serious offence striking independent legal interests, and must properly be reflected in a significantly increased sentence.See: See: R. v. Houle, 2008 ONCA 287 (CanLII), at para. 4; R. v. Woolcock, [2002] O.J. No. 4927 (C.A.) at para. 8, 15.[26]In reaching the conclusion that four years imprisonment is an appropriate sentence in this case, I have also taken into account that the accused undertook the litigation of this case in a responsible and reasonable manner.While the accused challenged the admissibility of the results of the police search of his person, once the evidence was ruled to be admissible the accused did not waste any court time contesting his guilt in relation to these two offences.At the same time, however, the accused did not profess or show any remorse for the commission of these offences.F.Credit for Pre-Sentence Restrictions on Liberty1.Pre-Sentence Custodya.Introduction[27]The accused was arrested for these offences on August 12, 2011, and was not released from custody on bail until February 27, 2012.Accordingly, the accused served almost exactly 6½ months in custody.He was in the Toronto East Detention Center the entire time.During the course of the sentencing hearing, defence counsel advised me, without any objection by the Crown, that this time in custody was uneventful for the accused.For a period of time the accused worked as a kitchen server on the range.Apparently, the accused engaged in no acts of misconduct while incarcerated.Indeed, he was a model inmate.The issue to be determined is the extent to which the accused should be given enhanced credit for this pre-sentence custody.b.The Legislation[28]According to s. 719(3) of the Code, a court, in determining the sentence to be imposed on a convicted offender, may take into account any time spent in custody by the accused as a result of the offence, but that the credit for such pre-sentence custody must be limited to “one day for each day spent in custody.”However, s. 719(3.1) of the Code provides that where “the circumstances justify it” the credit given for pre-sentence custody may be increased to a maximum of “one and one-half days for each day spent in custody.”These provisions were part of the Truth in Sentencing Act, S.C. 2009, chap. 29, which came into force on February 22, 2010.As the offences in the present case were committed by the accused after that date, the accused may receive up to a maximum of 1.5 days for each day of his 6½ months (199 days) in custody if justified having regard to the circumstances of this case.See: R. v. Clarke, 2013 ONCA 7 (CanLII).c.The Court of Appeal Decision in R. v. Summers[29]In R. v. Summers, 2013 ONCA 147 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal dealt with the important issue of whether a sentencing judge possesses the discretion under s. 719(3.1) of the Criminal Code to give enhanced credit to an accused for pre-sentence custody in order to account for an offender’s loss of remission and parole eligibility while in pre-sentence remand custody.Cronk J.A., delivering the judgment of the unanimous court, recognized the existence of such a discretion.In summarizing her conclusions regarding this issue, Cronk J.A. stated, at para. 8 and 119:As I see it, however, s. 719(3.1) of the Code allows a sentencing judge to credit pre-sentence custody at a ratio up to, but not exceeding, 1.5:1 for each day spent in pre-sentence custody where, on consideration of all relevant circumstances, such credit is necessary to achieve a fair and just sanction in accordance with the statutory scheme for sentencing and punishment set out in the Code.On a proper record, the relevant circumstances that may justify this enhanced credit include ineligibility for remission and parole while in remand custody.* * * * *I conclude where I began.In my view, properly construed, s. 719(3.1) of the Code permits a sentencing judge to credit pre-sentence custody up to a maximum of 1.5:1 for each day spent in pre-sentence custody where, on consideration of all relevant circumstances, such credit is necessary to achieve a fair and just sanction in accordance with the statutory scheme for sentencing and punishment set out in the Code.On a proper record, the relevant circumstances that may justify this enhanced credit include ineligibility for remission and parole while in remand custody.[30]Accordingly, the loss of remission and parole eligibility in remand custody may, indeed, be relevant circumstances justifying enhanced credit for an accused who has spent time in pre-sentence remand custody.More exceptional circumstances are not required for enhanced credit under s. 719(3.1) of the Code.See also: R. v. Carvery, 2012 NSCA 107 (CanLII); R. v. Stonefish, 2012 MBCA 116 (CanLII).[31]In determining that important issue of principle, Cronk J.A. observed, however, at para. 117, that this did not mean that enhanced credit will be available “to every remand offender on the basis of the absence of remission and parole eligibility,” as there must be some evidence or information before the sentencing judge that supports the conclusion that this factor “merits enhanced credit for a particular offender in a given case.”More specifically, at para. 118, Cronk J.A. expressly endorsed and underscored the following comments of Steel J.A. in R. v. Stonefish, at para. 81-83 and 85:Loss of remission and statutory release may be individual circumstances justifying enhanced credit where the accused can bring evidence to the court that, had he or she been a sentenced inmate, they would have most probably received remission and/or statutory release.Just because the circumstance will be applicable to many, if not most, accused does not mean it cannot be a circumstance relevant to an individual accused.A trial judge has discretion to grant or not grant the enhanced credit.For example, an otherwise eligible accused who intentionally delayed proceedings by continuously discharging counsel, or an accused who created delay by not cooperating with probation officers during the preparation of the pre-sentence reports, or an accused who refuses to participate in treatment programs may not receive enhanced credit despite the loss of earned remission or may not receive any credit at all, depending on the discretion of the sentencing judge.All the circumstances should be taken into account.But, on the other hand, if the accused can show that his or her behaviour on remand was such that they would have received remission had they been a sentenced prisoner, that is a factor that a court may take into account when exercising its discretion to award enhanced credit for [pre-sentence custody].* * * * *Based on evidence specific to the particular offender’s behaviour while on remand, the loss of remission is transformed from a universal characteristic into an individual one.[Emphasis added by Cronk J.A.][32]In R. v. Summers, the trial judge had given the accused the enhanced credit of 1.5 days for every day of the 10½ months of pre-sentence custody served by the accused, as a result of his loss of remission and parole eligibility.This is the maximum permissible enhanced credit under s. 719(3.1) of the Code.There was no suggestion that the custodial conditions of the accused were particularly harsh or oppressive.Cronk J.A. concluded, at para. 126, that the trial judge did not err in drawing this conclusion regarding the extent of the enhanced credit due to the accused in the circumstances of the case, and deferred to the ruling of the trial judge on his issue.[33]In reaching this conclusion, Cronk J.A. observed, at para. 123, that providing relevant information in relation to a claim for enhanced credit “need not be an onerous task.”While “formal evidence” of the accused’s “likely prospects for remission or parole eligibility” may be led at the sentencing hearing, information bearing up on these issues – such as the conduct of the accused while detained, any co-operation with the authorities, adherence to prison rules, or any efforts by the accused to advance the trial – may also be provided to the trial judge through the sentencing submissions of counsel, or the agreement of the parties.d.Conclusion[34]In my view, the decision of the Court of Appeal in R. v. Summers is indistinguishable from, and directly applicable to, the circumstances of the present case.As a youthful, first offender who, according to the uncontested submissions of counsel, conducted himself “flawlessly” while in custody, would have been an excellent candidate for early release due to earned remission or parole eligibility.Accordingly, while there was no suggestion that his time in pre-sentence remand detention was unusually harsh or oppressive, in my view R. v. Summers dictates that the accused be given credit of 1.5 days for every day spent in the Toronto East Detention Center.[35]As the accused spent 199 days in pre-trial custody, based upon my calculations, and giving him the maximum enhanced credit possible under s. 719(3.1) of the Code, the accused is entitled to credit for 298.5 days – nearly 10 months.2.Stringent Conditions of Judicial Interim Release (House Arrest)a.Introduction[36]On February 27, 2012 the accused was released on bail on a recognizance the total amount of $8,500, with three named sureties, and on essentially the following conditions:•Attend court as required;•Reside with his mother (one of the three sureties);•Not to be outside this residence except in the company of one of the three sureties, or while employed at a particular clothing store;•Abstain from the purchase, possession or consumption of non-medically prescribed drugs; and•Refrain from the possession of any firearm, cross-bow, weapon, ammunition, or explosive substance.[37]The accused has now been on this judicial interim release order for approximately 13½ months.Defence counsel contends that these bail conditions were especially restrictive.More particularly, defence counsel argued that the “house arrest” condition, which only permitted the accused to be outside his residence while in the company of a surety or “while employed” at a particular clothing store, ultimately caused the accused to lose his job in June of 2012.Since that time, the accused has remained unemployed.Defence counsel argued that the accused should be credited with approximately one-third of this time, or approximately 4½ months.b.The Court of Appeal Decision in R. v. Downes[38]In R. v. Downes (2006), 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA), 79 O.R. (3d) 321, the Court of Appeal for Ontario held that, where an accused is the subject of “stringent pre-trial bail conditions” including time spent effectively under “house arrest,” this mitigating circumstance must be taken into account and given some weight in the sentencing of the accused.More specifically, Rosenberg J.A., delivering the judgment of the Court, held that, in the circumstances, in relation to the 18 months the accused was on bail and subject to a condition of “house arrest” that required him to remain in his residence “except in the company of his surety,” the accused was entitled to 5 months credit.In summarizing the proper approach to the consideration of this issue, Rosenberg J.A. stated, at para: 37:In summary, credit for pre-trial bail conditions should be approached in the following manner:•Time spent on stringent pre-sentence bail conditions, especially house arrest, is a relevant mitigating factor.•As such, the trial judge must consider the time spent on bail under house arrest in determining the length of sentence.•The failure of the trial judge to explain why time spent on bail under house arrest has not been taken into account is an error in principle.•The amount of credit to be given for time spent on bail under house arrest is within the discretion of the trial judge and there is no formula that the judge is required to apply.•The amount of credit will depend upon a number of factors including, the length of time spent on bail under house arrest; the stringency of the conditions; the impact on the offender’s liberty; the ability of the offender to carry on normal relationships, employment and activity.•Where the offender asks the trial judge to take pre-sentence bail conditions into account, the offender should supply the judge with information as to the impact of the conditions.If there is a dispute as to the impact of the conditions, the onus is on the offender to establish those facts on a balance of probabilities in accordance with s. 724(3) of the Criminal Code.c.Conclusion[39]The present case is, in some ways, similar to the R. v. Downes case.Both individuals were subject to a “house arrest” condition that required them to remain within their residence except when in the presence of their surety.[40]The “house arrest” condition controlling the whereabouts of the accused in the present case, however, is somewhat less restrictive, in that the accused was permitted to be outside the residence: (1) if he was in the company of any one of three separate sureties; or (2) if he was employed at a particular clothing store where he worked.[41]Further, while the accused lost his employment at the clothing store where he had been working, it is difficult to imagine there having been any difficulty in varying that specific condition to permit the accused to pursue other employment opportunities, if the accused had sought such a variation.Instead, the accused has simply remained at home and unemployed since June of 2012.He made no attempt to vary the terms of his bail order.In these circumstances, I can only conclude that, like the accused in R. v. Downes, the accused in this case possesses a “weak work ethic.”[42]In addition, like the accused in R. v. Downes, in the present case there is little information as to how the accused spent his time while under house arrest on judicial interim release.There are few concrete details as to the actual impact that the “house arrest” condition had on the accused on a daily basis.[43]In all of the circumstances of this case, in my view it is fair to credit the accused with 3 months for the conditions of his judicial interim release.3.Conclusion Regarding Credits[44]I have concluded that pursuant to s. 719(3.1) of the Code and the decision in R. v. Summers, the accused is entitled to credit for nearly 10 months imprisonment for the 6½ months he spent in pre-sentence custody in the Toronto East Detention Center.I have also concluded that pursuant to the decision in R. v. Downes, the accused is entitled to credit for an additional 3 months imprisonment for the 13½ months the accused has spent under the conditions of his judicial interim release order, including his house arrest condition.Adding these two credits together results in a total credit of 13 months imprisonment.The sentence that otherwise would have been imposed upon the accused will be reduced by this total credit.G.The Sentence Imposed Upon the Accused[45]I have concluded that, having regard to all of the circumstances of the present case, a fit sentence in this case, would be four years (or 48 months) imprisonment.I have also concluded that in light of the various pre-sentence restrictions imposed upon the liberty of the accused, he should receive a credit of some 13 months toward that sentence.According to my calculations, once the accused is given that credit, the sentence that he should now receive totals 35 months imprisonment.I now hereby sentence the accused to 35 months imprisonment on both counts (concurrent).H.Ancillary Sentencing Orders[46]In addition, in my view all of the following ancillary sentencing orders are appropriate in the circumstances of this case:•Pursuant to s. 491(1) of the Criminal Code, I order that the firearm and ammunition that has been seized and detained in this case be forfeited to Her Majesty in right of Ontario and thereafter disposed of as directed by the Attorney General.•Pursuant to s. 16(1)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, I order that the drugs seized and detained in this case be forfeited to Her Majesty in right of Canada and thereafter disposed of as directed by the Minister of Health.•Pursuant to s. 462.37 of the Criminal Code, I order that the proceeds of crime, the $275 in cash be forfeited to her Majesty in right of Canada to be disposed of as directed by the Attorney General or otherwise dealt with according to the law.•Pursuant to s. 490.1(b) of the Criminal Code and s. 16(1)(b)((ii) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act the two cell phones that have been seized and detained in this case be forfeited to Her Majesty in right of Canada as “offence-related property” and disposed of by the member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada that may be designated for the purpose of this paragraph in accordance with the law.•Pursuant to ss. 109(1)(b) and 109(2) of the Criminal Code, I order that the accused be prohibited: (1) from the possession of any prohibited firearm, restricted firearm, prohibited weapon, prohibited device, and prohibited ammunition for life: and (2) from the possession of any firearm (other than a restricted or prohibited firearm), cross-bow, restricted weapon, ammunition, and explosive substance for a period of ten years after the date the accused is released from the term of imprisonment for these offences.•As the accused has been found guilty of a “secondary designated offence,” namely, possession of cocaine for the purposes of trafficking, pursuant to s. 487.051(3) of the Criminal Code, I order the taking of bodily substances from the accused for forensic DNA Analysis.I.Conclusion[47]In the result, the accused is sentenced to a total of 35 months imprisonment on each count (concurrent).I will endorse the indictment and the warrant of committal accordingly.The accused is also subject to all of the ancillary sentencing orders that I have issued.___________________________Kenneth L.

[orally]: The respondent, David Steven Enden, was sentenced to a total of eight months’ imprisonment as a result of having been convicted as follows: (i) of trafficking in hashish oil contrary to s. 4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act; (ii) of possession of cannabis marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to s. 4(2) of that Act; and (iii) of unlawfully having in his possession a restricted drug, psilocybin, contrary to s. 4(1) of the Food and Drug Act. He was sentenced to eight months’ on the first charge, four months’ concurrent on the second, and two months’ concurrent on the third.[2]The Crown appealed on the following grounds:1. that the sentence is not a fit sentence having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including but not limited, to the quantity and packaging of the marijuana, the continuing nature of the offences, and the criminal record of the accused.2. that the justice of the Court of Queen’s Bench who imposed the sentence erred in principle in failing to give appropriate consideration to the elements of deterrence and protection of the public in sentencing for this type of offence and in placing too much emphasis on the reformation and rehabilitation of the accused.[3]On the 4th of February, 1987, the respondent sold an undercover police officer fourteen one gram vials of cannabis resin (hash oil) for $325.00 and seven grams of marijuana for an additional $35.00. On March 3, 1987, his place of residence was searched and, the police found nine bags of marijuana, weighing a total of 91.6 grams; fifteen-one gram vials of hash oil; and three bags, weighing a total of 44.2 grams, of psilocybin (magic mushrooms). In addition, certain drug related paraphernalia was seized.[4]The accused is 27 years of age and has a lengthy criminal record.[5]We are of the unanimous opinion that the appeal must be allowed. The determining factor in all of the cases in this kind must be general deterrence. Given the circumstances of this case, including the number of convictions and the record of the respondent, we are of the view that an appropriate sentence would have been 14 months on each charge to be served concurrently.[6]Accordingly there will be an order that the sentence below be set aside and that in its place there be substituted a sentence of 14 months’ imprisonment on each charge, to be served concurrently.Appeal allowed."}

D.G.H. (1990), 1990 CanLII 7744 (SK CA), 88 Sask.R. 115 and R. v. W.J.V. (1991), 1991 CanLII 7939 (SK CA), 90 Sask.R. 110, this Court approved of sentences of five years' imprisonment in somewhat similar circumstances.This approach is consistent with authorities in other Western jurisdictions:see R. v. Robinson, Alta.C.A., February 11, 1994; R. v. White, B.C.C.A., November 30, 1994; R. v. D. (C.) (1991), 75 Man.R. (2d) 14 (C.A.) and R. v. McDonald, B.C.C.A., July 12, 1993.After taking into account the gravity of the offence, the relationship of the respondent to the complainant and the extreme exploitation of the complainant over a lengthy period, we conclude that the sentence under review is inadequate.We recognize the hardship of a jail sentence on any person but this consideration and others are offset by the aggravating factors that exist in this case.The respondent was a trusted uncle who should have provided guidance and support for his niece who came to Canada to attend school.He breached this trust and engaged in a pattern of coercive sexual abuse over a lengthy period.Furthermore, he showed little or no remorse for her plight.In the circumstances we allow the Crown appeal and substitute a term of five years imprisonment in place of the sentence imposed by the trial judge.The s.100 order is affirmed.DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 19th day of June, A.D. 1995.TALLIS J.A.I concurGERWING J.A.I concurLANE J.A."}

C-46.REASONS FOR JUDGMENTdymond, J.:INTRODUCTION[1]Mr. Todd Joseph Boland (“Mr. Boland”) entered pleas of guilty to a number of offences on April 3, 2009.These offences are set out on two separate indictments.[2]In relation to the first indictment, Mr. Boland plead guilty to a break and enter into a property located at Freshwater Road, which was committed on or about August 5, 2007.Items stolen included a laptop computer, DVD/VCR, graduation ring, daughter’s pride ring, silver ring, MP3 player, and CDs all valued at over $1,000.Access was gained through a ground floor window.DNA evidence left at the scene matched the DNA profile of Mr. Boland.[3]On April 3, 2009, Mr. Boland also plead guilty to a further set of offences in an indictment dated May 20, 2008, which were allegedly committed on August 14, 2007, at a property on Monkstown Road, where a female occupant heard a noise in her house late at night.Upon investigation a male person, later identified as Mr. Todd Boland, was found in her home.The accused, upon seeing the victim, said, “Hi” and fled the home by escaping through an open window.The female occupant of the home called the police and then awoke her parents who were asleep in the home at the same time.The police responded on the basis of the information provided by the female victim.A stakeout was made of the residence of Mr. Boland.Police were aware of a similar MO used by Mr. Boland in earlier break and enter cases.Mr. Boland, at the time of this offence, was under a curfew to remain in his residence between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. daily.While the police were doing surveillance of the Boland property, Mr. Boland approached his home and the police attempted to apprehend him.A scuffle ensued, Mr. Boland fled, but with the help of a tracking dog he was later found a few blocks away hidden in a bathroom of another premise where he had fled to hide.Mr. Boland was arrested and detained.[4]The police had the occupant of the house on Freshwater Road later take part in a police photo ID exercise whereby Mr. Boland was ID’d as the person in the house on the night of the break and enter.[5]The items attempted to be taken from the Freshwater Road property were a laptop computer, a printer, two watches and some coins, including several foreign coins.Coins were later found by the police outside the residence near a pair of sneakers.[6]When Mr. Boland was apprehended he had no footwear on, only socks.The occupant of the Freshwater Road property, when she came face-to-face with a person that had entered the property, observed the accused as only having socks on when he was observed inside the house.The occupant described the person as a male, fairly tall, slight build, with a buzzed haircut and wearing a blue/gray shirt, dark pants, and wool socks with a bit of red on them.He was also described as carrying a red duffle bag.Some of the items, including frozen food, were taken out of the freezer along with a bottle of rum and some hair products.The watches and coins were valued over $1,000.Most of the items were recovered by the police.[7]At the time of the arrest, Mr. Boland was bound by an undertaking dated February 19, 2007, with a curfew clause as part of its Court order.Mr. Boland was also subject to a probation order dated February 4, 2005.The order did not expire until February of 2008.The occupant of the Monkstown Road property did not know Mr. Boland and he had no reason to be inside the residence on the night of the home invasion.[8]As a result of the events of August 14, 2007, Mr. Boland had several charges laid against him under the Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, which included Count No. 1, break and enter; Count No. 2, being at large on an undertaking contrary to section 145(3)(a); Count No. 5, breach of probation for failing to keep the peace and be of good behaviour contrary to section 733.1(1)(a); and Count No. 7, resisting arrest of a police officer engaged in the execution of his duty contrary to section 129(a).The accused plead guilty to the above charges and the Crown withdrew charges of possession of stolen goods, contrary to section 354(1)(a), and two counts of breach of undertaking contrary to section 145(3)(a).antecedence of the accused[9]Mr. Boland is now 36 years of age and is unemployed.His Pre-sentence Report reveals that he has no present relationship with any of his 13 brothers and sisters.Both of his parents are deceased.He claims to have finished his grade eleven but left school before graduating.He spent most of his early years in foster homes to age seven.He spent ten years at Mount Cashel Orphanage and was compensated for allegations of physical, emotional and sexual abuse.[10]At age 18 he was placed in semi-independent living and then continued to rent apartments and bed sitting rooms with the help of Department of Health and Community Services.Mr. Boland has not held any fulltime jobs but has supported himself through a life of criminal behaviour, commencing in his youth.This lifestyle has continued.Between the age of 20 and 27 Mr. Boland experimented with drugs resulting in an addiction to cocaine and prescription drugs.He has had some counseling over the last few years, while incarcerated for various crimes.[11]Mr. Boland’s history of breaches of various criminal offences extends back to the mid to late 1980’s.There are some 38 breaches of court orders in his record.There have been numerous previous convictions for break and enter.The latest sentence, of Justice Goulding of the Newfoundland and Labrador Supreme Court, Trial Division, dated February 4, 2005, sentenced Mr. Boland a totality of 47 months on five separate offences.In that particular case, Mr. Boland was given 23 months credit for the time served on the two-for-one basis in pretrial custody.This resulted in a two years less a day sentence and he was placed on a three-year probation order.[12]Mr. Boland was under a curfew at the time of the commission the offences now before the Court.He was supposed to be in his residence between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. daily.His most current probation order expired on June 2, 2009.[13]Mr. Boland has served two federal terms; the first 26-month sentence was between 1995 and 1997 and the second 36-month sentence was between 1999 and 2002.His last period of incarceration referred to above was two-years-less-a-day from 2005 to 2006.He has also had four parole violations during these federal periods of parole.Mr. Boland’s extensive history also includes community supervision.Prior to January 2009 he resided in a common-law relationship for a period of time and was attempting to “stay clean”.However, upon his last arrest his common-law spouse left the relationship.Mr. Boland claims he does not believe he needs counseling for drugs but would be willing to abide by any order made by the Court to so attend.As to victim impact, Mr. Boland’s insight into the effects of his criminal activity on homeowners and victims generally has not seemed to register with him, at least not until just recently.[14]The Pre-sentence Report claims he is a poor candidate for community service.Prior to these incidents presently before the Court, Mr. Boland claims to be doing some self-employment with soapstone carvings, selling to a local dealer.He also claims to be involved in returning stolen property to the R.N.C. of crimes that have taken place within his community.The probation officer who prepared the report was unable to confirm through the R.N.C. these dealings with Mr. Boland.However, Mr. Boland was not asked the name of the officer with whom he was dealing.[15]Mr. Boland accepts responsibility for his crimes.mitigating factors[16]Mitigating factors in this case are the guilty pleas, the fact that there were no weapons used in the break and enters, and that there was no violence towards any of the victims involved in these break and enters.[17]Mr. Boland took the stand at his sentencing hearing and explained to the Court that he is now more aware of the impact his crimes are having on his victims.He claims that over the last year to year and a half his counseling sessions have given him greater insight into why he has had a life of crime.He understands that when Mount Cashel Orphanage was actually torn down he felt displaced and not ready to enter society.Crime was the result of the anger he felt towards the lot in life he was dealt after being put in foster care and later an orphanage.He now feels he is ready to deal with his alcohol and drug dependency.He claims he has better insight into why he has lead a life of crime.Over the past year or two he has made attempts to deal with these issues.I wish Mr. Boland success in his attempts at rehabilitation.Rehabilitation is always a factor in sentencing.Rehabilitation is one of the principles of sentencing outlined in section 718 of the Criminal Code.I have also reviewed sections 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code, as they relate to the principles applicable in sentencing hearings.[18]However, in cases like Mr. Boland’s where there is a long history of crime, rehabilitation, while important, is less important than general deterrence.While general deterrence is important, even more important is the protection of the public.The protection of the public from Mr. Boland committing further crimes is the overriding sentencing principle based on the facts and circumstances surrounding the case before the Court.position of the crown and the defence[19]The Crown takes the position that nothing less than federal time would be appropriate for Mr. Boland, with his long history of criminal activity.The Crown asks the Court to consider a sentence in the range of four and a half years after deducting time for pre-trial custody.[20]The Crown points out that there is a history of approximately 20 previous break and enter offences and attempts at trespass, 33 breaches of Court orders and 10 property related offences.These previous convictions are aggravating factors.Another aggravating factor is the fact that these break and enters were into residences where occupants could be in the home at the time of the invasions.This factor did not deter Mr. Boland and, in fact, on the stand he admitted that he really did not care if someone happened to be home.[21]The Defence agrees that a period of imprisonment is appropriate but is requesting provincial time of two years less a day, so Mr. Boland can continue his counseling relationship with the psychologist he is presently seeing.Mr. Boland claims this counselor is giving him insight into his problems.computation for time served[22]The Defence called as a witness at the sentencing hearing a Mrs. Heather Yetman who has 25 years experience with the Justice Department.She spent seven years as a classification officer and now is supervisor of classifications.Mrs. Yetman gave evidence that Mr. Boland has been classified as a remand prisoner since he was incarcerated for these offences on January 2, 2009.The Crown argues that although Mr. Boland has been on remand since January 2, 2009, he is unable to claim a two-for-one, as requested by the Defence, for the period from January 12, 2009, up to and including April 1, 2009, because he was serving a sentence as a result of a plea of guilty on January 12, 2009, for four breaches of Court orders.The Crown argues that because this sentence ran to April 1, 2009,based on the wording of section 719(3) of the Criminal Code of Canada Mr. Boland is not entitled to two-for-one for that period, as he was serving a sentence.Although it is correct to say that he was serving a sentence during this period, he was also considered a remand prisoner by prison authorities.[23]The Defence argues that although he was serving a sentence, Her Majesty’s Penitentiary (“HMP”) has still classified Mr. Boland as being what is referred to as “dual status inmate”.Mrs. Yetman explained that anyone awaiting a trial for which they are in custody is automatically deemed to be a remand prisoner.As a remand prisoner, Mr. Boland was required to be escorted anywhere he had to go either inside or outside of HMP for any appointments.[24]Due to staffing shortages, Mrs. Yetman gave evidence that there were times Mr. Boland, would not get escorted at HMP although he should have been escorted at all times, due to his being a remand inmate.[25]Mr. Boland could attend a gym, if he wished to, but only with other remand prisoners.It is interesting to note that other remand prisoners now constitute about 50% of the prisoner population at HMP located at St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador.This is certainly a staggering number.[26]After taking into consideration the arguments of the Crown and the Defence, I am considering the time Mr. Boland has been in custody as dual status classification, while serving a sentence for breach of Court orders on January 12, 2009.He was able to gain some remission time while serving these sentences.However, he was also on remand and, as such, he is not entitled to any time towards parole eligibility for time served before a sentence of these offences.This is approximately 164 days up to and including today’s date.[27]Because of his duel status, I am not willing to award Mr. Boland two-for-one, but I would give him one half of his time served on top of time served, or one and a half for each day served between January 12, 2009, and April 1, 2009, 117 days.This will be deducted from any sentencing imposed by the Court on today’s date.He will also get two-for-one for the time between January 2 to January 12, 2009, and April 1 to June 15, 2009, inclusive.This amounts to 152 days (76 x 2) for a total of 270 days rounded (117 + 152).This amounts to nine months.analysis and review of case law[28]Based on everything that has been put forward through Mr. Boland’s Pre-sentence Report, his own testimony, the submissions of counsel for the Crown and the Defence, a review of Mr. Boland’s record, the evidence at the sentencing hearing, I agree Mr. Boland is at a high risk to reoffend.[29]In reaching this conclusion, I have taken into consideration the following facts.Mr. Boland committed break and enters in November 8, 2002, November 23, 2002, December 4, 2002, and January 3, 2003; that he was in custody in 2004 awaiting trial; that he was sentenced in 2005 and 2006; and that less than 18 months after he was released on a three-year probation order he again committed a break and enter in 2007.This does not bode well for him not continuing as he has.[30]Mr. Boland claims he has changed and counseling has helped him.I encourage this counseling wherever he can get it.However, actions speak louder than words.Mr. Boland now has to take control of his own life and in those actions do exactly what he claims he is able to do as a result of counseling, which is to give up a life of crime.[31]A very lengthy sentence will not help his rehabilitative efforts, but the protection of the public has to be considered.[32]The Pre-sentence Report indicates Mr. Boland is not a good candidate for probation or other community supervision.As noted earlier, with a lengthy record with breaches of Court orders, I am satisfied they may be correct.[33]Yet, the sentence should not be so crushing as to prevent Mr. Boland from moving forward.The last sentence for break and enter by the Supreme Court was 16 months for two break and enters to be served consecutively.A further two sentences of 16 months ran concurrent to those.I have considered that sentence in relation to the sentence I am about to impose.I have also considered the cases of R. v. Dunn, 2008 NLTD 186 (CanLII); R. v. Ryan, 2006 NLTD 167 (CanLII);R. v. Jesso, 2008 NLCA 30 (CanLII); and R. v. Blackwell, 2007 BCSC 1762 (CanLII).[34]In the Dunn matter, Mr. Dunn had 19 break and enter convictions, many dishonesty related offences, and some 28 convictions for breaches of Court orders.Mr. Dunn spent considerable time in prison, including two sentences of federal time.The Court convicted Mr. Dunn and sentenced him to a period of two years plus 101 days with a reduction of two-to-one, resulting in a two-year sentence.[35]I have also considered the case of R. v. Mould, [1987] B.C.J. No 1518 (C.A.).final disposition[36]The following sentence will be imposed upon Mr. Boland:1)For the break and enter into property on Freshwater Road, 22 months;2)For the break and enter into property on Monkstown Road, 22 months, to be consecutive to Count No. 1;3)For a breach of being at large on an undertaking, contrary to section 145(3) of the Criminal Code of Canada, three months, concurrent to Counts No. 1 and No. 2;4)As to Count No. 5, failing to keep the peace and good behaviour, six months.Court orders have to be complied with and Mr. Boland refuses to comply with Court orders.This sentence will be consecutive to Counts No. 1 and No. 2;5)For resisting arrest, two months, concurrent to Counts No. 1, No. 2, and No. 5;6)In deciding on consecutive and concurrent sentences, I am also taking into account the fact that the consecutive sentence offences were separate in time and place.I have also considered the principles of totality in sentencing.[37]In total, the sentence will be 50 months incarceration.From that sentence I am deducting nine months for time served, for a total time to be served of 41 months.further orders[38]Further, I order Mr. Boland stay away from and have no contact in any way either directly or indirectly with Stephanie Walsh, Gina Fleming and Terry Loder while on parole for these offences.[39]If there is no DNA profile presently in place for Mr. Todd Joseph Boland at the DNA Registry, I also order Mr. Boland to provide samples of bodily substances reasonably necessary for DNA analysis in accordance with the provisions of section 487.051(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.[40]There will be no Victim Fine Surcharge as Mr. Boland is not in a position to pay such a fine.[41]Mr. Boland, I would encourage you to seek counseling for any addictions you need help with and I would also encourage you to seek programs to enhance your skill sets, for when you are released back into the community.Today, without some education or trade skills, it will be difficult for you to break away from the cycle of crime and get a full-time job.I sincerely hope you will be successful in this endeavour._____________________________wayne g. dymondJustice"}

Smith, for the Appellant)Appellant))))HEARD:April 30, 2004Power J.REASONS FOR DECISION ON APPEALINTRODUCTION[1]This is an appeal by G.G. (born [...], 1985) against a sentence imposed on him on November 18 th 2003 by Her Honour Judge Beaman of the Ontario Court of Justice in Ottawa pursuant to the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c.1.[2]The Appellant was charged with a breach of probation i.e., that he, on or about July 22 and 23, 2002, failed to report to a youth worker contrary to the court order of Judge J.P. Michel of the Ontario Court of Justice, Youth Division of April 9, 2001.On October 13, 2003, the Appellant plead guilty to this charge, and a second charge for failure to reside was withdrawn.On November 18, 2003, the Appellant was sentenced to open custody for six months and three months of community supervision, totaling nine months of custody, along with 12 months of probation.[3]This appeal involves a consideration of the relevant principles and factors for sentencing under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, (hereinafter, “YCJA”).In my opinion, the trial judge properly considered and applied these principles and factors; her reasons were sufficient in accordance with the provisions of the YCJA and with recent jurisprudence.As such, the appeal should be dismissed and the trial judge’s sentence should be upheld.BACKGROUNDThe Facts[4]The Appellant failed to report to his probation officer on two scheduled reporting dates, July 22 and 23, 2002.The Appellant’s mother informed the probation officer that the Appellant had also failed to return to his residence on July 23, 2002.Subsequently, the Appellant was charged for unlawfully and willfully failing or refusing to comply with the probation order of April 9, 2001, by failing to report as required by s.26 of the Young Offenders Act, R.S.C. 1985 c.Y-1 (hereinafter “YOA”).[5]In his submissions for sentencing, counsel for the Appellant suggested that an appropriate sentence would be 100-150 hours of community service, arguing that custodial sentences should be reserved for serious violent offences and that the trial judge was required to exhaust all non-custodial possibilities before imposing custody.Mr. Smith also argues that Judge Beaman imposed the sentence as a substitute for appropriate child protection, mental health, or other social measures.The Crown argued that failure to report is an essential breach of probation not to be taken lightly and that community service would be inappropriate, given the Appellant’s failure to complete a previous community service order.The Crown submitted that 6 months of open custody would be an appropriate sentence for the Appellant since he has a number of prior criminal convictions, and since he requires a more restrictive approach than has been taken in the past.[6]According to the pre-sentence report from the probation officer, the Appellant had a history of violent behaviour towards his family.The Appellant was not employed or in school, nor was he seeking treatment for his substance abuse problems or attending his appointments with his psychiatrist.The Appellant has at least three convictions for mischief, two convictions for assault, and several breaches of probation under the YOA.The Appellant had completed only 9 out of 50 hours of previously ordered community service.In response, the Appellant claimed that he continued to see his psychiatrist and that his behaviour was due to the influence of his peers.He also claimed that he suffers from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity and Conduct Disorder, for which he is taking medication and undergoing treatment.Trial Judge’s Reasons for Sentencing[7]The Appellant was sentenced to open custody for six months and three months of community supervision, totaling nine months of custody, along with 12 months of probation.The trial judge offered various reasons to support her sentencing decision:(a)no other non-custodial sentence would be appropriate;(b)community service has not worked in the past, since the Appellant has had several opportunities to be under community supervision and has been unable to comply with the rules, fulfilling only 9 of 50 assigned hours;(c)restitution would not be appropriate since the Appellant was not employed;(d)the Appellant has breached probation on several other occasions;(e)the Appellant has not been able to comply with previous non-custodial sentences;(f)the Appellant has serious substance abuse issues and problems with anger and past reports indicate that he responds very well to supervision and discipline; and(g)the Appellant has been convicted of a violent offence in the past.[8]In her reasons for judgment, the trial judge also referred to previous statements she made during the sentencing submissions: “This is very much related to what I had already said to you.”In my opinion, these statements should be considered as part of her reasons for sentencing.The statements included references to:(a)the Appellant’s inability to take responsibility for his actions by continuing to blame influences around him; and(b)the Appellant’s failure to attend school or remain employed.ISSUES[9]The issues on this appeal are:(1)What is the appropriate standard of review on an appeal of a sentence under the YCJA?(2)Did the trial judge fail to take into consideration the requirements of the YCJA when imposing a custodial sentence, and were her reasons sufficient?[10]Another ground of appeal, that the trial judge imposed an illegal sentence on the Appellant contrary to s. 787 of the Criminal Code R.S.C. 1985 Chap. C-46, was withdrawn by the Appellant.ANALYSISIssue Number 1 - What is the appropriate standard of review on an appeal of a sentence under the YCJA?[11]The standard of review in determining the fitness of a sentence was articulated by Iacobucci J. for the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Shropshire:An appellate court should not be given free reign to modify a sentencing order simply because it feels that a different order ought to have been made.The formulation of a sentencing order is a profoundly subjective process; the trial judge has the advantage of having seen and heard all of the witnesses whereas the appellate court can only base itself upon a written record.A variation in the sentence should only be made if the court of appeal is convinced it is not fit.That is to say, that it has found the sentence to be clearly unreasonable…Unreasonableness in the sentencing process involves the sentencing order falling outside the ‘acceptable range’ of orders.[1][12]Iacobucci J. also found that a deferential standard is consistent with accepted jurisprudential principles:[T]he matter is clearly one of discretion and unless patently wrong, or wrong principles applied, or correct principles applied erroneously, or proper factors ignored or overstressed, an appellate Court should be careful not to interfere with the exercise of that discretion of a trial Judge.[2][13]Furthermore, Iaccobuci adopted the reasoning of Bull J.A. of the British Columbia Court of Appeal that:[A]bsent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit.[3][14]Finally, Lamer C.J. explained the reason behind the deferential standard put forth in Shropshire:[I]n the absence of a full trial, where the offender has pleaded guilty to an offence and the sentencing judge has only enjoyed the benefit of oral and written sentencing submissions (as was the case in both Shropshire and this instance), the argument in favour of deference remains compelling.[4][15]In my opinion the above reflect the appropriate standard of review in this case.Issue Number 2 - Did the trial judge fail to take into consideration the requirements of the YCJA when imposing a custodial sentence, and were her reasons sufficient?[16]In my opinion the sentence issued by the trial judge was appropriate given that she considered the relevant principles and factors under the YCJA.[5]The Relevant Provisions of the YCJA[17]The purpose of the YCJA is to prevent crime and protect the public by addressing the underlying reasons for the offence and trying to reduce the over-incarceration of non-violent young persons through rehabilitation and reintegration.Section 3(1) of the YCJA provides an express declaration of the principles behind the Act.These include: encouraging responsibility and fair and proportionate accountability in keeping with the dependency and reduced maturity of youth, and ensuring that they are subject to meaningful consequences for their offences.[18]The objectives and principles for sentencing can be found in s.38(1) of the YCJA:The purpose of sentencing under section 42 (youth sentences) is to hold a young person accountable for an offence through the imposition of just sanctions that have meaningful consequences for the young person and that promote his or her rehabilitation and reintegration into society, thereby contributing to the long-term protection of the public.Section 38(2) outlines the principles of sentencing which a youth justice court must consider when sentencing a young person.These principles include consistency, proportionality, rehabilitation, reintegration and responsibility.Furthermore, s.38(2)(d) specifies that “all available sanctions other than custody that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all young persons.”In addition to these principles, a youth justice court must take into account the factors enumerated in s.38(3).These factors include the offender’s role in the offence, the harm done to the victim, any reparations made by the offender, time served, prior convictions, and any other aggravating or mitigating circumstances.[19]When imposing a custodial sentence under the YCJA, a youth justice court must also be satisfied that the young person meets one of the four pre-conditions listed in s.39(1):(a)the young person has committed a violent offence;(b)the young person has failed to comply with non-custodial sentences;(c)the young person has committed an indictable offence for which an adult would be liable to imprisonment for a term of more than two years and has a history that indicates a pattern of findings of guilt under this Act or the Young Offenders Act, chapter Y-1 of the Revised Statues of Canada, 1985; or(d)in exceptional cases where the young person has committed an indictable offence, the aggravating circumstances of the offence are such that the imposition of a non-custodial sentence would be inconsistent with the purpose and principles set out in section 38.[20]Even if the young person meets one of these criteria, the youth justice court may not impose a custodial sentence unless all reasonable alternatives to custody raised at the sentencing hearing have been considered and it has been determined that there is no reasonable alternative consistent with the principles of sentencing.In making this determination, s.39(3) requires that the youth justice court consider submissions regarding:(a)the alternatives to custody that are available;(b)the likelihood that the young person will comply with a non-custodial sentence, taking into account his or her compliance with previous non-custodial sentences; and(c)the alternatives to custody that have been used in respect of young persons for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.[21]Lastly, s.39(9) of the YCJA states that where a youth justice court imposes a youth sentence that includes custody, the court must state the reasons why it has determined that a non-custodial sentence is not adequate to achieve the sentencing purposes expressed in s.39(1) of the Act.Application[22]In my opinion the trial judge’s decision and reasons for sentencing are in compliance with all of the above requirements.[23]First, the trial judge considered the principles of sentencing and the related factors as required by the s.38 of the YCJA. She addressed the concepts of responsibility and proportionality by turning her mind to the Appellant’s failure to gain any sense of accountability for his actions, since he consistently made excuses for his problems. The trial judge also considered the principles of rehabilitation and reintegration by referring to the Appellant’s failure to control his anger and his continued lack of respect for authority, his failure to attend school or remain employed, and his failure to seek treatment for his substance abuse problems.In addition, the trial judge considered all reasonable alternatives other than custody when she stated that “no other custodial sentence…would be appropriate.”[24]Second, the trial judge spoke to the appropriate criteria for custodial sentences under s.39 of the YCJA. The trial judge found that the Appellant met more than one of the pre-conditions in s.39(1).He had previously failed to comply with non-custodial sentences and he had previously committed a violent offence.She also considered and dismissed alternatives to custody, by explaining that community service has not worked in the past and that restitution would be inappropriate given that the Appellant was unemployed.In determining whether there were reasonable alternatives in this case, the trial judge clearly contemplated all of the submissions made by the parties.She also found that the Appellant would be unlikely to comply with a non-custodial sentence given his failure to do so in the past.[25]Furthermore, the trial judge’s imposition of a custodial sentence may still be appropriate despite the YCJA’s emphasis on promoting non-custodial sentencing for young persons.According to Gorman P.C. J. in R. v. D.L.C.:The Act encourages judges to impose non-custodial sentences.This may be seen as its most dominating feature and primary purpose.However it does not seek to prohibit the imposition of custodial sentences upon young person.In fact, it explicitly recognizes the reality that such sentences will at times be necessary.[6]Likewise, Ritter J.A. held in R. v. C.D., that if alternatives to incarceration meet rehabilitation goals, but do not promote a sense of responsibility, then they must give way to more restrictive sentences.[7]In this case, the trial judge’s decision to impose a custodial sentence was reasonable given the evidence before her.[26]Therefore I have concluded that the trial judge properly considered all of the requirements of the YCJA with respect to imposing a custodial sentence.[27]Mr. Smith argues that in order for the reasons in this case to be sufficient, the trial judge was required to explicitly mention and provide reasons for her findings on each and every factor or principle listed in the YCJA.Indeed, in the trial judge’s reasons for sentencing, she did not explicitly address each factor.However, it is my view that this is not fatal.On the whole, the effect of her reasons demonstrates that she turned her mind to what was required under the YCJA.[28]The proper approach to determining the sufficiency of a trial judge’s reasons is clearly set out by Binnie J. for the Supreme Court in R. v. Sheppard:[A] trial judge does not err merely because he or she does not give reasons for deciding one way or the other on problematic points.The judge is not required to demonstrate that he or she knows the law and has considered all aspects of the evidence…Failure to do any of these things does not, in itself, permit the court of appeal to set aside the verdict…Trial judges are presumed to know the law with which they work day in and day out.If they state their conclusions in brief compass, and these conclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict should not be overturned merely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects of the case.[8]Although Sheppard dealt with the sufficiency of a trial judge’s reasons for reaching a verdict, the general principles in the above paragraph can also be applied to sentencing decisions, given that trial judges are required to give sufficient reasons to facilitate appellate review for both a finding of guilt and a sentence.[9]In my opinion, the Sheppard test applies notwithstanding the fact that the YCJA is very specific in setting out what a judge should and should not consider when imposing a sentence.CONCLUSION[29]Since I have concluded that the trial judge properly considered all of the relevant principles and factors under the YCJA, I find that it was open to her to opt in favour of a custodial sentence.My decision not to interfere with the sentence imposed is in accordance with the conclusion in R. v. D.H.D.In that case, Blair J.A. of the Ontario Court of Appeal confirmed that without finding an error in principle, an appellate court cannot interfere with the sentence imposed, so long as the trial judge considered the appropriate criteria.[10]DISPOSITION[30]Appeal as to sentence is dismissed.___________________________Power J.Released:October 18, 2004APPENDIX AYouth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002 c.1PreambleWHEREAS members of society share a responsibility to address the developmental challenges and the needs of young persons and to guide them into adulthood;WHEREAS communities, families, parents and others concerned with the development of young persons should, through multi-disciplinary approaches, take reasonable steps to prevent youth crime by addressing its underlying causes, to respond to the needs of young persons, and to provide guidance and support to those at risk of committing crimes;WHEREAS information about youth justice, youth crime and the effectiveness of measures taken to address youth crime should be publicly available;WHEREAS Canada is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and recognizes that young persons have rights and freedoms, including those stated in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Bill of Rights, and have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms;AND WHEREAS Canadian society should have a youth criminal justice system that commands respect, takes into account the interests of victims, fosters responsibility and ensures accountability through meaningful consequences and effective rehabilitation and reintegration, and that reserves its most serious intervention for the most serious crimes and reduces the over-reliance on incarceration for non-violent young persons;Section 3 Declaration of Principle3.(1)The following principles apply in this Act:(a)the youth criminal justice system is intended to(i) prevent crime by addressing the circumstances underlying a young person's offending behaviour,(ii) rehabilitate young persons who commit offences and reintegrate them into society, and(iii) ensure that a young person is subject to meaningful consequences for his or her offencein order to promote the long-term protection of the public;(b)the criminal justice system for young persons must be separate from that of adults and emphasize the following:(i) rehabilitation and reintegration,(ii) fair and proportionate accountability that is consistent with the greater dependency of young persons and their reduced level of maturity,(iii) enhanced procedural protection to ensure that young persons are treated fairly and that their rights, including their right to privacy, are protected,(iv) timely intervention that reinforces the link between the offending behaviour and its consequences, and(v) the promptness and speed with which persons responsible for enforcing this Act must act, given young persons' perception of time;(c)within the limits of fair and proportionate accountability, the measures taken against young persons who commit offences should(i) reinforce respect for societal values,(ii) encourage the repair of harm done to victims and the community,(iii) be meaningful for the individual young person given his or her needs and level of development and, where appropriate, involve the parents, the extended family, the community and social or other agencies in the young person's rehabilitation and reintegration, and(iv) respect gender, ethnic, cultural and linguistic differences and respond to the needs of aboriginal young persons and of young persons with special requirements; and(d)special considerations apply in respect of proceedings against young persons and, in particular,(i) young persons have rights and freedoms in their own right, such as a right to be heard in the course of and to participate in the processes, other than the decision to prosecute, that lead to decisions that affect them, and young persons have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms,(ii) victims should be treated with courtesy, compassion and respect for their dignity and privacy and should suffer the minimum degree of inconvenience as a result of their involvement with the youth criminal justice system,(iii) victims should be provided with information about the proceedings and given an opportunity to participate and be heard, and(iv) parents should be informed of measures or proceedings involving their children and encouraged to support them in addressing their offending behaviour.Section 38 Purpose and Principles of Sentencing38.

C-46).[3]Provincial Court Judge John MacDougall imposed a conditional sentence of two years less a day with conditions, including house arrest, reporting, counselling and abstinence from alcohol.[4]The Crown has applied for leave to appeal, maintaining that the sentence is manifestly inadequate having regard to the nature and circumstances of the offence and insofar as it inadequately reflects the objectives of denunciation and deterrence.[5]The following facts, which were read into the record by the Crown Attorney at the time of sentencing, were not disputed.Mr. MacDonald was represented by counsel at the hearing.[6]On October 8, 2002, Mr. MacDonald had been doing some interior painting at the house where he lived with the victim, his common law wife, Donna Mona Gass.By the time of the assault both had been drinking, but Mr. MacDonald to a much greater extent.In one statement to the police Ms. Gass indicated that the cause of Mr. MacDonald beating her was his perception that she was not appreciating his painting job, notwithstanding that she had told him many times that day that he had done a beautiful job.[7]After an exchange of words between Ms. Gass and Mr. MacDonald in the early evening Mr. MacDonald reacted by forcefully sweeping everything from a cupboard onto the floor.He then commenced throwing whatever was near him.He picked up a wine bottle and struck it across the side of Ms. Gass’s head, knocking her to the floor.He then threw a clothes iron at her, striking her on the foot.Ms. Gass felt faint.[8]Ms. Gass unsuccessfully tried to convince Mr. MacDonald to go to bed. When she tried to call for help, he pulled the phone cord out of the wall.Ms. Gass felt that she needed to go to the hospital for stiches.Mr. MacDonald refused to accompany her.She left the house but returned to find something to staunch her bleeding nose.As she approached the house, Mr. MacDonald struck her again.She fell to the ground.[9]Ms. Gass returned to the residence to try and reason with Mr. MacDonald. She told him that he could have killed her.He responded that he would continue to attempt to do so.[10]Ms. Gass finally fled the residence and was picked up along the road and driven to a residence where she called the police.Mr. MacDonald did not pursue her.[11]The police took Ms. Gass to the hospital for treatment.Photographs were taken which confirmed injuries to her head, back, arm and foot.She recalled being knocked to the floor in the house at least three times.Ms. Gass says that she is afraid of Mr. MacDonald when he is drinking and violent.[12]Mr. MacDonald had been convicted on February 12, 1997 of assaulting Ms. Gass with a weapon (Criminal Code s. 267(1)(a)).On that occasion he struck her in the face with an axe handle.For that offence he received a conditional sentence of six months (house arrest), accompanied by two years’ probation.STANDARD OF REVIEW:[13]In passing sentence a judge is exercising a statutorily authorized discretion under the Criminal Code:718.3 (1) Where an enactment prescribes different degrees or kinds of punishment in respect of an offence, the punishment to be imposed is, subject to the limitations prescribed in the enactment, in the discretion of the court that convicts a person who commits the offence.[14]As with other discretionary decisions, the standard of review on appeal is a deferential one.This standard has been articulated in a number of ways.It was neatly expressed by Macdonald, J.A. of this Court in R. v. Cormier (1975), 9 N.S.R. (2d) 687 at p. 694:20Thus it will be seen that this Court is required to consider the “fitness” of the sentence imposed, but this does not mean that a sentence is to be deemed improper merely because the members of this Court feel that they themselves would have imposed a different one; apart from misdirection or non-direction on the proper principles a sentence should be varied only if the Court is satisfied that it is clearly excessive or inadequate in relation to the offence proven or to the record of the accused.[15]More recently, in R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227; S.C.J. No. 52 (Q.L.)(S.C.C.) Iacobucci J., for a unanimous Court, said:[46]... An appellate court should not be given free reign to modify a sentencing order simply because it feels that a different order ought to have been made.The formulation of a sentencing order is a profoundly subjective process; the trial judge has the advantage of having seen and heard all of the witnesses whereas the appellate court can only base itself upon a written record.A variation in the sentence should only be made if the court of appeal is convinced it is not fit.That is to say, that it has found the sentence to be clearly unreasonable.[16]Similarly, in R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500; S.C.J. No. 28 (Q.L.) (S.C.C.), Lamer, C.J.C. said, for a unanimous Court, at pp. 565-566:[90]Put simply, absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit.Parliament explicitly vested sentencing judges with a discretion to determine the appropriate degree and kind of punishment under the Criminal Code ...[91]. . . The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which attempts to balance carefully the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence, while at all times taking into account the needs and current conditions of and in the community.The discretion of a sentencing judge should thus not be interfered with lightly.(Emphasis added)[17]This deference reflects a recognition of the unique qualifications of front line judges and is equally applied whether the sentence arises after a trial or from a guilty plea.As explained by the Court in R. v. M.(C.A.), supra:[91] This deferential standard of review has profound functional justifications. As Iacobucci J. explained in Shropshire, at para. 46, where the sentencing judge has had the benefit of presiding over the trial of the offender, he or she will have had the comparative advantage of having seen and heard the witnesses to the crime. But in the absence of a full trial, where the offender has pleaded guilty to an offence and the sentencing judge has only enjoyed the benefit of oral and written sentencing submissions (as was the case in both Shropshire and this instance), the argument in favour of deference remains compelling. A sentencing judge still enjoys a position of advantage over an appellate judge in being able to directly assess the sentencing submissions of both the Crown and the offender. A sentencing judge also possesses the unique qualifications of experience and judgment from having served on the front lines of our criminal justice system. Perhaps most importantly, the sentencing judge will normally preside near or within the community which has suffered the consequences of the offender's crime. As such, the sentencing judge will have a strong sense of the particular blend of sentencing goals that will be \"just and appropriate\" for the protection of that community. . . .(Emphasis added)[18]Thus, before interfering with this sentence, we must be persuaded that the judge proceeded upon an error in principle, failed to consider a relevant factor,overemphasized the appropriate factors, or that the sentence is demonstrably unfit.ANALYSIS:[19]Ms. Gass and Mr. MacDonald have lived together since 1991.His last work was as a welder, thirteen years ago.Since 1992 Mr. MacDonald has been in receipt of a disability pension.Mr. MacDonald says that he is an alcoholic.He professes to be a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, but, at the time of the offence had not attended meetings for some time.In 1997 Mr. MacDonald attended the New Leaf Program for anger management, but for only six sessions.The director of that program felt that Mr. MacDonald’s attendance had been too short to accomplish anything.That involvement was motivated, presumably, by his conviction for assault with a weapon that year.[20]Mr. MacDonald was fined for breaching the terms of his probation related to the 1997 sentence.The details of that breach were not a part of the record before the trial judge.[21]The photographs of Ms. Gass taken immediately after the assault, and also after the injuries had matured, depict a person who has been subjected to a severebeating.[22]A post-sentence report, dated January 20, 2003, was prepared on the Order of this Court at the request of counsel for Mr. MacDonald.While the author noted that Mr. MacDonald had been to that date compliant with the conditions of his sentence, the results of the Domestic Violence Inventory administered as a part of that process are troubling:. . . With regards to the violence scale, Mr. MacDonald’s response pattern is in the high risk or severe problem range.Mr. MacDonald should be considered dangerous.Recommendations are for referral for comprehensive psychological or psychiatric evaluation.As well, consideration might be given to a structured residential and/or treatment program to deal with his propensity for violence.[23]The report further indicated that, since sentencing, Mr. MacDonald has been regularly attending the New Leaf Program.The Spousal Abuse Risk Assessment puts him at “high risk”.Mr. MacDonald was angry and argumentative on calls to the Gass/MacDonald home made to ensure compliance with his conditional sentence.Ms. Gass was annoyed at such calls as well.Mr. MacDonald told the writer that, since the sentencing, he had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous twice weekly.He was scheduled to enter a five day detox program on January 26, 2003.[24]At the sentencing hearing the Crown Attorney sought incarceration for a period of three years. It was her submission that any sentence had to be of sufficient length to enable Mr. MacDonald to take advantage of addiction and anger management programs within the institution.Such programs are thought to be more readily available in a Federal Institution.To serve time in a federal institution, offenders must receive an incarcerative sentence of two years or more.Any sentence, of course, must be within the range appropriate for this offence and cannot be greater than otherwise justified in order to facilitate treatment (see, for example, R. v. Sack, [1994] N.B.J. No. 413 (Q.L.) at ¶ 11).The defence urged a conditional sentence with house arrest and conditions, including a requirement that Mr. MacDonald take steps to address his addiction to alcohol and attend counselling for anger management.[25]The judge’s thoughtful oral sentencing decision revealed his familiarity with the sentencing principles enumerated in s. 718 of the Criminal Code.He expressly recognized the need here for both general and specific deterrence and noted that the fact that this was a second assault upon the same victim was an aggravating factor.I am persuaded, however, that in imposing the conditionalsentence, the judge fell into error.[26]In R. v. Brown (1992), 1992 ABCA 132 (CanLII), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 242; A.J. No. 432 (Q.L.) (Alta.C.A.), a case which pre-dates the implementation of the conditional sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code, the Court discussed the blight that is spousal assault, at p. 249 (C.C.C.):This court's experience is that the phenomenon of repeated beatings of a wife by a husband is a serious problem in our society. It is not one which may be solved solely by the nature of the sentencing policy applied by the courts where there are convictions for such assaults. It is a broad social problem which should be addressed by society outside the courts in ways which it is not within our power to create, to encourage, or to finance. But when such cases do result in prosecution and conviction, then the courts do have an opportunity, by their sentencing policy, to denounce wife beating in clear terms and to attempt to deter its recurrence on the part of the accused man and its occurrence on the part of other men.In cases of assault by a man against his wife, or by a man against a woman with whom he lives even if not married, the starting-point in sentencing should be what sentence would be fit if the same assault were against a woman who is not in such a relationship. For example, what would be the fit sentence if the man had assaulted a woman on the street or in a bar ‑‑ and if the aggravating factors (such as severe violence, or a serious record of previous convictions for similar or other assaults), or the mitigating factors (such as a guilty plea or other evidence of remorse) were the same as in the actual case?Then the court should examine the circumstances which are peculiar because of the relationship. When a man assaults his wife or other female partner, his violence toward her can be accurately characterized as a breach of the position of trust which he occupies. It is an aggravating factor. Men who assault their wives are abusing the power and control which they so often have over the women with whom they live. The vulnerability of many such women is increased by the financial and emotional situation in which they find themselves, which makes it difficult for them to escape. Such women's financial state is frequently one of economic dependence upon the man. Their emotional or psychological state militates against their leaving the relationship because the abuse they suffer causes them to lose their self‑esteem and to develop a sense of powerlessness and inability to control events.In the case of assaults by a man against his wife or other female partner in life, two of the applicable principles are that the sentence should be shaped in the hope of furthering the rehabilitation of that man and in the hope of deterring him from repeating his conduct in the future. However, the more important principles are that the sentence should be such as to deter other men from similarly conducting themselves toward women who are their wives or partners (what is called the principle of \"general deterrence\"), and that the sentence should express the community's wish to repudiate such conduct in a society that values the dignity of the individual (the \"denunciation principle\"). The importance of giving effect to these latter two principles has been driven home by recent remarks in cases that did not relate to sentencing in criminal cases. The first is R. v. Lavallee, in the passage from Wilson J.'s judgment which has already been quoted. The second is the dissenting judgment of Hetherington J.A. in R. v. Coston (1990), 1990 ABCA 200 (CanLII), 108 A.R. 209 (C.A.).(Emphasis added)[27]Conditional sentences are authorized by s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code:742.1Where a person is convicted of an offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, and the court(a)imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years, and(b)is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2,the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender's behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the offender's complying with the conditions of a conditional sentence order made under section 742.3.[28]The Crown submits, and I would agree, that in formulating this sentence the judge did not follow the two stage process mandated by the legislation and clarified by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61; 2000 SCC 5.The judge must first determine whether this offence should attract a period of incarceration of less than two years.If so, a conditional sentence may be available.The judge must then be satisfied that a conditional sentence would not endanger the safety of the community and that such a disposition would be consistent with the fundamental principles and purposes of sentencing (see Proulx at paras. 58 to 78):¶ 58. . .Hence, a purposive interpretation of s. 742.1(a) does not dictate a rigid two‑step approach in which the judge would first have to impose a term of imprisonment of a fixed duration and then decide if that fixed term of imprisonment can be served in the community.In my view, the requirement that the court must impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years can be fulfilled by a preliminary determination of the appropriate range of available sentences.Thus, the approach I suggest still requires the judge to proceed in two stages.However, the judge need not impose a term of imprisonment of a fixed duration at the first stage of the analysis.Rather, at this stage, the judge simply has to exclude two possibilities: (a) probationary measures; and (b) a penitentiary term.If either of these sentences is appropriate, then a conditional sentence should not be imposed.(Emphasis added)[29]Here, it appears that the judge failed to turn his mind to the first requirement - that this crime warranted an incarcerative sentence of less than two years.As stated above, it is not necessary that the judge assign a fixed term to the sentence prior to moving to the second step, rather the judge must be satisfied that the appropriate term is under the two year period.Here the judge noted that the range for domestic assaults was from one to nine years but did not expressly fit this assault within that range.Indeed, he commented that the three year term sought by the Crown was not “untoward” for this crime.He said nothing more about the appropriate term of incarceration.[30]Having reviewed the range of sentences for such offences, and taking into account the mitigating factors here — the early guilty plea and the month served on remand, I am satisfied that the sentencing judge could have concluded that a sentence of less than two years was appropriate.As the Supreme Court of Canada noted in Proulx, no offence is presumptively excluded from the conditional sentencing regime (at ¶ 79).I would not, therefore, interfere with this sentence on account of the judge’s failure to expressly address the length of sentence before he moved to a consideration of the propriety of a conditional disposition.[31]As I will discuss below, it is my view, however, that a conditional sentence was not available here in that the circumstances of this offence did not satisfy the requirements of s.742.1(b).The Court, in Proulx, elaborated upon the additional prerequisites for a conditional sentence:¶ 60Once that preliminary determination is made, and assuming the other statutory prerequisites are met, the judge should then proceed to the second stage of the analysis: determining whether a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.Unlike the first stage, the principles of sentencing are now considered comprehensively. Further, it is at the second stage that the duration and venue of the sentence should be determined, and, if a conditional sentence, the conditions to be imposed.. . .¶ 63As a prerequisite to any conditional sentence, the sentencing judge must be satisfied that having the offender serve the sentence in the community would not endanger its safety: see Brady, supra, at para. 58; R. v. Maheu, 1997 CanLII 10356 (QC CA), [1997] R.J.Q. 410, 116 C.C.C. (3d) 361 (C.A.), at p. 368 C.C.C.; Gagnon, supra, at p. 2641; Pierce, supra, at p. 39; Ursel, supra, at pp. 284‑86 (per Ryan J.A.).If the sentencing judge is not satisfied that the safety of the community can be preserved, a conditional sentence must never be imposed.. . .¶ 68In my view, the focus of the analysis at this point should clearly be on the risk posed by the individual offender while serving his sentence in the community.I would note that a majority of appellate courts have adopted an interpretation of the criterion referring only to the threat posed by the specific offender: see Gagnon, supra, at pp. 2640‑41 (per Fish J.A.); R. v. Parker (1997), 1997 CanLII 14391 (NS CA), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 236 (N.S.C.A.), at pp. 247‑48; Ursel, supra, at p. 260; R. v. Horvath, 1997 CanLII 9759 (SK CA), [1997] 8 W.W.R. 357 (Sask. C.A.), at p. 374; Brady, supra, at paras. 60‑61; Wismayer, supra, at p. 44.. . .¶ 69In my opinion, to assess the danger to the community posed by the offender while serving his or her sentence in the community, two factors must be taken into account: (1) the risk of the offender re‑offending; and (2) the gravity of the damage that could ensue in the event of re‑offence.If the judge finds that there is a real risk of re‑offence, incarceration should be imposed.Of course, there is always some risk that an offender may re‑offend.If the judge thinks this risk is minimal, the gravity of the damage that could follow were the offender to re‑offend should also be taken into consideration.In certain cases, the minimal risk of re‑offending will be offset by the possibility of a great prejudice, thereby precluding a conditional sentence.(Emphasis Added)[32]The assessment of danger to the community includes a consideration of the threat posed by the specific offender and focuses on issues such as the risk of re-offence and the gravity of damage in the event of re-offence.In Proulx, the Supreme Court of Canada, endorsing the following words from R. v. Brady (1998), 1998 ABCA 7 (CanLII), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 504 (Alta.C.A.), confirmed that the “safety of the community” concern is directed, not just to the community as a whole, but includes an individual victim:[64] The words \"endanger the safety of the community\" include an unacceptable risk of danger to persons or property. It is not necessary that the risk of danger affect the whole community; it may affect any particular person or persons in it. The mere fact that an offender aims his misconduct at selected victims does not make the danger any less a community safety issue. Everyone is part of the larger community. When Parliament speaks of safety of the community, it is speaking of what it takes to make safe communities in this country. Freedom from personal harm or violence is most assuredly in that class.[33]The risk of re-offence, which is also a part of this analysis, requires a case-specific assessment.Lamer C.J., writing for the full Court in Proulx, refers to the list of factors relevant to this assessment as enumerated by Rousseau‑Houle J.A. in R. v. Maheu, (1997), 1997 CanLII 10356 (QC CA), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 361 (Que.C.A.):[TRANSLATION] ... 1) the nature of the offence, 2) the relevant circumstances of the offence, which can put in issue prior and subsequent incidents, 3) the degree of participation of the accused, 4) the relationship of the accused with the victim, 5) the profile of the accused, that is, his [or her] occupation, his lifestyle, his criminal record, his family situation, his mental state, 6) his [or her] conduct following the commission of the offence, 7) the danger which the interim release of the accused represents for the community, notably that part of the community affected by the matter.[34]Also relevant is whether the offender has complied with court orders in the past.The risk of re-offence must be assessed in light of the conditions which could be imposed with a conditional sentence.It may be that the risk can be appreciably reduced through the imposition of appropriate conditions coupled with an adequate level of supervision.[35]The judge, in granting this conditional disposition, did not expressly and could not have turned his mind to the requirement that such a sentence not endanger the safety of the community. Failure by the sentencing judge to do so, was, in my view, a material error in principle which requires this Court to intervene (C.A.M., supra at para. 90, per Lamer, C.J.C.).After conducting the required analysis I am not satisfied that a conditional sentence would not endanger Ms. Gass.Factors militating against such a sentence include Mr. MacDonald’s prior offence for the same crime on the same victim; the plan to resume co-habitation with Ms. Gass; and Mr. MacDonald’s lack of sustainable success in previous alcohol and anger management programs.In view of the couple’s stated intent to co-habit, there are no conditions which can reasonably ensure Ms. Gass’s safety.While a condition could be imposed that Mr. MacDonald have no contact with Ms. Gass, in view of his re-offence, and taking into account his past violation of a condition of probation, I would have no confidence that such a condition could be effective.Mr. MacDonald’s consumption of alcohol leads to violent and unpredictable behaviour.When that occurs, Ms. Gass is the focus of his rage.She is apparently unable to predict his temper flare-ups or to remove herself in order to avoid injury.In those circumstances, no level of supervision would suffice to adequately reduce the risk to Ms. Gass.[36]The sentencing judge noted that a significant deterrent to re-offending is the fact that, should Mr. MacDonald breach a conditional sentence, he would most likely be incarcerated for the balance of the term.He failed to recognize, however, that any such breach might well involve another assault upon Ms. Gass.There seems to have been a progression of the level of violence from the first assault to the second insofar as one can determine from the limited information available about the first offence.The fact that Mr. MacDonald purports to have no recollection of this brutal assault speaks of his lack of control when intoxicated.When he is in such a state it is fair to conclude that the deterrent effect of possible incarceration will have no impact on his behaviour.Had the judge considered the very real risk of serious harm to Ms. Gass should Mr. MacDonald re-offend, he could not have been satisfied that a conditional sentence was appropriate here.[37]Not only is the risk of re-offence high, but the gravity of the potential injury to Ms. Gass, should Mr. MacDonald re-offend, is unacceptable.In the case of violent offenders, a small risk of very harmful consequences of a future crime may preclude a conditional sentence (Proulx, supra, at ¶ 74).It is Ms. Gass’s view that Mr. MacDonald’s abuse of alcohol and violent behaviour is brought on by stress.One would expect him to be under great stress with the confinement of house arrest. The planned continued co-habitation, coupled with Mr. MacDonald’s addiction, his unpredictable and uncontrolled explosions of anger, and the progression of violence is a potentially fatal combination.[38]I have considered, as well, that this was an unprovoked assault.I do notsuggest that provocation would in any way excuse this brutal attack.The lack of provocation, however, speaks of the random nature of such an outburst and the probability of Ms. Gass being unable to avoid circumstances that could lead to a similar attack in future.[39]Thus, in my view, had the judge, as is required by s. 742.1(b), considered the safety of the community, he could not have imposed a conditional sentence for this crime.[40]While the above analysis is sufficient to preclude a conditional sentence here, I would note that s. 742.1(b) also requires that the judge be satisfied that such a sentence be consistent with the fundamental principles of sentencing.It is at this stage that the judge considers factors such as general deterrence and denunciation.I need not address this further requirement in detail.I would note, however, that, as stated in the excerpt from R. v. Brown above at ¶ 26, sentencing for spousal assault requires emphasis upon denunciation and general deterrence.While recognizing that “a properly crafted conditional sentence can also achieve the objectives of general deterrence and denunciation ...” (Proulx at ¶ 67) that Court acknowledges that institutional incarceration will generally provide more denunciation (Proulx at ¶ 102) and deterrence (Proulx at ¶ 107).It would be my view these principles deserve particular attention where a spousal abuser has re-offended following a conditional disposition.[41]It is important to recognize, as well, that society has an interest in Ms. Gass’s continued safety.Mr. MacDonald’s random attacks burden the state’s resources and endanger not only Ms. Gass but also the peace officers who are called upon to intervene.It is counter-intuitive to permit a violent offender to continue to cohabit with the victim, even though that victim is a willing participant.This would surely undermine confidence in the administration of justice.[42]It is my view that the judge’s application of the appropriate sentencing principles was overborne by Ms. Gass’s poignant plea that Mr. MacDonald be free to continue to reside with her.Ms. Gass elected not to file a victim impact statement.She did, however, address the court orally, at length.It is not uncommon for sentencing judges to be faced with similar pleas for leniency in cases of domestic violence.Ms. Gass said:MS. GASS Okay.I don’t know where to begin.I’m nervous for one thing.Where do I start?I don’t know if anybody in this courtroom understands alcoholism or not.I’m a recovering alcoholic myself. I do understand it.I think alcoholism is – I understand what an alcoholic black-out is.I have had them.And I know the remorse and I know the feeling of waking up in the morning and not knowing where your car is, wondering how you got home, afraid to ask somebody, scared to ask anybody because you’re afraid that you may hear that you’ve done something that you shouldn’t have or offended somebody or hurt somebody and not remembered it.And it’s a very lonely, scary feeling.I know that.And I know you do things in an alcoholic black-out that you wouldn’t normally do.I don’t think the medical profession even understands alcoholism.I don’t think anybody really understands alcoholism unless they are an alcoholic themselves or have experienced alcoholism. [Inaudible] the best way I can compare it is to how in the world would you ever know what it’s like to have a baby if you’ve never had one.That’s about the way I can – my way of explaining it.Let me see.I blame myself a little bit for what happened because I knew that Chloran was drinking butt (sic) I was not watching to see – I wasn’t aware.I should have been more aware of the amount that he was consuming, but I wasn’t and especially where I know he was under a great deal of pressure for about a month prior to that.And, therefore, I should have been more cautious and watched that he wasn’t – he shouldn’t have been consuming at all.I should have – that was something about that, I feel partly to blame because I didn’t.And as far as taking the first drink, only an alcoholic knows how powerful [inaudible] - - mostly powerful it is.Sometimes the alcoholic doesn’t know [inaudible].If they’re in a weakened condition and that drink is there, it’s more powerful than they are.I know because I’ve been there.I’ve got a little note so I can try to remember everything that I want to say.I love Chloran very much.He’s been a real good friend to me.He’s the best friend that I have.We’ve had - - we’ve been together for nine years in total, I guess, nine or ten years.And there was an incident eight years ago, a black-out drinking, and anyway it’s in the past as far as I’m concerned.And since then we’ve gotten along fine, better than most couples I might say.He’s very supportive and he’s kind to me.He’s real kind to me.And I need him, for one thing. I don’t know how I’m going to survive without him especially with winter coming on.I feel it’s unfair to me that I would have to line people up to do what he’s capable of doing for me; for instance, winter is coming on.I’m worried about that.We have a Keymac stove.It’s the only heat - - that’s the heating system for our house is a Keymac stove.There’s nobody in this area of Pictou - - in Pictou County that can fix a Keymac stove.Chloran fixes Keymac stoves, carburetors for people in the area.And if something goes wrong with my Keymac stove and Chloran is not there to fix it, I have no heat in the house.I would have to hire somebody from Truro to come to fix it.That’s one thing.I don’t know how to work the back-up system if we have a power failure and the Keymac goes - - I have to put the Keymac out because [it will go all through to that?] so I have no heat.And we bought insulation to put up under the house.It’s all under the house there.The two of us were going to put it up together.Now I may have to put that up or get - - hire somebody to put it up.Chloran and I can do it alone.The two of us can do it.That’s what the plan was.Another thing is our water pump.It loses its pressure.I don’t know how to put pressure in that water tank.I have to hire somebody to put pressure in that water tank or I’m without water.Well, the insulation.The windows need to be done.I probably could manage that on my own.I don’t know.What about if we have a winter like last winter?How am I going to get that snow off the roof by myself without hiring somebody?I’m sure that the Crown or somebody else isn‘t going to pay to do it.It’s going to be out of my pocket.Even the lawnmower hasn’t been cleaned up for winter and I’m not sure what to do with it.I feel unsafe with - - I feel more unsafe living out on the Sunrise Trail by myself out there in a small town in Pictou where there is a certain amount of crime in this town.And it’s a small town.People know that I’m living alone.I feel that I’m easy prey for somebody.There’s nobody there to protect me.I’m by myself.And everybody - - being a small town, everybody in town knows that I’m alone.You know, little things that I need Chloran for, as well. To get my winter clothes down from out in the shed, I have to climb up on a ladder.There’s nobody to hold the ladder for me.I haven’t even got the winter clothes down from up in the shed yet.I’m scared to go up on that ladder alone for fear I’ll fall.And car repairs, my [inaudible] TV anything goes wrong with that, I have to hire somebody to fix it.I’d like to thank the RCMP and the Court for their concern about my safety, but I feel safer with him than without him.And I’m not even sure I want to go on without him.There’s no point in it to me.As far as I’m concerned, I don’t even want to live without him.And regardless of what sentence he makes, it doesn’t matter.If it’s (minimum of?) two years, ten years, it doesn’t matter.When he is out, he’s back with me.And - - because I feel that I am safe with him.And I just dread the thought of Christmas without him.And Christmas is a very important time of year for me.It’s the time I get to see my grandchildren we can and spend quality time with them.I won’t have Christmas this year without Chloran.It’s him who looked after all the turkey dinner in the past, always has, so I can spend quality time with my grandchildren and my children that I don’t see very often.They don’t even know I’m here.They don’t know any of this has happened and I don’t want them to know because I don’t want them to worry about me.I guess - - and like I said, no matter how long he’s sentenced for, whatever you do, he’s going to be back with me regardless. That’s really all I can say, I guess.Please try to understand it is a disease and it’s not - - it’s a disease of the mind, the body, and the soul.And it’s, I think, one of the worst diseases anybody could ever have because it affects so many parts of you.That’s all I have to say to you, I guess.(Emphasis added)[43]Ms. Gass’s remarks underscore the extent of her vulnerability and dependence upon Mr. MacDonald.One wonders if she is able to fairly evaluate the relationship and the dangers that it creates for her.[44]Having heard Ms. Gass’s plea, the judge was clearly aware that incarceration of Mr. MacDonald would remove Ms. Gass’s only source of physical and, possibly, financial support. According to her, without the assistance of Mr. MacDonald, her living situation would be compromised.The judge’s imposition of a community based sentence was a well motivated effort not to re-victimize Ms. Gass.As I have already stated, however, by so doing he erred.[45]Such requests are all too common a part of sentencings for spousal assault.In R. v. Brown, supra, that court addressed the placement of the victim’s wishes in the sentencing process (at p.251):It is not possible to draw up an exhaustive list of factual elements which should be taken into account in sentencing in wife assault cases. Because the violence has occurred in the context of a spousal relationship without which the man might never have been violent toward the woman, the court must consider whether the assault for which the man has been convicted is relatively minor in nature, or is an isolated incident, or whether there are other circumstances which make it desirable that the sentence not be such as to be counter-productive to the possibility that the family relationship will be preserved (if there is any such possibility remaining). The first two of these points will already have been taken into account in deciding what the starting‑point should be; that is, what the fit sentence would have been if it had been an assault between strangers. The third point must be applied with care, because the plea of the wife that her husband be returned to her and that she not be further victimized by being deprived of his income should not readily be permitted to prevail over the general sentencing policy that envisages imprisonment of the man as not only an instrument of the deterrence of other men, but also as an instrument of breaking the cycle of violence in that man's family even at the risk of the relationship coming to an end during the enforced separation.(Emphasis added)[46]In R. v. Leger (J.D.) ([1997), 1997 CanLII 1813 (NS CA), 160 N.S.R. (2d) 143; N.S.J. No. 245(Q.L.)(N.S.C.A.), an appeal from a sentencing for spousal abuse, Flinn J.A., writing for this Court, quoted the following remarks of the trial judge:[14]With respect to the willingness of the appellant's common law spouse to forgive him, and continue their relationship, the trial judge said the following:When you take many of those purposes of sentencing and put them together, they override the very subjective interest in the victim here in maintaining an unbroken and continued relationship with the accused.Her forgiveness and the fact that she is willing to take her chances of further abuse and humiliation from this degradation, I might add, from this individual do not take away from the fact that he has committed a crime against the community as well as the victim and the whole community, to the mechanism of deterrence, must understand that not only is this wrong, it will not be tolerated.[47]I agree with the sentencing judge that Mr. MacDonald’s circumstances cry out for a rehabilitative sentence.While rehabilitation might better be accomplished in the community, this opportunity has been provided in the past, without lasting success.Here, the desirability for rehabilitation outside of an institutional setting conflicts with the goal of protecting the public from a dangerous person and must therefore give way to that end.[48]Mr. MacDonald must understand that one of the consequences of his criminal behaviour is to visit long term hardship upon Ms. Gass through his removal as her helpmate.The sad result is that the injury to Ms. Gass is not limited to the transient physical results of the beating but includes a profound impact on her day to day living.[49]Having found that a conditional sentence was not available here, it remains to fix the term of incarceration.A person who commits aggravated assault, wounds, maims, disfigures or endangers the life of the victim.Aggravated assault carries a greater penalty than does assault with a weapon, the crime for which Mr. MacDonald was previously convicted, and reflects an increased level of violence over his earlier crime.[50]As in all sentencing decisions, we must consider mitigating and aggravating factors.Mr. MacDonald’s guilty plea is a mitigating factor.His expression of remorse, however, rings hollow in the case of this second assault upon the same victim.Nor am I satisfied that Mr. MacDonald’s addiction to alcohol should mitigate on this second offence.Indeed, I would consider the fact of Mr. MacDonald’s intoxication an aggravating factor here.He was, as a result of the first conviction, introduced to the support services necessary to deal with his addiction.At that point, if not before, he was well aware of the dangers associated with his abuse of alcohol.He has not taken sustained advantage of those services, as a consequence of which he has re-offended.[51]Amendments to the Criminal Code in 1997 clarify that abuse of a spouse is an aggravating factor that should increase the sentence above what it would otherwise be.718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,. . .(ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender's spouse or common-law partner or child,(iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, ...[52]That this is a second spousal assault upon the same victim is a significant aggravating factor.As has already been mentioned, the nature of this crime calls out for denunciation and general deterrence.Specific deterrence is required, here, as well.[53]As mentioned above, Mr. MacDonald was fined for breaching the conditions of his earlier sentence.The particulars were not available at time of sentencing.Counsel agreed at the hearing of this matter that, should this court conclude that the sentence must be overturned, it would be appropriate for us, in substituting a fit sentence, to consider the circumstances of that previous breach. Mr. MacDonald was sentenced on February 12, 1997 to a six month conditional sentence followed by a period of probation.The offence to which he pleaded guilty and was fined was breaching the terms of his probation by consuming alcohol on August 31of that same year.Clearly, Mr. MacDonald’s abstention from alcohol was a key term of the probation order.I consider this past breach to be an additional aggravating factor.[54]As is the custom, I would grant a two month credit for the one month served on remand.After allowance of that credit, I am satisfied that the appropriate sentence for this offence is a term of imprisonment of twenty-two months followed by three years probation.(See, for example, R. v. Brown (B.J.) (2000), 2000 NSCA 146 (CanLII), 189 N.S.R. (2d) 287 (C.A.); R. v. Leger, supra; and R. v. Wiswell (1992), 1992 CanLII 2605 (NS CA), 110 N.S.R. (2d) 333; N.S.J. No. 135 (Q.L.)(C.A.))DISPOSITION:[55]I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, set aside the conditional sentence and order that Mr. MacDonald serve a sentence of imprisonment of twenty-two months followed by a three year probationary term with conditions.In addition to the statutory conditions Mr. MacDonald, while on probation shall: report to the Probation Services as directed by Probation Services; remain within the Province of Nova Scotia unless permission in writing is otherwise granted byProbation Services; attend for any mental health assessment as may be directed by Probation Services; and continue with or commence any substance abuse, anger management or other related program(s) or counselling as may be directed by Probation Services.Mr. MacDonald has fully complied with the terms of his conditional sentence.I would, therefore, order that he be granted four months credit for time already served.The weapons prohibition, which was not appealed, shall remain in effect.Bateman, J.A.Concurred in:Glube, C.J.N.S.Roscoe, J.A."}

(Montreal, April, 1997): Allan Manson (Faculty of Law, Queens University, Finding a Place for Conditional Sentences.Catherine C. FlanaganSolicitor for the CrownDavid E. LarterSolicitor for the AccusedJenkins J.: (orally and edited)[1]J.C.B. pleaded guilty to assaulting A.L. on October 14, 1995. Following a sentencing hearing, I will now sentence him for indictable assault, contrary to s. 266(a) of the Criminal Code.Publication Ban:[2]The offender was initially charged with sexual assault on the complainant, contrary to s. 271(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. A publication ban was invoked under s. 486. Subsequently, the offender pleaded guilty to the lesser offence of assault. In the circumstances, I am of the opinion that it continues to be in the interests of proper administration of justice that the publication ban directing that the identity of the complainant or information that could disclose her identity shall not be published in any document or broadcast in any way. The publication ban will remain in effect.Facts:[3]The prosecutor and the offender made a joint submission under s. 723(1) of the Criminal Code with respect to the facts relevant to sentence. As background, at approximately 3:00a.m., the victim, then aged 16, was walking home alone from a party north on Main Street in Montague. The offender, then aged 34, passed the victim and then turned his vehicle, stopped, and offered her a drive. She first said no, and then accepted. When they drove past the victim's designated destination, she became alarmed, but then calmed down when the offender turned his vehicle and returned to Montague. However, instead of continuing into Montague, the offender turned down a side road which comes to a dead end at Brudenell Point Park. There were no other cars present at that time. The offender removed the victim's clothing as well as his own. The victim remained passive and the accused interpreted her passivity as consent. The victim asked to leave the truck in order to urinate. When she got out of the truck, she attempted to run away. (I note that until this point in time no assault or offence occurred. It is following this that the assault occurred, these facts.)[4]Upon pursuing and catching up with the victim, the offender grabbed her and carried her back to the passenger side of his truck, causing her to strike her head on the passenger door as he forced her back into the truck. The victim was struggling with the accused and screaming as an unidentified car drove into the clearing, and the offender scrambled into the driver's seat, started the truck and drove off.The victim told the offender that if he would return her to Montague, she wouldn t say anything.[5](The following agreed facts followed the incident and are also relevant to the facts of the offence.) A short distance up the access road the offender stopped the truck and the parties dressed. He dropped her off at her originally designated destination. He told her he was sorry. Although she didn t know his name, the victim noted the truck license plate number. The police were called, and the victim was taken to hospital where her injuries were noted. The victim was released after an examination to the care of her mother. Upon being arrested, the offender provided a statement admitting to using force to put the victim back in the truck.Approach to Sentence:[6]In addressing sentence, I have had the benefit of, and considered, the victim's views expressed in her Victim Impact Statement dated April 29, 1997, submissions regarding the offender provided by the Pre-sentence Report provided by Probation Services, and the submissions of the offender and his counsel.[7]Assault is an indictable offence for which the maximum sentence is imprisonment for a term not exceeding five (5) years.[8]I am directed by the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention measures, to respect for the law and maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives: 1) denouncing unlawful conduct; 2) deterring the offender and other persons from committing offences; 3) separating offenders from society, where necessary; 4) assisting in rehabilitating the offender; 5) providing reparations for harm done to the victim or to the community; and 6) promoting a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledgment of harm done to victims and the community.[9]The fundamental principle is that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and to the degree of responsibility of the offender.[10] The sentencing judge is also directed to consider what the Criminal Code characterizes as other sentencing principles. For purposes of this case these include: (a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or to the offender (and there are certain statutory ones which are not present here); (b) the sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances; (c) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and (d) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders.[11] Within this realm of consideration, the Criminal Code expressly confers discretion upon the sentencing court.[12] Assault is the intentional application of force to another person, directly or indirectly, without her consent. Assault is viewed judicially as violence, as an offence against the person, and is treated seriously.[13] In this case, the offence in issue is assault. The offender is being sentenced for that offence only, and not for sexual assault. However, the surrounding circumstances are relevant. The assault was the product of a sexual encounter between the offender, a mature adult, and the victim, a teenage female, who were hitherto strangers, and almost immediately engaged in intimate sexual activity. The facts do not necessarily render a conclusion that the offender intended to hurt or harm the victim. The assault was, in any event, a crime of violence and serious in nature. The offender did not intentionally strike the victim's head against the truck, but he did apply unwanted force. The injury occurred in that context. It is readily apparent that the physical injury consequences for the victim could easily have been worse.[14] As the prosecutor indicated, most of the assault sentencing precedents are with regard to either domestic assault or bar room type activity, and neither of those situations provides much precedent value for this case. However, some instruction can be taken from the domestic assault cases. The offender was not in a position of trust as this concept is understood within the criminal law. But the differences in age, size, and position of the offender and the victim are relevant.[15] R. v. A.M.M. (1990), 1990 CanLII 2642 (PE SCAD), 80 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 288 (P.E.I.S.C.A.D.), the guiding domestic assault sentencing case in this jurisdiction, is clearly distinguishable. However, the principles enunciated therein are instructive.Domestic assault is treated as a serious crime of violence. The Appeal Division directed in A.M.M. that in such cases deterrence is the paramount consideration in order to protect all potential victims, and especially vulnerable ones such as spouses and children. Justice Mitchell stated he did not mean a custodial sentence must follow in every case of domestic assault, but he did mean that a court should impose jail terms for such offences unless the assault is very minor in nature or there are strong extenuating circumstances.[16] In A.M.M., the Appeal Division sentenced the offender for a violent and serious assault on his wife, more extensive than the assault in the present case, to one month in jail. For a lesser assault on his son he was sentenced to five days in jail. These sentences were passed in conjunction with a consecutive sentence for sexual assault on the offender's daughter. The decision indicates the sentences there might have been longer had the Crown shown more aggravating factors, and also but for application of the totality principle.[17] In R. v. Johnston, unreported oral decision, November 1996, Summerside (P.E.I.S.C.T.D.), the offender, who had no previous criminal record, pleaded guilty to assault of his female companion.The offence occurred at the offender's home, a motel room, following a disagreement which ensued from a bar room dispute between the parties. There was no direct sexual connotation and the violence was more extensive there than it was in this case. On a joint submission by the prosecutor and the defence in that case, I sentenced the offender to one month imprisonment, to be served as a conditional sentence in the community, with conditions, followed by a one year period of probation.[18] In R. v. Bruce (1991), 90 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 55 (P.E.I.S.C.T.D.), a first time offender who had been sentenced by a Provincial Court judge for a domestic assault of three months in jail had his sentence reduced on appeal to one month. It was noted on appeal that the offender and victim had resumed cohabitation.[19] R. v. Doyle, [1992] 2 P.E.I.R. E16 (P.E.I.S.C.T.D.) is similar to this case in the sense of thecharge and the plea scenario, and it is also somewhat analogous on the facts of the offence. In Doyle the offender and the victim met only that night in a public place and they went to a private place and then were engaged in some bedroom foreplay, from which an altercation ensued and an assault occurred. The offender was sentenced to six months imprisonment and two years probation.In passing sentence, Justice Campbell noted regarding Doyle particularly his criminal propensity for violence and fighting, shown by his record of four assault convictions during the previous three years, plus two convictions for causing a disturbance by fighting, as well as Doyle's lack of empathy for the victim.Doyle and the offender in the present case are not similar offenders. The character, attitude and criminal record of the offender were obviously integral to the sentence imposed.[20] The computer print-out showing sentences imposed for assault in recent years by Provincial Court judges is helpful in terms of considering the broad range of sentence. This shows generally a range from suspended sentence, fine and no jail term to four months or so. However, the value of this information is quite limited, in view of the principle that similar sentences are only for similar offenders and for similar offences committed in similar circumstances; and that sentencing relates to both the offence and the offender and is carried out on an individual basis. As a further example of limited precedent value of the same offence of assault, in a recent case this month, R. v. Buckingham, unreported oral decision, May 13, 1997, Charlottetown (P.E.I.S.C.T.D.), I sentenced the offender for assault to nine months in jail (with credit at time and a half for six months time served, so that he did not have to serve any more time). That offence occurred in conjunction with a robbery by two others and where the offender had a related criminal record.Factors Regarding the Offence and the Offender:[21] With regard to the factors in this case:There is no indication of premeditation regarding the offence of assault in this case.The circumstances surrounding the offence and the gravity of the offence are addressed substantially by my earlier comments regarding the offence of domestic assault and the direction provided in A.M.M.The Pre-sentence Report and submissions on behalf of the offender are both very favourable and show mitigating circumstances. The agreed facts state the offender told the victim he was sorry, and then immediately acknowledged to the police his involvement in the assault. The Pre-sentence Report, which lets the Court get to know the offender better, supports the view that the offender's remorse is both full and sincere. He acknowledged to the probation officer his involvement in the offence, that his behaviour was wrong, and that he is willing to accept the consequences of his action. He has expressed to her that this type of offensive behaviournever will happen again-- his quote to her, and hers to me. The offender has expressed a willingness to participate in rehabilitative treatment, and the probation officer has recommended he could benefit from further assessment and, if deemed appropriate, counselling.The offender has no criminal record. This criminal conduct appears inconsistent with his life activities. This is a mitigating factor.The offender is 36 years of age. He has been employed steadily for the past 18 years by the same employer, and the probation officer advises that he has a positive relationship with his fellow workers and gets along well at work. The offender enjoys the support of both his parents and of his employer. These are mitigating factors.In my view, this amounts to the kind of situation where mercy becomes a factor for consideration.[22] Against the mitigating factors, I retain in mind the inequality of position as between the offender and the victim, the harm which occurred to her, and the potential for worse.Victim Impact:[23] I have considered the impact on the victim as expressed in her Victim Impact Statement. This was very helpful for the Court. Respecting the victim's privacy interests, I will not repeat its contents here. The victim wants the offender to stay away from her. This can and will be ordered. She also describes very serious emotional impact. She has obviously suffered emotional impact as a result of this offence. Consideration of the Victim Impact Statement needs to be tempered and the statement considered in context. In the circumstances, not all of the victim's present circumstances are necessarily attributable to this particular incident, as manifested by her having previously exhibited some of the symptoms which she describes. It is expected that Victim Services would, as in all cases, help to prepare the victim to appreciate that her input, while important, is only one part of what a judge needs to consider when arriving at the appropriate sentence.Purpose and Principles/Sentence:[24] In my view, the offender is an excellent candidate for rehabilitation. I think that he would not personally benefit from incarceration. However, in view of the pre-eminence of the objectives of denouncing this kind of unlawful conduct and deterring other persons from committing similar offences, the offender's actions require a sentence of imprisonment. Subject to considering whether to impose a conditional sentence, I have determined that the offender should be sentenced to jail for a period of one to two months more or less. The level of culpability and the extent of the assault are less in this case than existed in either A.M.M. or in Johnston. Here, like in Johnston, there were substantial mitigating factors. In both A.M.M. and in Johnston it was one month that was given for the offence. However, in this case the situation which the offender created was dangerous in its occurrence, and even moreso in its potential, so I am looking at the gravity of the situation.I have concluded that 1-1/2 months sentence is proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. The sentence would be longer than that except for the very substantial mitigating factors that are present here. This imprisonment would be followed by a period of probation of nine months, such period as appears to me from past experience in sentencing to be approximately sufficient to accomplish the remedial counselling that is in order for the offender here.Conditional Sentence:[25] Parliament has provided sentencing judges with an additional tool. Under s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code, where a person is convicted of an offence and the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years, as here, the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender's behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the offender complying with the conditions of a Conditional Sentence Order made under s. 742.3. Before imposing a conditional sentence, the sentencing court needs to be satisfied that serving the sentence in the community: 1) would not endanger the safety of the community, and 2) would be consistent with the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing as set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.[26] I take guidance regarding consideration of the principles of conditional sentencing from appellate level jurisprudence in other jurisdictions: particularly R. v. Wismayer, not yet reported, QL: 1997 CanLII 3294 (ON CA), [1997] O.J. No. 1380 No. C19832 (Ont. C.A.), and R. v. Parker, not yet reported, QL:[1997] N.S.J. No. 194 C.A.C. No. 133174 (N.S.C.A.), and in the cases considered and mentioned by Justices Rosenberg and Bateman in those decisions; and additionally from R. v. Pierce, not yet reported, QL: 1997 CanLII 3020 (ON CA), [1997] O.J. No. 715 No.C22984 (Ont. C.A.), and numerous other cases to which counsel and I referred.[27] I am satisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community. The offender's own life activities, attitude following the offence and toward the victim, and the very favourable statements regarding his disposition, psychological needs, and potential for rehabilitation, plus the support system which he has, combine to weigh heavily toward that conclusion.[28] I am also satisfied serving the sentence in the community would be consistent with the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2. The interplay between conditional sentencing on the one hand and general deterrence and denunciation on the other hand is discussed and analysed in both Wismayer and in Parker. I subscribe to those views. In addition, I note that the scheme of the Criminal Code sentencing provisions introduced in 1996 directs consideration of restorative justice for this kind of situation, consideration of the offender as well as the offence, and some movement away from the traditional view of retribution. Section 718.2 requires the court to consider that an offender should not be deprived of liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances, and that all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders. The sentencing judge is directed to consider conditional sentencing and then the sentencing judge has a discretion whether or not to employ it.Conditional sentences are not limited to property offences; they also can be invoked for offences against the person involving violence. The objectives of denunciation and general deterrence are addressed in conditional sentencing; however, this requires judicial and public acceptance that a sentence to be served in the community is indeed a real and meaningful sentence.[29] The thrust of the conditional sentence legislation is to encourage courts to reduce reliance upon incarceration of offenders, where appropriate. For this offender, I have already ruled out lesser forms of punishment, such as suspended sentence and fine. The conditional sentence is only considered when the judge has already decided a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years should be imposed, in order to achieve a fit sentence. Conditional sentence, in order to obtain any degree of acceptance within the judiciary and the broader community, needs to be recognized not as a new form of sentence, but rather a new way in which a prison sentence can be served. The sentencing judge continues to subscribe to the challenge of balancing the objectives of sentencing. This includes consideration of denunciation and deterrence. Conditional sentencing provides the court with an additional tool to address these objectives short of imprisonment in an institution, in appropriate cases.[30] Justice Bateman J. commented on this in Parker ( at para. 53-54):...Parliament has now authorized a new mechanism for controlling offenders, short of imprisonment in an institution, and has encouraged the courts to use that tool where appropriate. The extent to which the public accepts the deterrent and denunciative value of a conditional sentence will only be measured over time. Judicious use of the conditional sentence will provide the public with an opportunity for first hand observation of its impact upon the liberty of an offender. A properly informed public, in my view, will not perceive a conditional sentence, such as that imposed here, to be a lenient disposition. The essence of institutional incarceration is a deprivation of liberty. The conditional sentence ordered here effects a substantial deprivation of liberty. ...[31] For the present case, jail would not be helpful, and I would surmise that it would more likely be detrimental for the offender, given the sensitive observations in the Pre-sentence Report. As well, in the community, he can retain his employment and pursue counselling. His activities can be controlled by the conditions of sentence. The objectives of general deterrence and denunciation can be met in this case without resorting to jail.[32] I also make reference to a paper (I m not sure if this is published; counsel are welcome to it) delivered to a conference of the legal community in Montreal in April, 1997 called Dawn or Dusk in Sentencing?Allan Manson (Faculty of Law, Queens University), in Finding a Place for Conditional Sentences, at p. 5 states:...Clearly, Parliament has directed sentencing judges to consider all alternatives before resorting [to] imprisonment. This is the statutory acceptance of the principle of restraint.At pp. 11 ff., Professor Manson addresses the need for denunciation and the distinction between retribution and denunciation:Our Supreme Court, recently distinguished between retribution and denunciation:The objective of denunciation mandates that a sentence should also communicate society's condemnation of that particular offender's conduct...in addition to attaching negative consequences to undesirable behaviour, judicial sentences should also be imposed in a manner which positively instills the basic set of communal values shared by all Canadians expressed by the Criminal Code.Regardless of how one explains denunciation, it is an expressive goal. Denunciation signifies a communal message about the gravity of the offence in general or the gravity of a particular offence as shaped by a characteristic of the offender. The goal of the expressive message is to promote fundamental values. It may only remind us of how we condemn certain conduct. Since denunciation is about moral education, a corollary to condemnation may include aspects of responsibility, remorse and reparation.For conditional sentences, the issue is when must the denunciatory message be accompanied by a fully-executed term of imprisonment so as not to diminish the objective. ...Professor Manson assesses this issue and the existence factors of which would ameliorate the need for the expression of a denunciatory message through a fully-executed sentence of imprisonment.[33] I conclude that there are factors present in this case, which I have already described as the mitigating factors, which ameliorate the need for expressing the denunciatory message, which still needs to be expressed, through a fully-executed sentence of imprisonment. It needs to be recognized that A.M.M. was written by the Appeal Division before the conditional sentencing provisions came into being. The principle of A.M.M. can still be honoured and invoked regarding denunciation and general deterrence. The criminal law requires the sentencing judge to take into consideration the principles and factors whichParliament has expressly stated in the principles of sentencing; denunciation and deterrence can still be given a pre-eminence.In my opinion, the objectives of general deterrence and denunciation can be met in this case without resorting to jail for this particular offender.[34] I conclude that the circumstances of the offence and the offender here are such that a conditional sentence should be imposed. Therefore, the offender will serve his sentence of 1-1/2 months imprisonment in the community, subject to his complying with the following conditions:[35] The following conditions, which are prescribed by s. 742.3(1), apply.The offender shall do all of the following:(a)keep the peace and be of good behaviour;(b)appear before the Court when required to do so by the Court;(c)report to his conditional sentence supervisor(i)within two working days, and(ii)thereafter, when required by the supervisor and in the manner directed by the supervisor;(d)remain within the jurisdiction of the Court unless written permission to go outside that jurisdiction is obtained from the Court or the supervisor; and(e)notify the Court or the supervisor in advance of any change of name or address, and promptly notify the Court or the supervisor of any change of employment or occupation.Regarding condition (d), the offender may go outside the jurisdiction only in the course of his employment, and only as necessary to retain his job, upon prior notification in writing by the offender and his employer to the offender's conditional sentence supervisor, and provided that the period of time outside the jurisdiction does not exceed 48 hours per assignment.[36] The following additional conditions are prescribed pursuant to s. 742.3. The offender shall:(f)remain in his own home between 7:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. each day, except when occupied during those hours in the course of his employment as certified in writing in advance by his employer and submitted to his conditional sentence supervisor;(g)refrain from any contact, either direct or indirect, with the victim, and refrain from attending at any place of residence of the victim;(h)when not in his home, carry a copy of the Conditional Sentence Order with him and produce it on request for identification to any peace officer;(i)undergo such assessment, counselling or treatment for any personal, behavioural, or mental health problem which may have led to this offence, as may be prescribed by his conditional sentence supervisor in consultation with the appropriate professional counsel, including participation in a sexual deviance therapy program if so directed.Victim Fine Surcharge:[37] The offender shall pay a Victim Fine Surcharge in the prescribed amount of $35.Restitution:[38] The offender shall pay restitution in the amount of $100 for the loss of victim's clothing.Probation:[39] During the period of probation following completion of the sentence of imprisonment being served in the community, the offender shall(1)Keep the peace and be of good behaviour.(2)Appear before the Court when required to do so by the Court.(3)Report to his probation officer when required and in the manner directed by the probation officer.(4)Remain within the Province of Prince Edward Island unless written permission to leave the province is obtained from the Court or his Probation Officer/Supervisor. The offender may leave the province during probation in the course of his employment.(5)Notify the Court or his Probation Officer/Supervisor in advance of any change of name or address, and promptly notify the Court or his Probation Officer/Supervisor of any change of employment or occupation.(6)Refrain from any contact, either direct or indirect, with the victim and refrain from attending at any place of residence of the victim.(7)Undergo such assessment, counselling or treatment for any personal, behavioural, or mental health problem which may have led to this offence, as may be prescribed for you by his conditional sentence supervisor in consultation with the appropriate professional counsel, including participation in a sexual deviance therapy program if so directed.__Justice David H.

J. Donohue, J.Overview[1]Mr. K.G. stands to be sentenced after conviction on one count of invitation to sexual touching of a person under the age of 16 contrary to s. 152 C.C.C., Count 1, and one count of attempt to obtain sexual services of a person under the age of 18, contrary to s. 212(4) C.C.C, Count 2.[2]A sentencing hearing took place on September 17, 2015.These are the reasons for the sentence imposed in the circumstances of this case.The FactsCircumstances of the Offence[3]Mr. K.G. telephoned the daughter, M.M., of his friend and co-worker a number of times.In the conversations he offered to pay money for the purchase of dirty panties from her or her friends as well as “extras” which involved sexual acts.[4]Mr. K.G. was aware that M.M. was 14 years of age and that her friend was 15 years of age.[5]Three of the telephone calls were recorded, detailing exactly what was said. Mr. K.G. testified that the conversations were not real and were only intended to be role-playing to warn her of the dangers of chat lines.[6]I found that the discussions were real and Mr. K.G. intended the actions he proposed in these conversations with M.M.Circumstances of the Offender[7]Mr. K.G. is 53 years of age.He is currently married with one 13 year old daughter. She has special needs that are severe.He also has two adult sons from his first marriage.[8]Growing up Mr. K.G. suffered physical abuse from step-fathers and sexual abuse from his older brother. He does not know who his real father is.[9]He left school at the age of 13.He largely did labouring jobs and then began his own home renovation business.He continues to do this work and finds being self-employed gives him flexibility for his daughter’s schedule.[10]Mr. K.G. smokes cigarettes and does not use illicit drugs.He has a drink after work and occasionally has up to seven drinks at a party.He has no substance abuse issues.[11]In connection with the offence he stated he was buying dirty underwear from women and assisting a lady who ran a dating service to sell them to male clients.Mr. K.G. maintains that he was trying to help this victim and explain about chat lines.He does not acknowledge what he did or show any remorse.[12]He advises that this will never happen again and he has no intention of doing anything.[13]He has met women through chat lines and had sex with them and continues to do so.[14]His sister in Texas and his business contact for renovations speak of him as a very loving father and they never had concerns about his behaviour.[15]Mr. K.G. was convicted of assault and served a year’s probation without any enforcement issues in 1997 to 1998.Right of Allocution[16]Mr. K.G. addressed the court stating that he wishes he could undo what happened five years ago.He said he was not a sexual offender but was “hooked on the chat line”.Impact on the Community[17]The impact of the offence of sexual offences against children was set out in R. v. M. (D.), 2012 ONCA 520 (CanLII), as the following:1.Our children are our most valued and are our most vulnerable assets.2.We as a society owe it to our children to protect them from the harm caused by sexual predators.3.Throughout their formative years, children are very susceptible to being taken advantage of by adult sexual offenders and they make easy prey for such predators.4.Adult sexual predators recognize that children are particularly vulnerable and they exploit this weakness to achieve their selfish ends, heedless of the dire consequences that can and often do follow.5.Three such consequences are now well recognized:a)Children often suffer immediate physical and psychological harm.b)Children who have been sexually abused may never be able as an adult to form a loving, caring relationship with another adult.c)Children who have been sexually abused are prone to become abusers themselves when they reach adulthood.6.Absent exceptional circumstances, in the case of adult predators, the objectives of sentencing, commonly referred to as denunciation, general and specific deterrence, and the need to separate offenders from society, must take precedence over the other recognized objectives of sentencing.[18]With such major and concerning impacts on children, the impact on the community of these offences is significant.[19]In so concluding, I wish to emphasize that when trial judges are sentencing adult sexual predators who have exploited innocent children, the focus of the sentencing hearing should be on the harm caused to the child by the offender's conduct and the life-altering consequences that can and often do flow from it. While the effects of a conviction on the offender and the offender's prospects for rehabilitation will always warrant consideration, the objectives of denunciation, deterrence, and the need to separate sexual predators from society for society's well-being and the well-being of our children must take precedence.Impact on the Victim[20]M.M. did not wish to provide a victim impact statement.There was no evidence in this regard for my consideration in sentencing.Legal Parameters[21]Count 1 is an indictable offence pursuant to s. 152 of the Criminal Code; invitation to sexual touching of a person under the age of 16.A person convicted of this offence is liable to imprisonment for a minimum term of 45 days and a maximum term of ten years.[22]Count 2 is an indictable offence pursuant to s. 212(4) of the Criminal Code; attempt to obtain sexual services of a person under the age of 18.A person convicted of this offence is liable to imprisonment for a minimum term of six months and a maximum term of five years.Positions of Crown and Defence[23]The Crown seeks a custodial two to three years as well as a DNA order, a SOIRA order for 20 years and a s. 161 parks and playground order (a) (b) and (c) for five years. The Crown agrees to an exception being made for contact between Mr. K.G. and his daughter.[24]In the alternative, if the Court ordered less than two years in custody, the Crown urges a probationary term of two to three years with counselling and a no contact, non-attendance order regarding anywhere M.M. is known to be.[25]The Crown described this as essentially a luring case, which was done by telephone, rather than the internet. The Crown submitted that Mr. K.G. was in a position of trust as M.M. referred to him as uncle.[26]The Defence position is a custodial sentence of six to nine months would be appropriate in the circumstances of this case plus a period of probation of two to three years.[27]The Defence submits there was no trust relationship but, if there was, it was at the low or light end of a trust relationship.M.M. did not often see or interact with Mr. K.G. and was never in a situation where they were alone.Case Law[28]The Crown relies on the following four submissions:Principles of Sentencing[29]In R. v. Woodward, [2011] O.J. No. 4216, 2011 ONCA 610 (CanLII)., the accused was convicted of sexual interference, inviting sexual touching, touching for a sexual purpose, attempting to obtain sexual services for consideration and sexual assault. He was convicted for luring a 12-year old girl via text message and sexually assaulting her. The complainant met the accused on an online dating site and led her to believe that he would pay her $200 million dollars to have sex with him. The complainant engaged in multiple sex acts with the accused one time. The accused received a global sentence of six-and-one-half years.[30]The Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed the accused’s appeals from his conviction and sentence. Like the trial court, the appellate court followed the sentencing principles in R. v. D.D., (2002), 2002 CanLII 44915 (ON CA), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 471. The court ruled that the R. v. D.D. sentencing principles were applicable to adult sexual predators who exploit children. According to the appellate court, “[t]hese sentencing principles include that the sentencing objectives of denunciation, general and specific deterrence and the need to separate offenders from society must take precedence over the other recognized objectives of sentencing” (para 39).[31]In R. v. D.M., [2012] O.J. No. 3616, 2012 ONCA 520 (CanLII)., the accused was convicted of sexual assault, sexual exploitation and inviting sexual touching. The accused was convicted for sexually assaulting his niece approximately 124 times for three years until she was 19 years old. The complainant moved from Fiji to live in Canada with her uncle, the accused. She was the accused’s dependent and she considered her uncle as equivalent to her father. The incident began with the accused touching her breast, then him touching her vagina, him asking her to touch his penis and eventually lead to sexual intercourse two or three times a week. The accused required the complainant to watch pornography. He threatened to deport her back to Fiji if she told anyone about these incidents. The trial judge imposed a sentence of three years.[32]The court of appeal determined that the trial judge made an error of law for setting the sentencing range too low. The trial judge should have referred to ss. 718.01 and .2 (ii.i) and (iii) of the Code which provides that where a child under 18 is sexually abused, the primary sentencing objectives are denunciation and deterrence. The provision also states that the fact that the abuser was in a position of trust is an aggravating factor. In considering the ss. 718.01 and .2 (ii.i) and (iii) principles, along with the fact that the accused was in a position of trust, the appellate court sentenced the accused to seven years.[33]In R. v. R.B., [2013] O.J. No. 278, 2013 ONCA 36 (CanLII)., the accused was convicted of sexual assault, sexual interference, inviting sexual touching and sexual exploitation. The accused’s conviction arose from repeatedly sexually abusing his niece when she was between 6 and 14 years of age. The misconduct progressed from touching to intercourse. He was sentenced for five year’s imprisonment comprised of four concurrent sentences: five years imprisonment for sexual assault, one year concurrent for invitation to sexual touching and four years concurrent for sexual exploitation.[34]The accused appealed his conviction and sentence. The accused was a permanent resident of Canada and a five year sentence would have him deported to his home country, El-Salvador. He requested that the totality of the sentence be apportioned differently from the trial judge. He requested a maximum sentence of two years less a day for any of the counts 1, 3 and 4, but to have them run consecutively to maintain a total sentence of five years imprisonment. The appellate court found that if they were to adopt the accused’s submissions, the overall principles and objectives of sentencing would still be addressed and would continue to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence. However, his appeal was still dismissed.[35]The proper approach to applying the principal of totality is to identify the accused’s most serious offence. Next the court must determine the total sentence so that each offence adds up to the total sentence. The court can then decide whether a sentence should be consecutive or concurrent to the other sentences imposed. The court found that the most serious part of the accused’s offence was the sexual assault of his niece (count 1). The court followed R. v. D.M. (above) which ruled that that the proper range of sentence for prolonged sexual abuse and assault of a child by a person in a position of trust is five to six years in the penitentiary. In following R. v. D.M. the court decided that the accused’s sentence could not run for two years less a day concurrently. Such a sentence would be “inadequate or artificial” (para. 31).Position of Trust: Aggravating Feature[36]In R. v. Manjra, [2009] O.J. No. 2484, 2009 ONCA 485 (CanLII)., the accused was convicted of sexual interference for removing a seven-year-old girl’s pants and underwear and licking her private parts when she visited his home. The accused was the complainant’s neighbour. The accused was sentenced with 17 month’s imprisonment and 24 months’ probation. The trial judge characterized the offence as a breach of trust because the accused lived next door to the complainant and the complainant had visited the accused many times before.[37]The accused appealed his conviction and sentence. The accused argued that the trial judge erred in principle by characterizing the circumstances of this case as a breach of trust and by characterizing the breach of trust as an aggravating factor. His appeal was dismissed.[38]The appellate court reasoned that the judge was entitled to characterize the relationship between the accused as an aggravating factor. The trial judge was also entitled to characterize the relationship between the parties as one at the low end of a trust relationship. The accused and complainant were not strangers. The court agreed that when the complainant called the accused “uncle”, she used the term generically. However, the court took into account that the complainant was a seven-year-old girl visiting the accused’s house. The court also considered the fact, from the accused’s testimony, that he gave the complainant and other children popsicles. The court held that that the sentence imposed was within the range for the offence, even for a first time offender.[39]The Defence relies on the following submission:[40]In R. v. Wasser, [2007] O.J. No. 2503, 74 W.C.B. (2d) 306, the accused was charged and convicted of obtaining the services of a female under the age of 18 years for consideration. He was charged and found not guilty of six other charges including similar charges at different time periods, sexual assault and making child pornography. The accused arranged a bondage session through an adult chat line with a 16-year-old girl, D.B. He was unaware that D.B. was a minor. The accused attended a rooming house with rope, a blindfold, alcohol and candy. With the encouragement of D.B.’s friend G.O., he bound D.B., groped her, and engaged in other sexual activity short of intercourse.[41]The accused served 31 days in pre-trial custody and was on judicial interim release for ten months. Three of his months on judicial interim release were under stringent conditions.[42]The incident was characterized by the court as an isolated “aberration” (para. 21) that did not involve a breach of trust or abuse under s. 718.2(a)ii of the Criminal Code. The court describes the accused as “a man under extraordinary stress taking an uncharacteristic step of calling a chat line. He allowed events to overtake him once he spoke with G.O.” (para.20).[43]The accused was sentenced to 62 days of imprisonment and 12 months of probation with conditions. His sentence amounted to time already served.[44]Justice Kiteley’s reasons for the sentence emphasized the objective of denunciation. The court determined that ordering a period of incarceration effectively denounced the accused’s behaviour. The court was not concerned about the sentencing principles of deterrence or rehabilitation since the accused had accepted responsibility for his actions and was ashamed of his behaviour.[45]The trial judge considered there to be other mitigating features including the accused’s active contributions to his workplace, family and religious community. The accused was a well-like man. After losing his job at York University in the engineering faculty, he had since started his own business that merged his engineering and business skills.He was married with three daughters and had all of his family’s support.[46]It is noted that this decision preceded the current minimum prescribed punishments. The decision suggests such acts are not abuse under s. 718.2a(ii.1).I did not understand from the defence that they were arguing that these phone calls and invitations did not amount to abuse of M.M.Mitigating and Aggravating Factors[47]There are a mitigating factors in this case.[48]Mr. K.G. is a loving father of a severely challenged 13 year old daughter.He has a good, steady, work record.He is the sole bread-winner of the family.[49]Mr. K.G. had one prior criminal conviction 17 years ago but he has never been convicted of a similar offence to these charges.[50]There was no actual face to face meeting between Mr. K.G. and M.M.[51]There are also aggravating factors in this case.[52]Mr. K.G. was in a position of trust in relation to the complainant. He was the complainant’s father’s best friend. Mr. K.G. was treated as an uncle by the complainant. He testified that the complainant was like a niece to him; she called him “Uncle R..” This abuse of trust is an aggravating factor.[53]During the commission of the offences, Mr. K.G. emphasized to the complainant the need for secrecy. He told her not to tell anybody. In abusing his position of trust, this is a further aggravating factor; if the complainant had complied with Mr. K.G.’s requests these crimes may not have been revealed.[54]During the commission of the offences, Mr. K.G. attempted to involve her young friends in these acts.Principles of Sentencing[55]The Criminal Code sets for the purpose and principles of sentencing:718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:(a)a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,(b)a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances[56]In cases of invitation to sexual touching of a person under the age of 16, and attempts to obtain sexual services of a person under the age of 18, the strongest principle in sentencing is denunciation, general and specific deterrence: R. v. Woodward, supra.Reasons[57]For Count 1, the legislation mandates a 45 mandatory minimum sentence of incarceration. For Count 2, the legislation mandates a six month mandatory minimum sentence of incarceration.[58]These charges are Mr. K.G.’ first offence of this kind and he has not been before the courts in over 17 years. There has been no incident since these charges, over a five year period.[59]I understand that there was no pre-sentence custody.[60]I consider that the seriousness of these offences is mitigated by the fact that they were brief conversations over a few days. The offence is in the conversations.I agree that the trust relationship could not be emphasized here as Mr. K.G. had never provided care or been alone with M.M.[61]In light of a careful consideration of both the mitigating and the aggravating factors, this court sentences Mr. K.G. to one year imprisonment on count 1, one year imprisonment on count 2, to be served concurrently.Ancillary Orders[62]Section 490.012 (1) of the Code mandates an order requiring the person convicted of a “designated offence” to comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act. Child pornography under s. 163 of the Code is a “designated offence” under s. 490.011(a).As Mr. K.G. has been convicted of two separate “designated offences,” he is required to comply with this order for life, pursuant to s. 490.013(2.1) of the Code.[63]The Crown and Defence agree that there is to be a DNA authorization pursuant to s. 487.051(1) of the Code. This order will issue.[64]Pursuant to s. 737(2)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code, individuals are requiredto pay a victim surcharge of $200 for each indictable offence per offence.Mr. K.G. has been convicted of two separate indictable offences and is, therefore, required to pay a total victim surcharge of $400. Pursuant to Order in Council No. 2173/99 of the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, Mr. K.G. shall pay the victim surcharge within 90 days of his release from custody.[65]I order pursuant to s. 161(1) of the Criminal Code which prohibits Mr. K.G., for a period of five years, from:(a) attending a public park or public swimming area where persons under the age of 16 years are present or can reasonably be expected to be present, or a daycare centre, school ground, playground or community centre;(b) seeking, obtaining or continuing any employment, whether or not the employment is remunerated, or becoming or being a volunteer in a capacity, that involves being in a position of trust or authority towards persons under the age of 16 years;(c) having any contact - including communicating by any means - with a person who is under the age of 16 years, unless the offender does so under the supervision of a person whom the court considers appropriate; with the exception of contact with his daughter.[66]I order a term of probation following his release from custody for a period of two years with counselling for Mr. K.G..[67]Mr. K.G. is to have no contact with M.M. during the period of his probation.Final Decision[68]Accordingly, I order Mr. K.G. to serve a one year custodial sentence for each offence he was convicted of; one year for count 1, and one year for count 2, to be served concurrently. On his release, he will be subject to a probationary period for two years, with the conditions set out above. I order a DNA order, a lifetime SOIRA order and a s. 161(1) order with the exception noted above.___________________________M. J. Donohue, J.Released: October 2, 2015CITATION: R. v.

IntroductionAt the completion of a seven-day trial, I found Mr. Bisram guilty of sexually assaulting S.H.on July 23, 2013, and also thereby breaching a probation order to which he was subject at the time that required him to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.These are my reasons for sentence with respect to these two offences.II. Circumstances of the OffencesThe circumstances surrounding the commission of these offences are set out in some detail in my reasons for judgment.See R. v. Bisram, 2014 ONCJ 644 (CanLII).As a result, only the briefest of summaries is necessary for the purpose of these reasons.In the summer of 2013, Mr. Bisram and Ms. H. both frequented the park that is situated immediately behind the Westwood Mall in the City of Mississauga.There is a beer store close by and the park is where a fair number of people routinely gather, especially in the summer months, mainly to drink.It was at the park that Mr. Bisram and Ms. H. met.Their shared interest in drinking in the park provided the impetus for a friendship.On the afternoon of July 23, 2013, Mr. Bisram and Ms. H. were both in the park, and at least for the period immediately preceding the offences, drinking together.Ms. H. had more to drink that afternoon than Mr. Bisram and she eventually passed out underneath a tree.She was so drunk that afternoon that she apparently failed to pull up her underwear and tights after urinating but before losing consciousness.Mr. Bisram, who was drunk and had an unrequited sexual interest in Ms. H., sexually assaulted Ms. H. while she was unconscious by having intercourse with her.The assault was interrupted when a security guard from the mall happened past in his car and was so alarmed by what he saw that he dispatched two colleagues to investigate.On their approach, Mr. Bisram stopped having intercourse with Ms. H. and scrambled to pull up her underwear and tights so that his crime would go undetected.However, DNA evidence served to establish that the security guards were justified in their suspicions and that there was nothing innocent about the interaction they had observed between Mr. Bisram and Ms.H.In short, Mr. Bisram had sex with Ms. H., without her consent, while she was passed out drunk and in an extremely vulnerable state.As a result, Mr. Bisram sexually assaulted Ms.H.At the time, Mr. Bisram was on a probation order for the offence of aggravated assault which was imposed following his conviction for that offence on May 6, 2013.The probation order included a condition that he “keep the peace and be of good behavior”.Quite obviously, by sexually assaulting Ms. H., Mr. Bisram breached that condition.Tragically, Ms. H. passed away in October 2013, apparently from an overdose.Consequently, I do not have the benefit of a victim impact statement that would explain the effect these crimes had upon her.Despite this, I think I can fairly say that it is extremely sad that Ms. H.’s last few months of life would have been marred by the knowledge that she had been violated by Mr. Bisram, someone she considered to be a friend.III. Circumstances of the OffenderMr. Bisram is 41 years old.He is originally from Guyana, where he grew up the youngest of four children.He reports a normal childhood with the exception of the suicide of an older stepbrother.Mr. Bisram immigrated to Canada at the age of 18 or 19.He came to Canada to marry his wife, who was Canadian.The marriage did not last and the couple was divorced after a year.Not long after his divorce, Mr. Bisram married again.He and his wife had one child, a son, who is now 12 years old.Unfortunately, after 14 years that marriage also came to an end.I understand that Mr. Bisram continues to maintain a close relationship with his son.He sees his son at least once per week and speaks to him at least every day.Until 2010, Mr. Bisram was gainfully employed.Over the years he has held a variety of warehouse and factory jobs.However, a workplace accident resulted in nerve and muscle damage to his left arm and he has been receiving benefits ever since from the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board.Three years ago Mr. Bisram fell while at home and struck his head on the edge of a countertop.The resulting injury was severe.Mr. Bisram had to be flown to St. Michael’s Hospital where he had brain surgery and remained in a coma for five days.Following his release from hospital, he spent a year at the Toronto Rehabilitative Hospital.It was during his stay in the rehabilitative hospital that he was also diagnosed with epilepsy, a condition that he manages with medication.Mr. Bisram has a criminal record which is as follows:May 5, 2000 – impaired driving for which he received a $600 fine and a one-year driving prohibition.February 2, 2012 – assault with a weapon for which he received a suspended sentence and was placed on probation for one year and was subject to a section 110 weapons prohibition for 10 years.May 6, 2013 – aggravated assault and breach of probation for which he received a suspended sentence having been credited for 98 days of pre-trial custody and was placed on probation for 2 years and subject to a section 109 order.A DNA order was also made.It is clear from the pre-sentence report filed as an exhibit at the sentencing hearing that Mr. Bisram is a severe alcoholic.Alcohol has played a significant and negative role in his life for a number of years.His alcoholism would appear to have played a major role in the breakdown of his marriage and in his past involvement with the criminal justice system.In my view, alcohol also played a contributing role in Mr. Bisram’s commission of the offences before the court.I have no doubt that in his drunken state, Mr. Bisram was more uninhibited and therefore more inclined towards committing the offences to which I found him guilty.Unfortunately, Mr. Bisram has not yet succeeded in addressing his addiction and achieving lasting sobriety.Although he did participate in a residential treatment program some years ago, his struggles with alcohol persist.It is troubling that despite all of the misery and misfortune that alcohol has brought into Mr. Bisram’s life, he reported to the author of the pre-sentence report that he does not “consider his drinking problematic”.That said, I take some comfort in the fact that at least to his defence lawyer, Ms. Jalali, Mr. Bisram acknowledged that he is an alcoholic.Quite obviously, acknowledging that there is a problem is an important and foundational step towards finally addressing it.Lastly, I note that as he did during his evidence at trial, Mr. Bisram continues to maintain his innocence with respect to the crime for which I found him guilty.IV.Positions of the PartiesOn behalf of the Crown, Ms. Norman argues that the range of sentences established by the case law for sexual assault involving intercourse with an unconscious victim is between two and four years.In arguing in favour of the upper end of the range, Ms. Norman submits that there are plenty of aggravating features in this case and no apparent mitigating considerations.In that regard, Ms. Norman emphasizes that Mr. Bisram was friends with the victim and therefore the crime involved a breach of trust, at least of sorts.That said, Ms. Norman admits that this is not a breach of trust of the kind recognized in the sentencing case law.For example, parent to child, doctor to patient, teacher to student, employee to employer, et cetera.Nevertheless, Mr. Bisram was friends with Ms. H. which Ms. Norman submits is an aggravating consideration.Further, Ms. Norman points to Ms. H.’s extremely vulnerable condition, which Mr. Bisram exploited for his own sexual gratification, as a further aggravating factor.In addition, as a result of Mr. Bisram’s actions, Ms. Norman argues that Ms. H. was seen in a state of partial nudity by a number of other men, an experience that must have been most humiliating.Given all of this, Ms. Norman argues that the primary sentencing objectives should be denunciation as well as both specific and general deterrence.With respect to general deterrence, Ms. Norman argues that those who might consider preying on young women who are vulnerable due to the consumption of intoxicants must be deterred from doing so.On behalf of Mr. Bisram, Ms. Jalali submitted time served was the appropriate disposition.On March 30, 2015, when sentencing submissions were heard, by my calculation that was just shy of 12 months’ imprisonment.With enhanced credit at the rate of 1.5 to 1, that would equal a total sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment.In making her submissions, Ms. Jalali does not engage with either the aggravating or mitigating features of this case, or even the general principles and objectives of sentencing.Rather, she goes directly to the case law.In her submission, when one peruses the precedents it is clear that a further period of incarceration is simply not warranted.In that regard, she implicitly relies upon Section 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code which provides, “A sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.”In short, the defence submits that Mr. Bisram has already served his sentence and that the only appropriate disposition at this stage is one of time served.V.Law and AnalysisThe Criminal Code provides that the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute to “respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society”.See section 718.This is accomplished by imposing “just sanctions” that reflect one or more of the traditional sentencing objectives; denunciation, general and specific deterrence, separation of offenders, rehabilitation, reparation to victims, and promoting a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledgement of the harm done to the victims and the community.See subsections 718(a) through (f).The fundamental principle of sentencing is that the sentence imposed must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.This long established tenet of the sentencing process is now expressly contained in the Criminal Code, see section 718.1, and also recognized as a principle of fundamental justice constitutionally guaranteed by section 7 of the Charter.See R. v. Ipeellee, 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII) at paras. 36-37, and R. v. Anderson 2014 SCC 41 (CanLII) at paras. 21-22.To satisfy this requirement, a sentence must “fit” both the seriousness of the crime and the offender’s level of moral blameworthiness in its commission.See Hamilton and Mason (2004), 2004 CanLII 5549 (ON CA), 186 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at para. 90 (Ont. C.A.).I am, of course, mindful of the governing sentencing principles and objectives.In that regard, in this case, bearing in mind the circumstances of these offences, I agree with Ms. Norman that denunciation and deterrence are especially important sentencing objectives.In terms of denunciation, the sentence imposed must express the court’s disapprobation for the crimes committed by Mr. Bisram.At the time, Mr. Bisram was already on probation and bound by a term that he keep the peace and be of good behaviour.That order had only been in effect for little more than two months when Mr. Bisram exploited Ms. H.’s extreme vulnerability for his own sexual gratification.At the time, Mr. Bisram would have been under no delusions about how Ms. H. felt about him.His sexual advances towards her had been rebuffed in the past.He knew she was not sexually interested in him.Despite this, when the opportunity presented itself, he violated her sexual autonomy and exploited her state of extreme vulnerability.Rather than assisting his drunken friend, he preyed upon her.In my view, this sort of conduct is extremely repugnant.The sentence imposed must send a clear message that women, especially when intoxicated and vulnerable, cannot be exploited for an offender’s sexual gratification.The sexual autonomy and dignity of women must be protected and the sentences meted out by courts dealing with offences of this nature must make clear that this sort of behaviour is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.Those who might contemplate such behaviour must recognize that it will attract severe consequences that are commensurate with the gravity of the violation upon the victim occasioned by such predatory conduct.Of course to this point, I have been focused on the gravity of the offences involved in this case.I must also address the degree of responsibility of the offender with particular regard to the objective of rehabilitation.In terms of mitigating features in this case, I frankly struggle to find any.Thankfully, there was no gratuitous violence used in the commission of this sexual assault.However, I do not see that as a mitigating consideration, just the absence of a potential aggravating feature and quite obviously any violence beyond the sexual penetration itself was unnecessary as Ms. H. was unconscious.In addition, Ms. H. remained unconscious throughout and only learned what had happened afterwards.So she thankfully was spared the ordeal of being conscious while she was being victimized, or awakening to Mr. Bisram sexually violating her.But again, I see this as the absence of a potential aggravating feature rather than a mitigating factor.For example, if the victim was to awaken and protest and the offender were to persist, I think this would be fairly treated as an aggravating consideration.The fact that Ms. H. remained unconscious simply does not lessen Mr. Bisram’s culpability.In fact, it could very well be the case that knowing that you had been victimized but not being cognizant of the exact circumstances could exacerbate the psychological and traumatic effects of such an assault in its aftermath.The fact that Mr. Bisram was drunk, in my view, serves as both a mitigating and aggravating feature.Mitigating because I accept that his faculties were impaired by alcohol which I think makes his actions less reprehensible than would be the case if they were the result of a sober and more calculating mind.Aggravating, in Mr. Bisram’s case at least, because alcohol seems to have been the catalyst for much of his past involvement with the criminal justice system and if not addressed, raises concerns about the ongoing threat he may pose to public safety.In that regard, I believe that rehabilitation remains an important sentencing objective in Mr. Bisram’s case.Unless and until he comes to terms with his alcoholism and stops drinking, his past pattern suggests he will continue to pose a threat of re-offending.Given this, I think it important to keep his alcohol abuse at the forefront as I consider his rehabilitation.Lastly, in terms of general principles I of course recognize and will adhere to the principle found in section 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code which provides, “A sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.”In that regard, I have carefully reviewed each of the cases that the parties brought to my attention as part of their submissions.I do not intend to review each in detail in these reasons.As is often the case, the search for the perfectly analogous sentencing precedent is somewhat elusive.Nevertheless, I think there are a couple decisions that are at least close enough to the facts of this case that they warrant some mention.In R. v. H.(H.), 2002 CanLII 41397 (ON CA), [2002] 158 O.A.C. 272 (C.A.), the Court of Appeal allowed a Crown sentence appeal against a conditional sentence of two years less a day that had been imposed by the sentencing judge.In that case, H.H. was the 18-year-old victim’s employer.He was found guilty of sexual assault following trial.The facts, in short, were that he managed to get the victim to his home using a pretext where he plied her with alcohol.The young woman eventually lost consciousness.At that point the respondent carried her to his teenage daughter’s bed where he proceeded to have vaginal intercourse with her.The victim awoke during the assault and tried to push him off, telling him to “get off”.She started to cry.He did not stop.The assault continued until the respondent was finished.For this offence, the Court of Appeal concluded that the conditional sentence imposed by the sentencing judge was “manifestly unfit” and indicated that in the circumstances “considering the nature of the crime and the personal circumstances of the offender, a custodial sentence was clearly called for and in our view a penitentiary term would have been appropriate.”Ibid. at paragraph 5.Despite the fact that the respondent had already finished serving his two-year conditional sentence, the Court of Appeal substituted a sentence of 18 months’ imprisonment.There are of course features of the offence in H.H. that make the crime in that case far more reprehensible than those here.The offender in that case set upon a deliberate course of conduct and did so while exploiting a position of power over the young complainant.In addition, the offender persisted in the assault even after the complainant awoke and pleaded with him to stop.In these respects, I think the sexual assault in H.H. was worse than the sexual assault here.Nevertheless, there are distinguishing features here with respect to Mr. Bisram.Namely, there is the fact that he was on probation at the time and that the order was just two months old when he committed these offences.Further, there is the fact that Mr. Bisram has a rather serious criminal record that includes prior acts of violence of increasing seriousness: assault with a weapon followed by aggravated assault and now sexual assault.More analogous, in my view, in terms of both the circumstances of the offence and the offender, is R. v. Laz-Martinez ONCJ 115.In that case following a preliminary inquiry, the accused plead guilty to sexual assault.The accused was an acquaintance of the victim.The accused had previously made advances towards the victim which had been rejected.On the night of the offence, the victim and the accused had been at a nightclub together.The victim invited a group of friends, along with the accused, back to her residence.The victim became rather drunk and was put to bed by some of her friends.The offender made his way to the victim’s bedroom where he had sex with her while she lay unconscious.One of the victim’s friends went to check on the victim and discovered the accused on top of her.Despite being interrupted, the accused refused to stop and continued the assault until he climaxed.Mr. Laz-Martinez, who was 32 at the time of sentencing, had only a very minor criminal record for breaching a recognizance.After being charged, Mr. Laz-Martinez took a number of positive steps towards his rehabilitation.He finally acknowledged a drinking problem and significantly reduced his alcohol consumption. He changed his pattern of friendships and his circle of friends and he became involved in a serious romantic relationship.Emphasizing the fact that Mr. Laz-Martinez was essentially a first offender who had committed a very serious offence involving violence, Justice Cole concluded that denunciation required a sentence of two years in the penitentiary.In my view, there are a number of factors that warrant an even longer sentence in the case of Mr. Bisram.First, Mr. Bisram is being sentenced for both breaching his probation order and for sexual assault.Subject to the principle of totality, I think the breach of probation warrants a consecutive sentence.Second, I note that Mr. Bisram has a prior criminal conviction for breaching a probation order.So this is his second breach.A fact that warrants a lengthier sentence in my view for purposes of both specific and general deterrence.Third, unlike Mr. Laz-Martinez, Mr. Bisram has a prior criminal record that includes prior acts of violence.Fourth, unlike Mr. Laz-Martinez, Mr. Bisram did not plead guilty and hence an acceptance of responsibility and an expression of remorse do not weigh in his favour in terms of mitigation.Fifth, unlike Mr. Laz-Martinez, Mr. Bisram has only very recently acknowledged his problem with alcohol and has yet to take any proactive steps of his own doing to address it.I think it is essential to Mr. Bisram’s rehabilitation that he finally come to terms with his alcoholism and do something meaningful about it.In light of all of these considerations, as well as the principles and objectives of sentencing already noted, I have concluded that the appropriate sentence for the sexual assault is three years’ imprisonment.In addition, I believe that the breach of probation warrants a sentence of three months’ imprisonment consecutive to the sentence for the sexual assault.This represents a total sentence of 39 months’ imprisonment.I turn next to a consideration of the credit to be given to Mr. Bisram for his time spent in pre-trial detention.Mr. Bisram was arrested on the date of his offences, July 23, 2013.He remained in custody until April 23, 2014 when I granted him bail.This is a period of nine months.Mr. Bisram was again arrested on June 25, 2014 and charged with breaching his recognizance and breaching the terms of his probation order.He remained in custody on those charges until August 18, 2014, when both charges were dismissed.This was a total additional period in custody of 83 days for which he is deserving of credit.Finally, on March 30, 2015, the date I heard submissions with respect to sentencing, the Crown applied for a revocation of Mr. Bisram’s bail.I granted that application.As a result, he has remained in custody since that day, a period of 38 days.In total, by my calculation then, Mr. Bisram has spent 13 months in pre-trial custody.I am mindful of the fact that in Ontario the conditions in holding centres where pre-trial detainees are held are comparatively harsher than the conditions one finds following the imposition of sentence when an offender is transferred to a correctional facility.I also recognize that an offender does not earn remission for periods spent in pre-trial detention, whereas remission and parole do ordinarily serve to reduce the amount of time an offender spends in actual custody serving a sentence.Therefore, in accordance with section 719(3.1), as it was interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Summers, [2014] S.C.C. 26, I am of the view that Mr. Bisram is entitled to enhanced credit for his 13 months of pre-trial detention at the rate of 1.5 to 1.He will therefore receive credit of 19.5 months towards his sentence.Given my conclusion that the total sentence appropriate for these two offences was one of 39 months’ imprisonment, giving Mr. Bisram’s 19.5 months of credit for his time spent in pre-trial custody, I impose a total sentence today of 19 months and 2 weeks of further imprisonment.I am making a specific recommendation that the sentence be served at the Ontario Correctional Institute so that Mr. Bisram can receive some much needed intensive treatment for his alcoholism.I will mark the warrant of committal to reflect that recommendation.In terms of ancillary orders, Mr. Bisram will be subject to a section 109 order for the rest of his life, and I am going to read the language of the order to him.Mr. Bisram, for the remainder of your life you will be prohibited from possessing any firearm, restricted firearm, crossbow, restricted weapon, ammunition or explosive substance.In addition, pursuant to section 487.051(4) a DNA order is mandatory as sexual assault is a primary designated offence.Therefore, I order that a sample of Mr. Bisram’s blood be taken today for inclusion of his DNA in the National DNA Databank.Finally, I order that Mr. Bisram be designated as a person convicted of a designated offence pursuant to section 490.011(1)(a) of the Criminal Code for a period of 20 years, and he will therefore be required to comply with the terms of the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for that period.Mr. Bisram, could you please stand up, sir?Do you understand the prohibition order that I have explained to you?You cannot have, for the rest of your life, firearms, crossbows, things of that nature.Do you understand?JAINARINE BISRAM:Yes, sir.THE COURT:You will abide by that?JAINARINE BISRAM:Yes, sir.THE COURT:Okay.And failure to abide by that is a separate serious criminal offence, do you understand?JAINARINE BISRAM:Yes, sir.THE COURT:All right.I hope you finally get treatment for your alcoholism, sir, and you actually find sobriety for everyone’s benefit.Thank you, counsel, I appreciate your careful and considered submissions and assistance with respect to this lengthy matter.MS. JALALI:Thank you, Your Honour.MS. NORMAN:Thank you.THE COURT:The victim fine surcharge applies.He will need, I guess, quite awhile to pay it.These are both indictable offences, the Crown proceeded by indictment.So what is it for each offence?Remind me, Madam Clerk, is it....CLERK REGISTRAR:Oh, it’s — for indictable it’s $200.THE COURT:So it’s $400.I’m going to specify that he have three years to pay it, all right?MS.

Hutchings, 2012 NLCA 2.STATUTES CONSIDERED: The Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C., 1985.JUDGMENT OF GORMAN, P.C. J.(SENTENCE)INTRODUCTION:[1]On July 11, 2015, Mr. Adams robbed Senior’s Seaside Take Out in Garnish, while possessing a knife, contrary to section 344(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985.On March 12, and April 29, 2015, Mr. Adams stole gas from the Canadian Tire Gas Bar in Marystown, contrary to section 334(b) of the Criminal Code.The Crown proceeded by way of summary conviction in relation to the latter two offences.[2]The sole issue for determination is the imposition of an appropriate sentence for these offences. For the reasons that will follow, I have concluded that this is an appropriate case for the imposition of a period of forty-four months incarceration. Let me explain my reasons for this conclusion by commencing with a review of the circumstances of the offences committed by Mr. Adams.THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT THE SENTENCE HEARING[3]The sentence hearing commenced with Crown counsel summarizing the circumstances of the offences committed by Mr. Adams.(1) The Robbery:[4]Crown counsel described the circumstances involved in the following manner:On July the 11th, 2015 at approximately 21:51 hours, Burin Peninsula RCMP received a complaint of an armed robbery at Senior’s Seaside Takeout \u0026 Gas Bar in Garnish, Newfoundland and Labrador.Debra Normadin was working the cash when a black pickup truck pumped $60.01 worth of gas.A lone male entered the store and asked her about getting some food.She advised that the kitchen was closed.He grabbed a can of pop and a sub sandwich, laying them on the counter.Mr. Adams demanded that Ms. Normadin open the cash drawer.She complied. Mr. Adams grabbed an unknown amount of cash from the register consisting of Canadian paper currency.She observed a few 20 dollar bills hit the floor.Another employee came from the kitchen and the man ran from the store.A black truck was seen fleeing the scene back towards Garnish.The male was described about 5’6”, bald with a multicolored shirt.She described him as having a strong odor of liquor on him.Employees called the RCMP.While on route to the scene, police were looking for a black pickup truck.Constable Kennedy was travelling with lights and sirens to the scene and observed a truck on the Winterland Road heading away from the scene.The truck pulled over and shut off all the lights.Constable Kennedy passed the truck and thought it was suspicious.She backed up and initiated a traffic stop with the vehicle at 22:00 hours.She detected an odor of liquor immediately upon arriving at the driver’s window.When asked who was drinking, the vehicle passenger Chelsea Hodder advised she had been.Around this time Constable Kennedy heard a description of the male suspect over the radio and it was very similar to the vehicle driver, Roy Adams, except for the color of the shirt.Mr. Adams was brought to the police vehicle and arrested for armed robbery, read his rights to counsel and police caution at 22:26.Upon returning to the police vehicle, Constable Kennedy detected a strong odor of liquor from Adams and entered into an impaired driving investigation.She returned to the suspect vehicle and noted an open Bud Light beer bottle inside.Constable Kennedy asked Chelsea Hodder if there was anymore open liquor in the vehicle.Hodder advised there was not.She stated that any additional liquor would be inside the cooler in the back passenger seat of the truck.She advised police could look in the cooler if they wanted.Constable Kennedy lifted the lid and observed a large quantity of money strewn about inside the cooler. Constable Coady had arrived to the scene and arrested Chelsea Hodder as a party to the offence of armed robbery.She was secured in a separate police vehicle.At 22:39 she was advised of her reason to arrest.At 22:40 she was read her Charter rights and police caution.At 22:56 she was placed on the phone in the police vehicle with a Legal Aid lawyer in private.Constable Coady remained with the vehicle to keep continuity.It was towed to the Marystown detachment to perform a search incidental to arrest in the safety of the detachment.Ms. Hodder was lodged in one of the interview rooms.She provided a caution statement to Constable Kennedy.She denied knowledge of an armed robbery.She stated that she nor her or Adams work and they did not have any money except for a thousand dollars they were saving to move out west.Mr. Adams was brought to the Burin hospital for an unrelated medical reason.He was brought to the Marystown detachment and provided breath samples at 23:36 hours-- breath demand at 23:36 hours.23:47 he spoke with Mr. Donald A. MacBeath Q.C., and provided breath samples of 60 mg percent and issued a license suspension.A search inside the vehicle revealed $1590 worth of cash in the cooler.There were four $5 bills, five $10 bills, fifty-six $20 bills, four $50 bills and two $100 bills.The vehicle license plate was located inside the vehicle.There was no knife recovered.Ms. Hodder was transported to the Clarenville detachment and held for WASH court.Mr. Adams was held at the Marystown detachment.Initial caution statements were taken of both Adams and Hodder on July 12th.Mr. Adams initially denied being in Garnish, stated he was in Main Brook camping the whole night and identified Kerri Stoddard and Jenn Jorgensen as friends who were there.He claimed he worked and the money in the cooler was money he had saved up.He had it in his wallet but threw it in the cooler because he wanted to keep it there instead.Ms. Hodder also denied knowledge of the robbery.A statement was obtained from Jenn Jorgensen who confirmed they were together camping in Main Brook on July 11th.After leaving during the evening, she returned around 9:30 p.m.Hodder and Adams were gone.She described them as being very drunk and foolish.Hodder had made a comment about being the last party before they moved.Before leaving, Adams was interested in her being arrested for an armed robbery in Marystown and wondered about police questioning.Adams told her he had no money.She brought us beer from earlier that evening.A statement from Brandon Savoury confirmed that they were at Main Brook together on July 11th with Mr. Adams and Ms. Hodder.Everyone was having a good time with the campfire and drinking.Someone had gotten a flat tire, Adams took him out to fix it.At around 8 to 8:30 Adams and Hodder left.Before leaving, he heard Adams and Hodder speaking under their breath about an armed robbery.They left the camp, they did not return.They were talking about moving to Alberta.This was the first time he’d met Roy Adams.On July 15th, Debra Normadin, the clerk at Senior’s Seaside Takeout \u0026 Gas Bar, at the time of the armed robbery, did a photo lineup with Constable Collins.The process was video and audio recorded.While going through the photos she put aside #8 and continued through the photos.After comparing 8 and 1, Ms. Normadin looked at photo #8 and said this was the person who had robbed her.When asked why she recognized him she said he was the man who came into the store and robbed me.Photo #8 was Roy Adams.Following the photo lineup, she provided another statement to Constable Collins.On July 15th, Robbie Isaacs attended the detachment and provided a statement.He was camping in Main Brook with Hodder and Adams among others on July 11th.He got to Main Brook around 5:30 to 6.Baker, Jorgensen and Stoddard left to check on the dog around 7.Shortly after, Adams and Hodder took off saying they were going to the sandpit.He said around 8:30 or 9 he got a call that they’d been arrested for armed robbery.On July 20th, RCMP received a call that an open pocketknife was found on the front lawn of a residence in Garnish.Corporal Foley made a patrol and retrieved the same.Jo-Ann Grandy said her husband found it while out cutting grass on Saturday afternoon.It was located near the main road on the way out of Garnish on the right-hand side.It was exhibited by police.July 20th, Roy Adams said he wished to provide another statement.Constable McGrath took the statement at the Marystown detachment.It was audio and video recorded.Adams stated he wished to tell the truth about what happened.He told the police that they went to Main Brook and set up their tents.He and Chelsea Hodder went to the road as someone needed help to get a tire changed and then they both went back to Main Brook.Jenn Jorgensen left the campsite for some reason.He was getting low on cigarettes so he stated he and Chelsea were going to get cigarettes.They wondered about the closest place to get cigarettes and they decided to go to Garnish.While heading to the store he noticed he was low-- in the truck, in gas.He pulled up to the pump. He did not have much money. He had only enough for gas and smokes.He put $60 in the truck and went into the gas station.He had no intention at the time but he was drinking vodka and described it as his poison.He asked the lady if the kitchen was open, the lady said that the kitchen was closed.He got a sub and a Pepsi and he thinks he laid the items on the counter.There were people in the store buying slushies.Something came over him.The people left, he had a knife in his pocket.He was hurting for money and he was down and out.He walked around the counter, and said to Missus: “Open the fuckin’ till.”She looked at him surprised, they were face to face.The knife was at his side.He said he didn’t lay a hand on her, his intention was to get the money.The lady stepped back, she opened the till. He told her this is a robbery.There was a five gallon bucket the lady sat on, put her head in the hands.He took the money from the till and shoved it in his jacket pocket.He heard the other misses come in so he left.Chelsea had no clue what he was doing.He stated as far as she knew he was paying for gas.He ran out and jumped in the truck and then told her he had robbed the store.The truck was pointed towards Frenchman’s Cove when he left the scene, he turned the truck and fled towards Garnish.He was driving towards Winterland and Chelsea was stating she had to pee.He stopped the truck, Chelsea peed and got back in the truck.He started the truck and saw the police.He didn’t know what to do so he threw the money in the cooler and put the lid on it.The officer asked why the plate was off the truck.He described a knife matching the description of the one located in Garnish.He said he wasn’t sure but he thinks he threw it out the window on the highway coming back from Garnish.He told Chelsea to put the window down and he threw the knife out.He was adamant that he’d never touched the lady or put her in a headlock.He showed remorse during the interview, he said he decided to tell the truth because he felt remorse for the lady in the store and he felt Chelsea should not be away from her son.A Summary:[5]In summary, the facts referred to by Crown counsel in relation to the armed robbery establish that on July 11, 2015, Mr. Adams entered the Senior’s Seaside Takeout \u0026 Gas Bar in Garnish.Mr. Adams had a knife in his hand and was face to face with Ms. Normadin.Earlier, Mr. Savoury heard Mr. Adams speaking to Ms. Hodder about an armed robbery.[6]Mr. Adams grabbed money ($1,590.00) from the cash register and left the takeout.Mr. Adams subsequently threw the knife out of the truck’s window.(2) The Two Thefts of Gas:[7]On March 12, 2015, Mr. Adams stole $114.63 worth of gas from the Canadian Tire Gas Bar in Marystown.On April 29, 2015, he stole an undisclosed amount of gas from the same gas bar.THE VICTIM IMPACT EVIDENCE[8]The owner of the take out (Ms. Carol Senior) filed a victim impact statement.Ms. Senior indicates that she is “very nervous” since the robbery occurred and worries for her employees.She has had “sleepless nights thinking about [the robbery] and what could have happened.”[9]In R. v. Lundrigan, 2012 NLCA 43 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal indicated that a “fit sentence” is one “that takes account of the circumstances of the offences and the offender.”THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER[10]I was not provided with any significant detail concerning Mr. Adams’ background or circumstances.Mr. Adams is twenty-four years of age.He has a criminal record.In 2004 and 2007, he was convicted of the offences of theft, failure to appear in court (two counts), impaired driving, and obstructing a peace officer.[11]Mr. Adams spoke on his own behalf.He took responsibility for the offences, expressed remorse and apologized to Ms. Normadin.THE PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[12]In R. v. Knott, 2012 SCC 42 (CanLII), it was held that \"the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code are meant to take into account the correctional imperative of sentence individualization.\"[13]In R. v. Berner, 2013 BCCA 188 (CanLII), the British Columbia Court of Appeal indicated that the “purpose of sentencing is to protect the public through sanctions a court imposes upon a person found guilty of committing an offence. Each codified objective of sentencing is designed to further the protection of the community.”[14]Section 718 of the Criminal Code states that the fundamental purpose of sentencing \"is to contribute...to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society.\"This is to be achieved by imposing sentences which have, among other objectives, the objectives of:-separating offenders from society, where necessary;-denouncing unlawful conduct;-general deterrence;-rehabilitation; and-the promoting of a \"sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims or to the community.\"[15]Section 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code states that \"a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.\"[16]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code states that any sentence imposed must be \"proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\"In R. v. Cluney, 2013 NLCA 46 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal, at paragraph 16, indicated that the “principle of proportionality applies to sentencing for all criminal offences…The appropriate range of sentence is related to the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.”[17]In R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII), at paragraphs 12 and 53, the Supreme Court of Canada noted that the “more serious the crime and its consequences, or the greater the offender’s degree of responsibility, the heavier the sentence will be.In other words, the severity of a sentence depends not only on the seriousness of the crime’s consequences, but also on the moral blameworthiness of the offender...Proportionality is determined both on an individual basis, that is, in relation to the accused him or herself and to the offence committed by the accused, and by comparison with sentences imposed for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. Individualization and parity of sentences must be reconciled for a sentence to be proportionate.”The Supreme Court also indicated that the “credibility of the criminal justice system in the eyes of the public depends on the fitness of sentences imposed on offenders. A sentence that is unfit, whether because it is too harsh or too lenient, could cause the public to question the credibility of the system in light of its objectives” (at paragraph 3).[18]Section 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code indicates that a \"sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender.\" In R. v. Briand, 2010 NLCA 67 (CanLII), [2010] N.J. No. 339 (C.A.), the Court of Appeal stressed the importance of considering an offender's personal circumstances in applying section 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code.[19]Section 718.2(d) states that \"an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances\" and section 718.2(e) states that \"all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.\"[20]In Berner, the British Columbia Court of Appeal noted that broadly “speaking, a sentencing judge looks to the conduct and culpability of the offender and punishes the offender for that conduct through the application of the principles and objectives of deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation and proportionality.”THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIESTHE CROWN:[21]In relation to the robbery offence, Ms. Manning sought the imposition of a period of thirty-six months imprisonment.She also sought the imposition of a DNA order and a section 109 prohibition.[22]In relation to the two theft offences, Mr. Vavasour sought the imposition of a period of thirty days imprisonment, to be served on a consecutive basis.He also requested that a compensation order in the amount of $114.63 be issued.[23]In support of her position, Ms. Manning referred to the following decisions:(1) R. v. Power, [2006] N.J. No. 287 (S.C.), in which the offender pleaded guilty to the offence of armed robbery. The circumstances were described as follows:On October 29, 2005 at approximately 6:15 p.m., Jason Power entered Kavanagh's Fish and Chips at 31 Malta Street, St. John's, NL. Store clerk Tammy McCarthy was standing behind the cash register at the front of the store. Her boyfriend, Mark McDonald and father, Tom McCarthy, were also working that date. Tom McCarthy is the owner of Kavanagh's Fish and Chips.Jason Power entered the store through the front door and approached Ms. McCarthy and demanded money, saying 'give me the f ... g money'. Mr. Power was wearing a baseball cap and a 3/4 length jacket pulled up to partially obscure his face. Mr. Power took a knife out of his pocket and held it in his hand. He held it over the counter while demanding the money. Ms. McCarthy called out to her father. Mr. Power repeated 'just give me the f ... g money'. Ms. McCarthy handed over what she estimates to be approximately $200.00 in cash to Mr. Power. Mr. Power then fled out the front door.Justice Hall endorsed a joint submission requesting the imposition of a period of three years imprisonment.(2) R. v. Hutchings, 2012 NLCA 2 (CanLII), [2012] N.J. No. 12 (C.A.), in which the Court of Appeal indicated, at paragraph 104, that the “normal level of sentence for armed robberies of convenience stores-gas bars by a young person, masked, late at night where the money or merchandise taken is relatively small could range from three to five years.”(3) R. v. Kelly, [2013] N.J. No. 44 (P.C.), in which the offender grabbed a high school girl and dragged her into the woods, telling her to shut up when she screamed. The victim managed to escape with minor cuts to her legs and back.I imposed a period of thirty months imprisonment (also see R. v. Kelly, [2014] N.J. No. 42 (C.A.)).(4) R. v. Frampton, [2014] N.J. No. 8 (P.C.), in which the offender pleaded guilty to the offences of robbery, assault with a weapon, assaulting a peace officer, resisting arrest and related breaches of court orders.In relation to the robbery offence, the accused robbed a gas bar while holding a knife to the ribs of a customer. A period of three years and five months imprisonment was imposed, which included a period of three years for the robbery offence.(5) R. v. Bennett, [2014] N.J. No. 51 (P.C.), in which the offender pleaded guilty to the offence of robbery. I described the circumstances involved in the following manner:On January 18, 2013, Mr. King invited Mr. Bennett to participate in a robbery with him and Mr. Barron. Mr. King told Mr. Bennett that he knew where a substantial amount of drugs were being kept.Mr. Bennett and Mr. King went to Mr. Bennett's residence and retrieved a knife and a machete. They paid another person $20.00 to drive them to Mr. MacDonald's residence and to wait for them. All three of the offenders were wearing \"dark clothing.\"When they arrived at Mr. MacDonald's residence, Mr. Bennett and his two friends attempted to conceal their identities by pulling their shirts up over the lower part of their faces. Mr. King attempted to break into the front door of the residence, but was unsuccessful. He then smashed the window with the machete and he and Mr. Barron entered Mr. MacDonald's residence, assaulted him (he was struck in the head) and stole marihuana, prescription medication, cash and an Aurora Tablet. Mr. Bennett waited by the door. Mr. King passed the tablet to Mr. Bennett as he and Mr. Barron left the residence.The items stolen were shared equally and Mr. Bennett received the tablet.I imposed a period of five years imprisonment.(6) R. v. Marshall, [2015] N.J. No. 393 (S.C.), in which the offender pleaded guilty to the offences of armed robbery and attempted armed robbery.The offences involved the robbery and attempted robbery of two convenience stores while using a knife.Mr. Marshall drove the vehicle used in the offenses.Justice Handrigan imposed a period of thirty-six months imprisonment for the robbery offence and eighteen months imprisonment, concurrent, for the attempted robbery offence.MR. ADAMS:[24]On behalf of Mr. Adams, Mr. Evans submitted that a period of two years imprisonment would be appropriate. Mr. Evans referred to Mr. Adams’ plea of guilty, his age and his limited criminal record as mitigating factors.[25]In support of his position, Mr. Evans referred to R. v. Strickland-Murphy, [2014] N.J. No. 329 (P.C.).In Strickland-Murphy, the accused attempted to rob a pharmacy while armed with a knife. She was suffering from a number of serious mental disorders and addictions.Only three months earlier the offender finished serving two years in prison for armed robbery and was still on probation.A period of three years imprisonment was imposed.THE STATUTORY REGIME[26]The maximum penalty for the robbery offence committed by Mr. Adams is life imprisonment.THE RANGE OF SENTENCE[27]In Cluney, the Court of Appeal indicated that while sentencing ranges “are merely guidelines rather than hard and fast rules, a judge ordering a sentence outside the regular range should explain how it is in accordance with the principles and objectives of sentencing.”[28]In R. v. McLaren, 2015 BCCA 478 (CanLII), the British Columbia Court of Appeal, at paragraph 24, indicated that it “has been said many times that sentencing is a highly individualized process and that the range of sentence is just that – a range.”[29]The Supreme Court of Canada in Lacasse described sentencing ranges as being “primarily guidelines, and not hard and fast rules” (at paragraph 60).[30]In addition, in every case in which sentence is imposed, in this Province, the sentencing judge must initially determine if a “prescriptive” or “descriptive” range of sentence applies (see R. v. Johnston, [2011] N.J. No. 303 (C.A.)).SENTENCING PRECEDENTSRobbery:[31]In R. v. Lucas, [2012] N.J. No. 454 (P.C.), the offender committed a number of offences, including the offence of robbery.The circumstances of this offence were described by the trial judge in the following manner:The facts accepted by the court were that on September 8, 2012, at approximately 8:10 p.m., Mr. Lucas and a female entered the Sobeys Store, Topsail Road, St. John's. They went to the meat department and took six sterling silver T-Bone steaks to the value of $99.82 and attempted to leave the store without paying for same.He was approached by Sobeys staff member Glen Taylor. An altercation ensued. Taylor grabbed the accused by the arm. Security officer Renee Smith attended to assist Mr. Taylor. She advised Mr. Lucas that he was under arrest for theft and asked him to go back into the store.Mr. Lucas' response was to pull out a large knife. He screamed, \"I'm going to fucking kill you\" as he slashed out at Mr. Taylor, striking him on the arm with the knife. Taylor backed away from Mr. Lucas, who then went towards Ms. Smith waving the knife and saying, \"You're not going to be able to eat after this. I am going to fucking kill you.\" He then held the knife near Ms. Smith's head. Ms. Smith then backed away and Mr. Lucas left the store. Mr. Taylor suffered several lacerations to his left arm.[32]For the robbery offence, Judge Walsh concluded that a period of four years incarceration was an appropriate sentence.[33]In R. v. Bungay, [2014] N.J. No. 25 (P.C.), the offender pleaded guilty to two robbery offences, possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, having her face masked and a breach of a recognizance.The two robberies were described as follows:On the 21st of May, 2013, she entered the \"For Your Convenience\" store and demanded money from the clerk, Tina Porter. She was armed with a knife and had it visible in her hand. Ms. Porter gave her approximately $200.00. She fled from the scene in her vehicle disposing of the knife and later spending the money on cocaine. She was arrested the following day by the police as the vehicle she was driving was identified.On the 6th of December, 2013, Ms. Bungay entered \"CJ's Convenience\" store while disguised with a scarf wrapped around her face. She demanded money from the clerk, Gail Butters, but did not use or produce a weapon. Ms. Butters took two five dollar bills from the cash register and put them on the counter and at the same time pressed an alarm linked to the adjoining residence. Ms. Cindy O'Keefe and her partner Mr. Roger Hynes, the owners of the business, responded and entered the store. Ms. O'Keefe chased the accused out of the store with a baseball bat.[34]For the December 6 offence, Judge Orr concluded that a period of three years imprisonment was an appropriate sentence and for the May 21 offence, a period of eighteen months imprisonment.[35]In R. v. MacCauley, [2014] N.J. No. 70 (P.C.), the offender committed a number of offences, including two robberies.These were described in the following manner:On September 29, 2013, at the Esso station, the accused had been buzzed in to the station by the attendant. He pulled out a knife with a blade approximately 6 - 8 inches long and demanded all the money. He stole approximately $200.00.On October 4, the accused entered Family Drug Mart. He covered his face, went to the counter and pulled out a long knife from a Sobeys bag. He wanted to steal drugs.[36]For the September 29 offence, Judge Walsh concluded that a period of six years imprisonment was an appropriate sentence and for the October 4 offence, a period of eighteen months imprisonment.[37]In R. v. Lambe, [2014] N.J. No. 235 (P.C.), the accused pleaded guilty to the offences of robbery, theft, fraudulently obtaining food or lodging, and several breaches of court orders.The robbery involved the holding of a knife to the throat of a taxi cab driver.The accused had a prior criminal record that included a conviction for robbery.Judge Walsh imposed a period of four years imprisonment for the armed robbery offence and a period 180 days consecutive for the remaining offences.A credit of one day for each day spent in pre-sentence custody was granted on the basis that the accused was “not likely to have gotten bail based upon his record of breaches of court orders.”[38]In R. v. Squires, [2015] N.J. No. 20 (S.C.), the accused was convicted of the offences of robbery, having his face concealed, possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose, breach of probation, breach of undertaking, damage to property, and uttering a threat, contrary to sections 88, 145, 264.1, 344(a), 351, 430(4) and 733.1 of the Criminal Code.The offences involved the robbery of a store in which a knife was used. Judge Hall concluded that a period of five and one-half years imprisonment would be an appropriate sentence for the robbery offence.[39]In R. v. Gough, [2015] N.J. No. 362 (S.C.), the accused pleaded guilty to the offences of armed robbery, attempted armed robbery, two counts of disguising his face with intent and two counts of breach of probation.The robbery and the attempted robbery were described in the following fashion:Mr. Gough was in the company of Jerry Marshall in the late hours of Sunday, February 22, 2015. The two young men were riding in Jerry Marshall's blue 4-door Honda Civic. They drove to Cormack Mini Mart, near the intersection of Harbour Drive and the causeway leading to Random Island, NL. Mr. Marshall, who was driving, stopped a short distance from the Mini Mart and Mr. Gough left the vehicle and went to the store. Mr. Marshall stayed in his vehicle.Jordan Butt, a Mini Mart employee, was getting ready to close for the night, at around 10:40 pm, when Mr. Gough entered the store. Mr. Jordan said Mr. Gough was wearing a black hoodie, black pants, sneakers with white on them and had a black scarf around his face. Mr. Butt says Mr. Gough carried a long knife with gold on its handle, and he pointed the knife at Mr. Butt and demanded money from him.Mr. Butt says he grabbed Mr. Gough by the arm in which he was holding the knife and put his other hand on Mr. Gough's chest; and he pushed Mr. Gough back towards the door to the Mini Mart. Mr. Butt says he managed to get Mr. Gough out of the store and locked the door; although Mr. Gough broke the glass in the door after he did. Mr. Gough ran from the store without getting any money. Mr. Butt was not injured.Mr. Gough and Mr. Marshall then drove to the Circle K Convenience Store and Gas Bar at Goobies in Mr. Marshall's car. Mr. Gough entered the Circle K at approximately 11:42 pm and again Mr. Marshall stayed in his car. Mr. Gough was dressed as he had been at the Mini Mart and carried the same large knife. Mr. Gough demanded money and cigarettes from the Circle K store attendant and the attendant complied. Mr. Gough returned to Mr. Marshall's vehicle with approximately $600 in a cash can and a quantity of cigarettes. Mr. Marshall and Mr. Gough then headed west on the Trans-Canada Highway towards Clarenville.[40]Judge Handrigan imposed a global sentence of forty months imprisonment, which included a period of thirty-six months imprisonment for the robbery offence.A Summary of these Precedents:[41]All of these robbery offences involved the use of knives and the sentences ranged from three years imprisonment to six years imprisonment.Theft:[42] The range of sentence for minor thefts ranges from the imposition of a discharge to relatively short periods of imprisonment when the offender has related criminal record (see R. v. Crocker, [2015] N.J. No. 445 (P.C.), R. v. Roberts, [2015] N.J. No. 356 (P.C.), R. v. Crocker, [2015] N.J. No. 296 (P.C.), R. v. Basha, [2015] N.J. No. 71 (P.C.), R. v. Prowse (1998), 1998 CanLII 18024 (NL CA), 168 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 289 (N.L.C.A.), R. v. C.C., [2012] N.J. No. 121 (P.C.), R. v. Reid, [2012] N.J. No. 164 (P.C.), R. v. Roberts, [2013] N.J. No. 214 (P.C.), R. v. J.B., [2013] N.J. No. 218 (P.C.), R. v. Park, [2013] N.J. No. 244 (P.C.), R. v. Sutherland, [2013] N.J. No. 53 (P.C.), R. v. Durnford, [2014] N.J. No. 5 (P.C.), R. v. Courtney, [2014] N.J. No. 172 (P.C.), R. v. Bennett, [2014] N.J. No. 51 (P.C.), R. v. Sutherland, [2014] N.J. No. 228 (P.C.) and R. v. Jacobs, [2015] N.J. No. 3 (P.C.)).[43]In Lacasse, the Supreme Court of Canada held, at paragraph 57, that although sentencing ranges “are used mainly to ensure the parity of sentences, they reflect all the principles and objectives of sentencing. Sentencing ranges are nothing more than summaries of the minimum and maximum sentences imposed in the past, which serve in any given case as guides for the application of all the relevant principles and objectives. However, they should not be considered ‘averages’, let alone straitjackets, but should instead be seen as historical portraits for the use of sentencing judges, who must still exercise their discretion in each case.”Thus (at paragraph 58 of Lacasse):There will always be situations that call for a sentence outside a particular range: although ensuring parity in sentencing is in itself a desirable objective, the fact that each crime is committed in unique circumstances by an offender with a unique profile cannot be disregarded. The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a highly individualized exercise that goes beyond a purely mathematical calculation. It involves a variety of factors that are difficult to define with precision. This is why it may happen that a sentence that, on its face, falls outside a particular range, and that may never have been imposed in the past for a similar crime, is not demonstrably unfit. Once again, everything depends on the gravity of the offence, the offender’s degree of responsibility and the specific circumstances of each case.IMPOSING SENTENCE WHEN MULTIPLE OFFENCES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED[44]When an offender has committed multiple offences, the Court must determine an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider the totality principle of sentencing[45]In R. v. Hutchings, 2012 NLCA 2 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal indicated that after determining the individual sentences which should be imposed, the next step is to determine if the individual sentences imposed should be served on a concurrent or consecutive basis. The Court of Appeal suggested in Hutchings that the individual sentences imposed “should presumptively be imposed consecutively...”Similarly, in R. v. Crocker (1991), 1991 CanLII 2737 (NL CA), 93 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 222 (N.L.C.A.), it was held that “consecutive sentences should be imposed unless there is a valid reason not to do so.”ANALYSIS[46]Mr. Adams committed a robbery of a takeout/gas bar.The employees of such establishments are very vulnerable and the sentencing principles of deterrence and denunciation must be stressed.These offences can cause significant harm to store employees.This must have been an extremely frightening experience for the clerk in this case.[47]While committing the robbery, Mr. Adams used a knife.He stood face to face with the clerk while holding the knife at his side.Mr. Adams subsequently disposed of the knife.[48]In addition, Mr. Adams stole gasoline from a gas bar on two occasions.[49]Though the robbery offence committed by Mr. Adams is a very grave offence, I must also consider that he has pleaded guilty to the offence, he has expressed remorse and he has a limited criminal record.[50]I conclude that for the individual offences committed by Mr. Adams, the following sentences are appropriate:(1) for the robbery offence, a period of forty-two months imprisonment; and(2) for two theft offences, a period of thirty days imprisonment in relation to each offence.[51]I conclude that the periods of imprisonment for each of these offences committed by Mr. Adams should be served on a consecutive basis as they constitute separate and distinct offences.[52]This formulation would result in a period of forty-four months imprisonment being imposed.Is this excessive?The answer to this question requires a consideration of how the proportionality principle of sentencing is informed by the totality principle of sentencing.As pointed out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Khawaja, 2012 SCC 69 (CanLII), at paragraph 125, the totality principle of sentencing “requires that the cumulative sentence rendered for multiple offences not exceed the overall culpability of the offender.”TOTALITY[53]In Hutchings, the Court of Appeal indicated that section 718.2(c) of the Criminal Code “requires consideration of whether a combined sentence is unduly long or harsh ‘where consecutive sentences are imposed’. On its plain reading, this means that considerations of totality are engaged in all cases involving the potential imposition of consecutive sentences.”The Court of Appeal held that after determining an appropriate sentence for individual offences and then determining if those sentences should be served concurrently or consecutively, the next steps required are the following:The approach is to take one last look at the combined sentence to determine whether it is unduly long or harsh, in the sense that it is disproportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.In determining whether the combined sentence is unduly long or harsh and not proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender, the sentencing court should, to the extent of their relevance in the particular circumstances of the case, take into account, and balance, the following factors:(a) the length of the combined sentence in relation to the normal level of sentence for the most serious of the individual offences involved;(b) the number and gravity of the offences involved;(c) the offender's criminal record;(d) the impact of the combined sentence on the offender's prospects for rehabilitation, in the sense that it may be harsh or crushing;(e) such other factors as may be appropriate to consider to ensure that the combined sentence is proportionate to the gravity of the offences and the offender's degree of responsibility.[54]Considering the totality principle I must ensure that the total sentence is not a \"crushing one\" (see Hutchings, at paragraph 73).I must consider Mr. Adams’ age and his prior convictions.[55]I conclude that considering the nature of the offences committed by Mr. Adams that a period of forty-four months imprisonment is not unduly long or harsh, in the sense that it is not disproportionate to the gravity of the offences and his degree of responsibility. That leaves one final question: what about the pre-sentence custody?PRE-SENTENCE CUSTODY[56]Mr. Adams has been in custody for 186 days.The Crown properly concedes that a credit of 1.5 to 1 should be given for this period of pre-sentence custody.Thus, the sentence imposed is reduced by 279 days.A VICTIM SURCHARGE[57]Victim surcharges totaling $400.00 are imposed. These victim surcharges must be paid to the Provincial Court within thirty days of today’s date.A DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID ORDER[58]Section 344 of the Criminal Code is a \"primary designated offence.\" Therefore, section 487.051(2) of the Criminal Code applies.It indicates that the Court shall issue such an order unless the offender establishes that the \"impact of such an order on their privacy and security of the person would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest.\"Thus, an order in Form 5.03 is hereby issued.A WEAPON/AMMUNITION PROHIBITION[59]Section 109 of the Criminal Code requires that a weapon/ammunition be imposed for the commission of an indictable offence, for which the offender may be sentenced to a period of ten years imprisonment, and in which violence against a person was used or threatened. Thus, pursuant to section 109(2) of the Criminal Code a weapon/ammunition prohibition is imposed for a period of ten years after completion of the period of imprisonment imposed and for life pursuant to section 109(3) in relation to any restricted or prohibited items.RESTITUTION[60]Mr. Adams is not in a position at present to pay restitution.However, he is young and there is no reason to suspect that he will not be able to do so in the future.Accordingly, a restitution order is issued pursuant to section 738 of the Criminal Code for restitution to be paid to the Canadian Tire Gas Bar in Marystown in the amount of $114.63.CONCLUSION[61]For the reasons provided, Mr. Adams is sentenced to a period of forty-four months imprisonment, minus a pre-sentence custody credit of two hundred and seventy-nine days.[62]Judgment accordingly."}

(Oral):Patsy Aldridge is before me in relation to six counts to which she has entered pleas of guilty.There are two spousal assaults and four counts of failing to comply with court expectations.[2]All of these arose in the last few months, the first being January 4, 2009, at which point it appears Ms. Aldridge slapped her former partner, Mr. Mendelsohn, on the left cheek.She also, when he arrived to pick up their son -- I believe the two children involved are Ms. Aldridge’s from a prior marriage but are residing primarily with Mr. Mendelsohn at this point in time; is that right?[3]THE ACCUSED:Correct.[4]THE COURT:Okay.So it appears on this particular incident she slapped Mr. Mendelsohn on the left cheek.She was also yelling at him, followed him outside, exchanged words with his new partner, and there were a number of phone calls that she made to him that day.She was ultimately arrested by the police, advised them she had taken some 27 sleeping pills, and was taken to the hospital.[5]She was released on an undertaking to an officer and charged with a number of conditions, including no contact with Mr. Mendelsohn and his new partner and a condition that she report.It appears that on the 5th of January she had telephone contact with him contrary to that condition.She has not entered a plea to that count; it is entered as an aggravating factor.[6]On the 16th of February, 2009, the police were called to another altercation between Mr. Mendelsohn and Ms. Aldridge.Mr. Mendelsohn advised that she tried to strike him on a number of occasions, and she was observed by the RCMP to push him when they arrived.She was under the influence of alcohol, provided a breath sample of 286 milligrams percent, contrary to an abstain condition on her probation order.[7]She was released February 22nd, with conditions again requiring her to abstain, to have no contact with Mr. Mendelsohn and to report.She failed to report to a bail supervisor on March 4th as directed.She failed to attend court on March 9th as required.On the 21st of March, Mr. Mendelsohn called the RCMP to advise, firstly, that Ms. Aldridge had made a number of telephone calls to him, contrary to her no-contact condition, while he was at the Superstore assisting the children with fundraising.She then arrived in person to speak to him at the Superstore.He called security and she, ultimately, fled.[8]She has spent some 69 days in remand, which at the normal credit of one and a half to one would amount to approximately 105 days.Crown is seeking a global sentence of six to nine months, plus probation.Defence is suggesting a sentence that would amount roughly to time served plus a couple of weeks.[9]I should point out that Ms. Aldridge comes before the Court with a prior criminal record which includes some eight breaches of court orders, as well as a 2007 assault on the same complainant.As a result of the past history, I have some significant concerns about Ms. Aldridge and the risk that she presents, particularly to Mr. Mendelsohn.As her counsel has pointed out, the assaults, in terms of the actual behaviour, are on the lower end of the scale, but what concerns me is the pattern of behaviour.We now have, in a period of two years, three assaults on the same individual.[10]I am also significantly concerned about the fact that we have two children that have been exposed on an ongoing basis to violence and to arguments.There appears to have been a history of ongoing arguments.[11]Ms. Aldridge is now 35 years of age.It appears she herself was subjected to an abusive and alcoholic childhood, which resulted in her being removed and placed in foster care.She later married and had the two children, who are now 15 and five.Her husband died some four years ago, at which point Ms. Aldridge moved to the Yukon with the children, as her biological father was here.She met Mr. Mendelsohn and they entered into a relationship which ended approximately a year ago.As I have noted earlier, the children are currently with him, so there is ongoing contact as they transfer the children back and forth, and clearly that has not worked out well.[12]To Ms. Aldridge’s credit, she has entered pleas of guilty, which I have considered.She has also, while in custody, been attending AA, meeting with Dr. Heredia, meeting with Kate Hart, and has been employed cleaning.She indicates that she hopes to take advantage of programming here, including the 28-day residential ADS program, and then hopes to return to Hamilton.[13]Based on all of the information before me, I am satisfied, looking at the circumstances of the offences before me, looking at Ms. Aldridge’s history and record, that there does need to be a custodial response with respect to the charges before me.I am satisfied, in terms of the principles that I am required to consider, that in this particular case denunciation, given that the charges are spousal in nature, and deterrence, particularly specific deterrence, given the fact that Ms. Aldridge continues to behave in the same manner, are such that appropriate sentences would be as follows.[14]Dealing first with the 105 days credit.On the March 4th fail to report breach there will be a sentence of one day deemed served by Ms. Aldridge’s attendance in court today, and I would ask the record reflect that she is being credited for 30 days spent in remand.With respect to the March 9th fail to appear, there will be a sentence of one day deemed served by her attendance in court today, and I would ask that the record reflect she is being credited for 30 days in remand.With respect to the no-contact breach on March 21st there will be a sentence of one day deemed served by her attendance in court today, and I would ask that the record reflect she is being credited for the remaining 45 days spent in custody.[15]That leaves us with the two assaults and the probation breach.On the first of the assaults, dated January 4, 2009, there will be a sentence of 30 days consecutive to any other sentence being served.With respect to the second assault, on February 16, 2009, there will be a sentence of 60 days consecutive to any other sentence being served.With respect to the abstain breach there will be a sentence of 45 days concurrent.So that is an additional 90 days to be spent in custody.[16]With respect to the issue of probation, she is currently subject to an 18-month probation order, dated September 17, 2008, so that would run until February of 2010.I note, in looking at that order, that it is extremely comprehensive.There are a number of conditions that address virtually everything I would include in a probation order, in any event.So I am not of the view that it is necessary to place her on further probation.[17]Hopefully, Ms. Aldridge, once you get matters resolved and get into some programming, there will not be a need for you to be under court supervision anymore.I am not confident at this point in time that you are at that stage, given the frequency with which you have been returning, but I do not see utility, at this stage, in placing you on additional probation.[18]The Crown has also noted the possibility of a discretionary firearms prohibition and discretionary DNA order.I do not see any need at this point in time for there to be a DNA order.I do take the position there may be some value with a firearms prohibition for a couple of years, but, Mr. Van Wart, you did not make any submissions on that point.Do you have anything that you want to say?[19]MR. VAN WART:Only that the violence doesn’t seem to escalate --[20]THE COURT:No.[21]MR. VAN WART:-- other than a very low level of physical confrontation, so I would say it’s unlikely that it would escalate to a use of a weapon.[22]THE COURT:Unlikely, yes, but as I indicated, we have an ongoing pattern of behaviour, and the potential is certainly there.I am going to order, Ms. Aldridge, that you be prohibited from having in your possession any firearms, ammunition or explosive substances for a period of two years.At this point, you know, we are lucky that we are not dealing with serious injuries.I do not want this to escalate to the point where somebody gets hurt.[23]Victim fine surcharges are waived.Remaining counts?[24]MS. ATKINSON:Crown directs a stay of proceedings.[25]THE COURT:Thank you.________________________________RUDDY C.J.T.C."}

James, 2001 YKTC 29Date: 20010608Docket: 99-00903/ARegistry: WhitehorseIN THE TERRITORIAL COURT OF YUKON(Before His Honour Judge John Faulkner)REGINAv.ALVIN DENNIS JAMESDAVID McWHINNIEAppearing for CrownFIA JAMPOLSKYAppearing for DefenceREASONS FOR SENTENCING[1]FAULKNER, T.C.J. (Oral):The accused Alvin Dennis James has entered pleas of guilty to two offences:a charge of sexual assault and a charge of breach of undertaking.The major focus of this disposition, of course, is to be with respect to the charge of sexual assault.[2]What happened was an opportunistic offence in that the accused was at the complainant's residence.She passed out, and the accused took advantage of her comatose state to have sexual intercourse with her, without her consent.[3]He initially entered a plea of not guilty and the matter proceeded to trial.However, after DNA evidence which the accused had sought to have excluded was received in evidence, the accused changed his plea to one of guilty.[4]The accused is now 38 years of age.He has a significant criminal record; however, it must be said that that record has slowed down very considerably since the early 90s.It must be said, as well, that he has no prior record of sexual offending and, in fact, no prior record of violent behaviour.[5]The pre-sentence report, which was prepared by Mr. Sutton, is not a positive one.It would appear that Mr. James is still attempting to deny his complicity in these events, despite irrefutable scientific proof to the contrary, and it also appears from the pre-sentence report that Mr. James has not responded positively to community supervision in the past.On the other hand, the pre-sentence report also reveals that Mr. James has had a reasonable work record given where he lives and the sorts of employment opportunities that are available to him, and that he has significant talents as an artist.It also reveals, of course, that he had a difficult upbringing, which may have a great deal to do with his past difficulties, and present difficulties, with the law and with substance abuse.The pre-sentence report further reveals that Mr. James has family responsibilities.[6]In fixing the quantum of sentence in this case there is one particularly significant factor, in my view, which must be taken into account, and that is that this particular sort of sexual assault is a very prevalent crime in this jurisdiction, and I have certainly heard far too many of these cases myself during my years on the bench.That being the case, it seems to me that denunciation and deterrence must be significant factors in fixing an appropriate disposition.[7]The accused has submitted that there should be a conditional sentence and points out, quite correctly, that even in cases where denunciation and deterrence are the predominant factors, that the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Proulx (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449, indicates that a conditional sentence is not precluded in such cases.I do not disagree with Proulx, even if, as a Territorial Court judge, I was entitled to disagree with the Supreme Court of Canada, but sitting where I am and faced with the prevalence of this particular crime, I think I am bound to say that a conditional sentence would be, in my view, an exceptional disposition in cases of this kind, having regard to the prevalence of this crime and the paramount need to deter it as best the Court can.[8]The other issue, of course, with respect to whether there should be a conditional sentence is the question of the accused's prospects in successfully completing a community-based sentence.Having regard to the indications in the pre-sentence report and further having regard to the fact that there had been a breach while the accused was on release for the sexual assault, I have come to the conclusion that Mr. James is not a suitable candidate for a conditional sentence, even were I inclined to impose one in all of the other circumstances of the case.[9]I agree with Ms. Jampolsky when she indicates that the range of sentence that has been imposed in circumstances of this kind is in the order of 12 to 24 months, and I can recall the R. v. Stewart case, T.C.Y.T., February 14, 2001, Faulkner, T.C.J. (Unreported) (00-10062A/B), mentioned by Crown counsel.However, I can also recall recently hearing another case, a man by the name of Frank Moose, which was heard, I believe, last November.The circumstances of the R. v. Moose case, T.C.Y.T., November 6, 2000, Faulkner, T.C.J. (Unreported) (99-00254), it seems to me, were much more similar to the case of Mr. James than the case referred to by Crown counsel.[10]Mr. Moose received, if I recall correctly, a 12-month sentence.There were some distinctions, however, that must be noted.Firstly, in the Moose case the Crown had proceeded by way of summary conviction, therefore making the maximum sentence one of 18 months.Mr. Moose also had a less serious criminal record and was steadily employed.However, on the other side of the ledger, Mr. Moose did not enter a guilty plea, but proceeded to trial and was convicted only after trial.Despite those differences, however, it seems to me that the Moose case is a closer parallel than the case referred to by Mr. McWhinnie.[11]Taking into account all of the circumstances of the case and of Mr. James, and having regard, as well, to the history of the case, which I have already alluded to, and, again, having regard to the prevalence of this particular crime in the jurisdiction, I have come to the conclusion that a fit sentence in this case is one of 14 months imprisonment.[12]Following your release from imprisonment, Mr. James, you will be subject to a probation order, which will be in effect for a period of 18 months following your release from imprisonment.[13]The terms of the probation order will be as follows:You will keep the peace and be of good behaviour.You will report to an adult probation officer forthwith upon your release from imprisonment and thereafter as directed.You will advise the probation officer forthwith of your address and thereafter advise him forthwith of any change of name or address.You will promptly notify the probation officer of any change of occupation or employment.[14]You will abstain from the possession or consumption of alcohol and controlled drugs or substances, and will submit to a breathalyzer test or urinalysis upon demand by your probation officer, a peace officer, or Sex Offender Risk Management Team member.You will attend, participate, and complete any psychological or other assessment, counselling, or treatment as directed by the supervising probation officer or Sex Offender Risk Management Team member.You will attend, participate, and complete the Sex Offender Risk Management Program as directed by your probation officer or Sex Offender Risk Management Team member.You will attend, participate, and complete alcohol and/or drug treatment as directed by your probation officer or Sex Offender Risk Management Team member.You will attend and participate with the Sex Offender Risk Management Team as directed by your probation officer.[15]You will have no contact, directly or indirectly, with L.R.J.You will reside at such place as your probation officer will approve in writing.[16]The victim surcharge is $100.[17]Now, does this case also engage the firearms prohibition and DNA sample provisions of the Code?[18]MR. McWHINNIE:Yes, sir, it engages the firearms order on a mandatory basis.Because the offence in this case occurred about six months before the coming into force of the DNA Act, S.C. 1998, c.37, under 487.052, I think it is, I'm entitled to apply to you for an order for DNA, on the same essential basis as what would be mandatory if this matter had occurred after the 1st of July of the year 2000.Given that this is a case where the only way in which the matter could be resolved was by way of the DNA that was obtained in the matter, given Mr. James's long - it appears - standing substance abuse issues and his severe alcohol problems, it's the kind of case where, should he ever find himself in conflict with the law in this fashion again, it would be reasonable, unless his alcohol problem is dealt with, to surmise that we may find ourselves in exactly the same situation, where DNA will be the only way to prove the case; and so we'd be suggesting that this would be an appropriate case for you to exercise your discretion and direct the taking of DNA.[19]THE COURT:Ms. Jampolsky?[20]MS. JAMPOLSKY:Your Honour, given that it's not mandatory, I'd ask for some time for this application, and perhaps we could --[21]THE COURT:I am sorry?[22]MS. JAMPOLSKY:Given that this is not a mandatory order at this point in time, I'd ask for some time to prepare for an application with regards to the DNA, so perhaps that matter could be stood down to another date, solely with respect to the DNA bank.[23]THE COURT:All right.We can do that.How much time would you need?(Matter of timing spoken to)[24]THE COURT:Firstly, with respect to the matter of the firearms prohibition, Mr. James, you are prohibited from having in your possession any firearm, ammunition, explosive substance, for a period of ten years following your release from imprisonment, and I direct that you surrender forthwith to the R.C.M. Police at Whitehorse, Yukon, any such items now in your possession.[25]Is the accused requesting time to pay the surcharge?[26]MS. JAMPOLSKY:No.Your Honour, given the circumstances, we'd be making an application to have the victim fine surcharge waived.Mr. James is in indigent circumstances; he doesn't have any income and he clearly won't be having any income in the future.[27]THE COURT:That can be payable forthwith.[28]MR. McWHINNIE:And the 145 charges, sir, did we dispose of those?[29]THE COURT:Not yet.Now, with respect to the matter of the DNA warrant, then, that will go to --[30]MR. McWHINNIE:June 15th.[31]THE COURT:-- Friday, the 15th, at 2:00 p.m.[32]MR. McWHINNIE:Thank you, sir.[33]THE COURT:With respect to the charge of breach of undertaking, Mr. James, you are sentenced to period of imprisonment of 30 days.Surcharge with respect to that matter will be $50, payable forthwith.[34]THE CLERK:You would run them concurrently?[35]THE COURT:Yes.[36]MR. McWHINNIE:Does the order, sir, for probation and the attendance upon the Sex Offender Risk Management Program, take any assessment that they may require -- what I'm thinking here is if they require him to attend upon the psychologist, for assessment by the psychologist.I can't remember the exact wording --[37]THE COURT:Well, I think I had used the verbiage suggested by the pre-sentence report, so --[38]MR. McWHINNIE:Then it should be there.Thank you, sir.[39]THE COURT:If that is not what you want, let me know.Otherwise, that is basically what it is.[40]MR. McWHINNIE:Thank you.FAULKNER, T.C.J."}

BeningerHeard on April 15, 2014Reasons for Decision released on April 23, 2014B. Kelnick................................................................................................counsel for the CrownA. Black..........................................................................................................for the applicantsBeninger J.:The Applicants have brought an application under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms challenging the s. 737 Victim Surcharge amendments, which came into effect on Oct. 24, 2013.The applicants are (in chronological order) Edward Tinker, Kelly Judge, Michael Bondoc, and Wesley Mead.I heard the applicant and Crown respondent submissions on Apr. 15, 2014.Notice under the Courts of Justice Act s. 109The first issue I will address is the Notice provided to the Crown by the applicants under s. 109 of the Courts of Justice Act.On the date of hearing, the Crown took the position that it had only received notice that the applicants were seeking a personal exemption from the provisions of the section, and were not seeking relief which may include striking down part or all of the s. 737 amendments.I do not accept the Crown position.The Crown was served with Notice under s. 109 of the Courts of Justice Act on or about Feb. 20, 2014.The Notice states that the applicants “intend to question the constitutional validity of s. 737 of the Criminal Code.”The legal basis for the argument is stated as being “s. 737 of the Criminal Code is unconstitutional.”Prior to the application being heard, the matter was spoken to in Court on Feb. 24, Mar. 17 and March 19.In court, the Crown acknowledged receiving notice of the constitutional application.At no point did the Crown take the position that the applicants were seeking limited relief.The Crown bases its argument that the applicants seek only limited relief on the order requested in the applicant’s factum. The relief sought by the applicants includes specific orders for exemptions for the applicants and “such further and other relief as this Honourable Court deems appropriate.”The Crown only raised the argument that limited relief was sought by the applicants upon filing its responding factum on or about Apr. 11, 2014.Despite having numerous opportunities to make the argument on earlier dates, the Crown chose not to do so.I find that the Crown had full and proper notice of the relief being sought by the applicants under s. 109 of the Courts of Justice Act.BackgroundThe s. 737 amendment issue has already been addressed in the Ontario Court of Justice by Madam Justice Schnall in R. v. Flaro 2014 ONCJ 2 (CanLII).I adopt the legislative summary of the s. 737 amendments, as set out by Justice Schnall.In particular, prior to the amendments, s. 737(5), now repealed, read:When the offender establishes to the satisfaction of the court that undue hardship to the offender or dependants of the offender would result from payment of the victim surcharge, the court may, on application of the offender, make an order exempting the offender…Under s. 737(5), the Court was able to exercise discretion with respect to the imposition of the surcharge provisions in appropriate cases.The amendments removed that discretion.The applicantsMr. Tinker and Ms. Judge filed affidavits on the application setting out their financial circumstances.The cases of Mr. Bondoc and Mr. Mead were heard in the two days prior to the application being argued.Taking into account the financial circumstances of the applicants, I did not find it to be part of a fit sentence to impose fines as punishment as part of any of their sentences.Prior to the s. 737 amendments, I would have exercised my discretion and waived the surcharge in each of their cases.My reason for waiving the surcharge would have been that, having heard all of the evidence and the submissions of counsel as to sentence, each of the offenders met the ‘undue hardship’ standard as set out in the repealed s. 737(5).Under s. 737(3), the amount of the surcharge may be increased, upon the exercise of a judge’s discretion in appropriate cases.By removing judicial discretion, the s. 737 amendments made the imposition of a surcharge mandatory on all sentences.The minimum amount of the surcharge, being $100 for summary offences and $200 for indictable offences, cannot be waived.Under s. 737(2)(b), the surcharge is applicable to every offender, including an offender who has no source of income, and relies on community food banks and shelters for the basic necessities of life.A person in those circumstances is given 30 days to pay a $100 surcharge, and 60 days to pay a $200 surcharge.When there are multiple counts, the amount of the surcharge owing is also multiplied. If the surcharge is not paid in the required time, payment may be enforced in the same manner as for a fine.Non-payment of the surcharge may result in a default jail term.s. 7 CharterI agree with Justice Schnall’s analysis which finds that the surcharge is a form of punishment.As set out in R. v. Ferguson, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96, 2008 SCC 6 (CanLII), a judge must impose sentence within the range fixed by Parliament, unless the minimum sentence is unconstitutional.Section 7 of the Charter provides that the state cannot deny a person’s right to life, liberty or security of the person, except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.As stated by Chief Justice McLachlin, for a unanimous Supreme Court of Canada,in Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, 2013 SCC 72 (CanLII), [2013] 3 S.C.R. 1101, at paragraph 58;“the question is whether the impugned laws negatively impact or limit the applicants’ security of the person, thus bringing them within the ambit of, or engaging, s. 7 of the Charter.”I find that the mandatory imposition of the surcharge does negatively impact the security of the person for the applicants before the Court.Without regard to their personal circumstances, the surcharge must be paid within a 30 or 60 day time period.If the surcharge is not paid as required, the person in default is clearly informed that they are subject to serving a jail sentence.The Crown argues that a person has the option of obtaining extensions of time to pay the surcharge.I do not find that argument persuasive.Applications for extensions of time to pay prolong a court proceeding.They require additional resources within the court system.In my view, an extended enforcement procedure for a $100 surcharge, targeting a person who has no ability to pay, is not a proceeding which enhances the criminal justice system in the eyes of the community.As s. 7 is engaged, the next determination is whether the deprivation is in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.As Chief Justice McLachlin writes in Bedford, supra, at paragraph 96;“The s. 7 analysis is concerned with capturing inherently bad laws: that is, laws that take away life, liberty, or security of the person in a way that runs afoul of our basic values.The principles of fundamental justice are an attempt to capture those values.Over the years, the jurisprudence has given shape to the content ofthose basic values.”Continuing in paragraph 123, Chief Justice McLachlin writes:“The question under s. 7 is whether anyone’s life, liberty or security of the person has been denied by a law that is inherently bad; a grossly disproportionate, overbroad, or arbitrary effect on one person is sufficient to establish a breach of s. 7.”The gross proportionality Charter analysis was recently reviewed by Justice Doherty in R. v. Nur, 2013 ONCA 677 (CanLII).At paragraph 74, Justice Doherty states,“The gross disproportionality standard recognizes that Parliament is free to set sentencing policy, even a policy that restricts the individualized approach to sentencing in Part XXII, so long as the policy does not impose sentences that are so excessive as to be grossly disproportionate.”Justice Doherty sets out a two- step inquiry in paragraph 75 and following:“First, the court must decide whether the punishment is grossly disproportionate as applied to the accused before the Court… If the sentence survives the particularized inquiry, the Court goes on to decide whether the sentence is grossly disproportionate when applied to reasonable hypotheticals.”To do the gross disproportionality analysis, a number of factors are identified in the case law by Justice Doherty in Nur, supra, at paragraph 78:-The gravity of the offence-The personal characteristics of the offender-The particular circumstances of the case-The actual effect of the punishment on the individual-The penological goals and sentencing principles reflected in the challenged minimum-The existence of valid effective alternatives to the mandatory minimum: and-A comparison of punishments imposed for similar crimes.The s. 737 amendment which removes judicial discretion is applicable in sentencing under the Criminal Code and CDSA for every offender.It is broadbrush legislation, which defies analysis of the applicable case law factors.The ‘reasonable hypothetical’ offender is everybody, and anybody.It may be a person with mental illness challenges who relies upon community food banks and shelters for the basic necessities of life.As noted by Justice Healy in R. v. Cloud, 2014 QCCZ 464, paragraph 18:“…the surcharge imposed by s. 737 would disturb reasonable and informed people because it is disproportionate- having regard to the quantum, the inflexibility of its terms and the inherent arbitrariness in distinguishing between cases where a fine is or is not imposed or cases that proceed by summary conviction or indictment.It is a blunt instrument that is far too blunt to achieve any valid penal purpose…”Chief Justice McLachlin writes in Bedford, supra, at paragraph 98, that:“Arbitrariness was used to describe the situation where there is no connection between the effect and the object of the law.”The object of the s. 737 amendments, as set out in the Legislative Summary of Bill C-37, is to “increase offenders’ accountability to victims of crime.” [Legislative Summary, Library of Parliament, Bill C-37, revised April 11, 2013].As an example, I have difficultly understanding how the stated legislative objective connects to the effect of the imposition of a surcharge in the case of a hypothetical impecunious offender who is found guilty of the offence of possession of one gram of marijuana under s. 4(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and given an absolute discharge.The legislative summary further notes that the first manner of achieving the legislative objective is “to eliminate judicial discretion.” [Legislative Summary, supra, pg. 1]I find that the removal of the Court’s ability to waive the surcharge is arbitrary, overreaching, and grossly disproportionate to the legislative goal which is advocated.I find the mandatory imposition of the surcharge to be a violation of s. 7 of the Charter.The s. 737 amendments also increased the amount of the surcharge payable when a fine is imposed as part of the sentence.In most cases, there is judicial discretion as to whether a fine is part of a fit sentence.In some cases, such as drinking and driving offences, Parliament has set minimum fines to be imposed.In those cases, Parliament has clearly distinguished certain types of conduct as requiring the punishment of a minimum fine.I do not find the imposition of the surcharge for offences with penalties that reflect a considered sentencing policy (ie: the deterrence of drinking and driving) to be grossly disproportionate or arbitrary.Section 1 CharterThe rights and freedoms as guaranteed by the Charter are subject to the limitation in s. 1:The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.The Supreme Court of Canada recently addressed legislation on sentencing in R. v. Summers, 2014 SCC 26 (CanLII).For a unanimous court, Justice Karakatsanis wrote, with reference to legislation respecting credit for pre-trial custody:“I recognize that ss. 719(3) and 719(3.1) do not exist in isolation, but form part of the overall sentencing scheme in the Criminal Code. As the legislature is presumed to have created a coherent, consistent and harmonious statutory scheme, s. 719 should be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the principles and purposes of sentencing set out in Part XXIII of the Criminal Code.”By way of analogy, the surcharge provisions in s. 737 must also be presumed to be part of a coherent, consistent and harmonious statutory scheme.Sections 718, 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code set out the purpose and principles of sentencing.In my view, the mandatory imposition of a surcharge in s. 737(2)(b) cannot be reconciled with a careful and balanced consideration of the principles and purposes of sentencing which is required by sections 718, 718.1 and 718.2.I hold that the requirement in s. 737(2)(b) for a surcharge, where no fine is imposed on the offender, does infringe s. 7 of the Charter and cannot be saved by s. 1.s. 12 and s. 15 of the Charter and s. 92(2) Constitution ActHaving decided the application on the basis of s. 7 of the Charter, it is unnecessary to address the applicant’s arguments with respect to s. 12 of the Charter, s. 15 of the Charter and s. 92(2) of the Constitution Act.ConclusionThe s. 737 amendment which removes judicial discretion in considering a fit sentence in all cases, without reference to sentencing principles as set out in s. 718, is a broad brush punishment which casts the widest possible net upon persons being sentenced in the criminal justice system.The remedy for the Charter violation is under s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982.I declare that the requirement for a mandatory surcharge in s. 737(1) and s. 737(2)(b) is of no force and effect.There will be no surcharge imposed with respect to any of the offences for any of the applicants.Released:April 23, 2014Signed: “Justice R. Beninger”"}

Andras Schreck, for the appellant PalaguruSusan Magotiaux, for the respondentHeard:Heard May 23, 2012On appeal from the convictions entered on September 25, 2008, by Justice Wailan Low of the Superior Court of Justice and on the sentence imposed by Justice Low dated February 20, 2009 for the appellant Palaguru.ENDORSEMENT[1]The appellants were among a group of attackers who set upon and beat two men sitting in a parked car. The attack was vicious and pre-meditated and intended to intimidate the victim so that he would not testify at an upcoming murder trial. Following a trial by judge and jury, each appellant was convicted of several offences. At the end of oral argument, we informed counsel that the appeal would be dismissed with brief reasons to follow. Here now are those reasons.[2]The appellant Mr. Skanthavarthayar was convicted of two counts of assault with a weapon, aggravated assault, and attempting to obstruct justice. He was given a global sentence of four years' imprisonment, less time served in pre-trial custody, credited on a 2:1 basis. His appeal is against conviction only.[3]The appellant Mr. Palaguru was convicted of assault with a weapon, assault, aggravated assault, attempting to obstruct the course of justice, and failing to comply with a condition of recognizance. He pleaded guilty to the last charge. For these offences, he too received a global sentence of four years' imprisonment less time served in pre-trial custody, credited on a 2:1 basis. He appeals against conviction and sentence.[4]In the appeal against conviction, the appellants raise one issue: Did the trial judge err in failing to give an adequate Vetrovec warning in her charge to the jury?[5]The Crown's main witness at trial, Lingathasan Suntharamoorthy, gave a full account of the attacks and threats and identified the appellants as attackers. However, Mr. Suntharamoorthy had a long criminal record that included many violent offences, including manslaughter, and a long history of lying to the police. In the course of his testimony, he was also frequently inconsistent. Everyone agreed that in his case a Vetrovec caution was necessary, to alert the jury that there were good reasons to doubt the witness's veracity.[6]The Vetrovec warning that the trial judge gave to the jury was consistent with the model set out in Justice Watt's Standard Jury Instructions. However, appellants' counsel submit that the trial judge failed to adequately explain to the jury why Mr. Suntharamoorthy’s evidence required their special scrutiny. They also allege that the trial judge gave the jury misleading instructions on confirmatory evidence, and that, overall, the effect of her Vetrovec caution succeeded only in undermining the theory of the defence.[7]We disagree. In the context of this case the Vetrovec caution was more than adequate. The jury could not have been under any misunderstanding about how they were to approach the evidence of Mr. Suntharamoorthy, whom the trial judge repeatedly described as unsavoury.[8]Nor did the trial judge mislead the jury in any way. In saying this, we wish to emphasize that we do not take so narrow a view of the principle of materiality enumerated in R. v. Khela, 2009 SCC 4 (CanLII), [2009] 1 S.C.R. 104 as counsel for the appellants have urged upon us.[9]When looked at in the context of the case as a whole, we consider that the few pieces of confirmatory evidence cited by the trial judge were capable of bolstering relevant aspects of Mr. Suntharamoorthy’s account. In other words, they were capable of strengthening the jury’s belief that Mr. Suntharamoorthy was telling the truth about the appellants’ involvement in the assault upon him. This evidence was therefore not misleading.[10]While identity was the central issue in the trial, there were other material facts in dispute as well. Moreover, the trial judge explicitly charged the jury that there was \"no confirmatory evidence\" with respect to the issue of identity, and her charge ended with a lengthy, detailed review of the frailties and inconsistencies in Mr. Suntharamoorthy’s testimony, all going to suggest why he should not be believed.[11]For these reasons, the appeals against conviction must therefore be dismissed.[12]As to the sentence appeal, the appellant Mr. Palaguru submits that the trial judge erred by failing to consider mitigating factors, by failing to consider the fact that the appellant had been subject to strict bail conditions before trial, and by placing too-great emphasis on aggravating factors.[13]In the course of the sentencing hearing, both Crown and defence counsel referred the trial judge to a pre-sentence report on Mr. Palaguru. The pre-sentence report recited some of the details of Mr. Palaguru's childhood in Sri Lanka, a time and place marked by such fear and violence that the family was forced to flee the country for Canada.[14]In light of this relevant information relating to the circumstances of the offender, we believe that the trial judge erred in stating without qualification that there were “no mitigating factors” and in observing that \"[the] Pre-sentence Report discloses unremarkable antecedents.\"[15]Still, in our view, the trial judge did not err in finding on the facts of this case that the predominant principles and purposes of sentence were those of denunciation and specific and general deterrence. There was ample evidence to support the trial judge’s finding that the appellant's attack upon the victim was a cowardly, vicious, and pre-meditated act, designed to dissuade the victim from testifying in a murder trial. It was thus open to the trial judge to conclude on the facts of this case, including a lengthy criminal record disclosing 13 convictions going back to 2000, that there were no mitigating factors sufficient to cause her to ameliorate the appellant's sentence.[16]In his written submissions the appellant also contends that the trial judge's failure to consider his restrictive bail conditions constitutes an error in principle. Although this ground of appeal was not advanced in oral argument, we wish to address it briefly here. While it is true that “a trial judge faced with an offender who has spent time on bail under house arrest should adopt a flexible approach, . . . the amount of credit and the manner in which it is to be taken into account as a mitigating factor is a matter for the trial judge.” R. v. Downes, 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA), [2006] O.J. No. 555 (C.A.) at para. 36. Here, in this case, the trial judge was aware of the appellant's restrictive bail, and equally aware that he had breached his bail conditions three times.[17]In our view, the global sentence of four years' imprisonment was a fit one in all the circumstances, in the sense that it was not clearly unreasonable. The sentence recognizes the fundamental principle of sentencing, proportionality, as set out in s.718.1 of the Criminal Code. It also honours the principle of parity in that it is similar to the sentence imposed on Mr. Skanthavarothayar for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. We would not therefore intervene to vary the sentence. Accordingly, the appeal against sentence is also dismissed.“E.E. Gillese J.A.”“S.E. Pepall, J.A.”“E. Ducharme J.A.”"}

Jacobs, [2015] N.J. No. 3 (P.C.).AUTHORITIES CONSIDERED: George Smith, A Primer Of Opinion Writing For Four New Judges, 21 A.L.R. 197 (1967).STATUTES CONSIDERED: The Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985.JUDGMENT OF GORMAN, P.C. J.(SENTENCE)INTRODUCTION:[1]On May 4, 2013, Ms. Crocker entered Brent Sweet’s Convenience Store in Summerside and placed a 750 millilitre bottle of Iceberg Vodka inside her blouse.She picked up a second bottle of Iceberg Vodka, walked to the cashier and paid for it.Ms. Crocker went to the washroom and then left the store.Ms. Crocker did not pay for the bottle of vodka she had placed inside her blouse.Ms. Crocker’s actions were videotaped by the store and subsequently placed on YouTube by the store in an attempt to identify her.Ms. Crocker was charged with and was convicted of the offence of theft, contrary to section 334 of the Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985 (see [2015] N.J. No. 215 (P.C.)).The Crown proceeded by way of summary conviction.[2]The sole issue left for determination is the imposition of an appropriate sentence for this offence.[3]Ms. Crocker has a long and related criminal record.The Crown sought the imposition of a period of incarceration.Ms. Crocker sought the imposition of a conditional discharge or in the alternative a conditional period of imprisonment.[4]I have concluded, primarily because of Ms. Crocker’s criminal history that this is an appropriate case for the imposition of a period of thirty days conditional imprisonment followed by a period of twelve months of probation.[5]In R. v. Lundrigan, 2012 NLCA 43 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal indicated that a “fit sentence” is one “that takes account of the circumstances of the offences and the offender.”THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER[6]Ms. Crocker is forty-one years of age.She has two daughters.She also has an extensive criminal record. It could fairly be described as being a “championship-level criminal record” (see R. v. McKenna, 2015 NSCA 58 (CanLII), at paragraph 17).[7]Ms. Crocker has twenty-nine previous convictions extending over the time period of 1990 to 2003.Her record consists primarily of thefts and breaches of probation. It is difficult to see how a conditional discharge would be in Ms. Crocker’s interest or not contrary to the public’s interest.THE PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[8]In R. v. Klemenz, 2015 SKCA 89 (CanLII), it was held that determining “an appropriate sentence requires consideration of the purposes and principles of sentencing as set out in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code as those purposes and principles apply to the individual circumstances of the offence and the offender. It requires the weighing of factors and the balancing of sometimes conflicting objectives.”[9]Section 718 of the Criminal Code states that the fundamental purpose of sentencing \"is to contribute...to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society.\"This is to be achieved by imposing sentences which have, among other objectives, the objectives of:-separating offenders from society, where necessary;-denouncing unlawful conduct;-general deterrence;-rehabilitation; and-the promoting of a \"sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims or to the community.\"[10]Section 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code states that \"a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.\"[11]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code states that any sentence imposed must be \"proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\"In R. v. Cluney, 2013 NLCA 46 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal, at paragraph 16, indicated that the “principle of proportionality applies to sentencing for all criminal offences…The appropriate range of sentence is related to the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.”[12]In R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII), at paragraphs 12 and 53, the Supreme Court of Canada noted that the “more serious the crime and its consequences, or the greater the offender’s degree of responsibility, the heavier the sentence will be.In other words, the severity of a sentence depends not only on the seriousness of the crime’s consequences, but also on the moral blameworthiness of the offender...Proportionality is determined both on an individual basis, that is, in relation to the accused him or herself and to the offence committed by the accused, and by comparison with sentences imposed for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. Individualization and parity of sentences must be reconciled for a sentence to be proportionate.”The Supreme Court also indicated that the “credibility of the criminal justice system in the eyes of the public depends on the fitness of sentences imposed on offenders. A sentence that is unfit, whether because it is too harsh or too lenient, could cause the public to question the credibility of the system in light of its objectives” (at paragraph 3).[13]Section 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code indicates that a \"sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender.\" In R. v. Briand, 2010 NLCA 67 (CanLII), [2010] N.J. No. 339 (C.A.), the Court of Appeal stressed the importance of considering an offender's personal circumstances in applying section 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code.[14]Section 718.2(d) states that \"an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances\" and section 718.2(e) states that \"all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.\"THE RANGE OF SENTENCE[15]In R. v. Oake, 2010 NLCA 19 (CanLII), [2010] N.J. No. 94, the Court of Appeal indicated that a judge has a duty \"to impose sentences in line with precedent, noting always that for each offence and each offender some elements are unique.\"In Cluney, the Court of Appeal indicated that while sentencing ranges “are merely guidelines rather than hard and fast rules, a judge ordering a sentence outside the regular range should explain how it is in accordance with the principles and objectives of sentencing.”In R. v. McLaren, 2015 BCCA 478 (CanLII), the British Columbia Court of Appeal, at paragraph 24, indicated that it “has been said many times that sentencing is a highly individualized process and that the range of sentence is just that – a range.”[16]The Supreme Court of Canada in Lacasse described sentencing ranges as being “primarily guidelines, and not hard and fast rules” (at paragraph 60).[17]In addition, in every case in which sentence is imposed, in this Province, the sentencing judge must initially determine if a “prescriptive” or “descriptive” range of sentence applies (see R. v. Johnston, [2011] N.J. No. 303 (C.A.)).SENTENCING PRECEDENTS[18]The range of sentence for minor thefts ranges from the imposition of a discharge to relatively short periods of imprisonment when the offender has a related criminal record (see R. v. Roberts, [2015] N.J. No. 356 (P.C.), R. v. Crocker, [2015] N.J. No. 296 (P.C.), R. v. Basha, [2015] N.J. No. 71 (P.C.), R. v. Prowse (1998), 1998 CanLII 18024 (NL CA), 168 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 289 (N.L.C.A.), R. v. C.C., [2012] N.J. No. 121 (P.C.), R. v. Reid, [2012] N.J. No. 164 (P.C.), R. v. Roberts, [2013] N.J. No. 214 (P.C.), R. v. J.B., [2013] N.J. No. 218 (P.C.), R. v. Park, [2013] N.J. No. 244 (P.C.), R. v. Sutherland, [2013] N.J. No. 53 (P.C.), R. v. Durnford, [2014] N.J. No. 5 (P.C.), R. v. Courtney, [2014] N.J. No. 172 (P.C.), R. v. Bennett, [2014] N.J. No. 51 (P.C.), R. v. Sutherland, [2014] N.J. No. 228 (P.C.) and R. v. Jacobs, [2015] N.J. No. 3 (P.C.)).[19]In Lacasse, the Supreme Court of Canada held, at paragraph 57, that although sentencing ranges “are used mainly to ensure the parity of sentences, they reflect all the principles and objectives of sentencing. Sentencing ranges are nothing more than summaries of the minimum and maximum sentences imposed in the past, which serve in any given case as guides for the application of all the relevant principles and objectives. However, they should not be considered ‘averages’, let alone straitjackets, but should instead be seen as historical portraits for the use of sentencing judges, who must still exercise their discretion in each case.”Thus (at paragraph 58 of Lacasse):There will always be situations that call for a sentence outside a particular range: although ensuring parity in sentencing is in itself a desirable objective, the fact that each crime is committed in unique circumstances by an offender with a unique profile cannot be disregarded. The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a highly individualized exercise that goes beyond a purely mathematical calculation. It involves a variety of factors that are difficult to define with precision. This is why it may happen that a sentence that, on its face, falls outside a particular range, and that may never have been imposed in the past for a similar crime, is not demonstrably unfit. Once again, everything depends on the gravity of the offence, the offender’s degree of responsibility and the specific circumstances of each case.THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIESTHE CROWN:[20]The Crown sought the imposition of a period of fourteen to thirty days incarceration followed by a period of probation.Ms. St. Croix placed significant emphasis on Ms. Crocker’s criminal record in support of the Crown’s position.MS. CROCKER:[21]Ms. Crocker sought the imposition of a conditional discharge or in the alternative a conditional period of imprisonment.Ms. MacDonald, in support of this position, referred to the minor nature of the offence and the time period which has elapsed since the commission of the offence.Ms. MacDonald pointed out that though Ms. Crocker has a significant criminal record, she had not been convicted of an offence since 2003.Ms. MacDonald urged me to concentrate on the sentencing principle of rehabilitation.[22]In Lacasse, the Supreme Court of Canada considered the sentencing principle of rehabilitation and stated (at paragraph 4):One of the main objectives of Canadian criminal law is the rehabilitation of offenders. Rehabilitation is one of the fundamental moral values that distinguish Canadian society from the societies of many other nations in the world, and it helps the courts impose sentences that are just and appropriate.[23]However, the Supreme Court also indicated in Lacasse that while “it is normal for trial judges to consider sentences other than imprisonment in appropriate cases, in the instant case, as in all cases in which general or specific deterrence and denunciation must be emphasized, the courts have very few options other than imprisonment for meeting these objectives, which are essential to the maintenance of a just, peaceful and law‑abiding society.”[24]Ms. MacDonald referred to my decisions in R. v. C.C., [2012] N.J. No. 121 (P.C.) and R. v. Stevenson, [2012] N.J. No. 230 (P.C.).[25]In C.C., I imposed a suspended sentence and a period of probation for two counts of theft.The offender in C.C. had a lengthy criminal record.[26]In Stevenson, the offender was convicted of a number of offences, including seven thefts.I imposed a period of three months conditional imprisonment.Publicity:[27]Ms. MacDonald also argued that a consideration of the publicity which Ms. Crocker has endured as a result of her conviction for this offence should cause me to conclude that the sentencing principle of specific deterrence has been satisfied.In support of her proposition Ms. MacDonald referred to the coverage of Ms. Crocker’s trial in the Western Star and the showing of the store’s video on You Tube, in which it received four hundred and twenty-eight views.[28]Publicity of criminal acts is an inherent feature of the criminal law process.Judges themselves can generate publicity by written judgments.It has been noted, for instance, that one of the effects of written judgments is to “to expose the court's decision to public scrutiny...In no other way can it be known whether the law needs revision; whether the court is doing its job, whether a particular judge is competent” (see George Smith, A Primer Of Opinion Writing For Four New Judges, 21 A.L.R. 197 (1967), at page 200).[29]Those convicted of crimes must expect that there may be media coverage because the “open court principle is of crucial importance in a democratic society. It ensures that citizens have access to the courts and can, as a result, comment on how courts operate and on proceedings that take place in them” (see Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 2 (CanLII), [2011] 1 S.C.R 19, at paragraph one).[30]Publicity of criminal acts may have reached new levels as a result of social media, but this is simply a matter of new technology rather than a change in reality.I do not see the publicity or social media content as mitigating factors in this case.ANALYSIS[31]Ms. Crocker stole a bottle of vodka more than thirty-one months ago.Yes she has an extensive criminal record, but her last conviction prior to this offence occurred more than thirteen years ago. Though a discharge may not be appropriate, a period of incarceration is equally inappropriate.[32]Having said this, the imposition of a period of probation standing alone would not adequately reflect Ms. Crocker’s long history of criminal activity.A period of imprisonment is required, but Ms. Crocker does not constitute a danger to the public and a conditional sentence would not be contrary to the principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code.[33]For these reasons Ms. Crocker is sentenced to a period of thirty days conditional imprisonment.In addition to the statutory conditions, the following additional conditions are imposed:-Ms. Crocker must report to a supervisor as and when required and comply with all directions received from her supervisor;-Ms. Crocker must refrain from entering within Brent Sweet’s Convenience Store in Summerside; and-Ms. Crocker must remain inside her residence at all times except:-to obtain medical or dental treatment for herself or a member of her family;-as allowed by her supervisor in writing;-each day between 1:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m.; and-on December 31, 2015 and January 1, 2016.THE PERIOD OF PROBATION[34]Following having served this period of imprisonment, Ms. Crocker will be subject to a probation order for a period of twelve months.In addition to the statutory conditions which apply, Ms. Crocker must:-report to a probation officer in person as required;-attend all counselling or treatment sessions arranged by her probation officer;-refrain from entering within Brent Sweet’s Convenience Store in Summerside; and-pay compensation to Brent Sweet’s Convenience Store in Summerside in the amount of $14.55.This must be paid to the Provincial Court in Corner Brook within thirty days of the commencement of this probation order.A VICTIM SURCHARGE[35]A victim surcharge in the amount of $100.00 is imposed.It must be paid to the Provincial Court within thirty days of today’s date.CONCLUSION[36]For the reasons provided, Ms. Crocker is sentenced to a period of thirty days conditional imprisonment followed by twelve months of probation.[37]Judgment accordingly."}

No punishment will bring this young man back or heal his family’s grief.Nor should that be the purpose of a criminal sentence imposed by a court of law.The task of the sentencing judge is set out carefully in the Criminal Code.He is to match such principles of sentencing as denunciation, general and specific deterrence, protection of the community, and rehabilitation of the offender with the unique facts of the case in front of him.4In this case, the sentencing judge found as a fact that the accused knocked the victim unconscious and then kicked him in the head with such violence that a shoe imprint was left on the victim’s forehead.In addition, the accused left the victim naked from the waist down, revealing significant insensitivity and cruelty on his part.The accused was previously convicted of assault and was on probation at the time the fight occurred.The sentencing judge was concerned that uncontrolled anger or rage was a problem for the accused.Given that finding, a sentence to be served in the community is not appropriate.5On the other hand, it was the victim who instigated the fight and who first approached the accused.While their friends watched, they both walked voluntarily to the parking lot where they began the fistfight.Consequently, the cases cited by the Crown which involve the use of a weapon or a surprise attack are not totally applicable to these circumstances.6The sentencing judge also considered several mitigating factors relating to the accused himself.He considered that the accused seemed to be genuinely remorseful, that a guilty plea had eliminated the need for a trial, and that the evidence regarding the accused indicated “good character, moral qualities, social responsibility and a positive future.”7The sentencing judge balanced all of these factors and imposed a custodial sentence of two years less a day, taking into account the time spent in custody and on bail while under strict bail conditions.8We cannot conclude that the custodial sentence of two years less a day was an unfit sentence.However, a sentence of under two years affords the opportunity of adding a probationary period.That opportunity was not commented upon by the sentencing judge in his reasons.We are of the opinion that it did constitute error on his part not to consider probation, and given the background of this accused, but also his prospects of rehabilitation, the addition of a probationary period is appropriate.We would allow the appeal of the Crown to the limited extent of adding two years of supervised probation, with appropriate conditions to be determined by the probation officer.9This modest adjustment aside, we see no basis for interfering with the custodial period of the sentence.It is not the function of this court to re‑weigh the various factors that have already been considered by the sentencing judge unless there is error in principle or unless the disposition is unfit.10Leave to appeal is granted with respect to both appeal and cross-appeal.The appeal by the Crown is allowed as indicated, and the appeal of the accused is dismissed._____________________________ C.J.M._______________________________ J.A._______________________________ J.A."}

(In Chambers)Counsel:Mr. Brittain on his own behalfAnthony B. Gerein for the CrownApplication:From:QBCNJ 4/07, J.C. of ReginaHeard:August 13, 2008Disposition:Application dismissedWritten Reasons: August 15, 2008Richards J.A.[1]This is an application by Mr. Brittain, pursuant to s. 678(2) of the Criminal Code, for and order extending the time for seeking leave to appeal in relation to the 12-month sentence he is serving for aggravated assault.The sentence was imposed on April 10, 2008.Mr. Brittain filed a notice of appeal, and a motion to extend the time for doing so, on July 21, 2008.[2]Mr. Brittain did not have counsel and, as a result, I allowed him, his mother and his father to explain the circumstances surrounding the delay.Mr. Brittain’s mother had the most detailed and first hand involvement with the issue.She said Mr. Brittain’s trial lawyer did not explain or advise as to the existence of rights of appeal.She indicated that she did her own research on the point after the sentence was imposed and while unsuccessfully attempting to make an appointment to visit the trial lawyer.Counsel for the Crown, noting that trial counsel for Mr. Brittain is experienced and well regarded, suggested that the recollections of Mr. Brittain and his parents should be considered with some caution.[3]As noted in R. v. Morin (2005), 2005 SKCA 37 (CanLII), 195 C.C.C. (3d) 190 (Sask. C.A.), the exercise of discretion in granting the type of relief sought by Mr. Brittain is usually influenced by consideration of the following factors:(a)Did the applicant have a bona fide intention to appeal before the time to appeal expired?(b)Has the applicant satisfactorily explained why he did not exercise his right of appeal within the prescribed time?(c)Would the Respondent be unduly prejudiced by an extension of time?(d)Is there merit in the proposed appeal which is to say, does it raise a reasonably arguable issue?(e)Do the interests of justice weigh in favour of extending the time to appeal?[4]It is useful to consider each of these points.First, it seems doubtful that Mr. Brittain had a bona fide intention to appeal before the appeal period expired on May 10, 2008.Mr. Brittain himself was rather uncertain as to when he first learned of his right to appeal and as to when he decided to appeal. He suggested that it was in June or July.His parents were similarly unable to provide much by way of specific information on this point.[5]Second, it is also not entirely clear why Mr. Brittain launched his appeal so late.He and his mother indicated that he did not know about the right of appeal until his mother unearthed it.However, at the same time, Mr. Brittain’s mother said there was a period when Mr. Brittain was reluctant to appeal because fellow inmates were suggesting his sentence might be increased rather than decreased if there was an appeal.[6]With respect to the issue of prejudice, the Crown candidly acknowledges that it would suffer no prejudice if Mr. Brittain’s application is allowed.[7]The merits of a possible appeal by Mr. Brittain is the most telling consideration.In this regard, it must be remembered that this Court is required to approach sentencing decisions with considerable deference.For example, the Supreme Court of Canada said this in R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500:[90]Put simply, absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit. Parliament explicitly vested sentencing judges with a discretion to determine the appropriate degree and kind of punishment under the Criminal Code. …[8]Given the facts of this case, there is no realistic prospect that Mr. Brittain would be successful even if his appeal did go forward.The sentence he is serving is well within the range of sentences typically imposed for similar crimes and there is no apparent error of principle or otherwise in the approach taken by the sentencing judge.[9]All things considered, I am obliged to conclude that the interests of justice do not weigh in favour of extending the time to seek leave to appeal.I appreciate that Mr. Brittain is experiencing some difficulties in jail.He has strong support from his parents and community and he is fortunate in that respect.Nonetheless, he has not established that it would be appropriate to extend the time for appealing his sentence.His application is dismissed.DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 15th day of August, A.D. 2008.____________________________________RICHARDS J.A."}

The following are my Reasons for Sentence.Circumstances of the Offences(a) Evidence of the victim[2]The complainant in this case, A.C., was born on December […], 1971 in Fiji.She came to Canada when she was 15 years old for an education and a better life.She came to live with her aunt, L.M., and her aunt’s husband, who was convicted in this case, D.M.She called L.M. and D.M. “auntie” and “uncle” respectively and considered them to be the equivalent of parents. Her evidence was she felt like their daughter.She was financially dependent on L.M. and D.M. until she left their home for an arranged marriage in March 1991.[3]In March 1988 when A.C. was 16 years old, D.M. touched her breast.This incident was the start of a chain of progressively more invasive sexual touching, and ultimately sexual intercourse, over a period of approximately three years.[4]Within a few days of the incident where D.M. touched A.C.’s breast, he began coming to her bed at night and asking her to touch his penis.He touched her vaginal area.A few weeks after the touching incidents, A.C. was requested by L.M. to rise at 6:00 a.m. each morning and make D.M.’s tea.She was not happy about this arrangement but was brought up to listen to her elders and felt she had no choice.A.C. would prepare D.M.’s tea and when he came downstairs, he would put his finger in her vagina and request that she rub his penis while they were on the living room couch.Sometimes he would ejaculate during the touching incidents.The touching incidents occurred in the living room and sometimes in the basement.[5]A.C. was not sure when, but a few months after the downstairs touching had started, D.M. began to penetrate her vagina with his penis.Once intercourse started, A.C. estimated they had intercourse two to three times per week, most often in the basement.A.C. recalled that intercourse usually occurred in the morning, but on four or five occasions, intercourse occurred in D.M.’s car.Sexual intercourse also occurred once or twice in D.M.’s bed.[6]On one occasion before A.C. and D.M. began to have intercourse, D.M. asked A.C. to sit on the floor and spread her legs.He tried to insert a six-inch carrot into her vagina.This incident devastated A.C..[7]D.M. oversaw A.C.’s birth control by giving her a birth control pill to take each morning.He kept the pills on a high shelf in the basement.[8]In the summer of 1988, D.M. requested that A.C. watch pornographic videos. He would call her from work to ensure she had watched them as instructed.D.M. asked A.C. to put her mouth on his penis and she thought that D.M. may have put his mouth on her vagina, but she was not sure.D.M. told A.C. that if she told anyone about their activities, she would be deported back to Fiji.A.C. believed him.[9]When A.C. turned 18, she began talking to her aunt about arranging a marriage for her.It was not unusual in her culture for marriages to be arranged or for women to be married at a young age.Her aunt complied, and A.C. left L.M. and D.M.’s home in March 1991 for her new married life in Vancouver.[10]Even after A.C. became engaged in early 1991, intercourse with D.M. continued.A.C. felt that D.M. was like an uncle to her and she had to respect him and do as he asked.[11]After A.C.’s marriage, D.M. kept in touch with her from time to time by telephone and in person when he visited Vancouver.He would remind her to ensure that others did not find out about their previous sexual activities.(b) Evidence of the offender[12]D.M. is 56 years old.He married L.M. in 1976 and they have two children, D.M. and M.M.He has since remarried.[13]D.M. denied touching A.C.’s breast and the touching that A.C. said occurred in her bed.He conceded that an affair started because L.M. was mistreating him and A.C. expressed concern about that.He became close to A.C. through talking and she pursued him.After about two years, they began to have sexual intercourse.He never forced A.C. to have sex.He estimated they had sexual intercourse a total of eight times over a period of about a year.He insisted that it was A.C. who approached him.[14]According to D.M., he and A.C. only had sexual intercourse one time in the morning.Usually sexual intercourse occurred when L.M. and the children were away.In his interview with police, D.M. initially denied having sexual intercourse with A.C. but then admitted that he did so as he felt that he had made a moral mistake and needed to admit what was true.He apologized only because he felt under pressure, but he insisted that the sexual intercourse was consensual.[15]D.M. denied attempting to insert a carrot into A.C.’s vagina, engaging in oral sex with her or having sex with her in his car.Although he was aware that A.C. was taking birth control pills, he did not give them to her to take.He tried to stop the affair with A.C. but could not because she kept coming back to him.Although he knew what he was doing was wrong, his evidence was it was not one-sided.He denied taking advantage of A.C. when he knew she was young, vulnerable and new to the country.Circumstances of the Offender[16]D.M. was 57 years old at the time of sentencing.In his pre-sentence report, D.M. expressed regret about the situation with his wife’s niece and that being 20 years older, he should have exercised better judgment.However, he strongly asserted that their relationship wasconsensual and that his wife’s niece was 16 years old at the time.D.M. is now married to his current wife, P.M., who also has two boys from a prior marriageHe and P.M. raised their sons together.D.M.’s wife was present throughout the entire trial and sentencing.P.M. and D.M.’s sons have done well in terms of education, careers and family.The family attends church together and both ministers at their church praised the couple’s parenting of their blended family.[17]D.M. obtained a grade 12 education in India and completed a college degree.For the past 15 years, he has owned and operated a trophy business in Concord, Ontario with the assistance of his wife.His business struggles to keep operating with the post-recession economy.His bail conditions, which restrict him from entering schools, have been detrimental to his business because schools were one of his major sources of revenue.D.M. was not noted to have any problems in the area of substance abuse or addictions.D.M. also had no criminal record.[18]Sources interviewed by the probation officer who prepared the pre-sentence report had nothing but respect and praise for the offender and were shocked to learn of the charges and the conviction.Family, relatives and the two clergymen interviewed reported no disturbing, suspicious or inappropriate behaviours towards young women.[19]While partially accepting responsibility for his behaviour, D.M. maintained that the relationship with A.C. was consensual.He portrayed her as pursuing a malicious and vindictive financial agenda against him.Several of his family members share this view.[20]The report suggests that the offender would benefit from sex offender programming andreporting to probation and community supervision as part of a sentence.Conditions recommended are that he report to a probation and parole officer, have no direct or indirect contact with A.C., and attend for assessment and/or counselling at the Manasa Clinic and follow their recommendations as directed by the probation and parole officer.[21]D.M. provided 27 letters of reference.These letters were overwhelmingly positive in their praise of D.M.I will state the highlights of these letters. A letter from Reverend Douglas G. MacKenzie, dated March 4, 2011, indicated that he has known D.M. for 32 years and came to know him when he was minister of Asbury West United Church in Toronto.He wrote that he found D.M. to be an honest and hardworking person who is well-respected within the church and community.He performed the marriage of two of D.M.’s sons and the brides had only positive things to say about their father-in-law.[22]A letter from Reverend Jim Keenan of New Hope United Church, dated March 9, 2011, describes D.M. as someone that he has known since the church first opened its doors in September 2007.Reverend Keenan found D.M. to be a person who has proven to be someone to count on.He is generous with his time and money with respect to the church community.He noted D.M. to be well-respected by the women as well as the men of all ages in the community.He has never noted D.M. to be aggressive or exploitive.[23]A letter from Mrs. Rai Sagar of the Fiji Hindu Cultural and Charitable Organization of Toronto, dated March 1, 2011, indicates that D.M. has served as an officer of that organization in the past and been an active member for over 12 years.She indicates that D.M. has contributedto improving the operations of the organization, including providing his place of business for meetings, donating money and gifts, and assisting, planning and running large events.[24]A letter from Mr. Sam Chopra, president of South Asians in Ontario Organization, dated January 2011, indicates that D.M. has been a member of their organization since 1996.He has helped organized events, is hardworking and kind, and always made donations to the club.[25]Ms. Theresa Opoqu, of Brookstone Relief Services, wrote on March 1, 2011 that D.M.’s business has donated clothing, trophies, stationery, customized pens, notepads and bags to needy children and their families in Ghana.[26]Mr. Christopher Bhatty, the director of the Christopher Career Institute in New Delhi, India, provided a letter of appreciation dated February 1, 2011 thanking D.M. for his sponsorship and support to the Institute for so many years.His monetary gift was used for educating underprivileged children who could not otherwise afford to go to school.[27]D.M.’s wife, P.M., provided a letter to the court dated March 7, 2011.P.M. described her husband as being ashamed, embarrassed and humiliated by the fact that a short-term love affair 22 years ago is being looked at as a sexual assault today.[28]D.M’s stepson, A.M. (son of P.M.), writes on March 13, 2011 that D.M. has treated him as his own son since he was 16 years old.He described D.M. as an essential and vital influence in his life to the point where he and his brother decided to legally change their last names to that of D.M.’s because he was the only father that he and his brother ever had.He also described D.M. as an amazing grandfather to his 17-month-old daughter J.M.[29]D.M.’s biological son, M.M., provided a letter to the court indicating that he has learned many things from his father, including honesty, integrity, hard work, compassion and helping others.He has never seen women or children uncomfortable when socializing with his father and the issues that have arisen in relation to this matter have shaken M.M.to the core.He believes that the offences are out of character for his father.There were also letters from customers of D.M.’s business, including Justin James of IGN Connection, who wrote that he has dealt with D.M. and his business since 1996, found him a pleasure to deal with and found his establishment as one with a good proven work ethic.A letter dated March 11, 2011, from Savitri Bangaroo of Embroidery Boutique, stated that he had known D.M. for 10 years through D.M.’s business and found him to be an honest, kind and hardworking person.[30]There were many other letters from relatives, both close and distant, which had extremely positive things to say about D.M.Impact on the Victim[31]The impact of the offences on A.C. cannot be overstated.She provided the court with a written victim impact statement which she read out in court.The statement detailed her past and present struggles.Not surprisingly, she has been devastated by the abuse against her.[32]A.C. then detailed the impact of the abuse.The interruptions in her life and school routine caused by the sexual assaults forced her to quit school at the age of 17 and begin working.This was never her plan; she had been an excellent student in Fiji and had come to Canada for a better life and an education.[33]A.C. also detailed the effects of the abuse on her health, which included being forced to go on birth control pills at age 16 and eating for comfort.She now suffers from migraines and grinds her teeth to the point of requiring a night guard.She fears authority and has difficulty trusting men.[34]In order to escape her abusive situation, she requested that her aunt arrange a marriage for her.Unfortunately, the marriage was a disaster because her husband was verbally, emotionally and physically violent.He became more violent when he found out that A.C. was not a virgin when they married.[35]She left the marriage with her son and struggled financially for many years.She finds herself in her 40s and living with her parents because she is unable to cope with being on her own.She described herself as feeling emotionally violated, robbed of her youth and having fulfilled the role of being D.M.’s slave when she came to Canada.After she left her husband, she felt traumatized by phone calls from D.M. and lived in fear of his calls; this was partly why she moved in with her parents.In addition to these consequences of the offences, like many victims of sexual assault, A.C. felt further victimized as a result of her disclosure of the abuse.Legal Parameters[36]The Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 provides the following sentences for the offences for which the accused has been convicted:(i)For sexual assault, a maximum of 10 years imprisonment;(ii)For sexual touching, a maximum of 10 years and a minimum of 45 days; and(iii)For invitation to sexual touching, a maximum of 10 years and a minimum of 45 days.The Position of the Crown and Defence[37]The Crown seeks a penitentiary term of seven years on the sexual assault, and three years concurrent on each of the other two offences.The Crown also seeks an order that D.M. provide a DNA sample, a weapons prohibition, an order that D.M. comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act, S.C. 2004, c. 10 for life and an order prohibiting communication between D.M. and A.C. and her family, and prohibiting him from being within 100 metres of her place of education, residence or employment..[38]The Crown argues that this is an appropriate case for a seven-year penitentiary sentence based on aggravating factors which include the parties’ age gap, A.C.’s vulnerability, D.M.’s abuse of his position of trust and his use of extortion to gain compliance and maintain secrecy.[39]The Defence seeks a conditional sentence.Mr. Pearson argues that such a sentence is not barred because of section 11(1) of the Charter.At the time of commission of these offences, no minimum sentences existed and D.M. could not have known that sentences in this area would become more harsh.[40]Section 742.1 of the Criminal Code stipulates three requirements for a conditional sentence:(i)That the sentence be below two years;(ii)That there be no applicable minimum sentences (there were none at the time of the offence); and(iii)That the community not be at risk.[41]The case of R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61 added a further condition that the conditional sentence must be consistent with other sentencing principles, including deterrence.[42]The Defence submitted that a conditional sentence can provide the appropriate deterrence because there is no early release and there are strict conditions.Mr. Pearson argued that this offender does not need to be taken out of the community. Rehabilitation is not required because he is a first-time offender and his actions over the 20 years since the offence speak to his involvement in the community.The offender has been on bail and has come to court as required.He has never breached his release terms.[43]This offender has no history of non-compliance and section 718.2(d) requires the court to consider the least restrictive sanctions.In this case, it is important for the court to consider that the offender supports both his family and the community.He is one of those exceptional offenders that falls outside the normal three to five-year range.No aggravating factors exist to bring this case into the upper range, and if a penitentiary sentence is ordered, the defence argues that it should be close to the lower end of the three to five-year range.[44]The Defence position is that this offender has acknowledged that he has done wrong and has a sense of responsibility.He did not view himself as being in a position of authority and still takes the view that the relationship was a consensual one.Further, since the victim resides in British Columbia, there is no risk of contact that might otherwise give rise to concern on the part of the court.Principles of Sentencing[45]Section 718 of the Criminal Code outlines the purpose of sentencing:The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.[46]Section 718.1 provides that “[a] sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.”[47]Section 718.2(a) provides that “a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances”.It sets out various aggravating factors to be specifically considered, which I will comment on further momentarily.Section 718.2 also requires that a sentence be similar to those imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances, that an offender not be deprived of liberty if less restrictive sanctions are appropriate, and that all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances be considered.[48]There is no dispute that the most important principles in this sentencing are denunciation, deterrence, the promotion of a sense of responsibility in the offender and an acknowledgement of the harm done to the complainant.DiscussionA.Section 724(3)[49]In a jury trial the trial judge must make findings as to the role of the accused before imposing a sentence.However, the judge is bound by any necessary implication from the jury’s verdict.Where disputed facts exist, the court may make findings based on the evidence at trial.More specifically, if there is a disputed fact that is relevant to the determination of a sentence, section 724(3)(e) states: “the prosecutor must establish, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of any aggravating fact or any previous conviction by the offender.”[50]The Crown’s position is that based on A.C.’s evidence, intercourse began in September 1988 and continued to March 1991.A.C.’s evidence was that intercourse occurred two to three times a week.If it occurred two times a week over that period, intercourse would have taken place 246 times.If it occurred three times a week over that period, it would have occurred 374 times.[51]The defence requests that I accept D.M.’s evidence on the same point.D.M.’s evidence was that there were eight incidents of intercourse over a three-year period. D.M. testified that the sexual activity was consensual.[52]The frequency of sexual activity is an aggravating factor which must be taken into account on sentencing.The Crown submits that the sexual activity was progressive starting with D.M. touching A.C.’s breast and vagina, asking her to touch his penis, putting his finger in her vagina, the carrot episode, oral sex, and eventually sexual intercourse.The sexual intercourse started from the time A.C. was 16 years of age and continued until the age of 19.[53]A.C.’s evidence was that D.M. would come to her bed every night and touch her in the vaginal area and ask her to touch his penis.A.C. estimated that the touching incidents went on for several weeks.Once she was requested to make D.M.’s tea, the bedroom touching ceased and began to occur on the couch in the living room or in the basement.After a period of time which A.C. estimated to be a few months after the downstairs touching had started, D.M. began to penetrate her vagina with his penis.[54]Based on the timeline described by A.C. and her evidence that the initial breast touching began in March 1988, the nighttime touching lasting a few weeks, and the intercourse beginning a few months after the nighttime touching ceased, this would put the commencement of intercourse around the end of the summer of 1988.I rely on A.C.’s evidence that the carrot incident and D.M.’s request that she watch pornographic videos both occurred in the summer of 1988.I accept this evidence as a form of grooming on the part of D.M. to ready A.C. for sexual intercourse.I find therefore that sexual intercourse between D.M. and A.C. commenced in September 1988.[55]A.C. was uncertain as to how often intercourse occurred.Her estimate was two to three times a week.Her estimate with respect to how often intercourse occurred was vague because at one point, she said that she could not recall if it occurred in the basement or on the living room couch.She was somewhat certain it mostly happened in the basement.She could not recall if D.M. wore a condom or if he was circumcised.At times, she said sexual intercourse occurred in D.M.’s car or in his bed.The inference from that evidence was that on those days sexual intercourse did not occur in the basement or the living room couch.[56]A.C.’s evidence is somewhat contradicted by that of her aunt, L.M., who said that D.M. was disconnected from the family and never spent any time with them.D.M. and A.C. would be alone at times such as when L.M. went out for a “girls night out,” in the morning from about to 6:00 to 6:30 a.m., and the occasional Sunday when L.M. went out with the children.[57]L.M. did not observe any change in A.C.’s behaviour towards D.M. during the entire time that A.C. lived there.L.M. had a close relationship with A.C., and A.C. confided in her since A.C. felt alone and culturally displaced in Canada.[58]D.M.’s evidence was that he did not touch A.C.’s breast and the touching incidents in A.C.’s bed did not occur.An affair began between them when A.C. expressed concern about how L.M. was treating D.M.D.M. tried to explain that he was a married man but A.C. pursued him.About two years after A.C. arrived in Canada, they began to have sexual intercourse on consent, but it was initially A.C.’s suggestion.[59]D.M. and A.C. entered into an informal agreement whereby if she made his tea in the morning, he would pick her up from work in the evenings.He would knock on her door at 5:45 a.m. and he would come down about 6:15 a.m. to drink his tea and eat his breakfast.He then made his lunch and left for work. D.M. and A.C. were alone together downstairs in the morning.According to D.M. they had sexual intercourse on one occasion in the morning. Sexual activity did not occur as often as A.C. said it did in the morning because there was insufficient time for such activity before D.M. left for work.[60]D.M. recalled they had sex in his bed one day when his wife was away.In his statement to police, he agreed that he and A.C. had sex about once a month in the living room but then told the police that it was just kissing and hugging.He told the police in a voluntary statement that he and A.C. had had sex eight times in total.D.M. denied that he threatened A.C. with deportation, that he kept in touch with her after she left his home in 1991, or that he continued to communicate with her for the purpose of ensuring that she did not tell others about the sexual activity.[61]A.C. regarded D.M. as a person who was in a position of authority over her.She called L.M. and D.M. “auntie” and “uncle”.Although they were not technically her aunt and uncle, these terms were used as a sign of respect and closeness in their culture. Her stay with them was an open-ended arrangement with no specific agreement as to when she would leave.A.C.’s evidence was that she considered L.M. and D.M. to be the equivalent of parents.She listened to them and obeyed them.They were her legal guardians for school purposes.She felt like their daughter.She was fully a member of their household and in exchange for room and board (at least prior to her becoming employed) she helped take care of the children, did laundry, dishes, ironing and other household chores as instructed by L.M.She was financially dependent on L.M. and D.M. because she had come to Canada with only $100.00.She depended on them to help her integrate into Canadian culture, to feed her, clothe her and look after her basic needs.[62]The evidence of A.C.’s mother, D.P., was that when her daughter went to Canada, L.M. would have the primary responsibility of looking after her and disciplining her if necessary.Since D.M. was L.M.’s husband, his part as a father figure was understood by everyone involved..[63]L.M.’s evidence was that she and D.M. discussed A.C. coming to live in their home.D.M. agreed to the arrangement and also agreed to adopt A.C. when L.M. suggested it.Ultimately, no adoption took place but that did not stop L.M. from thinking of A.C. as her daughter.L.M. testified that A.C.’s parents gave her full authority over their daughter.She bought clothes for her, enrolled her in school, helped her with her immigration papers and acted as a caregiver.Although L.M. was the person mostly involved in assigning household duties to A.C., D.M. occasionally asked her to do things.L.M. also helped with A.C.’s arranged marriage and accompanied her to Vancouver to meet her future husband.[64]D.M.’s evidence was that he knew nothing about the arrangement that A.C. would live with his family until she came to his home.L.M. did not discuss it with him in advance and he was not involved in paying for A.C.’s airfare.He had no forewarning of her arrival.D.M. was unsure about what A.C. would be doing when she arrived in their home but L.M. informed him that A.C. would be going to school.L.M. was to take care of her.D.M. was not resentful about A.C. staying with them because she was a family member.[65]Although D.M. agreed that A.C. looked up to him and respected him as an older family member and an authority figure in her life, he denied that he took the place of a parent.He denied that he could be described as her guardian and stated that he had never signed anything to that effect.He agreed that A.C. called him “uncle” and his wife “auntie” throughout the time she lived with them.[66]D.M. testified that he got along well with A.C. and that his relationship with L.M. was intact at the time that A.C. was there.D.M. denied taking advantage of A.C. when he knew she was young, vulnerable and new to the country.He did agree that having sexual intercourse with A.C. was likely a mistake, but that he was only human.[67]There is no issue that sexual activity occurred in this case.The issue for the purposes of section 724 of the Criminal Code is how often the activity occurred with respect to it being an aggravating circumstance to be considered on sentencing.The Defence argues that there is no reason why this court should not accept that the sexual activity occurred eight times as indicated by the accused in his testimony.For the Defence, it is not reconcilable that the sexual intercourse occurred 374 times as submitted by the Crown.The evidence simply does not support that in the view of the Defence.[68]There is no doubt that the jury by its verdict determined that D.M. was in a position of trust or authority towards A.C. or that A.C. was in a relationship of dependency with D.M. for the purposes of counts 2 and 3.With respect to count 1, I am satisfied by their verdict that the jury found that A.C. did not consent because she viewed D.M. as a person who exercised authority over her.That is, he was someone with the power to influence her conduct and actions as a result of the threat of deportation, his position as “uncle”, and a person on whom she depended for financial support.[69]With respect to count 2, A.C. indicated that she would be tired the next day and sometimes fell asleep in class.She also testified that D.M. would come to her every night and the same type of touching would occur.I accept her evidence to mean that D.M. touched her every school night, which would be five nights a week in one month or approximately 20 evenings.With respect to count 3, A.C. testified that after the nighttime touching ceased and the morning touching began, that D.M. would make A.C. touch and rub his penis and he would put his finger in her vagina while they were on the living room couch.Sometimes these incidents occurred in the basement.This type of touching progressed to sexual intercourse which began several months later.Based on A.C.’s evidence that the touching on the downstairs couch in the basement occurred on the mornings that she prepared tea for D.M. and that it happened almost every morning, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that it occurred three mornings a week over a period of three months, or approximately 36 times.[70]With respect to the sexual intercourse, I reject the offenders’s evidence that it occurred only eight times over a period of three years.I also reject his evidence that it did not start until A.C. had been living in the home of D.M. and L.M. for two years.I find his original evidence that it occurred once a month is more consistent with A.C.’s evidence that sexual intercourse was an ongoing activity.I also accept that D.M.’s request that A.C. touch his penis (which A.C. testified sometimes resulted in him ejaculating) and him inserting his finger into her vagina replaced sexual intercourse on occasion.I accept A.C.’s evidence that sexual intercourse occurred in other places and at other times than the morning incidents, including in D.M.’s bedroom and in his car.On that basis I therefore conclude that sexual intercourse did not occur as frequently as A.C. said it did, but that it occurred more frequently than D.M. said it did.As such, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt thatA.C. and D.M. had sexual intercourse four times per month over a period of 31 months (i.e. from September 1988 up to and including March 1991), being approximately 124 times.Aggravating and Mitigating Circumstances[71]Section 718.2 of the Criminal Code mandates that the court consider any relevant mitigating or aggravating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender that may increase or reduce the sentence to be imposed.[72]There are a number of aggravating circumstances present here, including the following:(i)The complainant was under the age of 18 during the majority of times when the offences were committed.(ii)D.M. abused a position of trust and authority while A.C. was in a relationship of dependency to him.(iii)D.M. took advantage of the fact that A.C. was young and vulnerable as a new immigrant. D.M.’s threat of deportation was a theme throughout the trial and A.C. took this threat seriously.There would have been cultural shame in her leaving her aunt’s home and returning to Fiji, and according to A.C. it would have been impossible for her to retain any status as a young woman in Fiji when it became known that she was no longer a virgin.(iv)The abuse was repeated, constant and spanned for three years of A.C.’s residency with D.M. and L.M..(v)D.M. violated A.C.’s dignity and sexual integrity.(vi)He groomed A.C. by preparing her for sexual activity.He forced her to watch pornographic videotapes and inserted a carrot into her vagina in preparation for intercourse.(vii)These circumstances changed the course of A.C.’s life, resulting in a forced arranged marriage which turned out to be abusive.She left school because she could not maintain her grades while D.M.’s abuse was ongoing.She retained a sense of cultural shame that she married without her virginity intact.[73]By way of mitigating circumstances, I find the following:(i)The offender has no prior criminal record.(ii)He has had a steady employment record.(iii)He has followed his bail conditions without incident.(iv)He has been a contributing member of society with respect to both his family and his community.The letters of support which have already been reviewed in detail describe someone who, apart from this incident, takes family values seriously and is committed to helping both the South Asian and the local communities.The complainant was forced to testify at the preliminary inquiry and at trial.The accused has not accepted responsibility for the offences and expresses no remorse for them, other than indicating that he made a moral mistake.While these are not, of course, aggravating factors, their absence reflects the absence of what would otherwise bemitigating circumstances.[74]There is a significant gap in the position of counsel about the applicable sentencing range for this offence.The Crown says a penitentiary sentence of seven years on the sexual assault with three years concurrent on each of the sexual exploitation and invitation to sexual touching count would be appropriate.[75]The Crown’s position is that denunciation and deterrence are the primary objectives in sexual offences committed by persons in a position of authority.The Crown also relies on section 718.2(a)(iii) requiring that this court take into consideration the fact that the offender abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim and that this is mandated by statute to be an aggravating circumstance.The Crown’s position is that a conditional sentence is not available because of the mandatory minimum sentences in relation to section 153.[76]The Crown presented a significant number of cases, but relied mostly on R. v. D.D. (2002), 2002 CanLII 44915 (ON CA), 58 O.R. (3d) 788 (C.A.).In this case, the accused was sentenced to eight years on each count concurrently.The case involved an accused convicted of numerous sexual offences related to four boys each between the ages of 5 and 8 years.The accused stood in a position of trust to all four boys.The offending conduct included masturbation, group sex, oral sex and attempted and actual anal intercourse.The accused assaulted the boys and threatened them in an effort to maintain their silence.One boy, for instance, was hung over a balcony some 30 floors off the ground in an act of intimidation.The accused also had compromising photographs of some of the boys which he threatened to make public if they exposed his offences.[77]R. v. D.D. is frequently cited in cases involving the sexual abuse of children.Moldaver J.A., in a particularly strongly-worded ruling, at para. 35 cited the concern for protecting our children from the harm caused by sexual offenders.Children, he reflected, are our most valued, and at the same time, most valuable assets, manifestly incapable of defending themselves against predators.He summarized his ruling at para. 44 as follows:To summarize, I am of the view that as a general rule, when adult offenders, in a position of trust, sexually abuse innocent young children on a regular and persistent basis over substantial periods of time, they can expect to receive mid to upper single digit penitentiary terms.When the abuse involves full intercourse, anal or vaginal, and it is accompanied by other acts of physical violence, threats of physical violence, or other forms of extortion, upper single digit to low double digit penitentiary terms will generally be appropriate.[78]In this case, D.M. is clearly an adult offender in a position of trust.He abused a young woman on a regular and persistent basis over a substantial period of time.The abuse involved full intercourse, and although not accompanied by violence or threats of violence, the threat of deportation was significant and created an overwhelming sense of vulnerability in the victim.It follows, the Crown argues, that seven years is appropriate.There are, of course, distinguishing factors between this case and those of R. v. D.D., which I will return to momentarily.[79]In R. v. O.B., 2008 CanLII 57165 (ON SC), 2008 CanLII 57165 (Ont. S.C.) at para. 28 and following, Molloy J. addressed the apparent conflict in applicable ranges reflected in R. v. D.D. on other cases such as R. v. B.(J.) (1990), 36 O.A.C. 307 (C.A.).In R. v. B.(J.), the accused was convicted of sexual assault and indecent assault on his stepdaughter.He began having sexual intercourse with her when she was six years old and continued to have frequent intercourse with her until she was 14 years old.The sexual assaults were not, other than on one occasion, accompanied by violence.The trial judge sentenced the accused to eight years for the sexual assault and five years concurrent for indecent assault.On appeal, both counsel agreed that the appropriate sentencing range for offences of this nature was three to five years.While the court did not appear to take issue with that expression of the appropriate range, the trial judge’s global sentence of eight years was upheld.[80]Subsequently, R. v. B.(J.) has been cited in numerous cases as confirmation of a range of three to five years for sexual intercourse with children by a person in a position of trust.[81]Returning to R. v. O.B., the accused was found guilty of sexual assault, sexual interference and invitation to sexual touching against his two stepdaughters. The offences, which took place when the girls were between the ages of 9 and 13 and 7 and 11, respectively, included multiple incidents of sexual touching, two incidents of sexual intercourse and one invitation to perform fellatio. As a result of one of the incidents of sexual intercourse, one of the girls became pregnant. The accused was sentenced to nine years imprisonment for the assaults against the first victim and two years imprisonment for the assaults against the second victim, to be served consecutively for a total of 11 years imprisonment.[82]Molloy J. considered both R. v. B.(J.) and R. v. D.D. and held at para. 30 that R. v. B.(J.) must be re-evaluated against the Court of Appeal’s decision in R. v. D.D.That said, she recognized, and I agree, that ranges of sentences are meant to be guidelines only, and, as Molloy J. stated at para. 33, “subject to the decision of a trial judge who needs to be flexible in fashioning the sentence appropriate for the unique circumstances of any given case.”[83]It is often stated that it is difficult to reconcile results across sentencing decisions because they are a reflection of the individualized nature of sentencing and the considerable discretion that trial judges have in fashioning sentences.As Chief Justice Lamer stated in R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500 at para. 92: “Sentencing is an inherently individualized process, and the search for a single appropriate sentence for a similar offender and a similar crime will frequently be a fruitless exercise of academic abstraction.”[84].It is hard to imagine how horrible A.C.’s life with D.M.’s family must have been.Every day that she lived there, she either suffered sexual abuse or the fear of it.A.C. was afraid that if her aunt found out, she would be sent back to Fiji.She took D.M.’s threats of deportation seriously.She told the court that she felt helpless, dumb and stupid.She felt like her body had no feeling and that she was operating as if by remote control.She said it made no difference if she told D.M. to stop.He would simply tell her that everything would be okay and continue on.A.C. came to accept that resistance was futile.The best she could do was emotionally disconnect and carry on as best she could. A.C.’s evidence at trial demonstrated a pattern of increasingly intrusive abuse by D.M. between the ages of 16 to 19.The abuse started as touching, progressed to oral sex, both giving and receiving, and ultimately to intercourse.D.M. ensured that A.C. would not get pregnant by monitoring the daily administration of birth control pills.As time went on, D.M. became more outrageous in his demands, requiring that A.C. have sex with him in the master bedroom and in his car after he picked her up from work.At times when his wife and children had plans to go out and wanted to take A.C. with them, he would insist that she stay home and iron his pants.Such ruses were designed solely to isolate A.C. and obtain more opportunities for sexual activity when D.M.’s wife and children were out of the house.[85]The Crown also referred to R. v. R.G., 2010 ONSC 4082 (CanLII).In this case, the offender received a six and-a-half year sentence with three months credit for pre-sentence custody.In that case, the offender was convicted of sexual assault, sexual interference, sexual exploitation, invitation to sexual touching, incest and uttering threats.The victim was the offender’s daughter whom he began to sexually assault when she was in grade 5.The sexual abuse continued until his daughter moved away when she was approximately 17 years old.The abuse began as touching and progressed to intercourse.The offender had no prior record.As a result of the abuse, the victim had difficulty with close personal relationships, particularly with males, difficulty sleeping at night and low self-esteem.[86]The offender was in a position of trust to the victim and abused his young and innocent daughter on a regular and persistent basis over a substantial period of time.The abuse involved full intercourse accompanied by violence or threats of violence.The abuse had a profound effect on the victim.The sentence received was six and-a-half years imprisonment for the sexual assault, four years concurrent for the incest, one year concurrent for the threatening and a 10-year weapons prohibition, a DNA order, a prohibition under section 161 of the Criminal Code and a requirement that the offender comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for life.[87]Boswell J. in R. v. R.G. relied on R. v. D.D. as useful guidance in terms of the sentencing range, but at para. 59 was careful to distinguish D.D. because in D.D., there were four victims who were somewhat younger than the victim in R.G., the accused in D.D. had a minor criminal record and the violence in D.D. was more severe than in R.G.[88]In support of their position, the defence reviewed a number of cases involving sexual offences where conditional sentences were imposed.[89]In R. v. L.F.W., 2000 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 132, a 21-month conditional sentence was imposed where the victim was the cousin of the offender and was warned not to tell of the activity.The offender at the time of the offence was between ages 22 and 28 and the victim was between the age of 6 and 12.The accused expressed no remorse.The accused had no criminal record and had led a productive life in the 25 years that had passed since the offences were committed.The trial judge determined that no specific deterrence was required.The trial judge found that a conditional sentence was not inappropriate in all of the circumstances. A majority of the Court of Appeal for Newfoundland dismissed the appeal from the Crown, and a majority of the Supreme Court then dismissed the appeal from the Crown.[90]In R. v. F.M., [2002] O.J. No. 5401 (S.C.), the offender was found guilty after trial of touching the genitals and watching pornography with a victim when the victim had been between the ages of 9 and 14.She was a close friend of F.M.’s family.F.M. had acted as a surrogate father for the victim.F.M. was 55 years old and had no criminal record.F.M. was sentenced to two years less a day to be served conditionally followed by three years probation.It was determined there was little risk that F.M. would re-offend and the aggravating circumstances were that the victim was vulnerable and the assaults were repeated.[91]The defence presented a number of other similar cases where conditional sentences were imposed.[92]I agree with the Crown that these cases are not on all fours with the facts before this court.The cases that the defence presented did not involve sexual intercourse.Although there were aggravating circumstances with respect to the ages of the victims, the type of touching that occurred and the vulnerability of the victims, they cannot be realistically considered to represent an appropriate range of sentence in this case.[93]This case is more closely aligned with the facts in R. v. R.G. where the accused was in a position of authority, no violence was threatened and the abuse occurred over a long period of time. However, the victim in that case was far younger than A.C. and the abuse went on for more than twice as long as in this case.[94]I accept that the appropriate range in this case is therefore within the three to five year range.While the aggravating factors are significant in this case, they are not the worst.As such, I do not view this as a case which would merit a sentence in the range that the Crown has suggested.Sentence to be Imposed[95]Accordingly, in all of the circumstances, D.M., I sentence you as follows:(i)On count 1, sexual assault, three years in the penitentiary;(ii)On count 2, sexual touching, one year concurrent;(iii)On count 3, invitation to sexual touching, one year concurrent.[96]In terms of the ancillary orders sought, I make the following additional orders:(i)A DNA order under section 487.051 of the Criminal Code;(ii)An order that D.M. comply with the Sex Offender Information Registration Act for life;(iii)An order that D.M. not communicate with or attend within 500 metres of A.C.’s place of work, education or residence for life.(iv)Under s.109(1)(a) a weapons prohibition for 10 years.___________________________Justice C.

EvansAssistant Crown AttorneyThe issue to be discussedDoes s. 718.02 of the Criminal Code embrace an offence of uttering a death threat to a peace officer even though there is no direct reference to that offence within the terms of the provisions?For the reasons that follow, I find that the question must be answered in the affirmative.The accusationsMr. Valade pleaded guilty on April 28, 2014, to accusations of uttering death threats and to possession of marijuana, prosecuted by way of summary conviction, and a pre-sentence report was ordered.The factual backgroundIt was agreed by the offender that he was extremely intoxicated on the night in question, and that a police officer was requied to investigate his state of health and Mr. Valade was apparebtly passed out in a public washroom.When he came to sufficiently to understand his situation, he called the investigator officer a vile name which is a corruption of the correct scientific name for a precise racial group, one to which he is not a member, to then utter a number of threats of violence including words to the effect that “I will kill you” and included threats of dire violence directed at the officer’s spouse and children.The investigation later disclosed a small quantity of marijuana.The contents of the pre-sentence reportThe pre-sentence report disclosed a prior recprd including a distant and a recent conviction for impaired operation, an assault in 2000, fail to comply with probation and release orders, andmischief.It appears that Mr. Valade’s longest prior jail term was of three days’ duration.Further, the probation officer reported that the offender self-disclosed that he is a workaholic and enjoys a quite satisfactory employment history.It appears obvious that Mr. Valade’s criminal history is directly linked to the abuse of alcohol and other substances, and insight is lacking as there is a direct reference to his record being the result of the actions of others resulting in his picking up a bottle, so to speak, leaving aside his opinion that alcohol use is not problematic.The offender did assume full responsibility for his actions, a commendable attitude, in light of his inability to recall any of his actions on the evening in question.The position of the partiesThe prosecution sought a 30 day jail term, a weapons prohibition for 5 years, a DNA order, and a period of probation for 12 months.The defence submitted that a conditional jail term is fit, emphasizing the guilty pleas and acceptance of responsibility, and the imperative need to protect his employment.The principles of sentencing, especially Parliament’s injunction found at s. 718.02 of the Criminal CodeThe sentencing principles that are at play include s. 718, s. 718.1, s. 718.02 and s. 718.2(d) and (e) of the Criminal Code, the latter two clauses making plain the need to exercise restraint in the selection of a term of imprisonment.More to the point of the present discussion, Parliament decreed recently that peace officers (and other vulnerable groups) ought to be further protected by sentencing courts by means of a specific clause, s. 718.02 of the Criminal Code, which reads:Objectives --offence against peace officer or other justice system participant- 718.02 - When a court imposes a sentence for an offence under subsection 270(1), section 270.01 or 270.02 or paragraph 423.1(1)(b), the court shall give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence of the conduct that forms the basis of the offence.Objectifs -- infraction à l'égard d'un agent de la paix ou autre personne associée au système judiciaire - 718.02 - Le tribunal qui impose une peine pour l'une des infractions prévues au paragraphe 270(1), aux articles 270.01 ou 270.02 ou à l'alinéa 423.1(1)b) accorde une attention particulière aux objectifs de dénonciation et de dissuasion de l'agissement à l'origine de l'infractionShortly put, the sections refer to assaulting a peace officer and intimidation of a justice system participant.Section 718.02 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, is found in Part XXIII, titled “Sentencing”. The provision was enacted by means of S.C. 2009, c. 22, s. 18, and has been in force as of October 2, 2009, under the authority of SI/2009-92.The next three provisions, ss. 270.01, 270.02 and 270.1, respectively, were also enacted by means of S.C. 2009, c. 22, s. 18, and have been in force as of October 2, 2009, under the authority of SI/2009-92. They serve to augment the protection that peace officers should enjoy by creating offences which are equivalent to existing crimes of violence with the added aggravating element that the victim of the offence is a peace officer.Previously, if a constable was the victim of an assault involving a weapon, the charge had to be pursued under s. 267 and not s. 270 of the Code and thus, the record would not obviously point to an offence of violence against those who serve and protect.Further, the offence of disarming a peace officer is new, and addresses an existing concern by elevating what was an aggravating circumstance in sentencing into a separate offence.In light of this legislative enactment, the Court is at liberty to conclude that Parliament’s intent is to protect peace officers by severe sentences, all other things being equal, in the cases involving the precise offences noted above.The question is whether s. 718.02 is engaged in the case of a death threat made to a police officer.For the reasons set out below, I conclude that the spirit of Parliament’s intent is best respected by a generous and liberal interpretation of s. 718.02 in which a reference to uttering threats to a peace officer is understood to be part of parcel of the intent of the legislation.Drawing attention to the legislation in general, R. v. Holloway, 2014 ABCA 87 (CanLII), includes these observations penned by Watson and McDonald JJ.A. in the course of a memorandum of judgment:20 Similarly, s. 718.01 and s. 718.02 of the Code which give primary to denunciation and deterrence objectives are not merely statements of policy respecting only the individual circumstances of the offence or offender, but embody larger statements of Canadian social norms. The same might be said for some of the factors listed in s. 718.2(1)(c) of the Code. Further still, the concept of totality both at common law (respecting multiple offence transactions) or under s. 718.2(c) of the Code (respecting otherwise consecutive sentences) is in service of a broader principle of restraint also reflected in ss. 718.2(d) and (e) of the Code. Under the totality principle, departures even from proportionate sentences for individual offences are sometimes justified on the basis that an accumulation of proportionate consecutive sentences may simply be unacceptable, again as a matter of Canadian social norms.[Emphasis added]It is obvious to the Court that the emphasis is on denunciation and deterrence over other principles.After all, this is what was expresed in R. v. Zarafonitis, 2013 ONCJ 570 (CanLII), by O’Donnell J. at footnote 6 to para. 19: “[…] provisions such as s. 718.02 of the Criminal Code, which requires judges to emphasize denunciation and deterrence over other principles of sentencing when imposing sentences for, e.g. assaults on police officers […]”In my view, the expression “primary consideration” denotes paramountcy in sentencing.In this vein, R. v. Baines, 2013 ABPC 92 (CanLII), includes these remarks:27 While the principles of denunciation and deterrence in cases involving offences against peace officers are statutorily paramount given the provisions of Section of 718.02 of the Criminal Code, the Court of Appeal in the Ponticorvo [2009 ABCA 117] case went on to indicate that in order to give effect to the principles of denunciation and deterrence in cases of this kind, substantial terms of imprisonment are necessary in all but the most unusual circumstances when offences involve violent assaults on police officers. The case before the Court clearly involves a violent assault on a peace officer and requires a substantial term of imprisonment unless \"the most unusual circumstances\" exist. [Emphasis added]An examination of the case law supports the views noted in the paragraphs above, beginning with R. v. Ratt, 2012 SKPC 154 (CanLII), as it provides a good summary of Parliament’s intent to direct primary, but not exclusive, consideration to denunciation and deterrenceIn R. v. Ratt, 2012 SKPC 154 (CanLII), Justice Daunt observed at para. 36:36 Section 718 outlines the fundamental purpose of sentencing, which is \"to contribute ... to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions\" that have one or more of several objectives. Section 718 then lists several objectives of sentencing, including denunciation and deterrence. Apart from the objectives, there are several principles of sentencing, beginning with the fundamental principle in section 718.1: a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. Other principles deal with aggravating and mitigating circumstances, totality, parity, restraint, and especially relevant in this case, the principle that all available sanctions other than jail should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders.The Court then remarked: “38 Denunciation and deterrence are two of the six listed objectives of sentencing. Although the sentence should be primarily designed to achieve those two objectives, the principles of sentencing, such as the Gladue factors [with respect to Aboriginal offenders], must still be addressed in crafting a fit sentence”.Further guidance was consigned at para. 39 as to the need to balance all objectives and principles, though the ranking requires that denunciation and deterrence be given primacy.Indeed: “Parliament chose the phrase ‘primary consideration’ and not ‘sole consideration’. This is in contrast to the Divorce Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.)) subsection 16(8), which dictates that the Court, when dealing with child custody, \"shall take into consideration only the best interests of the child\" [Emphasis added by Daunt J.]. Thus other sentencing objectives remain relevant.The well-reasoned judgment in R. v. Baines, 2013 ABPC 92 (CanLII), includes these remarks, emphasizing that severity is typically called for in cases in which s. 718.02 is engaged27 While the principles of denunciation and deterrence in cases involving offences against peace officers are statutorily paramount given the provisions of Section of 718.02 of the Criminal Code, the Court of Appeal in the Ponticorvo [2009 ABCA 117] case went on to indicate that in order to give effect to the principles of denunciation and deterrence in cases of this kind, substantial terms of imprisonment are necessary in all but the most unusual circumstances when offences involve violent assaults on police officers. The case before the Court clearly involves a violent assault on a peace officer and requires a substantial term of imprisonment unless \"the most unusual circumstances\" exist. [Emphasis added]56 The Criminal Code of Canada, Section 718.02 states that when a court imposes a sentence for an offence against a peace officer or other justice system participant, the court shall give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence when considering the appropriate sentence for the offence. In addition, the Alberta Court of Appeal has stated that in order to give effect to the principles of denunciation and deterrence in cases of this kind, substantial terms of imprisonment are necessary in all but the most unusual circumstances when offences involve violent assaults on police officers. The case before the Court involves a violent assault on a peace officer and therefore requires a substantial term of imprisonment unless \"the most unusual circumstances\" exist. [Emphasis added]Of course, the need for a blended and balanced consideration of all principles in this case, as in all others cases of sentencing, goes without saying.In this vein, R. c. Jacko, 2013 QCCQ 931 (CanLII), includes direct remarks on the need for a sentencing court to balance its application of all relevant principles and objectives.As we read at para. 4 and at para. 5:4 L'article 718.02 C. cr. prévoit que le juge doit accorder une attention particulière aux objectifs de dénonciation et de dissuasion lorsque le délinquant s'est porté à des voies de fait sur un agent de la paix. De plus, afin de déterminer une juste sanction, le Tribunal doit aussi considérer les principes suivants :a)La peine doit être adaptée aux circonstances aggravantes ou atténuantes liées à la perpétration de l'infraction ou à la situation du délinquant;b)L'harmonisation des peines, c'est-à-dire l'infliction de peines semblables à celles infligées à des délinquants pour des infractions semblables commises dans des circonstances semblables;c)L'obligation d'éviter l'excès de nature ou de durée dans l'infliction de peines consécutives;d)L'obligation, avant d'envisager la privation de liberté, d'examiner la possibilité de sanctions moins contraignantes lorsque les circonstances le justifient;e)L'examen de toutes les sanctions substitutives applicables qui sont justifiées dans les circonstances, particulièrement comme en l'espèce en raison de l'origine autochtone de l'accusée.5Enfin, la peine doit être individualisée et personnalisée.In this case, the threat advanced by Mr. Valade included the possibility of repeated violence towards his spouse and children. Noteworthy in this vein is the case of R. v. Morine, 2011 NSSC 46 (CanLII).Para. 67 records a number of aggravating factors, including the deliberate choice “[…] to spit into Constable Wetzel's face, to insult and mock him, and to later threaten to spit in his face again if he had the chance.” Later, this fact was emphasized: “73 […] I take into account that there was a threatened second assault of spitting later, while the opportunity presented itself.”I note as well the instruction found in R. v. Lavallee, 2011 CanLII 6668 (NL PC), 2011 CanLII 6668 (Nfld. Prov. Ct.), at para. 15:It has been held that those who assault peace officers ‘should expect imprisonment’ to be the result (see R. v. Jacobish, [2008] N.J. No. 255 (S.C.), at paragraph 37). In R. v. McArthur, 2004 CanLII 8759 (ON CA), [2004] O.J. No. 721 (C.A.), at paragraph 49, the Ontario Court of Appeal indicated that \"Violent attacks upon police officers who are doing their duty are attacks on the rule of law and on the safety and well-being of the community as a whole. Sentences imposed for those attacks must reflect the vulnerability of the police officers, society's dependence on the police, and society's determination to avoid a policing mentality which invites easy resort to violence in the execution of the policing function.\"For ease of reference, I have reproduced below additional passages from the McArthur decision, 2004 CanLII 8759 (ON CA), 2004 CanLII 8759 (Ont. C.A.), cited immediately above at para. 15 of R. v. Lavallee, 2011 CanLII 6668 (NL PC), 2011 CanLII 6668 (Nfld. Prov. Ct.).This may be said to be the “black letter” expression of the state of sentencing law before the introduction of s. 718.01 of the Criminal Code:[48] A conviction for attempted murder will almost inevitably result in a lengthy penitentiary term. These attempted murders are particularly egregious. They occurred in the course of the respondent’s flight after committing serious crimes. There were four victims, all of whom were seriously hurt and continue to suffer significant adverse effects from the shooting. The respondent used a particularly dangerous weapon which on the evidence was “manufactured to kill”. The shootings were obviously the result of a considered decision by the respondent to use deadly force if he met any resistance from the police. These shooting were the product of a careful plan implemented with deadly detachment and efficiency. Only sheer good luck foiled the respondent’s desire to kill those who would try to stop him.[49] As indicated above, the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society is the fundamental purpose of sentencing. Police officers play a unique and crucial role in promoting and preserving a just, peaceful and safe society. We rely on the police to put themselves in harm’s way to protect the community from the criminal element. At the same time, we rely on the police to act with restraint in the execution of their duties and to avoid the use of any force, much less deadly force, unless clearly necessary. Violent attacks upon police officers who are doing their duty are attacks on the rule of law and on the safety and well-being of the community as a whole. Sentences imposed for those attacks must reflect the vulnerability of the police officers, society’s dependence on the police, and society’s determination to avoid a policing mentality which invites easy resort to violence in the execution of the policing function: R. v. Forrest (1986), 15 O.A.C. 104 at 107 (C.A.).[Emphasis added][50] The murder of a police officer acting in the execution of his duty attracts the highest penalty our law permits: Criminal Code s. 231(4)(a). The respondent did everything within his power to commit that crime.[51] Thankfully, the use of deadly force against police officers by those seeking to avoid capture is relatively rare in Ontario, as is the use of deadly force by police officers against fleeing felons. Counsel could not recall any other case in this Province where an individual seeking to avoid capture attempted to murder and seriously wounded three police officers. We are also unaware of any such case. We cannot think of a more serious case of attempted murder than the shooting of these three police officers.[52] The seriousness of all of the offences committed by the respondent, particularly the attempted murders, and his high level of personal culpability in each and every one of these offences points strongly to life imprisonment as the appropriate sentence.I conclude by noting the unique position in Canadian society occupied by peace officers.In this regard, R. v. Bal, 2013 BCPC 21 (CanLII), reminds us of this generally understood proposition at para. 93:93 Police officers occupy a special and unique position in our society. Section 718.02 gives primary consideration for denunciation and deterrence in cases of persons assaulting peace officers. \"The public places a great deal of trust in police officers […]” Regina v. Sweet, 2007 BCPC 240 (CanLII), para. 31.ConclusionIn conclusion, it may be said that there is nothing remarkable about the contents of s. 718.02 of the Criminal Code as it may be suggested that it merely codifies the existing common law sentencing approach, but with a view to emphasizing Parliament’s will that police officers be the subject of an express “aggravating clause” in order to better protect them from violence, on the one hand, and in order to make plain that the Courts will respond with severity to any harm visited upon members of this protected class. The aggravating impact of violence against a peace officer, as a member of a protected class, was made plain in R. v. Miller, 2002 CanLII 45072 (ON CA), 2002 CanLII 45072 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 7:[7] The trial judge … [was not] unmindful that the victim was a police officer, of whose profession this Court has said:Police officers, in the performance of their duties, are the representatives of the whole community, and an attack upon them is an attack upon the structure of a civilized society.Further, police officers, in the performance of their duties, are often in a position of special vulnerability and are entitled to such protection as the law can give.R. v. Forrest (1986), 15 O.A.C. 104, at 107, per Zuber J.A.Thus, surely Parliament intended that aggravating weight in accordance with s. 718.02 be assigned to offences of uttering a death threat to a peace officer, as occurred in this instance, all other things being equal.In the result, a 30 day jail term is imposed, together with a 5 year weapons prohibition, a D.N.A. order, and a victim fine surcharge."}

BrissetteAgent for Federal ProsecutorA. McLeodCounsel for Mr. Moffatt******March 6th, 2012REASONS FOR SENTENCEMulligan, J.(Orally):[1]Mr. Moffatt, do you have anything to say before I pronounce sentenceMR. MOFFATT:No, thank you.THE COURT:You may be seated.[2]Mr. Moffatt pleaded guilty to three counts on an eight count indictment on October 12th, 2011.Alvin Moffatt pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking, contrary to s. 5.2 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, production of marijuana contrary to s. 7(1) of the Controlled Drug and Substances Act, and possession of a weapon, brass knuckles, contrary to s.88 of the Criminal Code of Canada.[3]Prior to the plea, Moffatt brought an application attacking the validity of the search warrant seeking to have the evidence seized excluded, pursuant to s.24(2) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.For reasons issued October 20th, 2011, the defence application was dismissed.The sentencing hearing was adjourned so that a pre-sentence report and an electronic monitoring report could be obtained.The sentencing hearing took place on January 11, 2012.The offender appeared with his counsel, who made submissions on his behalf.A pre-sentence report was filed together with an electronic monitoring report.Both Crown and defence counsel submitted casebooks, setting out their respective positions for an appropriate sentence for this offender.The Crown submits that a fit sentence should be 12 months of incarceration followed by a period of probation together with ancillary orders.The defence submits that this is a proper case for a conditional sentence of imprisonment, for a period of two years less a day together with a three-year probation period to follow.The defence does not oppose the ancillary orders sought.The following are my reasons for sentence.[4]There is no dispute as to the summary of facts submitted by the Crown.On June 23rd, 2010, the South Simcoe Police Services entered Mr. Moffatt’s home in Bradford pursuant to a search warrant.Among the items seized were: 451 marijuana plants at various stages of development, 54 bags of marijuana seeds together with growing paraphernalia including grow lights, shades, ballast, trays, rigs, water reservoirs, and humidity and temperature monitors.Police seized receipts indicating that the grow operation had been operating since the spring of 2008.Brass knuckles were also located in the residence.Mr. Moffatt was cooperative with the police.THE OFFENDER[5]The Crown filed a pre-sentence report which made reference to Mr. Moffatt’s previous record, which is not disputed.In 2007, he was convicted of marijuana production pursuant to s.7(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substance Act.He received a 12 month conditional sentence and a 12 month probation order.In 2008, he was convicted of assault and given a conditional discharge plus 18 months probation.[6]Mr. Moffatt is 34 years of age.His parents separated when he was an infant.He had difficulty in elementary school and was identified as a high needs student.He spent some time in group homes.He returned home as a teenager but left home when he was 17 or 18 to seek employment.He has a positive work record with nearly continuous employment.He had a long term domestic relationship which terminated with a domestic assault charge for which he received a conditional discharge as previously mentioned.[7]The pre-sentence report indicates that he is a long term user of marijuana, but he reports that he has not used marijuana since his arrest on these charges.[8]The report indicates that he was cooperative with the author of the pre-sentence report and he was cooperative with the police in connection with these charges.It appears that he responded well to community supervision with respect to the previous order and completed some counselling programs successfully.As the author of the report indicates in his assessment:“This is a recidivist with two previous terms of communitysupervision.One was for very similar offences to do withproducing drugs, namely growing marijuana.He served aconditional sentence plus probation.He has also had aterm of probation for domestic assault which was for 18months.”[9]The author of the pre-sentence report makes a number of recommendations including that Mr. Moffatt seek counselling for substance abuse and attend life skills counselling.POSITIONS OF CROWN AND DEFENCE[10]As noted, the Crown seeks a term of incarceration of 12 months followed by a period of probation.Defence submits that this is a proper case for a conditional sentence of two years less a day together with an electronic monitoring program and a period of probation.PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[11]Parliament has now codified many former common law principles in the Criminal Code of Canada.Section 718 describes the fundamental purpose of sentencing to be “to contribute along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions.”[12]The Code sets out six objectives for sentencing judges to consider.(i)to denounce unlawful conduct;(ii)to deter the offender and others fromcommitting offences;(iii)to separate offenders from society where necessary;(iv)to assist in the rehabilitation of offenders;(v)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(vi)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledge the harm done to victims in the community.[13]The Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c19, provides additional sentencing principles at para.10(1):“Without restricting the generality of the Criminal Code, the fundamental purpose of any sentence for offence under this part is to contribute to the respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society while encouraging rehabilitation, and treatment in appropriate circumstances, of offenders and acknowledging the harm done to victims and to the community.”AGGRAVATING FACTORS AND MITIGATING FACTORS[14]Section 10(2) requires the Court to consider any relevant aggravating factors including previous convictions fordesignated substance offences and the involvement of a weapon.[15]There are a number of aggravating factors here.Mr. Moffatt has a criminal record for two offences.The offences are recent and one of them is very similar to the matters before the Court.The previous offences did not involve a weapon offence.In this case, Mr. Moffatt has pleaded guilty to possession of brass knuckles.[16]Mr. Moffatt was conducting his marijuana operation from his residence in a residential area of the community.Mr. Moffatt had a substantial amount of marijuana plants on hand together with dried marijuana and packaging seeds and growing paraphernalia.The quantity found and the receipts going back for one or two years prior to the seizure indicate thatthis was a sophisticated operation conducted for no purpose other than commercial gain.MITIGATING FACTORS[17]Mr. Moffatt has maintained a positive work record over the years in spite of his lack of formal education.[18]Mr. Moffatt had entered a guilty plea with respect to the three counts before the Court.[19]Mr. Moffatt has been cooperative with the police and with the author of the pre-sentence report and has attended counselling when recommended.[20]While on probation previously, Mr. Moffatt was not charged with any breaches of the probation orders.THE STEP PRINCIPLE[21]Mr. Moffatt has a previous criminal record for a similar offence.The step principle discourages a dramatic increase in penalty but recognizes the need for an increased penalty for a similar offence.In R. v. McRea, [2008] BCCA 227, Mr. Justice Smith described the step principle as follows:“The theory of the “step” approach is that, when an offender has a previous record for arelated offence, the sentence should be escalated since the offender was not deterred by the previous sentence, but the escalation should be in moderate steps.”[22]The Crown provided a casebook with a number of decisions from the Ontario Court of Appeal and other courts in support of its position that a period of incarceration of 12 months is required in this case to provide specific deterrence to Mr. Moffatt and general deterrence to others in the community who may wish to attempt to profit by similar ventures.Because of Mr. Moffatt’s previous recent conviction for a similar offence, the Crown opposes a conditional period of imprisonment.[23]Defence counsel provides cases in support of its position that a conditional sentence would be appropriate in the circumstances of this case.In addition, defence provided discussion as to why the cases relied on by the Crown could be distinguished on the facts applicable to this case and the circumstances of this offender.[24]The Court of Appeal has provided guidance as to whether or not a conditional sentence is appropriate for offences of this nature.In R. v. Jacobson, 2006 CanLII 12292 (ON CA), 2006 Carswell Ont. 2331, Rosenberg J.A. stated at para 31:…It could not be said that a lengthy conditional sentence with strict terms would have been unfit, although in my opinion a conditional sentence for a cultivation operation of this magnitude in a residential area would be rare, even for a first offender.[25]On the facts of that case, the Court substituted a six month custodial sentence for an 18 month conditional sentence based on fresh evidence as to the accused’s mental health problems and his clinical issues.[26]In R. v. Nguyen, [2007]ONCA, 645, La Forme J.A. repeated this principle that a conditional sentence for a cultivation operation in a residential area would be rare, and upheld the trial judge’s decision of the imposition of a 15 month period of imprisonment.The facts of that case indicated that 1121 plants were seized together with 18 pounds of harvested marijuana in addition to the theft of electricity.On those facts, the Court stated at para. 47:“The trial judge determined that these circumstances required the need for denunciation and general deterrence that could not be achieved through a conditional sentence.She was entitled to do so.This was not one of those rare cases.”[27]The Court went on to note that as well that the 15 month sentence of imprisonment imposed by the trial judge could be considered somewhat high but was not outside the range.The Court of Appeal did not interfere with that sentence.[28]The Crown submits that R. v. Lozinski [2009] O.J. No. 5494 (O.C.J.)provides a basis for a custodial sentence in circumstances such as these.In Lozinski, Zisman J. rejected a conditional sentence for an offender who pleaded guilty to possession of weapons dangerous, production of marijuana and possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking.That offence involved the discovery of 264 marijuana plants together with growing paraphernalia in the offender’s home.The offender pleaded guilty and had no criminal record, and had completed a substance abuse program prior to the sentencing hearing.The Court imposed a period of eight months incarceration and noted at para 20.“In my view, a conditional sentence is not appropriate in the circumstance of this offence, and for this particular offender.Denunciation and general deterrence mandate a custodial sentence.It is only by sentencing the defendant to incarceration that a strong message can be sent to like-minded individuals that establishgrow operations in residential communities will not be tolerated and will have serious consequences.”[29]Counsel for the defence submits that this is one of the rare cases where conditional sentences ought to be considered.The defence seeks to distinguish this case from other referred to by the Crown on the basis that the number of plants found or the lack of hydro theft charges lower the seriousness of the circumstances here.[30]Defence counsel relied on R. v. Gorcsi, 2011 Caswell Ont. 11967 (O.C.J.) for the proposition that a conditional sentence can still be considered by the Court for an offender who does have a previous record.In Gorcsi, the offender pleaded guilty to a single count of possession of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking.Marijuana was seized during the execution of a search warrant at the offender’s home.However, as Harpur J. noted in Gorcsi, the offender’s previous convictions were dated and unrelated and the offender was in a stable relationship and had a broad and supportive network of friends.The Court noted that a conditional sentence will be rare for participants in commercial level trafficking, but noted as to specific deterrence for this offender:“As to specific deterrence, Mr. Gorcsi has undergone the process of arrest and public prosecution.His broad social network is aware of his commission of this offence.His reputation in the community as a law abiding citizen has been destroyed.In short, a custodial sentence is not required to discourage Mr. Gorcsi from recidivism; he could not be mistaken about the many dangerous consequences of his conduct even without the prospect of a jail term.”[31]I am satisfied that the range of sentence for these types of offences would be in the range of less than two years, therefore a conditional period of sentence merits consideration.The Supreme Court of Canada provided guidance as to when a conditional period of sentence ought to be considered in R. v. Proulx, [2001] S.C.R. 61.However, as the Court noted at para 106:“There may be certain circumstances in which the need for denunciation is so pressing that incarceration will be the only suitable way in which to express society’s condemnation of the offender’s conduct.”[32]I am satisfied that a conditional sentence is not an appropriate sentence for this offender with respect to these offences.If a conditional period of sentence is to be considered rare for a first offender, then it will be rarer still for an offender who has a criminal record similar to Mr. Moffatt’s.[33]Mr. Moffatt pleaded guilty to two offences under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act in connection with marijuana production and possession at his residence.In addition, he pleaded guilty to possessing brass knuckles at his residence.I am satisfied that this was not a small scale operation, and given the brass knuckles available to him, there was a potential for violence.[34]Mr. Moffatt has a criminal record for two offences, one of which was for a recent similar offence of marijuana production under s.7.1 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.He received the benefit of a conditional sentence of 12 months followed by a period of 12 months probation.It is clear that the conditional sentence imposed then failed to bring home the specific deterrence objective of s. 718.[35]A conditional period of sentence under the circumstances of this offender would not be a fit sentence.In my view, Mr. Moffatt requires a period of incarceration to provide the specific deterrence required to denounce his unlawful conduct and to deter him from committing other offences.At the same time, any sentence imposed on Mr. Moffatt should assist him in rehabilitation when he re-enters the community after a period of incarceration.[36]Mr. Moffatt, please stand.I am satisfied that a fit sentence is a period of 12 months incarceration followed bya period of two years probation.Terms of probation will be that you report to your probation officer upon your release and as directed thereafter, and take such counselling programs as may be directed by your probation officer.[37]In addition, the following ancillary orders shall apply:(i)There will be a DNA order under s.487.051 ofthe Criminal Code;(ii)There will be a mandatory weaponsprohibition order under s.109 of the Code for tenyears;(iii)There will be a forfeiture order in connectionwith items of property seized by the Crown inaccording with Schedule “A” filed by the Crown atthe sentencing hearing.[38]I just want to break down the sentence with respect to the three counts.The first count which is count number five so my sentence is 12 months for that sentence.The next count is count six, so the sentence is 12 months concurrent to count five and the final count was count eight and I sentence to him to six months concurrent to count number five.So the totality of the sentence is 12 months.Form 2CERTIFICATE OF TRANSCRIPT (SUBSECTION 5 (2))Evidence ActI,CathyKnelsen,(Nameof Authorized Person)certifythat this document is a true and accurate transcript of the recording ofR. v.MoffattIntheSuperiorCourt of Justice(Nameof Case)(Nameof Court)heldat75Mulcaster Street, Barrie, OntarioL4N 3P2(CourtAddress)takenfrom Recording3811-04-20120305,which has been certified in Form 1.March 10th, 2012(Date)(Signatureof Authorized Person(s))"}

Murrayfor the AppellantDana Giovanettifor the RespondentAppeal Heard:December 4, 1998Judgment Delivered:December 18, 1998THE COURT:Appeal dismissed per reasons for judgment of Hallett, J.A.; Glube, C.J.N.S. and Pugsley,J.A. concurring.HALLETT. J.A.:The appellant was convicted of second degree murder. The jury did not make a recommendation respecting a period of imprisonment that the appellant must serve before being eligible for parole. Justice Goodfellow sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment and fixed the period of parole ineligibility at 19 years.The appellant asserts that the trial judge erred: (i) in failing to consider time spent in custody pending sentence; and (ii) in failing to give the appropriate weight to the principles of sentencing and, as a result, over-emphasized the elements of denunciation and deterrence and under-emphasized the significance that the appellant was a first time offender.We have reviewed the remarks of the trial judge in fixing the period of parole ineligibility and the submissions of counsel on appeal. It is correct that the trial judge did not make any reference in his sentencing remarks to the fact that the appellant was in custody prior to sentencing for a period of 18 months.Section 719(3) of the Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-4.6 gives a sentencing judge the discretion to take into account in determining sentence \"any time spent in custody by the person as a result of the offence\". Subsection (3) is part of the provisions of the Code dealing with the purposes and principles of sentencing and follows the provisions of s. 719(1) which provides that \"a sentence commences when it is imposed, except where a relevant enactment otherwise provides.\"Section 746(a) of the Code creates a specific and mandatory direction that:746. In calculating the period of imprisonment served for the purposes of section 745, 745.1, 745.4, 745.5 or 745.6, there shall be included any time spent in custody between(a)in the case of a sentence of imprisonment for life imposed after July25, 1976, the day on which the person was arrested and taken intocustody in respect of the offence for which that person wassentenced to imprisonment for life and the day the sentence wasimposed; or ...Section 746 is a specific and explicit provision which mandates that, with respect to life sentences, the time in custody between arrest and sentencing date shall be included in calculating the period of imprisonment served for the purpose of s. 745.4.Section 745 deals with sentences of life imprisonment. Section 745.4 deals specifically with ineligibility for parole and sets out the criteria a sentencing judge is to apply where an offender is convicted of second degree murder:745.4 Subject to section 745.5, at the time of the sentencing under section 745 of an offender who is convicted of second degree murder, the judge who presided at the trial of the offender or, if that judge is unable to do so, any judge of the same court may, having regard to the character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, and to the recommendation, if any, made pursuant to section 745.2, by order, substitute for ten years a number of years of imprisonment (being more than ten but not more than twenty-five) without eligibility for parole, as the judge deems fit in the circumstances.Considering the scheme of the Code and, in particular, the ordering of the sections dealing with sentencing (Part XXIII of the Code), s. 746 is applicable to parole proceedings. Section 746 provides that where an offender is sentenced to life imprisonment he or she shall be given credit as provided in the section when determining.the date on which the ineligibility for parole period shall expire.Counsel for the appellant seems to take the position that notwithstanding s. 746, the trial judge was required to consider time spent in custody in fixing the appropriate period of parole ineligibility.In support of his position, the appellant's counsel relies on a decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Rezaie (1996), 1996 CanLII 1241 (ON CA), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 97. He submits:8. The failure at the time of sentencing to consider time spent in custodyprior to trial, conviction and sentence is an error in law and principle:In my opinion the Rezaie decision must be distinguished. The offence in Rezaie was a sexual assault; the term of imprisonment five years. The sentencing judge refused to give credit for pre-sentence custody. In Rezaie the Ontario Court of Appeal did not go so far as counsel suggests. In discussing what was then s. 721(3) of the Code (a section essentially the same as s. 719(3)), Laskin, J.A., for the Court, stated at p. 104:Although this section is discretionary, not mandatory, in my view a sentencing judge should ordinarily give credit for pre-trial custody. At least a judge should not deny credit without good reason. To do so offends one's sense of fairness. Incarceration at any stage of the criminal process is a denial of an accused's liberty. Moreover, in two respects, pre-trial custody is even more onerous than post-sentencing custody. First, other than for a sentence of life imprisonment, legislative provisions for parole eligibility and statutory release do not take into account time spent in custody before trial (or before sentencing).It is clear from the aforesaid quotation that the Ontario Court of Appeal properly considered s. 721(3) to be discretionary. A review of the decision shows that the Court merely imposed on the sentencing judge a requirement that he give reasons if he was not going to give credit for pre-trial custody. Secondly, the Court clearly recognized that there were legislative provisions dealing with credits for time between the date of arrest and custody and the date of sentencing with respect to sentences of life imprisonment.The Rezaie decision did not involve a question of parole ineligibility and, therefore, is not particularly helpful nor supportive of the appellant's counsel's position.Counsel for the appellant also relies on a decision of Associate Chief Justice Callahan of the High Court of Ontario rendered on the 17th day of November, 1988 (R. v. Breen, Nov. 17 1988 (Ont S.C.)). The offender was convicted of second degree murder. He had spent 19 months in jail pending sentencing. The sentencing judge took the time spent in custody into consideration in fixing the period of ineligibility for parole. It would appear from a reading of Associate Chief Justice Callahan's remarks on sentencing that he did not considers. 746 of the Code. Counsel are unaware of any other case in which a trial judge took pre-trial custody into consideration in fixing the period of parole ineligibility following the conviction of an offender for second degree murder.Section 719(3) is discretionary. It is customary for a trial judge to take into consideration time spent in custody prior to sentencing in determining what is an appropriate period of imprisonment if the offence in question warrants imposition of a period of incarceration. There are no statutory guidelines for the exercise of this discretion but fairness in sentencing is the ruling criteria. It is obvious that fairness, as a general rule, dictates that credit be given when considering the period of incarceration to be imposed.However, in sentencing a person convicted of second degree murder, a life sentence is mandated by the Criminal Code. Therefore, there is no s. 719(3) discretion to be exercised by the sentencing judge.Where an offender has been convicted of second degree murder, the trial judge has a discretion to fix the period of parole ineligibility anywhere between 10 and 25 years by applying the criteria set forth in s. 745.4 of the Code. There is nothing in s. 745.4 which expressly confers on a sentencing judge a discretion totake pre-sentence custody into consideration.Section 746 mandates that any person sentenced for life imprisonment must be given credit for the time served between arrest and custody and the date sentence was imposed. Section 746 comes into play at the time of parole proceedings in calculating when the parole ineligibility period expires.In my opinion, the sentencing judge has two separate and distinct functions following a conviction for second degree murder: (i) he or she imposes the mandatory life sentence. Accordingly, s. 719(3) is not relevant with respect to the term of imprisonment to be imposed; and (ii) he or she then fixes the period of parole ineligibility. Section 719(3) has no application in determining the period of parole ineligibility.By enacting s. 746 Parliament has dealt with the issue of credit for pre­sentence custody when an offender is sentenced to life imprisonment. Therefore, the need for the sentencing judge in the interest of fairness to consider pre­sentence custody no longer exists.In my opinion: (i) in the absence of any direction in s. 745.4 to consider time spent in custody in fixing the period of parole ineligibility; and (ii) considering that Parliament has made express provision dealing with pre-sentence custody in s. 746, it was not an error in law for the sentencing judge to fail to consider the appellant's pre-sentence custody in fixing the period of parole ineligibility.I will now deal with the appellant's second ground of appeal that the sentencing judge did not give appropriate weight to the principles of sentencing.The role of an appeal court is circumscribed by the provisions of s. 687(1) of the Code and the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227; (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193. In Shropshire the Supreme Court held that s. 687(1) of the Criminal Code requires a Court of Appeal to consider the \"fitness\" of the sentence appealed from. The Appeal Court does not have free reign to modify a sentence simply because the Court felt a different order ought to have been made. A court of appeal should only vary a sentence if it is convinced that the sentence is not fit, that is, that the sentence under appeal was clearly unreasonable. The task of a Court of Appeal is to determine if the sentencing judge applied wrong principles or if the sentence was clearly excessive or inadequate. It is only if the sentence falls outside an acceptable range that it is considered to be unreasonable.Following an offender's conviction for second degree murder, the sentencing judge, in determining whether to increase the period of parole ineligibility beyond ten years, must consider the criteria set out in s. 745.4 of the Code.In Shropshire the Supreme Court held:(i)that denunciation and deterrence are relevant factors in fixing theperiod of parole ineligibility;(ii)that as a general rule, the period should be 10 years but that can be ousted by a determination of the trial judge that according to the criteria set out in s. 745(4) the offender should wait a longer period before having his suitability to be released into the general public assessed; and(iii)that the power to extend the period of ineligibility need not be used sparingly by the sentencing judge.I am satisfied from a review of the reasons given by the trial judge for fixing 19 years as the period of ineligibility for parole that the trial judge considered the character of the offender. The trial judge stated in his reasons that he found the appellant's evidence that the victim had made improper sexual advances towards him was a revolting suggestion that was totally lacking in credibility. The trial judge further commented on the character of the offender when he statedThis has been a particularly brutal murder. It is incomprehensible to me howyou could kill somebody, probably enjoy a cigarette afterwards, wash, seta fire and carry on with the theft of things from a man's home. It is a brutalmurder in the sanctity of his own home.In his remarks on sentencing the trial judge also commented on what Iwould perceive to be his views on the lack of remorse of the appellant. The trial judge stated:I thought the attempt at an apology by Mr. Tsyganov when he was on the stand was rather hollow.The trial judge was well aware that the appellant was a first offender as he made specific reference to it. Although the trial judge referred to the appellant as being a \"young person\" the record shows that he was in his 30th year when he committed the murder.It is likewise clear from his reasons that the trial judge considered the nature of the offence as he specifically commented on the brutality of the murder. A review of the evidence supports the trial judge's finding that the murder was, indeed, brutal.The sentencing judge considered the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence when he commented in his reasons: (i) that the murder would never have happened if the victim had not been generous enough to permit the appellant to reside with him back in 1991; and (ii) that were it not for this fact the appellant would never have come in contact with his victim.The sentencing judge had sat through many days of trial testimony. He was well aware of the circumstances of the offence and made specific reference to the fact that the crime was committed in the victim's home; that the victim had. been generous to the appellantand that the murder was brutal.The trial judge made specific reference to being familiar with the Shropshire case and R. v. Muise (1994), 1994 CanLII 4074 (NS CA), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 119 (N.S.C.A.) as well as the principles respecting the fixing of the period of parole ineligibility as recited to him by the appellant's counsel.Counsel for the appellant submits that a 14 year period of parole ineligibility would be fit as being more in line with decisions he relied on from several other provincesIn R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500; (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327, Chief Justice Lamer, for the Court commented at p. 375 (C.C.C.(3d)) respecting disparity of sentences:Appellate courts, of course, serve an important function in reviewing and minimizing the disparity of sentences imposed by sentencing judges for similar offenders and similar offences committed throughout Canada: see, e.g., R. v. Knife (1982), 1982 CanLII 2569 (SK QB), 16 Sask. R. 40 (C.A.) at p. 43; R. v. Wood (1979), 21 C.L.Q. 423 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 424; R. v. Mellstrom (1975), 22 C.C.C. (2d) 472 at p. 485, 29 C.R.N.S. 327, [1975] 3 W.W.R. 385 (Alta. C.A.); R. v. Morrissette (1970), 1970 CanLII 642 (SK CA), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 307 at pp. 311-12, 12 C.R.N.S. 392, 75 W.W.R. 644 (Sask. C.A.); R. v. Baldhead 1966 CanLII 335 (SK CA), [1966] 4 C.C.C. 183 at p. 187, 48 C.R. 228, 55 W.W.R. 757 (Sask. C.A). But in exercising this role, courts of appeal must still exercise a margin of deference before intervening in the specialized discretion that Parliament has explicitly vested in sentencing judges. It has been repeatedly stressed that there is no such thing as a uniform sentence for a particular crime: see Mellstrom, Morrissette and Baldhead. Sentencing is an inherently individualized process, and the search for a single appropriate sentence for a similar offender and a similar crime will frequently be a fruitless exercise of academic abstraction. As well, sentences for a particular offence should be expected to vary to some degree across various communities and regions in this country, as the \"just and appropriate\" mix of accepted sentencing goals will depend on the needs and current conditions of and in the particular community where the crime occurred. For these reasons, consistent with the general standard of review we articulated in Shropshire, I believe that a court of appeal should only intervene to minimize the disparity of sentences where the sentence imposed by the trial judge is in substantial and marked departure from the sentences customarily imposed for similar offenders committing similar crimes.The Court recognized that sentences for a particular offence should be expected to vary to some degree across various communities and regions of the country.The Supreme Court commented (at p. 360) that Parliament, in imposing mandatory minimum periods of parole ineligibility, was undoubtedly animated by the full range of sentencing principles and that in setting the threshold period of ineligibility, Parliament appears to have been principally motivated by the sentencing goals of deterrence and denunciation.I am satisfied that the sentencing judge did not over-emphasize denunciation and deterrence in fixing the period of ineligibility for parole in the circumstances of this murder. The sentencing judge considered the criteria set out in s. 745.4 of the Code and, therefore, did not apply the wrong principles in arriving at the 19 year period of ineligibility that he fixed.Considering the periods of parole ineligibility fixed in other second degree murder cases considered by this Court, I am satisfied that the period of 19 years as fixed by the sentencing judge is within an acceptable range and is not unreasonable. The sentence is, therefore, fit. I would dismiss the appeal.Hallett, J.A. Concurred in:Glube, C.J.N.S.Pugsley, J.A.CANADAPROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA1996C.

ETHIERAppearances:David McWhinnieRobert DickCounselfor CrownCounselfor DefenceREASONS FOR SENTENCING[1]FAULKNER C.J.T.C. (Oral):Joanne Walker has entered pleas of guilty to seven charges: three of theft, three of fraud and one of forgery.All these offences were committed in connection with Ms. Walker's activities as an insurance broker in the City of Whitehorse.[2]Ms. Walker had been employed by various insurance agencies for a number of years and thus was quite familiar with the insurance brokerage business and able to obtain a licence as an insurance broker.[3]In the fall of 2004, she opened her own insurance firm which she called \"Territorial Insurance Solutions.\"Once in business, Ms. Walker sold home, auto and business insurance to numerous members of the public, purportedly acting as agent for various major insurance companies.However, in fact, Ms. Walker had no contracts to sell insurance on behalf of these insurance companies and she did not, in fact, place insurance on behalf of the clients but kept the money paid to her in premiums.[4]To provide her clients with the belief that they were insured, she provided them with bogus binder letters and forged pink financial responsibility cards, insurance policies and other documents.In all, between 145 and 150 phoney policies were sold.Her activities came to an end when the fraud was discovered, and her licence to sell insurance was revoked on the 6th of July, 2005.In total, members of the public were defrauded of approximately $120,000.[5]At the time of the discovery of the scheme, Ms. Walker still had approximately $30,000 of the proceeds in her possession.This amount was recovered.She has since repaid $5,000, leaving an outstanding loss of approximately $85,000.[6]One of the most singular and most serious aspects of this scheme is that, as a result of Ms. Walker's activities, a large number of people were driving their cars and living in their homes thinking that they were insured when they were not.The potential for a serious financial disaster befalling one or more of her clients was certainly there.Equally, it may be supposed that there was a risk that someone injured by an accident would be unable to receive due compensation.[7]In her interviews with the probation officer, Ms. Walker suggested that her own errors and omissions insurance would have provided coverage in the event that one of her clients suffered a loss.Given Ms. Walker's experience in the insurance industry, it is inconceivable that she could have honestly thought anything of the kind.Fortunately, there were no major accidents or losses.[8]The scheme I have just described was about as clear a breach of trust as may be imagined.Indeed, the element of trust is of the very essence of the business of an insurance agent or broker.[9]This was a sophisticated scheme wherein Ms. Walker prepared a large number of forged documents for the purpose of covering up her activities.There were a large number of victims.There was a substantial loss.The scheme was operated over a long period of time.As stated, the offender's activities posed a grave risk to the community.In such circumstances, the cases make it abundantly clear that a deterrent sentence is called for.See, for example, R. v. Reid, [2003] Y.J. 101 (QL) and R. v. Bogart [2001] O.J. 2323 (QL).[10]Reid, being a Yukon case, is very much on point.It is true that there are some distinguishing features between the two situations.Reid stole a larger amount of money and, so far as could be determined, blew it on a lavish lifestyle.She made no restitution.On the other hand, Ms. Walker, who can at least claim to have acted slightly less egregiously, was engaged in activities that, as I have already stated, involved a large number of victims who were not only defrauded of their money but placed in a very risky situation.[11]Since the discovery of the scheme, Ms. Walker has made some attempts at restitution.It was suggested by counsel that she had repaid some $30,000 on discovery of the scheme and that this was restitution.This is not really a correct characterization of what occurred.What occurred is that when caught, Ms. Walker still had $30,000 of the ill-gotten gains and was relieved of them.[12]This is not really any different than a bank robber, who, when caught, still has a portion of the money.Calling his forfeiture of that money restitution is hardly an apt description of what has occurred.However, she has paid some $5,000 out of her own pocket.This amount, though relatively trivial in light of the total amount of the loss, is nevertheless of some significance considering her income throughout the period of making the payments totalling $5,000 has amounted to no more than around $1,200 per month.[13]When the matter first appeared before me for sentencing, Ms. Walker also indicated through counsel her willingness to assign her interest in a piece of real estate, being the former matrimonial home.It was claimed that the sale of this property and her receipt of her share of the equity might produce as much as $40,000 in restitution.[14]At the time, Ms. Walker had not actually taken any steps to assign these funds.In the circumstances, sentencing was adjourned.In the meantime, assignments have now been prepared and produced, but it now develops that the amount to be realized will probably be a much lesser sum, possibly as little as $10,000.[15]Beyond what may be realized from the sale of the home, it does not appear that Ms. Walker has any reasonable prospect of paying off the balance, although she could continue to make modest payments.[16]Mr. Dick also submitted that Ms. Walker, unlike Ms. Reid, had not spent the money on a lavish lifestyle but merely to keep her family afloat.I am prepared to accept this assertion to a certain extent, but it seems to me that the claim must lose some force when it is remembered that Ms. Walker managed to go through some $90,000 in a period of about ten months.[17]In sentencing for a large and sophisticated fraud, particularly one involving an egregious breach of trust, deterrence and denunciation must be the primary focus of sentencing.These considerations have not changed since the introduction of the conditional sentencing provisions of the Code.[18]Indeed, as Mr. Justice Rosenberg observed in R. v. Wismayer, 1997 CanLII 3294 (ON CA), [1997] O.J. No. 1380 (QL):General deterrence, as the principal objective animating the refusal to impose a conditional sentence, should be reserved for those offences that are likely to be affected by a general deterrent effect.Large-scale, well-planned fraud by persons in position of trust…would seem to be one of those offences.[19]This position of the courts arises from the fact that fraud is clearly a crime of deliberation and is all the more so when, as here, it is a sophisticated scheme carried out over a long period of time.There is an old saying that judges used to refer to in cases such as this and it remains apt in the circumstances:The game, the judges would say, must not be worth the candle.When the element of breach of trust is added to the game, the necessity to make clear that the reward is not worth the risk is all the greater.[20]I was urged by Mr. Dick to impose a conditional sentence.While I see some distinctions between this case and Reid, supra, the differences, in my view, are insufficient to permit the imposition of a community-based sentence in this case.[21]Having regard to the nature of the crimes committed by Ms. Walker, a sentence in the range of two years would be entirely apt.Giving full credit for the guilty plea and giving full credit for the efforts that Ms. Walker has made to date with respect to restitution, the sentence of the Court with respect to these matters is a sentence of 15 months imprisonment, concurrent on each count.[22]Following your release from imprisonment, Ms. Walker, you will be subject to a probation order for a period of two years.The terms of that order will be that you:1.Keep the peace and be of good behaviour;2.Report to the Court as and when required;3.Report, within two working days after the order comes into force, to a probation officer and thereafter, as directed;4.Advise the probation officer in advance of any change of name or address;5.Promptly notify him of any change of occupation or employment; and6.Take such assessment and counselling as the probation officer directs.[23]You will make restitution in the amount of $25,000 to be paid into the Clerk of the Court, in trust for the Superintendent of Insurance.That sum is to be paid within 18 months and you will be credited as against that sum any monies that are paid into the court pursuant to the assignment of proceeds from the sale of your real property in the City of Whitehorse.[24]Additionally, there will be a restitution order in favour of the Superintendent of Insurance in the amount of $85,000.Again, any amounts paid into court are to be credited against that sum if such amounts are paid prior to the entry of judgment.Obviously, any proceeds that accrue from that would be paid on a pro rata basis to those persons who suffered losses as a result of this offender's activities.[25]In the circumstances the surcharges are waived.[26]MR. MCWHINNIE:I think the outstanding counts, if they haven't already been stayed, Your Honour, should be.[27]THE COURT:Stay of proceedings on the remaining counts.________________________________FAULKNER C.J.T.C."}

PRICE, for the Appellant/Crown)Respondent))- and -))LARRY JAMES DAVIS)MILENA CELAP, for the Respondent)Appellant))REASONS FOR JUDGMENT[On appeal from the judgment of the HonourableJustice K. Hawke, dated May 10, 2007]There is a publication ban in regard to the name of the complainant or any information that could identify her, pursuant to s. 486.4 of the Criminal CodeDURNO J.[1]The respondent lived in a common-law relationship with the 9 year old complainant’s mother.When the child’s mother was out of the house, on at least four dates in July and August of 2006, the complainant would sit on the couch with the respondent, her caregiver at the time, and watch pornographic movies titled, ‘Bobby Sucks’ and ‘Girls who Eat Girls’.While watching the movies, the respondent touched her breasts and vaginal area, both over and under her clothing.On August 27, 2006, the complainant and her mother disclosed the conduct to police.On the same day, the respondent was arrested and released from custody.[2]On December 20, 2006, he pled guilty to sexual assault after a Crown election to proceed summarily.The plea was entered before a trial date was set.The Crown sought 12 months served in jail, and corollary orders. The defence sought a conditional sentence.On May 10, 2007, the trial judge sentenced the respondent to 9 months, to be served conditionally, with modified house arrest for the first four months and 75 hours of community service, followed by two years probation, a DNA order and a Sex Offender Registry order for ten years.[3]The Crown appeals, contending the sentence was demonstrably unfit and that the trial judge erred in misconstruing the Court of Appeal judgment in R. v. D.R. 2003 CanLII 9127 (ON CA), [2003] O.J. No. 561, in finding that the absence of more aggravating facts was a mitigating fact, in failing to find that committing the offence while having the complainant watch pornographic movies was an aggravating fact, in her application of the principle of denunciation, and in finding that denunciation militated in favour of a conditional sentence.[4]The respondent has served the conditional sentence.The Crown sought to expedite this appeal, and it could have been heard in November, 2007.The respondent’s counsel was not available, and two intervening dates were adjourned by the respondent’s counsel.Counsel have agreed that the appeal will proceed on the basis the respondent has served 6 of the 9 month conditional sentence for the purpose of any calculations regarding credit for the time served of the conditional sentence, if I were to determine that a jail sentence was warranted.The Trial Judge’s Reasons[5]Her Honour acknowledged the importance of a guilty plea in general, and particularly in cases involving young children, because the plea sends a message to the child that they were not responsible for the conduct.The respondent had not backtracked from his responsibility and that he alone caused the offence, unlike in other cases where the offender equivocates about his or her role.[6]In terms of the pornographic movies, the trial judge did not list it as an aggravating factor on sentence.The only comments about the movies in the Reasons were as follows:With respect to the pornographic movies involved, I do not have any details; I infer from the word pornography that this material was explicit and inappropriate, however, there’s no suggestion that the material was illegal.[7]As regards the impact of the offence, there was no Victim Impact Statement, nor any reference to s. 722.2 of the Criminal Code regarding Victim Impact Statements.The only reference to the impact of the offence on the complainant was contained in a letter from her mother, T.H. who wished to reconcile with the respondent.Ms. T.H. did not take lightly “the atrocities” that occurred to her daughter.They sickened her.However, she concluded the incidents did not contain any malice, and regarded it as “an isolated occurrence orchestrated by many factors”.The respondent himself had suffered abuse as a child, experienced difficulties regarding his divorce and workplace issues that depressed him.Ms. T.H. regarded the respondent as a good provider and father figure for the complainant[8]Ms. T.H. wrote that the complainant had forgiven the respondent and was not afraid of him.Indeed, she was looking forward to the possibility that he would be coming home soon.She truly missed him.Ms. T.H. referred to the offence as a “huge error in judgment”.[9]The respondent was 52 years of age, and had been employed at the TTC for 31 years.He had a very difficult childhood with an abusive father.He was involved in the union activities at the TTC, which in part contributed to his depression at the time of the offence, according to Ms. T.H..The documents filed on the sentencing confirmed he was under a significant amount of stress around the time of the offence, both personally and professionally.[10]A report from his treating psychiatrist confirmed that the offence was committed while he was depressed.He had taken appropriate steps to address his mental health issues.The psychiatrist said, “My sense is that incarceration in jail would likely have a negative impact on the mental health of Mr. Davis and interfere with treatment.It is not possible to be fully clear as to the extent of that impact”.The respondent’s prognosis was good.He had expressed remorse and strong motivation to pursue treatment.[11]Her Honour examined the Court of Appeal cases filed by the Crown that referred to there being a need for exceptional circumstances to impose a conditional sentence for this offence, but noted she had never seen the Court of Appeal outline what they would consider to be exceptional circumstances.All of the cases cited involved more serious allegations than this case.[12]The trial judge found that the preconditions to considering a conditional sentence were met: there was no minimum term, a fit sentence was under two years, and permitting the respondent to serve the sentence in the community would not endanger society.The aggravating factors were that the abuse involved a person under the age of 18 by a person in a position of trust.[13]In examining whether a conditional sentence was consistent with the purposes and principles of sentencing, the trial judge identified factors that militated for and against a conditional sentence.As regards those militating against a conditional sentence, Her Honour noted the gravity of the offence.However, the sexual assault was not as grave as many others, and it could not be ignored that the conduct was at a relatively low end of the scale.There were two aggravating factors: the complainant was under 18, and the offence involved a breach of trust.[14]The next factor was the degree of responsibility of the offender.Her Honour noted the respondent was the sole person responsible for the offence.The last factor militating against a conditional sentence was general deterrence, one of the primary principles of sentencing for this offence.[15]The trial judge found the following factors militated in favour of a conditional sentence.First, was the offender’s rehabilitation, including that he had taken positive steps and was committed to the process.Her Honour found the doctor “speculated” that going to jail could interfere with his rehabilitation.Second, reparation and promoting a sense of responsibility militated in favour of a community-based sentence, because those objectives could be achieved through a conditional sentence.[16]In regard to denunciation, Her Honour said:Denunciation is the communication of society’s condemnation of an offender’s conduct.More often than not denunciation is thought to be a goal that militates against a conditional sentence, but surely the decision about the best method of achieving this communication has everything to do with the offender that the Court is endeavoring to communicate with, as it is meant to send a message to the offender.It would seem to me that terms that illustrate that there will be consequences that interfere with your life and at the same time demand that you maximize your contribution in terms of being a good member of society can communicate this point quite adequately to many offenders.The defendant is a first offender, everything in the material indicates that he is and will continue to be receptive to this message; hence I have listed denunciation as one of the things that militates in favour of a conditional sentence.I also note on the denunciation part that part of the sentence will be that the defendant will be on the Sexual Offence Registry and as much as that registry was not designed for this purpose, it would seem to me that one of the collateral effects of the registry is a continuing message of denunciation as complying with it is a regular reminder to a defendant with respect to how he is now viewed in terms of the Sexual offence Registry.[17]Having considered and balanced the relevant purposes and principles of sentencing and the criteria for a conditional sentence, Her Honour found that a conditional sentence was a fit disposition.[18]The trial judge concluded that the sentence should be 9 months served conditionally, with 4 months of house arrest, with exceptions for employment or union activities, to attend church, medical and dental appointments or emergencies for himself or his immediate family.For the last 5 months he was to abide by a 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. curfew with the same exceptions.He was to have no contact with the complainant without the written revocable consent of Ms. T.H. and the C.A.S. delivered to his probation officer.Under no circumstances was he to live with the complainant until September of 2007.The respondent was to continue his treatment with Dr. Shaul or his designate and perform 75 hours of community service.He was also ordered to provide a DNA sample, comply with a s. 161 (1)(b) order for 5 years and participate in the Sex Offender Registry for 5 years.Fresh Evidence[19]A report from the respondent’s psychiatrist, dated January 23, 2008, was admitted on consent.Dr. Shaul’s diagnosis of depression remained.The respondent’s mood symptoms had partially improved, but there remained some residual mood symptomatology in the context of the unresolved legal issues.Mr. Davis had been fully compliant with the recommended management plan, as he continued to take Celexa and derived benefits from the anti-depression medication.He continued to attend intermittent therapy session with a focus on stress management, support, problem solving, his high level of remorse, and maintaining his strongly stated goal of never re-offending.[20]The doctor concluded strongly emphasizing that the respondent would experience a significant relapse of his depressive illness if he were incarcerated because he would lose some of the key outlets of renewing self-worth such as sustaining his work.Work has permitted him to contribute to society and its loss would trigger a relapse.The Scope of Appellate Sentence Review[21]The Court of Appeal has recently outlined the scope of sentence appeals in R. v. Thurairajah 2008 ONCA 91 (CanLII), [2008] O.J. No. 460.Doherty J.A. for the Court, wrote at para 31 to 33:31Despite the trial judge's central role in the sentencing process, s. 687 of the Criminal Code does authorize sentence appeals. Appellate intervention, where warranted, is part of the sentencing scheme fashioned by the Criminal Code. An appellate court may vary a sentence imposed where the trial judge has erred in principle, failed to consider evidence relevant to sentence, misapprehended a material fact, or imposed a sentence that is demonstrably unfit: R. v. McDonnell (1997), 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), 114 C.C.C.(3d) 436 at paras 15-16 (S.C.C.); R. v. Rezaie (1996), 1996 CanLII 1241 (ON CA), 112 C.C.C.(3d) 97 at 103 (Ont. C.A.).32The Crown argued that the trial judge made errors in principle and that the sentence was demonstrably unfit. As I agree with the latter submission, I do not propose to address the alleged errors in principle. A sentence is demonstrably unfit when it falls outside the range of sentences that could reasonably have been imposed in the circumstances. This standard of review does not ask - does the sentence accord with the appeal court's opinion as to the appropriate sentence, but instead asks - is the sentence within the range of sentences that could reasonably be imposed in all the circumstances: McDonnell, supra, at para. 15; Rezaie, supra, at 103.33The question of whether the sentence imposed in this case is demonstrably unfit comes down to this - was a conditional sentence a clearly inappropriate disposition in the totality of the circumstances? If it was not, this court must defer to the trial judge's decision even though it might have imposed a different sentence: R. v. T.(J.C.) (1998), 1998 CanLII 17661 (ON CA), 124 C.C.C.(3d) 385 at para. 14 (Ont. C.A.).Analysis[22]The Crown does not argue that a conditional sentence can never be imposed for the sexual assault of a vulnerable child.Rather, the Crown argues that the circumstances of this offence, including that there was touching over and under the clothing, that it occurred on four occasions while the respondent had the 9 year old child watching pornographic videos and he was in a position of trust, mandate a sentence served in jail notwithstanding the mitigating factors.Put differently, there was nothing exceptional about the offence or the offender that would warrant a community based sentence.The Crown also argues that the trial judge’s Reasons reflect errors in principle.If I were to agree with the Crown, Ms. Price submits there should be some time spent in jail.She was unable to provide a similar case where after a guilty plea to similar allegations a 12 month jail sentence, the sentence sought by the Crown at trial, was imposed.[23]The respondent submits that the mitigating factors when viewed in the context of all the circumstances resulted in a factual situation where the sentence was not demonstrably unfit.Further, while the respondent cannot assist with the meaning of the trial judge’s analysis of denunciation, Ms. Celap submits the Reasons do not contain errors that would permit appellate intervention regarding the sentence.In the alternative, if I were to conclude a jail term should have been imposed, the 6 months already served on the conditional sentence, with one-for-one credit for that time, are sufficient.There would be no need, and it would not serve any useful purpose, to send the respondent to jail now.[24]I am persuaded the trial judge committed several errors in the sentencing judgment: first, in inferentially concluding the fact the events occurred while the respondent had the 9 year old complainant watch pornographic moves was not an aggravating factor; second, in her application of the denunciation principle and in concluding that denunciation supported a conditional sentence, third, in finding that the Sex Offender Registry Order was part of denunciation and supported a conditional sentence.Influenced by these errors, Her Honour concluded this was an exceptional or rare case that warranted a conditional sentence.[25]First, in regard to the pornographic movies, Her Honour noted it was “explicit and inappropriate”, but not illegal.When examining the aggravating factors, ones that militated against a conditional sentence Her Honour did not mention the movies.With respect, she erred in so doing.The circumstances under which an offence is committed are relevant.Aggravating facts need not be separate criminal offences.That there was no evidence the videos were illegal did not remove them as aggravating facts.Showing a 9 year old pornographic movies while sexually assaulting her, is a more aggravating fact situation than if there had been no movies shown.[26]Second, in regard to denunciation, the trial judge found that the decision about the best method of achieving the communication of society’s condemnation of the offender’s conduct had everything to do with the offender that the Court is endeavoring to communicate with, as it is meant to send a message to the offender.[27]Her Honour continued that “the terms that illustrate that there will be consequences that interfere with your life and at the same time demand that you maximize your contribution in terms of being a good member of society can communicate this point quite adequately to many offenders”.The respondent was a first offender, and everything in the material indicated he had been and would continue to be receptive of that message.These factors led Her Honour to list denunciation as a factor militating in favour of a conditional sentence.[28]With respect, the trial judge conflated the principles of general deterrence and specific deterrence with denunciation.Pursuant to s. 718 of the Criminal Code, Parliament has directed that “the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one of more of the following objectives: a) to denounce unlawful conduct, b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences …”[29]The denunciatory component of a sentence is not meant to send a message to this offender.Rather, the denunciation focuses on the conduct, and not the particular characteristics of the offender: Sentencing, 6th Edition, C.C. Ruby et al, LexisNexis, Butterworths, 2004, at p.5.[30]The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. M.(C.A.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), 105 C.C.C.(3d) 327 at 369, has held that denunciation mandates that a sentence must communicate society’s condemnation of the offender’s conduct as follows:The objective of denunciation mandates that a sentence should also communicate society's condemnation of that particular offender's conduct.In short, a sentence with a denunciatory element represents a symbolic, collective statement that the offender's conduct should be punished for encroaching on our society's basic code of values as enshrined within our substantive criminal law.As Lord Justice Lawton stated in R. v. Sargeant (1974), 60 Cr. App. R. 74 at p. 77: \"society, through the courts, must show its abhorrence of particular types of crime, and the only way in which the courts can show this is by the sentences they pass.\"The relevance of both retribution and denunciation as goals of sentencing underscores that our criminal justice system is not simply a vast system of negative penalties designed to prevent objectively harmful conduct by increasing the cost the offender must bear in committing an enumerated offence. Our criminal law is also a system of values. A sentence which expresses denunciation is simply the means by which these values are communicated. In short, in addition to attaching negative consequences to undesirable behaviour, judicial sentences should also be imposed in a manner which positively instills the basic set of communal values shared by all Canadians as expressed by the Criminal Code.[31]The Alberta Court of Appeal has distinguished the principles of general deterrence and denunciation for historical sexual assaults as follows:The lapse of time does not in any way render inapplicable the principles of general deterrence and denunciation. The first of these requires a sentence which will intimidate those other than the offender who might be tempted to follow his example. The second requires a sentence by the imposition of which the court will reflect society's view of the wrongness of the conduct, and persuade those who might be confused about what is right and wrong. These two principles may overlap in their effect on the choice of sentence.[32]The trial judge erred in concluding that the denunciatory component of a sentence is directed to the offender.While Her Honour appropriately referred to communicating to others, a component of denunciation, her focus on this offender and his receptiveness of “the message” was in error.In the result, the trial judge misinterpreted denunciation and erroneously concluded the principle of sentencing militated in favour of a conditional sentence.[33]The trial judge considered the fact the respondent would be subject to the Sex Offender Registry as supportive of a conditional sentence, because it would be a continuing message of denunciation to the defendant how he is now viewed in terms of the registry.Pursuant to that legislation, enacted in 2004, an offender is required to report to the registry for either 10 years, 20 years or life, depending on the offence committed.The reporting obligations have been described as follows in R. v. C.L.B. (2007), 2007 ABQB 521 (CanLII), 225 C.C.C. (3d) 237 (Alta. Q.B.) at para 8.The reporting obligations are found in ss. 4-6 of SOIRA. Persons subject to a SOIRA order must report to a registration centre within 15 days of conviction or release from custody (s. 4(1) and (2)), report annually and within 15 days of a change of residence or surname (s. 4.1), provide personal information including name, date of birth, residential and business addresses and phone numbers, and physical description (s. 5), and provide information about locations they are staying at for any trips exceeding 15 days (s. 6).[34]SOIRA orders are mandatory, unless the offender establishes that the impact of the order on his or her privacy or liberty would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest in protecting society through the effective investigation of crimes of a sexual nature, to be achieved through the registration of information relating to sexual offenders under the registry.[35]The Alberta Court of Appeal has held that SOIRA orders are not a sentence, nor are they penal consequences of sentencing.The orders issue as a consequence of sentencing: R. v. Redhead (2006), 2006 ABCA 84 (CanLII), 206 C.C.C. (3d) 315.[36]While the trial judge did not characterize the SOIRA order as a punishment, she linked the order to a continuing message of denunciation to the respondent.It would be wrong to consider the SOIRA order as a form of punishment.A constitutional challenge, alleging a breach of s. 11 of the Charter, to the DNA Order provisions was unsuccessful, because the orders were not punishment: R. v. Rodgers (2006), 207 C.C.C.(3d) 205 (S.C.C.) at para 63.The Court held:63 This does not mean, however, that \"punishment\" under ss. 11(h) and 11(i) necessarily encompasses every potential consequence of being convicted of a criminal offence, whether that consequence occurs at the time of sentencing or not. A number of orders can be made by a sentencing court, for example an order for forfeiture, a firearm prohibition, a driving prohibition, or an order for restitution. It is beyond the purview of this appeal to determine whether or not any of these consequences constitutes a punishment. As a general rule, it seems to me that the consequence will constitute a punishment when it forms part of the arsenal of sanctions to which an accused may be liable in respect of a particular offence and the sanction is one imposed in furtherance of the purpose and principles of sentencing. In this respect, the protection afforded by s. 11 must be contrasted with s. 12 of the Charter that protects against cruel and unusual \"treatment\" or punishment. For example, DNA sampling, ordered as a consequence of conviction, would undoubtedly constitute a \"treatment\" and, if the physical method for obtaining a DNA sample were cruel and unusual, redress could be obtained under s. 12.64 However, I agree with the conclusion reached by the Court of Appeal and find that the imposition of a s. 487.055 order, although a consequence of the convictions on the index offences, does not constitute a punishment within the meaning of s. 11. I find none of Mr. Rodgers' arguments persuasive. First, his concern about the potential dangers of equating the taking of DNA samples to fingerprinting is a matter for consideration under s. 8, not s. 11. Second, the fact that the DNA order may have a deterrent effect on the offender does not make it a punishment. As aptly noted by Bateman J.A. in Murrins:The fact that the existence of a DNA profile may deter offenders from committing future crimes is a residual benefit but does not bring the order into the category of a punishment. The order is in furtherance of the legitimate state interest in solving crime rather than its interest in sanctioning the offender. [para. 102]As stated by the Crown in its factum, \"[w]hile it is true that many punishments are aimed at having a deterrent effect, that does not mean that every deterrent measure is, by definition, 'punishment'. For example, random traffic stops to check for alcohol consumption hopefully have the effect of deterring people from drinking and driving, but no one could properly characterize a R.I.D.E. stop as 'punishment'\". Finally, the argument that there is a definite stigma attached to the taking of a DNA sample is not persuasive. Other than a notation on the records of the Canadian Police Services Information Centre, there is no information that a person's DNA sample is in the data bank. If there is any stigma, surely it flows from the convictions upon which the order is based. In any event, the fact that a treatment may occasion a certain stigma does not turn it into a punishment. Stigma may be occasioned by the simple fact of being arrested and charged with a criminal offence.65 The DNA sampling and analysis is no more part of the arsenal of sanctions to which an accused may be liable in respect of a particular offence than the taking of a photograph or fingerprints. I therefore conclude that ss. 11(h) and 11(i) have no application to this case.[37]There are differences between the DNA legislation and SOIRA, such as the length of time compliance is required; for the DNA it is one sample, for SOIRA it can be life in terms of continuing obligations.However, it should not be regarded as a further punishment on the offender.[38]While it is not necessary for the determination of this appeal, it is highly unlikely Parliament’s enactment of the Sex Offender Registry was intended to support more lenient sentences for sex offenders.[39]Finally, the D.R. misinterpretation argument and the submission that the trial judge converted the absence of more aggravating facts into mitigating facts or facts in support of a conditional sentence can be dealt with together.Where the sexual abuse of children that include penetration, collateral crimes and/or additional force, those factors are aggravating.That a case of child sexual abuse does not include one or more of those facts or oral sex is not a mitigating factor.R. v. Stuckles (1998), 1998 CanLII 7143 (ON CA), 41 O.R. (3d) 103 (Ont. C.A.)[40]The absence of one or more of those aggravating factors can be informative in examining the facts upon which other sentences were imposed with the facts upon which the offender is being sentenced.The presence or absence of aggravating factors can be informative in regards to the gravity of the offence, one of the fundamental principles of sentencing – that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.Criminal Code, s. 718.1.Before imposing a conditional sentence, a judge must be satisfied that a community-based sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2.Criminal Code, s. 742.1.[41]The trial judge repeatedly referred to the “lower level of violation” in this case and that the acts were relatively few and over relatively a short period of time.While portions of the Reasons appear to support the Crown’s submission, I am not persuaded the trial judge strayed into the prohibited reasoning.[42]I turn next to whether or not applying the appropriate principles the sentence was demonstrably unfit.Conditional sentences are available for offences involving the sexual abuse of children by persons in loco parentis.Indeed, the Supreme Court of Canada was asked to find that there was a presumption against conditional sentences for certain offences including sexual offences against children.R. v. Proulx (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C.(3d) 449 at par 80The Court held that while the gravity of such offences was clearly relevant to determining whether a conditional sentence was appropriate, that it would be unwise and unnecessary to establish judicially created presumptions that conditional sentences are inappropriate for specific offences.at para 81.[43]The Court of Appeal has repeatedly stated that conditional sentences for sex offenders who commit offences while in positions of trust should be rare: R. v. D.D. 2003 CanLII 9127 (ON CA), [2003] O.J. No. 561 where the Court noted:This court has repeatedly indicated that a conditional sentence should rarely be imposed in cases involving the sexual touching of children by adults, particularly where, as here, the sexual violation is of a vulnerable victim in a position of trust.In addition, circumstances that involve multiple sexual acts over an extended period of time and escalating in intrusiveness generally warrant a severe sentence.[44]In R. v. G.L. 2003 CanLII 57437 (ON CA), [2003] O.J. No. 1719, the Court noted they had repeatedly stressed both the serious nature of sexual abuse against children, and the importance of sentencing sexual offenders with the principles of denunciation and deterrence in mind.There, the conduct occurred over 18 months and included kissing, the touching of her breast and vagina over and under her clothing, as well as digital penetration.The sentence was 10 months.[45]The Court has imposed or upheld conditional sentences in cases of sexual abuse of children.R. v. G.(A.) (1998), 1998 CanLII 7189 (ON CA), 130 C.C.C.(3d) 30; R. v. Wood [1999] O.J. No.1520, R. v. Esmond [2002] O.J. No. 2544.There are other offences, as well, where the Court has found the need for exceptional or the “rare” case for a conditional sentence to be fit and imposed a community-based sentence.R. v. Folino (2005), C.C.C.(3d) 353[46]I am persuaded that the errors in principle noted above led the trial judge to impose a demonstrably unfit sentence – one that was clearly inappropriate in the totality of the circumstances.While there were significant mitigating factors, neither the offence, the circumstances under which it was committed, nor the offender, were rare or exceptional so as to justify a conditional sentence.[47]Counsel agree that the fact the offence is less serious than cases where the Court of Appeal upheld or imposed jail terms, does not make it rare or exceptional.I agree.The Court of Appeal in all of the cases relied upon dealt with indictable offences that, absent limitation period issues, could be expected to involve more serious allegations.However, the Court of Appeal has not restricted their comments to indictable offences.[48]Applying the Court of Appeal judgments, having regard to the mitigating facts including his early guilty plea, absence of a previous record, good work record, and efforts at rehabilitation, and aggravating factors, including the age of the complainant, that the respondent breach a position of trust, that there were four events that included touching over and under the clothing while having the child watch pornographic movies, I am persuaded that this offence required a sentence of incarceration.A conditional sentence was inconsistent with the purposes and principles of sentencing.[49]What remains is to determine the length of that sentence and whether the respondent should be incarcerated at this time given that he is deemed to have served 6 months of his conditional sentence since counsel agree that the norm is for the Court of Appeal to credit the time serving a conditional sentence at a one for one credit.R. v. Roberge [2007] O.J. No.2339 As indicated earlier, no authorities were presented that would support a 12 month sentence for this offence and this offender, even including the pornographic movies being shown.A low reformatory sentence would have been appropriate given all of the circumstances.[50]While the trial judge should not have imposed a conditional sentence, with the respondent having served the equivalent of a 6 month sentence already, a sentence within the appropriate range, the appeal is dismissed.___________________________Durno J.Released:March 13, 2008COURT FILE NO. 1817/07DATE:20080313ONTARIOSUPERIOR COURTOF JUSTICEB E T W E E N:HER MAJESTY THEQUEENRespondent-and –LARRY JAMES DAVISAppellantREASONS FOR JUDGMENTDURNO J.Released:March 13, 2008"}

V. Folk and FolkDate: 1986-02-11Docket: 2080 and 2081Between:R. V. FolkandFolkTallis, Wakeling and Sherstobitoff, JJ.A.Counsel:D. Murray Brown, for the Crown;L. Murphy, for the respondents.[1]Sherstobitoff, J.A.: On May 19th, 1985, the respondents were convicted by Maurice, J., of the Court of Queen's Bench, after a three day trial, of two offences, wounding Cst. Ernest Wenman on May 5, 1983, and wounding Cst. Vaughn Veinot on May 5th, 1983, in each case contrary to s. 245.2(1) of the Criminal Code of Canada. On June 19th, 1985, Barry Folk was sentenced to 9 months imprisonment on each charge to be served concurrently. On the same date, William Folk was sentenced to one year imprisonment on each charge to be served concurrently.[2]The respondents appealed the convictions but the appeal was abandoned. The Crown appealed the sentences contending that the trial judge failed to properly consider the seriousness of the offences, the need for deterrence, as well as public protection.[3]There was much conflicting evidence at trial. The respondents gave evidence which was diametrically opposed to that given by the police officers who were injured. The facts, as found by the trial judge, are here summarized.[4]At approximately 3:10 a.m., on May 5th, 1983, Constables Wenman and Veinot of the Regina City Police encountered a vehicle with no lights on, travelling on the wrong side of the road, and speeding. The police did not catch up to the car until it stopped at the Folk residence. They stopped the police car with red grille lights and a portable red light flashing. The Folk vehicle began to back as though to ram the police car but the Folk vehicle stopped. Wenman approached Barry, the operator of the Folk vehicle, and asked for his driver's licence and vehicle registration. Barry said he did not have them, pushed Wenman and when Wenman grabbed Barry's arm, Barry struck him in the facial area with his fist. Wenman, who had smelled liquor on Barry's breath, then made a demand on him for a breathalyzer sample and asked him to accompany him to the police station for that purpose. Barry swore at Wenman, pushed him and walked away. Wenman then advised Barry that he was under arrest and attempted to restrain and handcuff him. Barry resisted and Wenman wrestled him face down to the ground. He had one arm around Barry's neck, and the other one held Barry's arm behind his back. During the course of the struggle, Wenman lost his handcuffs. He called upon Veinot to assist him in handcuffing Barry. Veinot went to Wenman's aid and succeeded in getting the handcuff on one of Barry's arms. However, before he could finish handcuffing Barry, William (a passenger in the Folk vehicle) intervened. William attempted to pull Veinot away from Barry. Wenman got up and pushed William away. Wenman told William to stay away and that he was under arrest for obstruction. William struck Wenman in the face and knocked him unconscious. Veinot, who still had been unable to handcuff Barry's other arm noticed the fallen Wenman. William was standing over Wenman, kicking him in the face and shoulder area. Veinot then went to Wenman's aid. A struggle ensued between Veinot and William. Barry got up, went to the fallen Wenman and kicked him. Barry joined the struggle between William and Veinot. Both of the Folks struck Veinot and knocked him down. While he was on the ground, both men kicked him about the face and arms. This continued until police officers arrived on the scene and arrested the Folks.[5]Both officers sustained serious injuries. Veinot had a cut on an eyebrow. There was a cracked bone in the area of his eye. He lost a small piece of flesh from the ring finger of his right hand with resultant numbness to the end of the finger from a pinched nerve. He had stiffness and soreness to his left knee and elbow. He had pulled muscles and stretched ligaments. The eye was completely swollen shut for a week and a half and vision was blurred until two weeks after the date of the incident. Up to the time of the trial, he suffered from bleeding noses, had difficulty blowing his nose and had intermittent swelling in his facial area. He was off for three weeks as a result of the injury and had to be assigned to light duties for a week and a half.[6]Cst. Wenman was hospitalized for three days. He suffered a broken nose, black eyes, bruises on his chest and back, and required five stitches to the bridge of his nose. After release from hospital he had to return to have his nose operated on to straighten it. At the date of trial, he was due to go back to have his nose rebroken and straightened. He was off work for several weeks.[7]William Folk was 27 years old at the date of the offence. On August 24th, 1979, he was convicted of the offence of possession of stolen property valued over $200.00, contrary to s. 312 and 313(a) of the Criminal Code and given 12 months probation. On November 20, 1981, he was convicted in Calgary of assault causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 245(2) of the Criminal Code and fined $400.00. He comes from a family which has always been law abiding and well respected in the community. The family was always well provided and cared for in all respects, and according to the probation report, the parents emphasized a good value system including the work ethic and respect for others. The family has always been very caring and close knit and continues to be so. William Folk has played professional hockey in the United States and is and has been active in other sports which have taken him on tours to Hawaii, Europe and New Zealand. William now lives with his mother, a widow and was at the date of trial, engaged to be married. He has a Grade 12 education and a couple of years of college and is presently self-employed in the home renovating business.[8]Barry Folk was 24 years old at the date of the offence. The family circumstances outlined above with reference to William apply to Barry. He has no criminal record. Barry lives in a common law relationship and the couple has a good relationship. He completed Grade 12 and has a couple of years of University education. At time of trial, he had his own landscaping business. His chief leisure activities are outdoor sports including hockey, hunting and boating.[9]This court has said in R. v. Ross, an unreported decision of this court, dated September 9, 1983, [see 1983 CanLII 2315 (SK CA), 27 Sask. R. 235] as follows:\"It has been said time and again that the principal purpose of the criminal process, of which sentencing is a critical element, is the protection of society; and that in imposing a sentence, courts must have regard for several factors: punishment; deterrence; protection of the public; and the reformation and rehabilitation of the offender. These factors, and other matters necessarily incidental to them, including the gravity of the offence, the circumstances of its commission, the incidence of the crime in the community, the public attitude toward the crime as well as the personal circumstances of the accused, his age, and character, record and attitude must all be taken into account. This court in R. v. Morrisette (1971), 1970 CanLII 642 (SK CA), 1 C.C.C.(2d) 307, made these observations:'The real problem arises in deciding the factor to be emphasized in the particular case. Of necessity, the circumstances surrounding the commission of an offence differ in each case so even for the same offence sentences may justifiably show a wide variation.. . . . .'… the public can best be protected by the imposition of sentences that punish the offender for the offence committed; that may deter him and others from committing such an offence; and that may assist in his reformation and his rehabilitation'.\"[10]I am of the opinion that in the circumstances of this case the sentences must be increased. In R. v. Ross, supra, and R. v. Littlewolfe (1981), 1981 CanLII 2405 (SK CA), 13 Sask. R. 388, this court held that one year imprisonment was an appropriate sentence for an accused for a serious assault upon a police officer in the execution of his duty. In both cases, the conviction was under s. 246 of the Criminal Code, where the maximum penalty is imprisonment for five years. The respondents in this case were convicted under a section of the Criminal Code for which the maximum penalty is 14 years imprisonment. The maximum term of imprisonment indicates the gravity with which Parliament viewed the offence.[11]Taking into account the background of the respondents, I find it impossible to comprehend why they did what they did. Their conduct falls below the lowest standard of civilized behaviour. It is one thing to assault another person when he can fight back; it is quite another thing to \"put the boots\" to that person when he is down and helpless in the case of Veinot, and unconscious in the case of Wenman. The respondents are perhaps fortunate that other police officers arrived on the scene when they did or the beating might have continued with far more terrible consequences.[12]The law will not tolerate such conduct and the sentences must reflect that lack of tolerance. I am of the opinion, with all due respect to the trial judge, that he failed to properly consider the seriousness of the offences, the need for deterrence, and the need for public protection. The ferocity of the assaults and the injuries inflicted upon peace officers in the execution of their duties could warrant sentences of 18 months imprisonment to 24 months imprisonment. However, taking into account the background of the respondents, the character references given, and their lack of any substantial criminal record, something less is, in this particular case, appropriate.[13]The learned trial judge imposed a lesser sentence on Barry Folk. He did so on the basis that William was older and that if William had not involved himself there would have been no incident since Barry was being arrested and under control when William intervened. I do not agree. Both were equally responsible for what happened.[14]Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the sentences and impose a sentence of 15 months in prison on each respondent on each charge, to be served concurrently.Appeal allowed."}

KEIR ADAMSBefore:Honourable A. H. BrienAt:Saint John, N.B.On:JANUARY 17TH, 2001APPEARANCES:PROSECUTION- P. McPhailDEFENCE- M. Richard and J. BlackierReasons on SentenceTHE COURT:[1]Counsel, I have had an opportunity of considering not only your submissions made this morning, but also to review some of the cases which were submitted on behalf of the Crown, as well as to consider aspects of sentencing which a Court is required to take into consideration when fixing the appropriate sentence.[2]The accused has plead guilty to two charges.Count 3 is wilfully evading the payment of Federal Income Tax in the amount of $22,561by failing to report income for the taxation years 1994 and 1995 in the amount of$92,823 contrary to s.239(1)d) of the Income Tax Act. The other, count 4, is wilfully evading the payment or remittance of G.S.T. of $ 16,096 for the same tax years contrary to s. 327(1)c of the Excise Tax Act.[3]I must say that these cases do present some difficulty because of the nature of the offences.I refer to the offences jointly because while they are charged under different Acts, the principles behind each are the same and the nature of the offences is similar.[4]First, whether espoused in a case in 1958, or in 1999, there is no doubt but that these offences are criminal in nature.They are crimes just as fraud is, just as theft is. (see R. v. Ramm (1958) 120 C.C.C.44 (Ont. C.A.) @ p.47, R. v. Bell (1925) 43 C.C.C.286 (S.C.C.))[5]Second, there is no question that these types of crimes have a detrimental effect on society.In this particular instance, of course, we are talking about the entire country.When people and businesses do not pay their taxes, they are not paying their share, and the loss of that is obviously something that has to be absorbed by those other people and businesses who do pay their taxes.Other taxpayers end up carrying the burden for those who don’t pay the tax. ( for similar comments see R. v. Horowitz (1971) 71 D.T.C. 5350 (Ont. Co. Ct.) @ p 5368-9; Curley v. R. (1969) 7 C.R.N.S. 108 @ p.113-4)[6]As cited in cases referred to by the Crown counsel, courts have observed that there is a frustration element with these types of offences; other taxpayers feel that there has been an injustice done to them, that they are being penalized for being honest. ( see R. v. Stavroff (unreported) June 21, 1978 (S.C.O.)[7]With respect to the motive, Defence counsel presents an alternative rationale for why someone would not in fact declare the income received and thus not have to pay the taxes which they are obligated to do.It’s an alternative to that presented by Crown namely the motivation of greed.To counter this Defence counsel suggests that it is one of the problems that arise in a competitive industry.He suggests that businesses, which are otherwise following the requirements, find themselves at a point where they can not remain competitive in price because others are breaking the law. The impression is that others are breaking the law by not declaring their income, and therefore are offering their services and materials at a lower rate to a consumer.It is based upon the premise that where no tax is to be paid, then that component need not be built into a quoted price.I think that is the argument; in essence the accused found himself in a situation where his business, particularly the paving business became more competitive, his competitors were cutting their rates based on the assumption that they would receive their money in cash and it would be unreported for tax purposes.[8]That is an argument which allows for a spiral into what has generally been referred to as the “underground economy”.If everyone had that attitude then, of course, we would be in a very precarious situation in this country.[9]In my opinion, the argument that “others do it, therefore must I”, is simply an argument of self-interest.It basically overlooks the rationale that while not always popular, taxes are nevertheless necessary for the country to be funded.In essence, it replaces the rationale of the “public interest” for the rationale of “self-interest”.(see R. v. Gregoire (1972) 72 D.T.C. 6219 (Que.)[10]It is a rationale which others can very easily be lured into applying, and therein lies the problem.When one looks at the whole issue of deterrence and exemplary sentences, people have to be alerted to the fact that such rationale is detrimental to the country as well as against the law. Others might look to a well-established business as a role model, and perhaps get the notion that if an otherwise reputable individual embarks on that approach, then it may be acceptable for them as well.That’s the whole aspect of sentencing that deals with protection of the public.[11]“Self interest”, whether it is categorized as greed, or whether it is categorized as a desire to maintain your current status, or as a desire to be part of what is going on in that particular industry, is not the basis of income tax legislation.[12]With respect to the factual circumstances, notwithstanding Crown counsel’s argument with respect to the level of operation of the accused, I accept Defence counsel’s submission that this was not a sophisticated scheme.In this aspect it is in contrast to the situation facing Judge Lampert in R. v. Gaudet (1998) 202 N.B.R.(2d) 301 as well as to other cases which this Court has heard.[13]It is also noted, and Crown counsel does cite one case consistent with such, that simplicity in approach is sometimes a more effective way of evading taxes than sophistication.[14]Now, one has to bear in mind that this case, like most income tax cases which the court hears, is a case where detection is not from the individual coming forth, but rather from an individual being audited.This is not a case where an individual has ‘seen the error of his or her ways’ and has come forth to declare the income which he or she failed to declare. Rather the income tax department has received some type of lead and followed it up with an audit and brought this prosecution.[15]Defence counsel presents the accused as an individual who, perhaps because of his lack of formal education and his manner of doing business, did not pay very close attention to good book-keeping practices.He states that at the time the prosecution was launched, Mr. Adams had to engage experienced individuals to ‘put together’ the financial pieces to which he had failed to pay attention in prior years.Defence counsel does not present this as a case where the accused blames his book-keeper.Nor should he. While he may not have the academic credentials the accused certainly has demonstrated business credentials.He has obviously survived in business for many years.He chose the manner in which to conduct his business.He obviously chose whom to hire, and if he didn’t hire someone who was able to ensure that the requirements of the Income Tax Act were followed or fulfilled, that’s a decision he made.The Court does not place much weight on any argument that it was a combination of the failures of a bookkeeper and of an inadequate bookkeeping system.[16]In essence, the impression left with the court is that Mr. Adams is someone who knows the value of a dollar, and he obviously made a business decision with respect to who and how he was going to keep track of his records and that was not a very good decision on his part.[17]Other aspects of the factual circumstances to be considered include the requisite knowledge of the act. This case should be distinguished from those cases where there is a momentary failure in good judgement, a spur of the moment, a one-time attempt at something which subsequently is found not to be the best way to approach.[18]This is a case where the accused was dealing with his income tax over a two year period of time, and obviously must have been aware that, if in fact there were not good records, then he would not be able to defend his particular position.As the Crown noted, the accused chose a method of retaining large sums of money at his house, and of course that practice would have avoided detection through other means, such as banking records.[19]With respect to the amount involved, clearly when one looks at some of the more recent cases, the amount here is not a substantial amount, however, even that is a matter that is relative to the position of the taxpayer.[20]The details before me of Mr. Adams’ lifestyle are that he has raised a family of eight, has been married fifty-two years, is currently in business and has had a number of small businesses over the years. Defence counsel represents that this is not a situation of an individual living “high on the hog”, so to speak, but that whatever he has evaded in taxes, he has used to continue his businesses and to continue to support his family.[21]It is fair to note however that this is not a situation of dire need, or financial desperation.The Court often deals with situations where people have been in dire need, and, as a result, have done things which are contrary to the law.While not excusable in such cases, there is some explanation which bears on being able to survive and the Court can take that into consideration.The representations in this case do not put Mr. Adams in that category.The need seems to be that he wanted to maintain his lifestyle through the competitive times.[22]I have already touched on some aspects of the character of the accused as were represented to me, and to that I think could be added the description of hard working,enterprising individual and having a good business sense, notwithstanding a limited formal education.[23]I must say that I have to discount Defence counsel’s representation that somehow Mr. Adams should be given credit for not having to rely at any point in time on the social safety nets that have been set in place by governments, such as employment insurance and social welfare.Clearly, in our society, these safety nets are necessary, but they require individuals to contribute their fair share by taxes to fund the programs.Ironically that is what the accused was attempting to avoid.[24]The accused has no previous record.With respect to character, it is sometimes found that good character can be a guise to avoid detection.People considered to be of good character might more easily avoid the attention from the Income Tax Department for instance.[25]There does not appear to be any indication that the accused was attempting to use his good character in the community as a guise.However, I have noted the detrimental effect on a community when a role model is found to have broken the rules.It can have the effect of being a negative influence on others, bringing them to think that if people like Mr. Adams, at his age and perceived position in the community break the rules then it might be okay.[26]This is the insidious side of the problem with income tax.To say that no one likes to pay income tax is probably a fair statement.The other side is that people, who do not like to pay income tax and then do not pay it, nevertheless benefit from the taxes paid by others.Therein lies one of the problems with sentencing.How to get that point across.[27]With respect to the duration of the offence, in this particular instance it’s two years, two tax years.While not a lengthy period of time, as noted it isn’t something that just developed overnight as far as the accused’s approach to record keeping for instance.[28]As to the principles of sentencing, the Criminal Code now codifies the principles which a Court is to take into consideration.I am not going to repeat those, they are set out in the Code.However I think some comment from the Court is necessary with respect to Defence counsel’s very candid observations with respect to the changing philosophy in sentencing.[29]In some situations a Court has looked at the prosecution itself, all the publicity that goes with that and all the negative aspects such has on an individual’s life as being salutary to the individual, and to anyone else who might be in a similar position. In certain areas of what we generally refer to as criminal law, there appear to be more sentencing tools and options available to Courts. For instance, there has been a definite shift with respect to incarceration, allowing Courts sentencing alternatives to incarceration. However, sentencing parameters are set by the Parliament of Canada, and in certain areas of criminal law, those parameters have been removing the discretion of Judges and fixing penalties in the nature of minimums.[30]I think with respect to the Income Tax Act, and my knowledge of the Act over the years, the Parliament of Canada has shifted towards the removal of discretion from Judges with respect to certain types of offences.There appears to be a particular emphasis on those types of offences which appear to be more easily related to and calculated in monetary terms.Other illustrations of that are the Tobacco Tax Act and the Excise Act provisions dealing with certain goods and commodities.[31]Under the Income Tax Act, penalties are fixed in terms of monetary amounts and by increasing the minimum fines, the Parliament of Canada is sending a clear signal that larger financial penalties are going to be attracted to continuation of offences such as in this situation.[32]It may well be that for the accused, simply the matter of being prosecuted, and all that that signals would be enough to deter him.However, as has been observed in other situations, it is not always simply the matter of deterring the individual, but deterring the general public.[33]I do agree with Defence counsel’s submission, that it will be the very fact that Mr. Adams receives a significant fine which sends the signal.The current minimum, at fifty percent, is a significant fine.Hopefully the message will go out to others, that there is a significant penalty if in fact you fail to report your income, and therefore evade the tax on it.[34]With respect to the administrative penalties, they have been referred to generally by Defence Counsel in his submissions and not opposed by the Crown.I am able to take into consideration that there are administrative penalties which are significant unto themselves.(see R. v. Sumarah and North Star Shipping [1970] 5 C.C.C. 317 @ p.327)[35]Perhaps those penalties are not so well known to tax-payers as the penalties which are assessed when the matter goes to prosecution.However, the one message to be taken from the imposition of the criminal sanction, and I assume the administrative sanction, is to be honest and report your income and pay the tax.[36]I’ll take into consideration that the accused has entered a plea of guilty, avoiding what was to be a lengthy trial.I also accept that the plea comes as soon as counsel on his behalf had an opportunity to learn fully what the case was against him.On one hand that was a matter which really has been compounded by Mr. Adams himself as clearly his records were not in very good shape.However I think it is fair to recognize an individual has plead guilty at the earliest opportunity, if in fact it comes following a disclosure of all the information so that counsel can advise accordingly.[37]Lastly, with respect to the range of sentencing, Counsel have made their presentations based on the Court adopting a percentage.I have re-read the provisions of the Income Tax Act, and I do not believe that it has to be the percentage that guides the Court.In my opinion, if a fine is to be levied, it should be levied according to the principles of sentencing and it should be a fine which in fact falls within the requirements of the Act, but are set according to what the Court considers to be the appropriate penalty.[38]Clearly an argument can be made for a sentence in percentage terms.In my opinion the use of percentages can be misconstrued as an assessment by the court of the degree of culpability in comparison to that found in other cases.In sentencing, the court often has to take into consideration factors which neither lend themselves to easy comparison nor specific degrees.In this particular instance, the court is going to fix a penalty in dollar, rather than percentage terms.[39]Looking at all of the factors which I have canvassed, and placing those as I have in the mitigating and aggravating columns, I assess the penalties as follows.Mr. Adams, would you stand?[40]With respect to the failure to report your income as set out in count three, the appropriate penalty in my opinion is eighteen thousand dollars.[41]With respect to count number four, that is the evasion of taxes imposed under the Excise Tax Act, which has been referred to generally as the G.S.T., the penalty that I am going to impose is twelve thousand dollars.[42]The total fine is thirty thousand dollars, the ‘in default’ time will be sixty days on each count consecutive."}

Wright [2002 NSSC 247] on charges of possession of cannabis resin for the purpose of trafficking, and possession of proceeds of crime, contrary to ss. 5(2) and 8 respectively of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19.[2]The respondent was stopped for speeding, which led to the discovery of a carton containing 4.6 kilograms of cannabis resin and $40,020 cash in the trunk of his vehicle. Justice Wright found that the respondent was “. . . acting as a courier for someone involved in the drug trade”, and accepted his evidence that he was paid $1,000 to deliver the carton from Halifax to Moncton. On a voir dire during the trial, Justice Wright concluded that while it was not proved that the respondent knew the exact contents of the box, he knew it was related to the drug trade.[3]Justice Wright considered the relevant sections of the Criminal Code, the principles of sentencing, the respondent’s criminal record and his role in the venture. The respondent, who is 41 years old, had a criminal record of 11 prior convictions, five of which were for simple possession and one for cultivation of a narcotic. He claimed to be a user of marijuana for medical reasons. Justice Wright sentenced the respondent to a term of imprisonment for 18 months, to be served as a conditional sentence in the community, and subject to certain conditions, including house arrest for the first nine months, with specific exceptions, curfew of 10:00 p.m to 6:00 a.m. for the next nine months, and 80 hours of community service. A lifetime firearms prohibition under s. 109 of the Code was imposed, as were forfeiture orders relating to the vehicle and the cash.[4]The rationale for the length of sentence selected is found in the following passage of Justice Wright’s decision:¶ 18 As referred to earlier, s. 718.1 sets out the fundamental principle that sentencing must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. Without question, anyone involved in the distribution of drugs, even as a courier, and even with soft drugs, commits a serious offence. But everything is relative. Here, it can be readily inferred that the offender knew, or at least held the trust of, someone involved in large scale commercial trafficking of cannabis resin. But there is no evidence before me that the offender was a principal of such an operation himself, or had a stake in the profits, or even that he acted as a courier for someone else as a recurring activity. Although no excuse, nor a mitigating factor in any way, the evidence indicates that he was in a desperate financial situation at the time, trying to emerge from a personal bankruptcy, and saw this as an opportunity to make a fast buck to the tune of $1,000. He seemingly ignored the consequences of such criminal activity.¶ 19 While his degree of responsibility is not to be understated, at the same time, it does not rank as egregiously with that of a principal of a large scale commercial operation who, generating the trafficking of drugs, receives the proceeds of sale and reaps the profits in an enterprise of greed.¶ 20 Because I make this distinction, as urged by defence counsel, I reject a penitentiary term, as well as a sentence of probation, as inappropriate. I am further satisfied that the offender, having no history of drug trafficking or being a major player in the drug trade, does not present a risk of endangering the safety of the community. There is nothing in his Pre-Sentence Report or his past criminal record that persuades me otherwise. Those criteria being met, the question remains whether a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.[5]The Crown applies for leave and, if granted, appeals the sentence, submitting that the sentence is demonstrably unfit, based on error in principle in characterization of the offences, and that the sentence inadequately reflects the principles of denunciation, deterrence and protection of the public.[6]The applicable standard of review of the sentence is, as stated by Justice Oland in R. v. Longaphy, 2000 NSCA 136 (CanLII), [2000] N.S.J. No. 376 (C.A.) at § 20:[20]A sentence imposed by a trial judge is entitled to considerable deference from an appellate court.A sentence should only be varied if the appellate court is satisfied that the sentence under review is “clearly unreasonable”: R. v. Shropshire (1995), 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at pp. 209‑210.Absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence if the sentence is “demonstrably unfit”: R. v. M.(C.A.) ( 1996), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 (S.C.C.) at p. 374.The Supreme Court of Canada reiterated this standard of appellate review in reviewing a conditional sentence in R. v. Proulx (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449, [ 2000] 1 S.C.R. 61 at § 123‑126.[7]I agree with the submission of the Crown that the sentence is outside the acceptable range for offences of this nature, and that the trial judge erred in principle in his characterization of both the offence and the respondent’s degree of involvement in the drug trade, and in failing to give sufficient weight to the criminal record of the respondent.[8]Sentences for possession of narcotics for the purposes of trafficking imposed by this court over the last 25 years have consistently been largely influenced by the quantity of drugs involved and the function or position of the offender in the drug operation. Other factors considered either more or less relevant, depending on the circumstances, are the criminal record and age of the offender, whether he was on probation at the time of the offence, and the sophistication and scope of the enterprise. This approach was emphasized in R. v. Fifield (1978), 25 N.S.R. ( 2d) 407, where MacKeigan, C.J.N.S. said at p. 410:In the various categories one cannot find or expect to find any uniformity of sentence.The cases above are merely random samples to illustrate the apparent categories.Certainly sentences are not, and should not be, closely proportionate in their length to the quantity of marihuana involved.The quantity is important in helping show the quality of the act or the probable category of trafficker ‑ ‑ the isolated accommodator of a friend, the petty retailer, the large retailer or small wholesaler, or the big‑time operator.The categories respectively have broad and overlapping ranges of sentence into which the individual offender must be appropriately placed, depending on his age, background, criminal record, and all surrounding circumstances.[9]I would agree with the trial judge that the respondent’s role was not equal to that of the “principal of a large scale commercial operation”. The trial judge appeared to have found that since the respondent was simply or merely a courier, he was not a significant player in the drug trade, and therefore equivalent to a petty retailer. However, it is indisputable that a courier is an integral part of the distribution system in the drug business.Drugs and money have to be delivered from the importation or cultivation location to the dealers and the users. Couriers provide that critical link between the wholesalers and retailers, often shielding the major stakeholders from detection.In Nova Scotia, couriers have not traditionally been regarded as less culpable or treated more leniently than other middlemen in the organization.[10]An examination of possession for the purposes cases, reveals that the typical range of sentences for small wholesalers or large retailers, the people on the third of the four rungs of the ladder identified in Fifield, is two to five years incarceration. It also appears from this survey that the quantity of cannabis resin necessary to categorize a person at this level is two to ten kilograms, with values in the tens of thousands of dollars range. The presence of exceptional mitigating circumstances, such as youth, or previous unblemished character, may, of course, take an offender out of the normal range. Some of the cases, illustrative of these points, in chronological order are:- R. v. Butler (1987), 79 N.S.R. (2d) 6 (C.A.): This was a courier case involving 8.8 pounds (or 4 kg.) of cannabis resin. The court increased the 90 day sentence to one year custody. The offender was young, 25 years old, and had no previous record.- R. v. Boudreau (1987), 81 N.S.R. (2d) 382 (C.A.): The facts are very similar to the matter under appeal. The offender was found to have 6 kilograms of cannabis resin and $34,000 cash in his vehicle. He was 30 years old and had a prior record including three drug offences. This court decreased the sentence to three years.- R. v. O’Toole (1992), 1992 CanLII 2610 (NS CA), 110 N.S.R. (2d) 359 (C.A.): The sentence was increased to 2 years custody for offences involving possession of 2.04 kilograms of cannabis resin, one-half gram of cocaine and a loaded hand gun. The offender had a minor record and was 31 years old. The quantity of drugs involved was said to be “. . . far in excess of that which would classify the respondent as a petty retailer.”- R. v. Crossan (1993), 1993 CanLII 3276 (NS CA), 116 N.S.R. (2d) 352 (C.A.): The 21 year old offender with one previous conviction was apprehended with 2 kilograms of cannabis resin and 166 grams of cocaine. Concurrent sentences of four and one half years were imposed on appeal.- R. v. Collette (1999), 1999 CanLII 4552 (NS CA), 177 N.S.R. (2d) 386 (C.A.): The offender, found to be a courier of 10 kilograms of cannabis resin who was also involved in the arranging of the transaction, on appeal had his sentence increased to 3 years, in addition to the 5 months served on the conditional sentence.[11]All of these cases involved possession of a sufficient quantity of cannabis resin to place the offenders in the commercial sector, to use the Fifield terminology as either a large retailer or a small wholesaler. At the top end of the range, there were other aggravating factors, such as possession of cocaine or large sums of money. Butler, at one year custody, was outside the range because of youth and lack of a criminal record. Absent exceptional circumstances, a person involved in a small wholesale or large retail operation, such as this, should generally attract a sentence in the range. His placement within that range will take into account factors personal to the offender and his degree of involvement. Any suggestion that there is a separate and lower range of sentence for couriers within a commercial operation is rejected.[12]Other possession of narcotics cases that may, at first blush, seem atypical of this range are cases where the offenders were either petty retailers (R. v. Wheatley (1997), 1997 CanLII 14532 (NS CA), 159 N.S.R. (2d) 161(C.A.)), or had a minor marijuana growing operation (R. v. Frenette (1997), 1997 CanLII 3512 (NS CA), 159 N.S.R. (2d) 81(C.A.)). The issue in those specific cases, among the first to consider the conditional sentence legislation, was whether the sentences, conceded by the Crown to be in the less than two years range, should be served in the community. Those offenders were not found to be operating in the commercial arena.[13]There are no mitigating factors in this case which would remove the respondent from the normal range. He is not youthful and he has a significant criminal record. In fact, he was convicted of another drug offence while awaiting trial for this offence. He was not only paid $1,000 for transporting drugs, but was also entrusted with $40,000 cash by whomever was in charge of this inter-provincial transaction. Although the trial judge accepted that the respondent did not necessarily know the exact contents or quantity of drugs in the box he was delivering, he obviously must be taken to have known that the package was of significant value. It is fair to infer that he would not have been paid $1,000 to deliver a minor quantity of drugs. The comments of Pace, J.A., in R. v. Butler, supra, are applicable to the respondent:[10]In the present appeal the trial judge found the respondent's motivation for trafficking in drugs was to make money and, although he may have in the past used some of his own product, there is no indication that he was addicted or the profits would be used to satisfy his own habit. Thus I can only conclude that greed and the quest for easy money quite overcame any thought in the respondent's mind of the great and, in many cases, the irreparable harm he might inflict on others. Clearly, to carry out an operation of this magnitude required premeditation and planning which is an aggravating factor which must be considered in sentencing. See: R. v. Tellum and Zablaska (1979), 29 N.S.R. (2d) 145; 45 A.P.R. 145.[14]I also agree with the submissions in the Crown’s factum in this respect:Drug trafficking offences involve considerable planning and deliberation. In deciding to take a chance by breaking the law in hopes of making easy money, drug dealers engage in a rudimentary form of cost-benefit analysis, weighing the chances of getting caught and the possible consequences against the financial gains they will reap if successful. This is the very kind of thought process that the Respondent embarked upon when, to paraphrase the pre-sentence report, he chose to avail himself of an opportunity to make $1,000, being aware of the consequences and in spite of his own better judgment. In making decisions like this, drug dealers should know that they are likely to receive substantial penalties if caught. This is the type of conduct which is amenable to the deterrent force of the law.[15]The circumstances of this offence and this offender require a sentence in the usual range, that is a penitentiary term, and is not within the eligibility range for a conditional sentence.The circumstances are commensurate to those in R. v. Collette, supra, and R. v. Boudreau, supra. The sentence was unfit in that it is outside the range of sentence and does not appropriately reflect denunciation and general and specific deterrence.[16]I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal, and substitute a term of incarceration of three years, and give credit for six months served pursuant to the conditional sentence, so that the balance remaining as of this date is 30 months. I would affirm the prohibition and forfeiture orders and revoke the order for community service.Roscoe, J.A.Concurred in:Bateman, J.A.Hamilton, J.A."}

Claxton...................................................................................counsel for the DefendantDe Filippis J.:[1] After a five day trial, I found the defendant guilty of public mischief, attempted fraud over $5,000.00, and perjury.In essence, the defendant falsely reported the theft of his motor vehicle for the purpose of defrauding an insurance company and, in so doing, obtained a proof of loss statement by false pretence and lied under oath.The fraud was not successful and the defendant was arrested for these offences.My reasons are reported at R v Akinyemi, 2014 ONCJ 2013.[2] The chronology of events in this matter is as follows:In October 2011, Mr. Shaikh placed an advertisement in Kijiji offering to sell a 2004 Land Rover (Range Rover) for $16,000.00.On the 11th day of that month he negotiated a sale of the vehicle for $14,500.00 to a tall black man with a beard and short hair.This man produced a certified cheque and directed that the transfer of ownership be in the name Victor Akinyemi at 46 Thackery Drive, Ajax.This is the defendant’s name and address.Mr. Shaikh gave one used key for the Range Rover to the purchaser and was told the vehicle would be exported to Ghana.On 19 October 2011, ownership in Range Rover was registered in the defendant’s name.On 20 October 2011, a new key was ordered for the above noted Range Rover by a man who produced identification in the name of Victor Akinyemi, resident at 46 Thackery Drive, Ajax.The cost of cutting the new key was $348.24In late October and early November 2011, Mr. Seegobin, an automobile mechanic, serviced the Range Rover in question at the request of the defendant. The repairs cost $1,111.69 and he paid in cash.While servicing the vehicle, Mr. Seegobin overheard the defendant say he goes back and forth to Africa and would be shipping a motor vehicle there.On 3 January 2012, the defendant contacted the police to report the theft of the Range Rover.He stated he had visited a friend and parked the vehicle on the street while he stayed overnight.In the morning he awoke to find the car gone.On 11 January 2012, the defendant filed a Statement of Loss with his insurance company in which he reported a different date (5 October) and price ($21,000.00) for the purchase of the Range Rover.He also asserted that he has only one key.On 2 February 2012, Det. MacFarlane invited the defendant for an interview and questioned him at length about his income, expenses, and purchase of the Land Rover.It is clear his monthly income is insufficient to cover his monthly expenses and credit charges.The Defendant did not ask if the vehicle had been found.On 31 January 2013, the defendant was examined at the officers of the Durham Reporting and Mediation Services in Whitby.He was represented by counsel at the examination.He made a statement under oath to Kevin Griffiths, a person authorized by law to permit it to be made.[3] At the examination under oath the defendant stated he had purchased the Range Rover as a result of an advertisement on the Kijiji website from a man whose first name is “Mohamed”. This is Mr. Shaikh’s first name.The defendant also said the seller had given him only one key which was turned over to insurance company when he claimed indemnity for the theft of the motor vehicle. He was asked and answered the following questions:Q: Is the key the seller gave you was (sic) the key that you gave to the Personal?A: That is correct.Q: And that’s the only key that you’ve ever had to the Land Rover?A: That is correct.Q: And you’ve never acquired any other keys to the Land Rover?A: No.A: I have that correct, you, you didn’t – you only had one key, you’ve only ever had one key to the Land Rover?A: That is correct, that’s right.[4]The significance of the defendant’s testimony about the key is set out in the following excerpts from my reasons for judgement:The matter of the key is of critical importance to this case.It is clear that Mr. Shaikh handed over only one key to the buyer of the Range Rover.The defendant asserted that he had only one key in his Proof of Loss statement and repeated this in his Statement under Oath to Mr. Griffiths.The latter forms the basis of the perjury count. Moreover, a second key is a significant part of the fraudulent scheme that is alleged. If the motor vehicle was shipped overseas, a key would go with it.If the defendant falsely reported the theft of his vehicle, being in possession of a key is helpful in portraying the loss as having occurred without his participation or negligence.Hence the need to obtain another key.There is no doubt that somebody purchased the Range Rover in question and, nine days later, ordered a new key for it.Both transactions were completed in the name of the defendant, with accompanying personal information.The defendant’s references to “Mohamed” and “Kijiji” in the examination under oath confirm the inference I draw from the other evidence that he purchased the Range Rover from Mr. Shaikh.His assertions that he paid $21,000.00 for the vehicle and possessed only one key, repeat false statements he made in the Proof of Loss Statement.The latter is a sworn document that acts as the application to be indemnified by the insurance company for the theft of the motor vehicle.I am convinced the Range Rover was not stolen.This explains why, during the course of an hour long interview with the investigating officer, the defendant never asked about the progress of the investigation or if the vehicle has been found. It is likely the Range Rover was shipped to Africa but this conclusion is not necessary for the disposition of this case; the Crown has proven the defendant falsely claimed his motor vehicle was stolen in his application for indemnity.I find the defendant guilty of public mischief, attempted fraud over $5,000.00, false pretence [the latter was stayed by the Crown].The defendant is also charged with committing perjury by insisting, in the statement under oath, that he (i) only had one key to the Range Rover, (ii) turned it over to the insurance company, and (iii) never acquired another one.As I have explained, the purchase of the second key was important in facilitating the fraud.Similarly, lying about it was a significant act in concealing the scheme.I have no doubt that the defendant knowingly made a false statement under oath with intent to mislead.He is guilty of perjury.[5] The defendant is 37 years old and married with children.He is an engineer by profession.He does not have a prior criminal record.I am advised the defendant lost his job because of these charges and will have difficulty pursuing his career with a criminal record.The defendant has had to liquidate his investments to support his family.He has significant community support; I received letters from family and friends; all are shocked by these events and attest to good character. His pastor testified that the defendant is a valued member of the All Nations Full Gospel Church and volunteers at several church programs.The defendant’s wife informed me that the family is in financial distress because her husband has not found other employment.The defendant offered a tearful apology to the court and asked for leniency.[6]The position of the parties reflects their appreciation of the offences and personal circumstances of the defendant: The Crown submits that a sentence of 90 days in jail, followed by probation is appropriate.The Defence argues for a discharge or, in the alternative, a conditional sentence of house arrest.A discharge is out of the question in the circumstances of this case; such a disposition is in the defendant’s best interest but contrary to the public interest, especially, as will be explained below, with respect to the perjury count.[7] Section 742.1 of the Code lists four criteria that a court must consider before deciding to impose a conditional sentence: (1) the offender must be convicted of an offence that is not punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment; (2) the court must impose a term of imprisonment of less than two years; (3) the safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender serving the sentence in the community; and (4) a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2. The first two criteria are not obstacles in this case; the only issue is the third and fourth pre-requisite.[8] There is nothing to suggest the defendant would endanger the safety of the community if her sentence were served under house arrest. Moreover, it is my practice not to impose conditional sentences without the electronic supervision program. Thus, I have greater confidence that the provisions of house arrest will be observed and this mitigates the risk of harm to the community. The real issue is whether a conditional sentence is in accord with the principles of sentencing; as noted, the most important ones in this case are denunciation and deterrence.[9] The Supreme Court of Canada has observed that a conditional sentence can meet the demands of denunciation and deterrence in the right circumstances (see R. v. Proulx 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61).A conditional sentence for the attempt fraud and public mischief would properly balance the defendant’s personal circumstances with the planned and deliberate steps taken, over time, to facilitate the offences.However, such a sentence is not appropriate with respect to the perjury.In coming to this conclusion, I take into account the nature of this offence and the fact that it was committed one year after the defendant was confronted by the police and while he was represented by counsel. This was a considered act, not a spontaneous one.[10]By providing a maximum penalty of 14 years for perjury, Parliament expressed its view of the gravity of the offence.The courts have treated the matter seriously because it strikes at the heart of the judicial system; R v C.D. [2000] O.J. No. 1668 (Ont. C.A.).It has been said that perjury is an offence that is easy to commit, yet difficult to prove and that once proven, the offender must expect severe punishment; R v Foster [1982] S.J. No. 1124 (Sask. C.A.).[11]In R v Kusnezoff [1991] B.C.J. No. 412, the British Columbia Court of Appeal identified three kinds of perjury:The most serious category is where the perjured evidence is being given to lead to the conviction of an innocent person.The second most serious category is where, as in this case, the perjured evidence is given in the hope of procuring the U acquittal of a guilty person.The third and final category, in a descending order of seriousness, is where a person gives perjured evidence to protect himself or herself.[12]The defendant’s perjury places him in the third category.A similar case is R v Zeek 2004 BCCA 42 (CanLII), [2004] B.C.J. No. 112 in which the offender lied under oath to perpetuate an insurance fraud.In upholding a sentence of 12 months in jail, the British Columbia Court of Appeal stated that a conditional sentence did not address the principles of denunciation and deterrence.[13]In this case, the principles of denunciation and deterrence require a jail sentence. Having regard to the defendant’s personal circumstances, including the impact on his career and financial hardship, I accept the Crown’s submission of a 90 day jail sentence for the perjury.In light of this, I suspend the passing of sentence for the remaining counts and place the defendant on probation for one year on terms that keep the peace and be of good behaviour and have no contact with Mr. Shaikh, Mr. Zeegobin, Mr. Savja, Mr. Smith and Mr. Griffiths.I also order that the defendant provide a sample of his DNA.Released:June 4, 2014"}

Rodney Macdonald on behalf of Van Nam NguyenD E C I S I O NGLENNIE, J. (Orally)[1]Van Nam Nguyen has been convicted after a trial by Judge and Jury of the offence of production of cannabis marijuana contrary to Section 7(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.The offence is an indictable one and carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment as provided for in Section 7(2)(b) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.It also carries a mandatory minimum 10 years weapons prohibition pursuant to Section 109(1)(c) of the Criminal Code of Canada.[2]The grow operations in this case were located within three Saint John residences located respectively at 25 Mountfield Crescent, 137 Boyanner Crescent and 2 Willie Avenue.[3]The accused's brother, Than Huu Nguyen, was the owner of the residence at 25 MountfieldCrescent.The accused owned the residence at 2 Willie Avenue and the accused's wife, Nhan Thi Doan, owned the residence at 137 Boyanner Crescent.[4]The evidence at trial was that a sophisticated commercial grow operation was occurring at 25 Mountfield Crescent and that the offender, Van Nam Nguyen, assisted in the production at that location.[5]The evidence further disclosed that the offender's residence at 2 Willie Avenue had, immediately prior to the execution of a search warrant, been a sophisticated commercial grow operation which had just been dismantled.[6]The evidence also disclosed that the residence owned by the offender's wife, Nhan Thi Doan, being 137 Boyanner Crescent, had been converted to be used as a commercial grow operation prior to being dismantled by persons known to the accused.[7]The harvested marijuana found at 25 Mountfield Crescent had an estimated value of $100,000.00 (priced per pound).The expert testimony disclosed that this residence had the potential to produce 100 plants for harvest per month.The annual harvest was estimated at 12 crops for a total value estimated at between $1,500,000.00 and $2,000,000.00.The value would depend upon how the crop yields were packaged and sold at the pound, ounce or per gram.[8]The evidence also showed that 2 Willie Avenue was a residence similarly converted as 25 Mountfield Crescent.Both these residences were of a similar size and therefore had the same approximate annual crop yield of near or exceeding $1,000,000.00.[9]The smaller residence, 137 Boyanner Crescent, also had a production capacity similar to 2 Willie Avenue and 25 Mountfield Crescent.[10]These were large scale commercial grows where electricity was obtained illegally via a bypass for all three grow operations.The amount of money the accused stood to gain was substantial.The Offender[11]According to his Pre-sentence Report, Van Nam Nguyen is one of nine children in a family from North Vietnam.He came to Canada in 1998, having been sponsored by his older brother, Thang Van Nguyen.He is 26 years of age, married to Nhan Thi Doan and they have a two year, eight month old son who was born in Canada.He has a grade seven education from his native country, Vietnam.He has little training except for his family's bakery business in Vietnam and as a fish processor on the production line at Connors Brothers in Blacks Harbour and now at a sea farm operation.[12]According to his Pre-sentence Report, within two weeks to a month of his arrival in NewBrunswick, he started working for Connors Brothers on the production line earning approximately $18.00 an hour.He was employed with Connors Brothers until his arrest in January 2004.From October 2004 to March 2005, he was employed with a salmon aquaculture farm in St. George.Analysis[13]The purpose and principles of sentencing are set out in Section 718 of the Criminal Code of Canada.By these principles, sentencing is required to contribute to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committingoffences;(c)to separate offender from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to thecommunity; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility to offenders, andacknowledgement of the harm done to victims and to thecommunity.[14]A further consideration of the Court in sentencing is contained in Section 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code, which provides:A sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.[15]A sentence must also be proportionate to the gravity of the offence given the degree of responsibility of the offender.[16]The aggravating and mitigating factors in this case are as follows:Aggravating Factors1.The offender was an integral part of a family run growoperation;2.The sophisticated nature of the setups which included thebypass of electricity;3.A total of three residences were involved;4.The huge financial gain to be made;5.The dangers of the grow operations to human life and theresidences nearby; and,6.the prevalence of marijuana grow operations in the SaintJohn area.Mitigating Factors1.Van Nam Nguyen is a first time offender;2.He has a wife and young son and also helps to look after hisailing mother;3.He is 26 years of age; and4.He was steadily employed prior to his conviction.Other Cases[17]In R. v. Nguyen, 2004 CarswellNB 344, an accused with 200 mature plants and 34 pounds of marijuana ready for distribution was sentenced by Provincial Court Judge Ferguson to two years in a federal penitentiary.[18]In the unreported care of R. v. Thang Van Nguyen and Thien Thi Doan in 2004, Judge Alfred H. Brien sentenced a husband and wife to terms of 32 months and 14 month respectively for a residential grow operation which yielded 50 pounds of marijuana.[19]In R. v. Eden, 2005 CarswellNB136, Justice Grant imposed a sentence of two years imprisonment on a charge of production of marijuana involving a grow operation in Saint John at one location involving a total of 1,052 marijuana plants with a value of between $405,000.00 and approximately $1.5 million.Consideration of a Conditional Sentence[20]It is the position of defence Counsel in this case that a conditional sentence ought to be granted in the circumstances of this case.It is the position of the Crown that a conditional sentence should not be granted.[21]In R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61 (S.C.C.), the Supreme Court of Canada carried out an exhaustive review of the conditional sentence option which was declared in force by Parliament on September 3, 1996.There are four criteria established with respect to its application:(i)the offender must be convicted of an offence that is not punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment,(ii)the court must impose a term of imprisonment of less than two years,(iii)the safety of the community must not be endangered by the offender serving the sentence in the community, and(iv)a conditional sentence must be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in s. 718 of theCriminal Code.[22]I am satisfied that the offender in this case qualifies for the first three criteria.However, I am of the view that a conditional sentence would be inappropriate on the fourth condition because even the most stringent disposition would fail to adequately address the requirement of deterrence and denunciation.[23]In R. v. Innes, 2001 CarswellBC 1373, the Court stated when commenting on grow operations in British Columbia:One cannot help but to reflect upon the history of the so-called \"grow ops\" in this province.It was not that many years ago that such enterprises were rare and not treated as a particularly worrisome phenomena.Generally the Courts, including this Court, imposed fairly lenient sentences on those involved.In so doing I believe we failed our communities.[24]In R. v. Nguyen, 2000 BCPC 27 (CanLII), 2000 BCPC 0027 (B.C. Prov. Ct.), Judge Lenaghan dealt with these issues in a very helpful and insightful fashion.He pointed out that what the Courts are dealing with in these cases is not marijuana consumption or possession which some would argue is benign, but rather the \"marihuana industry \" which is malignant and which \"has a profound and corrupting effect which if not checked has the potential to undermine social institutions and mores Canadian society holds dear.\"Justice Lenaghan pointed to the terrible experience in other countries where the proliferation of such criminal enterprises engenders corruption and contempt for the law.In short, he concluded that marijuana production of this type is a serious crime and the need for denunciation and deterrence is so pressing that incarceration is the only suitable way of expressing society's condemnation of this conduct and of deterring this offender and others from similar conduct in the future.[25]In R. v. Lee, 2004 CarswellNB 3323, the Court commented on the use of the sanction of a conditional sentence in cases involving the commercial production or sale of drugs as follows:I note that several judges have commented on the fact that incarceration will have a real deterrent effect in cases involving the commercial production or sale of drugs.The reason is that, in most instances, these are businesses.People chose to get into such a business in the same way and for the same way reasons that most people get into business.Generally they do not stumble into such an enterprise as is the case with so many offences that the court sees - because of impulsivity, mental illness, drunkenness or drug addiction.Generally, people get into the business of producing drugs because they have thought about it, done a cost-benefit analysis and reached the conclusion that the benefits outweigh the costs.It is therefore reasonable to conclude that those contemplating getting into or staying in such a business will factor into the \"cost\" side of the analysis the likely penalty they will face if caught.[26]In my opinion, it is also necessary to take into consideration the nature of the type of crime involved with grow operations and the risks they create for residential neighbours through fire hazards.[27]As well, the profits to be made from grow operations are great and thus a reasonably significant deterrent will likely be required to discourage people from getting into the business.As MacKenzie, J.A. said in R. v. Tranat ¶ 9:… Sentences can be viewed as a cost of doing business and lenient sentences provide little deterrent compared to the profit potential.[28]As stated by the Court in R. v. Lee:Although a Conditional Sentence can have a significant denunciatory and deterrent effect, a jail sentence will generally be a more onerous penalty because it results in the complete deprivation of liberty in an institution rather than the partial deprivation of liberty in the home.In my view the more onerous penalty of a jail sentence is required in this situation in order to promote respect for the law and to adequately address the sentencing objectives of denunciation and deterrence.The fundamental principle is that the sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.The commercial production of marijuana is a reasonably serious offence…[29]In my view, a conditional sentence in this case would not be proportionate to the gravity of the offence.Rather, a jail sentence is required.[30]The prevalence of marijuana grow operations in the Saint John area must be abated.There is a need for denunciation and deterrence for this type of crime.[31]In this case, there was a large commercial character to the grow operations.There was a sophisticated quality to the operational setup and the production, including the bypass of electricity from its source.In my opinion, this is not a case for a conditional sentence.[32]I believe this is a case as contemplated by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Proulxwhere the Court wrote:However, there may be certain circumstances in which the need for denunciation is so pressing that incarceration will be the only suitable way in which to express society's condemnation of the offender's conduct.[33]In my view, it is necessary in this case to send a strong message to the community that operating a grow operation is a serious criminal offence and will be treated as such and that any offender will dealt with severely by this Court.It is also necessary for this Court, on behalf of the community, to make a strong statement denouncing this type of crime.Therefore, I conclude that any jail time in this case should be served in jail and not in the community.The request for a conditional sentence is accordingly denied.[34]I have taken into consideration the sophisticated nature of the crime, the grow operations in this case including the bypass of electricity, the duration of the grow operations, the magnitude of the production and the monetary profit the accused and his family stood to gain.I have also taken into consideration the fact that it would appear that Van Nam Nguyen was not the key man but rather as the Crown argued, he was a willing participant in a family operation.His Pre-sentence Report says that he maintains \"limited responsibility \" for the series of events that bring him before this Court.I have also considered the reference letters offered by the offender's employer and co-workers and the positive comments contained therein.I have also taken into consideration the accused's wife's comments.She says her husband was following \"family instructions.\"[35]The duration of the operation in this case makes any argument of lapse of judgment difficult to accept.This was clearly a commercial production intended for substantial profit carried on over a considerable period of time.It is necessary for this Court to tailor a sentence to meet the accused's involvement in the grow operation.In my opinion, incarceration is the only suitable way to express society's condemnation of the offender's conduct.[36]Having considered the submissions of Counsel; the offender's Pre-sentence Report; the mitigating and aggravating factors in this case; sentences imposed in similar cases; as well as the amount of time spent on remand that amounts to approximately five months which, when doubled, gives a credit of 10 months of pre-trial custody and post-trial custody, which credit I have taken into consideration and allowed, Van Nam Nguyen is sentenced today to a sentence going forward from this day of 20 months in jail.[37]There will also be a mandatory firearms and weapons prohibition order effectively immediately and terminating 10 years after the date of his release from imprisonment._______________________________Peter S.

Did the trial judge err in refusing to order a mistrial?[1]On May 21, 2003 the appellant and two other co-accused were arraigned.Counsel for the co-accused informed the court that all three men required an interpreter.An interpreter was provided.The appellant’s counsel, Mr. Kiefer, brought an application to exclude the evidence of the cocaine on the basis that the search violated the appellant’s s. 8 Charter rights.The application was dismissed.The appellant then pled guilty to the charge of possession for the purpose of trafficking.[2]On June 6, 2003 the appellant’s sentence hearing took place.Mr. Kiefer asked to be removed from the record as the appellant had retained new counsel, Mr. Mattson.When asked if the interpreter was present, Mr. Kiefer stated that in his view the appellant did not require an interpreter.Mr. Kiefer was then discharged.[3]Mr. Mattson, the new counsel for the appellant, then asked the trial judge to adjourn the sentencing proceedings as his client had “severe deficiencies in understanding the English language” and needed an interpreter.This request was granted.Mr. Mattson then asked the trial judge to strike the guilty plea and enter a conviction on the voir dire evidence, in order to preserve the appellant’s rights of appeal.This request was granted.[4]On September 12, 2003 the appellant appeared for his sentencing hearing with new counsel, Mr. Smart.Mr. Smart brought a motion for mistrial based on an alleged violation of the appellant’s s. 14 Charter right to an interpreter.Mr. Smart submitted the appellant did not understand the nature of the arraignment and Charter proceedings.In support of the motion, Mr. Smart filed an affidavit from Mr. Mattson.In the affidavit, Mr. Mattson stated that his client had severe trouble understanding English.He also stated that his client informed him that the interpreter was sitting in between the two other co-accused, and the appellant could not hear the translation.The mistrial motion was dismissed and the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in doing so.[5]The only evidence before the trial judge on whether the appellant was denied an interpreter was the affidavit of Mr. Mattson who was not counsel for that part of the trial.This affidavit was hearsay.The appellant did not file an affidavit or give evidence that he did not have the services of the interpreter who had been provided for the three co‑accused during the proceedings.No complaint was made about the adequacy of the interpretation during the Charter motion. On that record it was open to the trial judge to find that the appellant had not made out a breach of s. 14.We therefore have no basis on which to interfere with the trial judge’s decision to give no weight to the Mattson affidavit and not to declare a mistrial.2. Did the trial judge err in sentencing by overemphasizing the principles of general deterrence and denunciation?[6]The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in principle when, in his reasons for sentence, he referred to the fact that Guelph was a university community although there was nothing to suggest that the appellant had any dealings with university students.In our opinion the trial judge was simply speaking at large about the harmful effects of cocaine and he did not err in principle.[7]The sentence of 18 months imposed by the trial judge was within the range and it was open to the trial judge to find that this was not an appropriate case for a conditional sentence.The circumstances before us are identical to those before the trial judge.We would not interfere with the sentence.[8]The appeal as to conviction and sentence is therefore dismissed.“Karen M.

No. 129 (P.C.).STATUTES CONSIDERED: The Criminal Code of Canada, RSC, 1985.JUDGMENT OF GORMAN, P.C. J.(SENTENCE)INTRODUCTION:[1]Earlier today, Mr. Hynes pleaded guilty to the offence of dangerous driving, contrary to section 249(1)(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada, RSC 1985.The Crown proceeded by way of summary conviction.The sole issue for determination was the imposition of an appropriate sentence for this offence.I imposed a period of four months conditional imprisonment.These constitute my reasons for doing so, commencing with a review of the circumstances of the offence committed by Mr. Hynes.THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCE[2]On May 29, 2012, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police received a complaint of a motor vehicle being driven in a dangerous manner in the area of Parsons Pond.Subsequent investigation revealed that Mr. Hynes had driven a motor vehicle into a ditch and then on to the lawn of a resident of Parsons Ponds, driving through that person’s fence until striking a town water valve.Mr. Hynes was observed driving the motor vehicle away from Parsons Pond on the wrong side of the road while approaching a “blind turn.”When Mr. Hynes was arrested by the police, they could smell alcohol coming from him.Mr. Hynes informed the police that he had no recollection of having driven to Parsons Pond.[3]In R. v. Lundrigan, 2012 NLCA 43 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal indicated that a “fit sentence” is one “that takes account of the circumstances of the offences and the offender.”THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER[4]Mr. Hynes is sixty-six years of age.He has no prior convictions.Mr. Hynes was born in Cow Head.He left school after grade four to work in the woods to help support his family financially.As an adult, he has primarily been employed in Alberta andOntario.He is presently employed as a snow plow driver on a part time basis for a private company.THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES[5]The Crown sought a period of two to four months conditional imprisonment.It did not seek a driving prohibition.Mr. Hynes agreed with the range of sentence proposed by the Crown.THE PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[6]In R. v. Knott, 2012 SCC 42 (CanLII), it was held that \"the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code are meant to take into account the correctional imperative of sentence individualization.\"[7]Section 718 of the Criminal Code states that the fundamental purpose of sentencing \"is to contribute...to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society.\"This is to be achieved by imposing sentences which have, among other objectives, the objectives of:-separating offenders from society, where necessary;-denouncing unlawful conduct;-general deterrence;-rehabilitation; and-the promoting of a \"sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and the community.\"[8]Section 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code states that \"a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.\"[9]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code states that any sentence imposed must be \"proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\"[10]Section 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code indicates that a \"sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender.\" In R. v. Briand, 2010 NLCA 67 (CanLII), [2010] N.J. No. 339 (C.A.), the Court of Appeal stressed the importance of considering an offender's personal circumstances in applying section 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code.[11]Section 718.2(d) states that \"an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances\" and section 718.2(e) states that \"all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.\"THE RANGE OF SENTENCE[12]In R. v. Tuglavina, [2011] N.J. No. 25 (C.A.), the trial judge in imposing sentence indicated that the concept of range of sentence had been \"overruled by the Supreme Court of Canada many times.\"The Court of Appeal disagreed.It concluded that the \"sentencing judge erred in failing to give any consideration to the representations of Crown counsel respecting the appropriate range of sentences.”In R. v. Oake, 2010 NLCA 19 (CanLII), [2010] N.J. No. 94, the Court of Appeal indicated that a judge has a duty \"to impose sentences in line with precedent, noting always that for each offence and each offender some elements are unique.\"In addition, in every case in which sentence is imposed, in this Province, the sentencing judge must initially determine if a “prescriptive” or “descriptive” range of sentence applies (see R. v. Johnston, [2011] N.J. No. 303 (C.A.)).A prescriptive range has not been set for the offence of dangerous driving.SENTENCING PRECEDENTS-DANGEROUS DRIVING[13]In R. v. Rogers (2008), 2008 NLCA 19 (CanLII), 274 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 159 (N.L.C.A.), the Court of Appeal indicated that for \"simple dangerous or impaired driving, sentences range from a $1,000.00 fine in Denney, [2007] N.J. No. 218, to two months imprisonment in Penney, [2001] N.J. No. 320, three months in Giovannini, 2007 CanLII 39742 (NL PC), [2007] N.J. No. 336, six months in Antle, 1993 CanLII 8190 (NL CA), [1993] N.J. No. 176, and Oliver, [1996] N.J. No. 322, and twelve months in Fry (conditional), [2005] N.J. No. 353.\"[14]In R. v. Jacobs, [2011] N.J. No. 442 (P.C.), the offender pleaded guilty to the offences of dangerous driving and operating a motor vehicle while prohibited from doing so contrary to sections 249(2) and 259(4) of the Criminal Code.The dangerous driving offence involved the offender operating a snowmobile in a dangerous manner on the main street of Curling.In determining an appropriate sentence for these offences, I had the opportunity to consider a number of sentencing precedents including Rogers.I summarized the effect of these precedents by noting that they \"illustrate that for the offence of dangerous driving periods of 3 months conditional imprisonment (Barry-joint submission); 6 months incarceration (Roche and Pardy, [2009] N.J. No. 321); 9 months conditional imprisonment (McCarthy, [2010] N.J. No. 34); 12 months incarceration (Hollett and Rogers); and 12 months conditional imprisonment (Fry) have been imposed.\"In Jacobs I imposed a period of four months conditional imprisonment.[15]In R. v. Burton, [2012] N.J. No. 129 (P.C.), the accused was convicted of a number of offences including the offence of dangerous driving.I described the circumstances involved in the following manner:…on June 5, 2011, Ms. Burton \"drove her vehicle directly at Mr. Lovell with the intent to threaten Mr. Lovell with the application of force, i.e. being struck by the vehicle. She did so out of anger and frustration and in an attempt to have him return to her residence.\" I also concluded that Ms. Burton was driving in such a manner that \"she almost drove into a ditch\" and that \"she drove her vehicle toward Mr. Lovell on more than one occasion.\" At the time, Ms. Burton's three years old child was in the vehicle.[16]For the dangerous driving offence, I imposed a period of six months conditional imprisonment.ANALYSIS[17]As can be seen from the sentencing precedents referred to, a period of four months conditional imprisonment is within the range of sentence for the offence of dangerous driving.The circumstances of the driving which took place in this case were extremely dangerous.However, Mr. Hynes is an older offender with no previous convictions.For these reasons, and considering the submissions of counsel, I concluded that a period of four months conditional imprisonment should be imposed.A DRIVING PROHIBITION[18]Normally when an offender is convicted of the offence of dangerous driving a driving prohibition will be imposed both for deterrent purposes and to protect the public.However, as pointed out earlier, the Crown indicated that it was not seeking such an order in this case.On this basis, I did not impose a driving prohibition.CONCLUSION[19]For the reasons provided, Mr. Hynes was sentenced to a period of four months conditional imprisonment.[20]Judgment accordingly."}

Lindo-Butler, for the CrownRichard Litkowski, for the Defendant))HEARD:January 30, 2012Kelly j.REASONS FOR SENTENCE[1]Mr. Ian Junior Chambers was convicted of eight offences arising from his possession of one handgun: a .38 caliber Smith and Wesson revolver.Mr. Chambers possessed such a handgun on March 23, 2010 in the area of Weston Road and Eglinton Avenue in the City of Toronto.[2]Mr. Chambers brought an application pursuant to ss. 7, 12 and 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms at trial.He alleged that the police used excessive force on his arrest and as such, the charges should be stayed.At the end of the trial, the charges were not stayed.Accordingly, Mr. Chambers was convicted of all offences and the matter was adjourned for the purposes of sentencing.[3]Mr. Chambers comes before me as a 25 year old and third time firearms offender.Crown Counsel seeks a period of incarceration of 13.5 years.Counsel for Mr. Chambers seeks a sentence of 7 years.I have concluded that the appropriate sentence in these circumstances is 8 years less time served.He will be subject, as well, to certain ancillary orders.What follows are my reasons.The Facts[1][4]The area of Weston Road and Eglinton Avenue (where this offence occurred) was known to all police officers who testified from both Gangs and Guns and 12 Division of the Toronto Police Service.They all described it as a high crime area where drugs are bought and sold, gangs loiter and guns are possessed and used.Close to this intersection, and where the arrest occurred, is a residential area with war time type bungalows occupied by middle class citizens.A public junior school is also in the vicinity.[5]On March 23, 2010, Detective Constables Loucks and McFarlane were conducting surveillance in the area of Weston Road and Eglinton Avenue.They had received information about the shooting of an unknown male party and police believed that the shooter was still in the area.Police feared that there may be some form of gang retaliation for the shooting.[6]It was in this location that both officers first observed Mr. Chambers.Mr. Chambers was observed leaning up against an alcove to the entrance of “Nancy’s Bar and Grill”.Mr. Chamber’s right hand appeared to be holding something in his jacket pocket and the officers became concerned that he was armed with a gun.Mr. Chambers appeared to acknowledge other persons in the neighbourhood.[7]Various members of a gang known to the police as the Five Point Generals were also in the area.They, too, appeared to acknowledge the presence of Mr. Chambers.One of them also appeared to be holding a firearm that was concealed.P.C. Loucks concluded from the conduct of all parties that he was about to observe “something” happen “real fast” and “right then”.[8]Eventually Mr. Chambers walked northbound on Bala Avenue.At around the same time,a marked police cruiser appeared and approached in the direction of Mr. Chambers.D.C. McLane observed a uniformed police officer get out of the cruiser at which point Mr. Chambers ran in an easterly direction into a backyard.The uniformed officers from the cruiser (P.C. Mahli and P.C. Morris) followed him.[9]Mr. Chambers ran into a driveway of 37 Bala Avenue and within seconds, he reached a small fence that rose six to eight inches from the ground.Mr. Chambers tripped on the fence and it was at this point that Mr. Chambers turned to the left and P.C. Mahli observed the handgun.At this point, P.C. Mahli testified that his “heart dropped” and testified “I was not sure if he was going to shoot at me”.[10]P.C. Mahli took out his own gun and was yelling at Mr. Chambers to “get down” and to stop.He was yelling out “he’s got a gun” at which point Mr. Chambers dropped the gun.Mr. Chambers regained his balance and continued running to the back of the yard.P.C. Mahli chased him and put his gun back in his holster.[11]Mr. Chambers tried to jump a mesh fence at the back of the yard that was four or five feet in height.As he was attempting this, P.C. Mahli grabbed Mr. Chambers from behind; took Mr. Chambers down to the ground; and ended up on top of Mr. Chambers who had his back on the ground.[12]A struggle ensued between Mr. Chambers and P.C. Mahli.P.C. Mahli admitted to punching, elbowing, kneeing and possibly kicking Mr. Chambers during this struggle.The purpose of using such force was to prevent him from fleeing and to prevent him from accessing the gun.[13]P.C. Morris immediately attended to the site and he, with P.C. Mahli, were able to roll Mr. Chambers over face down and handcuff him to the rear.Mr. Chambers was arrested, the firearm was retrieved and he was taken to the hospital.[14]The registered nurse who assisted Mr. Chambers at the hospital noted several injuries to the face of Mr. Chambers (that are described in more detail in my reasons for judgment).He received stitches and Percocet at the hospital.Following his release, he was taken to 12 Divison for processing.When incarcerated at the Metro West Detention Centre, he was observed and treated for two days in the Health Care Unit.What is the fit sentence?[15]In coming to my conclusion regarding the appropriate sentence of 8 years, I am reminded of the guidance provided by of our Court of Appeal in R. v. Danvers[2] The Courts have increasingly denounced gun violence and the illegal possession of firearms in Toronto, as has the general public.[16]In R. v. Danvers, supra, the Ontario Court of Appeal made it clear that a strong message must be sent to those in our society who would use and possess illegal firearms.Armstrong J.A. stated: “our courts have to address the principles of denunciation and deterrence for gun related crimes in the strongest possible terms”.[Emphasis added][17]In the six years since Danvers was decided, “the concern [over gun violence] is still unfortunately very much alive and un-satiated.”If anything, an even stronger message needs to be sent that the possession of illegal firearms will simply not be tolerated:In my view, the paramount sentencing objectives in this case are denunciation and deterrence. The citizens of this city must be protected from individuals who choose to illegally possess weapons and even more importantly, who choose to use those weapons especially in such a premeditated and merciless manner. Individuals who choose to engage in such behaviour must be given the strongest possible message that such conduct simply will not be tolerated and, if it is committed, it will attract the severest of consequences. Severe consequences are also necessary to serve as a clear deterrent to others who might be inclined to engage in such conduct given the manifest danger that it poses for the lives and safety of other people.[3]The Aggravating Factors[18]In light of these principles, I will deal first with the aggravating factors which I consider to be the following:a.The circumstances in which Mr. Chambers was in possession of a firearm are extremely grave.The weapon is obviously a deadly one.However, the situation is worsened due to the fact that it was loaded and ready for firing.b.The firearm was carried in a neighbourhood known for violence.That being said, it appears that Mr. Chambers was carrying such a firearm in a place where businesses operate.For instance, Mr. Chambers was described as being in the area with two bars, one coffee shop and a KFC.Presumably the businesses were operating at 5:30 p.m. on the date in question and were locations where members of the public are to be welcomed and encouraged to visit.Anybody in that area of town at that time was at risk due to the conduct of Mr. Chambers.c.The firearm was also carried in a neighbourhood occupied by both apartment dwellers and home owners.There was a school located in the area where Mr. Chambers was arrested.Although it is not likely that the school was in full operation at the time of the arrest, it may be that children were attending for after school programs.Mr. Chambers put those children and others at the school at risk by carrying the firearm as he did.d.Most importantly, Mr. Chambers put the owners and occupiers of 37 Bala Avenue at risk by his conduct.Not only did he race down the driveway of the home upon noting the presence of police, he ran into the backyard.It was 5:30 p.m. and anyone could have been in the driveway or the backyard as he did this.Had the gun discharged at any time during this chase or when it was dropped, the consequences for anybody in the area, and particularly for those residents of 37 Bala Avenue, could have been deadly.e.Mr. Chambers put the public at serious risk when he chose to flee from the police officers and dropped the loaded firearm in the backyard of somebody’s home.f.Mr. Chambers has a prior and related record as follows:DateOffencePenaltyDecember 8, 2004Possessionof a loaded, prohibited or restricted firearmSuspendedsentence and probation for

time of the offences.i.Mr. Chambers was on judicial interim release at the time of the offences.The Mitigating Factors[19]I consider the following to be the mitigating factors affecting sentence:a.Although Mr. Chambers did not plead guilty; he did raise a legal argument submitting that his Charter rights were infringed.I do not find that Mr. Chambers brought the application frivolously and that such an application had merit.b.Mr. Chambers re-elected to be tried by a judge alone which reduced the amount of court time required to hear this matter.c.Mr. Chambers did concede guilt to all offences should the Charter application be dismissed and required no further evidence to be called.d.Although Mr. Chambers was in control and it was his decision to flee the officers, he did suffer some injuries upon his arrest as referred to above.e.Mr. Chambers has shown remorse as is set out more fully below.f.Mr. Chambers is 25 years of age and has support in the community as set out more fully below.g.To date, Mr. Chambers has not been incarcerated in the penitentiary.Rehabilitation[20]In considering Mr. Chambers’ rehabilitation, I have considered the evidence called and produced at his sentencing hearing.It is my view that there is “hope” for the rehabilitation of Mr. Chambers.(i)The Father[21]Mr. Chambers’ father (the “father”) testified that his son was raised in a difficult area of town and that they made efforts to isolate their children from the environment so that they would go on to be productive in society.He said that Mr. Chambers was a good student up until approximately Grade 10 when he did poorly and became disinterested in education.He did not secure full time employment thereafter and he did not return to school despite his father’s urging.He testified that his son has been shot twice but that he does not know the perpetrator.[22]The father appears to have been steadily employed throughout his life and currently works for the TTC.He seemed to blame himself for not being in his son’s life enough to keep himself on the right track due to his separation from his wife.This, of course, is unfortunate.[23]Despite the problems that Mr. Chambers has had with the law, his father is hopeful that he can get his education and become a productive member of society.He is willing to support him and provide him with a residence upon his release, if necessary.I accept the evidence of the father as sincere despite his failed efforts to date.(ii)Ms. Julieann Moore[24]Mr. Chamber’s girlfriend, Ms. Julieann Moore, also testified that she has hope for Mr. Chambers.She met Mr. Chambers in 2005 and together they have a daughter who is five years old.Ms. Moore had been steadily employed by Bell Mobility for three years until they relocated her position.She is hopeful that she will obtain another position with Bell Mobility shortly.[25]Despite the legal troubles of Mr. Chambers, Ms. Moore is willing to stand by him.“Mind boggling” was an apt description provided by Counsel to Mr. Chambers regarding her loyalty as Ms. Moore appears to be hard working, intelligent and responsible.It is obvious that Mr. Chambers has been a disappointing boyfriend and father due to his criminality but she is willing to support him upon his release from custody.Again, I accept that Ms. Moore can be a positive influence on Mr. Chambers when he is released.(iii)Mr. Chambers[26]There is no doubt that Mr. Chambers has potential to be a contributing member of society.This became evident through the production of a letter written by him.It is cogent, legible and thoughtful.[27]The letter shows that Mr. Chambers has insight into his problems.He is remorseful and asks for forgiveness.He describes his past as “shameful” and he describes himself as “embarrassed”.Mr. Chambers is now attending church programs and has turned to God for guidance.[28]Most importantly, Mr. Chambers takes full responsibility for his actions.He says that he does not want to “throw” his life away and he has learned:“there is no winning when your envolved [sic] in a criminal life”.He says that he wants to “be there” for his daughter.He intends to advance his education while in custody and start searching for a job upon his release.He wants to have a career and to provide for his family.[29]Based on the above, I believe that there is hope that Mr. Chambers can be rehabilitated.I make this finding based mainly on the insight into his crimes as set out in his letter to the Court.Conclusion Re:The Fit Sentence[30]There is no doubt that handguns in the city of Toronto are a scourge on our society.In sentencing Mr. Chambers, I am cognizant of the principles that I must consider.Most importantly:deterrence, denunciation and the protection of society.[31]In my view, the request for 13.5 years in custody for possession of one gun is simply too much taking into consideration the “jump” principle.Mr. Chambers has been incarcerated on two occasions for gun offences for a period of time served of 7 months on each occasion.To go from 7 months to 13.5 years in custody would be crushing to Mr. Chambers.Such a position also fails to take into account the principle that “a first penitentiary sentence should be as short as possible”[4][32]I am also of the view that a sentence of 7 years is simply too low in the circumstances.Accordingly, I have calculated the sentence of 8 years on the following basis:a.Count 1:Six Years in Custody[33]The minimum mandatory sentence of 5 years for the possession of a firearm with ammunition fails to take into account the circumstances in which it was possessed:a.Mr. Chambers was carrying a loaded weapon, concealed at 5:30 p.m. in a highly populated area of Toronto;b.Mr. Chambers decided to flee police running through the yard of a residential home and dropping the gun as he tripped over a fence; andc.Mr. Chambers struggled as the police tried to arrest him.[34]In my view, the three factors referred to above are significant aggravating factors that warrant the elevation of Mr. Chambers sentence to 6 years.One year in addition to the minimum mandatory sentence addresses these aggravating factors of the possession of the firearm.b.Counts 6 and 7:2 Years in Custody[35]I accept the submission of Crown Counsel that possessing a firearm while prohibited from doing so should attract a sentence that is consecutive to other sentences.Mr. Chambers has been the subject of two court orders not to possess firearms and he has not complied with them.[36]Subsequent to Justice Nordheimer’s decision in J.G.[5], a number of Courts have had the opportunity to revisit the issue of whether or not a sentence for a breach of a prohibition order should be consecutive or concurrent to the sentence for the underlying firearms conviction.A general consensus has emerged that the sentences should be consecutive[6].[37]The sentences for breach of the prohibition order must be consecutive in order to reflect Mr. Chambers’ commission of a separate and distinct offence – breaching a court order that specifically prohibited him from possessing firearms.I do not accept that the sentences for possessing the firearm in breach of two prohibition orders should be concurrent.They were two separate orders given on two separate occasions and give rise to two separate offences.Accordingly, I am sentencing Mr. Chambers to one year for each of those offences to be served consecutively.c.Counts:2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 are Concurrent[38]The sentences for the other offences will be concurrent.I bear in mind that at least five of the offences arise out of the possession of one handgun.The other three offences arise from breach of court orders.In my view, the totality principle is a significant consideration in my decision to impose concurrent sentences for the remaining five counts.[39]In summary, Mr. Chamber’s criminal record should reflect the following convictions and penalties:CountSectionConvictionDisposition195(1)Possessionof a restricted firearm with ammunition.6 yearsin custody292(1)Possessionof a firearm knowing its possession is unauthorized.1 yearconcurrent to count 1391(1)Unauthorizedpossession of a firearm.1 yearconcurrent to count 1496(1)Possessionof a weapon obtained by the commission of an offence.1 yearconcurrent to

concurrent to counts 6 and 7Should Mr. Chambers receive enhanced credit for time served?[40]Mr. Chambers describes his life in the Don Jail since his incarceration there on March 23, 2010:a.It has been a rough experience since they are living three to a cell.b.The conditions are described as “dirty”.c.Clean clothes come ever few weeks.d.He is able to have fresh air in the yard every few months.e.He was assaulted by three people when he attempted to use the phone to contact his family.He was choked and he woke up in the shower with blood in his mouth.f.He does not describe the conditions to his family because he does not want them to be worried.g.He has been unable to participate in any programs save the religious ones.[41]There was no evidence called at the sentencing hearing to dispute those issues about incarceration in the Don Jail as described by Mr. Chambers.[42]As I have stated above, I do not conclude that Mr. Chambers’ application to stay the proceedings was without merit.He advanced a defence as he was entitled to do and he remained in custody at the Don Jail while doing so.I did not see anything in the record to suggest that Mr. Chambers did anything to delay these proceedings.[43]In my view, the circumstances described above justify the maximum credit of one and one-half days for each day spent in custody.There is no indication stated on the record that Mr. Chambers was detained pursuant to s. 515(9.1), 524(4) or (8).Accordingly, Mr. Chambers will be given credit of 1,026 days (684 actual days in custody plus 342 days of enhanced credit).What ancillary orders should be made?[44]The following ancillary orders will be made:a.Mr. Chambers will be ordered to provide such samples of his bodily substances as may be required for forensic analysis pursuant to s. 487.051(b) of the Criminal Code;b.Mr. Chambers will be subject to a weapons prohibition for life pursuant to s. 109 of the Criminal Code.c.The gun and any ammunition is forfeited to the Crown pursuant to s. 164.02 of the Criminal Code.Conclusion[45]It is my view that the sentence of 8 years in custody for Mr. Chambers properly reflects society’s abhorrence of guns in our city.It also serves as denunciation and deterrence for those contemplating such possession.It takes into account Mr. Chambers’ youth, the support he has in the community and the fact that this is his first trip to the penitentiary.Lastly, and most importantly, the totality of a sentence of 8 years for these offences is appropriate.[46]In conclusion, Mr. Chambers is sentenced to 8 years less 2 years and 10 months leaving a total of 5 years, 2 months to be served.Kelly J.Released:February 2, 2012CITATION: R. v.

One long gun was found, unlocked and unloaded, in the kitchen.[6]Mr. Rutledge was the sole occupant of the house at the time of the search.[7]Tyler Rutledge pled guilty to possession for the purpose of trafficking in cocaine, and Mr. Rutledge pled guilty to possession of marijuana under three kilograms for the purpose of trafficking.He was given what was admitted by counsel to be an extremely lenient sentence, of a fine of $500 plus probation, on a joint submission by Crown and defence.[8]Billy fled the jurisdiction and has not been located.Tyler, on probation after serving his sentence, has been subsequently charged with breach of probation, and his whereabouts are now also unknown to the police.[9]In this trial concerning the weapons located in the house, Mr. Rutledge found himself charged with a total of 7 counts: possession of each of the three handguns, possession of the handguns together with readily accessible ammunition, careless storage of the long guns, and careless storage of ammunition.An additional count, of possession of one of the handguns, a Glock 17 9mm, with its serial number defaced, was dismissed following the jury trial.Verdicts of guilty were given on the additional six counts on June 30th, 2015.[10]The three counts for possession of three individual handguns, Counts 2, 3 and 4, are subsumed within the first count, of possession of the handguns together with readily accessible ammunition.Accordingly, pursuant to the principles in R v Kienapple, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729, 15 C.C.C. (2d) 524, these charges will be stayed.It remains to sentence Mr. Rutledge on Counts 1, 6 and 7.(a)Circumstances of the Offence[11]For the purposes of sentencing, it is clear from the acquittal on Count 5 relating to the defaced serial number on a Glock 17 handgun in the safe in the Indictment that the jury was not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Rutledge had seen the hand guns.The Crown put forward a strong case that he was at a minimum willfully blind to the existence of the handguns in the safe.It is clear that he knew that Billy had brought the safe into the house, and gave him permission to put it upstairs.It is clear from the verdict that he also must have seen the bullets for the handguns in what was technically his bedroom, although he said he seldom used it and normally slept on a couch in the living room on the main floor.[12]There was a solid basis for finding willful blindness with respect to the guns in the safe. Mr. Rutledge acknowledged in his evidence that he knew there was some problem with the safe, and had intended to ask Billy about it but never got around to it because Billy was always in the presence of other people. He acknowledged that he thought there was possibly stolen property or drugs in the safe, and that he had previously seen Billy with a realistic-looking handgun that turned out to be a starter pistol. For the purposes of sentencing, it is appropriate to sentence him on the basis that he did not see or handle the guns, but knew or strongly suspected that Billy had guns in the safe, but preferred not to have actual knowledge.There is insufficient evidence in my view to say beyond a doubt that he had direct knowledge of the guns, so the sentencing will proceed on the basis that he was wilfully blind to the reality that there were guns in the safe.[13]With respect to the careless storages charges, I accept that Mr. Rutledge, living on an isolated farm property and frequently using his long guns for rifle practice or shooting coyotes and other predators, or for cleaning them prior to sale and exchange of them at gun shows, had simply become excessively careless about the proper way to store them.Nonetheless, it is clear that he had allowed his home to be used by a number of young people, friends of Billy and Tyler, who sometimes stayed over and would have had easy access to the potentially improperly stored long guns and ammunition, for example if they had come home that night.(b) Circumstances of the Offender[14]Mr. Rutledge has already been sentenced for possession for the purpose of trafficking in marijuana.He clearly had lost control over the use of his home by his son and step-son for other illegal purposes:he thought Billy was storing illegal ATVs, snowmobiles and cars on the property, and I find he must have known of the cocaine use in his house, from the second scale with cocaine powder on it in the kitchen, the cocaine bowls and spoons sitting out in Tyler’s bedroom, from his suspicions of Billy, and from the activities in the house.[15]Anyone who had seen and heard Mr. Rutledge during the trial would conclude that he is a very hard-working, straight-forward, and apparently gentle person, who perhaps has had limited financial advantages in life, but the advantage of living in a beautiful area of the country, and working on the land and with animals.[16]After the verdicts were given, the defence indicated that it would file personalized material on sentencing in preference to having a pre-sentence report prepared by the usual authorities.The material ultimately filed by the defence is sparse.It consists of a letter from Mr. Rutledge’s father’s doctor certifying that “due to Clarence’s current health issues and age, he is unable to increase his farming workload for the foreseeable future.”[17]As well, the defence orally submitted, through counsel, a brief summary of Mr. Rutledge’s personal circumstances.He is 56 years of age and in good health.He has lived on the family farm for most of his life.The family farm has been owned in the Rutledge family for over 100 years.Mr. Rutledge stopped his education in Grade 10, to work full time on the farm, tending to racehorses and cattle.At age 19 he obtained outside employment, having a range of jobs including construction and installation of HVAC systems.He continued to work on the farm to help out.[18]He has two children, an adult son who resides up north, and Tyler, who was born in February of 1993.Mr. Rutledge divorced Tyler’s mother when Tyler was 2. For the first few years, Mr. Rutledge had weekend access to Tyler, but often took care of him for longer periods because his mother had alcohol problems.He obtained custody of Tyler when Tyler was in kindergarten, and in 1997 he moved back to the farm and began to build the house where the offences occurred.At times his stepson Billy also lived with them. Tyler had moved out from under his care for a period of time because he got in trouble when he was in high school, and he could not live with his father because his father could not be a surety. Billy also was arrested in Orangeville and Mr. Rutledge sought to be a surety but was rejected because he was not, strictly speaking, a relative.[19]Mr. Rutledge continued to farm and was involved in the collection and sale of shotguns. By 2012, while the basic structure was finished, the plumbing, interior finishes, and some of the exterior finishes were still a work in progress[20]Mr. Rutledge was an easy-going parent:when Tyler returned in 2010 he let him and his girlfriend Cassie live in the upstairs two bedrooms, and later when Tyler and Billy returned in the late summer of 2012, he let them more or less have the run of the house.By December 2012, Tyler and Billy, frequently at the time preceding the search, were in and out of the house.[21]Mr. Rutledge has a criminal record for various alcohol and driving related offences, including three convictions for over 80 or impaired driving in 1991, 1995, and 2010.He also has convictions for driving while disqualified or suspended in 1998 and 2012.He has served three short periods of jail time in the past.[22]His sentence on the related offence of possession for the purpose of trafficking under three kilograms of marijuana resulted in a fine of $500 and one year probation as well as a Section 109 prohibition for ten years. That was termed a “modest” sentence and was based on joint submissions for pleas of guilty made by Mr. Rutledge and his son Tyler at the same hearing.(c)Pre-trial Release Conditions[23]Mr. Rutledge was arrested on December 21, 2012 and was initially released on December 24th, 2013 on a recognizance requiring that he reside in Shelburne with his sister.He was at first prohibited from attending at the farm and from possessing any weapons or ammunition.He was required to surrender any additional firearms that had not been seized.Restrictions were relatively lenient, but required the presence of a surety for non-specified absences from the home:he was required to remain at his residence except for employment purposes, medical emergencies, court-related matters, counsel matters, or in the presence of one of his sureties, who were his sister and father.He was also required to seek assessment for alcohol abuse.In May of 2013 the residency requirement was amended to permit him to reside at his father’s house on the adjacent farm, although he was prohibited from residing at or attending the house where the warrant was executed.Accordingly, he would be permitted to continue to farm the joint family properties. These terms have continued for almost two and a half years, to the present time.[24]It is clear that where credit is requested on the basis of stringent bail conditions it is incumbent on the offender to provide information as to the impact of the pretrial conditions.Obviously in this case the restriction on weapons and firearms has restricted Mr. Rutledge’s side business of trading and selling rifles at gun shows.It has not strictly speaking prevented him from continuing in his farming business, because the house in which he resides with his father is on the adjacent and contiguous farm property and he has been permitted to continue to farm their roughly 2000 acres, with a total of about 500 head ofcattle, sheep and horses.However, as he indicated at trial, he has been unable to protect his sheep from the predations of coyotes.(c) Impact on the Victim and/or Community[25]The potential for serious harm through the use of restricted and prohibited handguns illegally held is obvious.There is a well-known connection between drug trafficking and the use of handguns.In possessing these weapons, even assuming that Billy and/or Tyler were the probable users of them, Mr. Rutledge allowed himself and his home to be part of a dangerous and socially undesirable milieu.Ammunition for these handguns was stored in the same room, and Mr. Rutledge clearly had lost control over the activities of Tyler and Billie, even though he admitted that he was well aware that he should have been questioning them or getting Billy to move out.[26]With respect to the careless storage charges, there is no inherent connection to the dangers of drug dealing but the potential for harm remains, beyond the dangers of carelessness, in that drugs were being stored and dealt with in that house, and there were many people coming and going.Legal Parameters and Counsel’s Positions on Sentencing:[27]The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R v Nur, 2015 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2015] SCJ No. 15, clarified that the mandatory minimum sentence of three years in Section 95 offences is unconstitutional. There is no dispute thata conditional sentence is statutorily available on these offences and could be imposedas an alternative to or in addition to a custodial sentence.[28]The defence argued that the primary blame for the handgun offences should clearly be on the step-son Billy, and that since the unsafe storage charges were closer to regulatory offences, a conditional sentence was appropriate in these unique circumstances, including Mr. Rutledge’s minimal role, the fact the guns were in an unpopulated area, and the length of time on house arrest.[29]The Crown submitted that the appropriate range in all of the circumstances of this case would be between 21 months and two years, plus two years probation on Count 1, and an additional three months on the Careless Storage charges for a total of between 24 and 27 months.It was acknowledged that the terms of house arrest in the particular circumstances of this case should result in some credit, because of the restrictions in those terms, and it was suggested that a credit of five months, and in any event no longer than eight months should be given.That would bring the range to a reformatory term of 16 to 19 months.The Crown also recommended that a term of probation might be appropriate.[30]The defence submitted that these were extraordinary circumstances, that the primary responsibility for the more serious offence of possession of the handguns lay at the feet of his stepson Billy, and that a conditional sentence was justified in all of the circumstances of this case. The Crown argued that any sentence should be served in custody.[31]Despite his counsel’s suggestion that in effect Mr. Rutledge should be sentenced as a parent who has momentarily lost control of a young adult in his home, and unexpectedly discovered an illegal gun or other illegal activity, the facts simply do not permit that lenient view. Over a period of time, while he himself was trafficking in marijuana out of the house, he permitted drug use in the house, with young people coming and going. He permitted his house to be a safe haven for the activities that he knew or suspected were going, as he admitted to a large extent in his own evidence, and as the jury found. He thought Billy was bringing stolen vehicles on to the property, he admitted to allowing Billy to bring in the safe and place it in his own bedroom, and he himself burned the box.[32]Mr. Rutledge was not primarily responsible for the handguns, by any means, but his role as a facilitator cannot be ignored, on the evidence.Case Law:[33]Both Crown and defence supplied casebooks providing useful support for the basic principles they relied on: the continuing need for significant sentences in cases involving possession of prohibited firearms, notwithstanding the unconstitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentences, consideration of sentencing in the context of related drug offenses, consideration of conditional sentences in the context of weapons offenses, including where the offender was not the owner or prospective user of the gun, and the impact of stringent terms of pretrial house arrest on the length of sentence.Seriousness of the Offence, Particularly in the Drug Context[34]In R v Nur 2013 ONCA 677 (CanLII), 2013, ONCA 677 (C.A.) affirming R v Nur, 2015 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2015] SCJ No. 15 the case striking down the mandatory minimum sentences for offences under Section 95 of the Criminal Code, the court nonetheless upheld the penitentiary sentence imposed at trial, given the seriousness of the offences, noting that most cases within the range of conduct covered by Section 95 may well merit a sentence of three years or more. However, the Court acknowledged that a three-year term for a person who has essentially committed a licensing infraction would be out of sync with the principles set out in the Criminal Code and would amount to a “cavernous disconnect” between the sentence and the offense. The crown stressed that in this case, as an enabler of the storage of guns, Mr. Rutledge participated in conduct that was a significant risk to society: this offence was not akin to a licensing infraction.[35]In R v Delchev, 2014 ONCA 448 (CanLII) and cases referred to in it, the court addresses the “toxic combination” of cases involving guns and drugs. A sentence of 3 ½ years on 16 counts of weapons and drug offenses was upheld by the Court of Appeal, noting that a higher sentence could have been imposed. In reviewing the cases (referred to at paras 22 – 28) it was noted that the Court of Appeal has consistently indicated that “the combination of drugs and guns is particularly concerning. This combination is a serious aggravating factor on sentencing”.[36]Although the defense has strenuously argued that Mr. Rutledge’s limited involvement with the hand guns cannot be associated with drugs, a realistic view of the evidence in the jury’s finding cannot ignore the reality of the drug use and trafficking in the house.[37]These principles were reiterated in the trial decision in R v Boussoulas, 2015 ONSC 1536 (CanLII), [2015] OJ No. 1104 (Sup. Ct) where a sentence of 21 months plus 2 years probation was given. The defense emphasized that the context in Boussoulas (and the cases referred to in para 22 to 23) of having a loaded gun in a highly populated area heightened the aspect of risk. I agree that in this case the immediate risk, at least inadvertent or collateral harm on the street, was lessened by the isolation of the property and the fact that there is no evidence of where Billy might have used the guns: but this is not a case of no risk or a mere regulatory offense.[38]In R v Mohammed, [2008] OJ No. 5492, the court assessed the situation of the co-accused Mr. Ngo, in a case where guns were found in a locked vehicle, unloaded, with no bullets in the vehicle and where the accused were in joint possession with two others for less than half an hour. Even for a young accused with no criminal record who was employed and supporting children, a sentence of two years in the penitentiary was imposed.[39]On behalf of the defense, it was stressed that most of the cases referred to involved the possession of illegal handguns in the Greater Toronto Area, where the risk was deemed to be greater because of a “plague” of guns and gun-related violence on the streets of Toronto. In R v Allen, [2006] O.J. No.4597 for example a sentence of 21 months was given on a plea of guilty on one count of possession of a restricted firearm with ammunition where the accused was found in possession of while driving on the busy Toronto street in daylight.[40]In any event Mr. Rutledge’s involvement was not in handling the guns, it was in making it easy for Billy to store the guns in a place he had ready access to it, clearly a lesser and more peripheral role.Conditional Sentence Caselaw:[41]The cases referred to by Counsel did not provide real support for the conditional sentence requested. All were patently distinguishable.[42]In R v Nuttley, 2013 ONCJ 727 (CanLII) a guilty plea to various offenses including possession of a prohibited firearm with readily accessible ammunition and careless storage of firearms resulted in a conditional sentence of 12 months plus probation for three years, but credit of 11 months was given for pretrial custody.[43]In R v Smickle, 2013 ONCA 678 (CanLII), [2013] OJ No. 5070, the offender was found, during a dynamic search, to be in possession of a fully loaded semi-automatic handgun. The court held that a conditional sentence, of one year reduced to five months to take into account pre-sentence incarceration and strict bail terms, was manifestly inadequate, even absent the mandatory minimum. The Court did note that the offender was “not off by himself in some isolated forest playing with a fully loaded cocked handgun. He was in someone else’s apartment located in a high-rise apartment building.” He was a young first offender said to be posing with the loaded gun for a photograph.The accidental discharge of the gun put the police and others at risk in the apartment. The Court suggested that a sentence approaching maximum reformatory was appropriate.[44]In R v S.C., [2006] O.J. No.3893, the Court of Appeal reviewed a conditional sentence imposed, after the accused had served six months of pretrial custody (credited at twelve months) and pled guilty to possession of a restricted weapon and related offences. The Court of Appeal held that the sentence should have been two years less a day, but did not reincarcerate the offender as he had been on restrictive bail pending appeal and had completed seven months of the conditional sentence.[45]In R v Carbone, [2012] OJ No.176 (OCJ), illegal weapons, two hand guns and ammunition, were bought and stored improperly, in offices, for defensive purposes. Even where the accused had exemplary backgrounds and guilty pleas were entered on summary conviction procedure, a custodial sentence of 60 days intermittent was deemed necessary, and the court rejected suggestions that a conditional or suspended sentence could be appropriate.[46]These cases suggest that even with a guilty plea, a lesser role, no prior record, or other mitigating factors not present here, a custodial sentence is still appropriate.Credit for Stringent Pretrial House Arrest Terms[47]The defence argues that credit for pre-sentence bail conditions should be given because of the length of time that Mr. Rutledge has spent under house arrest.House arrest has been identified as a form of punishment in a conditional sentence context.Courts have come to consider time spent under stringent bail conditions, particularly including house arrest, as a mitigating factor to be considered with other factors, although no specific formula is to be applied to the length of time or specific conditions imposed. “Particularly stringent bail conditions can have a mitigating effect on sentence”:R v Spencer (2004), 186 CCC 3d 181 (ONCA) at para. 43.[48]In this case, as the Crown acknowledges, lengthy pre-sentence bail conditions including house arrest, does require consideration in determining the length of sentence.[49]In R v Downes, 2006 CanLII 3957 (ON CA), [2006] OJ No. 555 (ONCA) the Court of Appeal noted that some of the same considerations justifying enhanced credit for presentence custody will also apply to an offender who has spent a long time under house arrest with stringent conditions: it was noted that house arrest as a term of conditional sentence is considered to be a form of punishment: see R v Proulx (2000), 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (SCC) at para 103.[50]The court recommended that credit for pretrial bail conditions be approach with flexibility: time on stringent presentence bail, especially house arrest, is a relevant mitigating factor. The time spent under house arrest must be considered in determining the length of sentence, and failure to do so would be an error in principle. However there is no formula to be applied and the amount of credit is within the discretion of the trial judge, depending on factors including the length of time, stringency of conditions, and impact on liberty. The offender has an onus to provide information as to the impact of the condition: para. 37.[51]In this case, as in Downes, there was a lengthy period of house arrest, with a stringent condition that he leave the house only with his surety, even for work. Mr. Rutledge clearly was able to continue his work on the farm for most of the pretrial term. He has not provided any specific information concerning any interference with work or other aspects of his life, except for the suggestion that his social life with his new girlfriend was restricted, since she is now living in the house he is prohibited from entering, and a surety would have to accompany them off the property. The court in Downes gave five months credit for 18 months spent under house arrest.[52]However, unlike the case in Downes, Mr. Rutledge’s bail conditions permitted the opportunity to work and pursue rehabilitative and treatment options without dependence on a surety, although his social life was undoubtedly curtailed.Findings of Fact[53]With respect to the careless storage charges in Count 6 and 7, the most significant issue is whether or not this was a single incident of careless storage, resulting in the gun cabinet and ammunition box being somewhat inadvertently left open because Mr. Rutledge fell asleep after cleaning his newly acquired antique gun. The alternative explanation is that Mr. Rutledge had the gun out to protect his drugs and that this was a habitual scenario.[54]Despite the presence of other guns in the house, for example the disassembled starter pistol and the realistic looking gun in Tyler’s bedroom, and the incident described by Mr. Rutledge where Billy and Tyler were examining a handgun that Mr. Rutledge looked at to satisfy himself it was only a starters pistol, I am prepared to accept that Mr. Rutledge himself normally stored the long guns properly. I do not necessarily accept his explanation of the instructions he says he was given when he was trained years ago: they were improbable at best. His descriptions of target shooting in the yard and shooting coyotes would suggest that there might have been other occasions of departure from the regulations.[55]However I am satisfied from his evidence and from the overall neatness of the gun cabinet and the ammunition for the long guns, that normally the long guns were stored properly in the safe and ammunition in the lock box, or with respect to his girlfriend’s guns, in locking cases. I accept his evidence that when others were around the gun cabinet and ammunition were normally kept locked.[56]This is a significant mitigating factor with respect to those charges.[57]The level of culpability with respect to the handgun charges is different. The jury clearly accepted that even if direct knowledge was not proved, Mr. Rutledge was aware of or strongly suspected – to the point he was wilfully blind to the fact – that Billy was storing handguns in the safe.[58]At least in the weeks preceding the search, all indicia pointed to the fact that Billy and perhaps Tyler were involved in guns and drugs and perhaps other illegal activities perhaps involving stolen vehicles as Mr. Rutledge clearly suspected. There were marijuana plants growing in the house, there was drug-use paraphernalia throughout the house, the second scale with white powder in the kitchen, and Billy and Tyler were handling a realistic looking gun.[59]Mr. Rutledge was an enabler, and his own participation through selling marijuana cannot be ignored.He was more than just a parent who had momentarily lost control, or a short-term co-possessor of a gun in transit, as in some of the cases.He was a facilitator whose permission to use the property for these activities, including in particular, his permission to allow the storage of the handguns, sanctified the risk, maintaining the pending danger against which the legislation is directed.Mitigating and Aggravating Factors[60]In summary, there are a number of mitigating factors in this case:-the lack of any related record;-the length of time that Mr. Rutledge has been on somewhat restrictive pretrial release;-the fact that the long guns were obtained for primary purposes of animal control, target shooting, and a business;-the fact that the long guns were locked up safely if others were in the house, or if he was away from the house;-the family’s need for Mr. Rutledge’s continuing involvement on the farm;-Mr. Rutledge’s limited role with respect to the handguns;-the overall favourable prospects for rehabilitation.[61]While there was no plea of guilt, this is simply the absence of a mitigating factor seen in some of the cases.I note that there were viable issues assessed at trial, including knowledge of the guns in the safe.[62]The most significant aggravating feature of this case relates to the handguns. The defense has argued that there is no connection between the drugs and the handguns, so the risk emphasized in many of the cases is not present here. I cannot agree. As noted above, while not directly involved in Billy and Tyler’s activities, Mr. Rutledge was a facilitator. In finding wilful blindness relating to the guns in the safe, the jury must have taken into account the other indicia in the house involving guns and drugs. As well, ammunition fitting all three guns, and shoulder holsters, were stored in his bedroom.This cannot be ignored in sentencing.Reasons:[63]Count 1(Handguns): In all of these circumstances, I accept that a reformatory term is adequate to meet the principles of denunciation and deterrence. A sentence of 18 months in the reformatory, including consideration of the brief period of custody on arrest, is the least appropriate sentence in these circumstances. I would reduce this by six months on account of the lengthy period of time served on house arrest with moderate but nonetheless somewhat restrictive terms. The resulting sentence is one of 12 months in the reformatory.[64]The defense vigorously argued that any sentence of two years or less can properly be served conditionally under continuing house arrest. The technical parameters of the provisions governing consideration of conditional sentences have been met.However, this is not a case where a sentence to be served conditionally can properly be imposed, given the risk to the public inherent in Mr. Rutledge’s actions in harbouring Billy and his guns.As well, special mitigating factors such as a plea of guilty, youth, non-involvement in other concurrent offences, and lack of any criminal record are not present here.[65]The defense raised a sympathetic argument relating to Mr. Rutledge’s family farm and the need for his presence to continue to assist his father with the work attendant on 500 head of sheep, cattle and horses. I have already considered this aspect in determining the length of sentence to be imposed.[66]The court is not unmindful of the burden that will fall on the family, including in particular his aging father. Such burdens, even as acutely particularized in this case, often fall on friends and family of an accused who is sent to jail. There is a loss of income, loss of personal support, and loss of family help. Family and friends suffer, and have to fill in the gap left by the absence of a convicted person. In this case Mr. Rutledge’s work will have to be picked up by hired help and/or community support for the duration of the sentence he spends in custody.[67]For reasons of deterrence, both specific and general, and denunciation, the sentence must be served in jail, in a provincial reformatory. Probation for two years will follow, with terms.[68]As an aside, I would note that had Counts 2, 3, and 4 relating to the individual handguns not been stayed, the sentence on each of those counts would have also been 12 months to be served in the reformatory, concurrent to the above sentence and concurrent to each other.[69]Counts 6 and 7 (Long guns): The Crown has asked for sentence of three months consecutive for the careless storage charges. Circumstances of the case, in which the use of the long guns was not proven to be associated with the other drug and weapon activities of the house, make it appropriate that there be a short sentence, of three months.[70]Accepting the fact that this was not a habitual circumstance, and on the basis that normally Mr. Rutledge – notwithstanding his marijuana trafficking business – kept these guns safely stored, these counts are appropriately viewed as close to regulatory in nature.[71]Normally I would make this a consecutive sentence, leaving aside the totality principle. However, in the context of the sentence imposed today on the handgun offences, and having regard to the totality principle, the sentence imposed for Counts 6 and 7 is one of three months concurrent on each charge, also concurrent to the sentence of 12 months on Count 1, for a total sentence in the reformatory of 12 months, to be followed by two years probation.[72]Terms of probation will include, in addition to the statutory terms:- report to a probation officer within three days of release from custody, and thereafter as directed;- not to be in contact directly or indirectly with Billy Cousins except in presence of Clarence or in court;- not be in possession of any weapons, firearms or ammunition;-abide by any recommendations for treatment or counselling made by his probation officer.Ancillary Orders:[73]S.109 Criminal Code: An order prohibiting the possession of firearms, weapons, and ammunition is clearly appropriate in the circumstances of each of these offences.Mr. Rutledge is already prohibited under section 109 as a result of the conviction on possession for the purpose of trafficking previously imposed.An order for prohibition for a ten year period, to run from the conclusion of incarceration in this case, is also made.[74]Forfeiture:This is an appropriate case for the forfeiture of all handguns, rifles, and long guns and ammunition seized, with the exception of the six long guns in locked cases found outside the gun cabinet.The Crown does not dispute that these were locked at the time they were seized and that they were owned by Mr. Rutledge’s friend Kim Deer. These are to be identified by Mr. Rutledge, from the police photographs if possible, and returned to the owner by the police.A list of remaining weapons and ammunition to be forfeited and held as appropriate pending further cases will be agreed to by Crown and defence and made Exhibit 6.[75]DNA: It is agreed that an order pursuant to section 487.051[3] of the Criminal Code, in Form 5.04, for the taking of samples of bodily substances for the purposes of forensic DNA analysis, is mandated.[76]Victim Surcharge:This requirement is not in this case disputed in its application or quantum. It is ordered that the minimum mandatory amount of $200 on each count, totalling $600, be paid by Mr. Rutledge within six months of his release from custody.Endorsement:[77]The record has been endorsed as follows: Count 1: 12 months in reformatory plus two years probation on terms.[78]Counts 2, 3, and 4: stayed on Kienapple principle, (sentence on each count would have been 12 months in reformatory concurrent and concurrent to Count 1 plus 2 years probation on terms).[79]Count 5:acquittal, based on jury finding of not guilty[80]Counts 6 and 7: three months on each count concurrent to each other, and concurrent to sentence in Count 1.[81]Total sentence:12 months in reformatory plus two years probation.[82]Section 109 order for 10 years, order for taking of bodily samples for DNA analysis, order for forfeiture of weapons and ammunition with exceptions, victim surcharge $600._________________Wein J.Released:October 27 2015CITATION: R. v.

(orally)[1]This is a sentence appeal by Carol Paige Windigo.She received a total sentence of five months and a $550.00 fine with seven days in default.The sentence was for ten offences committed primarily during April 2007, involving, by way of principal offences, four driving while disqualified charges contrary to s. 259(4) of the Criminal Code.Immediately following receipt of her sentence, she applied for and received judicial interim release, during which time she breached one of the undertakings by consuming alcohol and, then while at the police station, trying to escape custody.[2]Ms. Windigo appeals her sentence, asking that a conditional sentence order be imposed in its place.Normally, the sheer volume of offences and the number of driving offences might well cause this Court to dismiss her appeal without hesitation, but, in this case, there are several factors relating to her situation that prompt this Court to allow the appeal, set aside the sentence received and impose a sentence of imprisonment to be served within the community.[3]Ms. Windigo gave birth to her first child on November 11, 2007.In an updated pre-sentence report filed on the day the appeal was heard, Mr. Michael Laliberte, a probation officer with the Ministry of Corrections and Public Safety, advised the Court that the infant child suffers from an infliction that would make it very difficult for the child to be separated from Ms. Windigo for any length of time.As Crown counsel indicated, this is a factor that the Court can consider in this case.It appears that acceptable care for this child is not readily available on the Muskowekwan First Nation and, were Ms. Windigo to be incarcerated, the child would be placed in foster care. In addition, Ms. Windigo is again pregnant.[4]Again in the updated pre-sentence report, Mr. Laliberte advises the Court that the offences were as a result of Ms. Windigo attempting to \"fix\" her relationship with the child’s father by trying to live with him.She is now living at her mother's home, which, according to Mr. Laliberte, is far more stable and supportive.The Court has also considered that Ms. Windigo has her grade 12 and plans on furthering her education. According to her counsel, a grade 12 education is a significant accomplishment in Ms. Windigo’s immediate community.Mr. Laliberte also advises the Court that Ms. Windigo has demonstrated a will to better her situation.[5]In weighing these additional factors, the Court notes that none of the driving while disqualified charges occurred while Ms. Windigo was intoxicated.There was no \"bad driving,\" in this case.Rather, Ms. Windigo had not taken the required course that was a pre-condition to her driving again following a .08 charge, for which she had received a conditional discharge as a youth.This is, of course, offered by way of explanation and context rather than mitigation. Other than one shoplifting charge, committed as a youth, she has no record prior to the offences before the Court.[6]These offences appear to be the product of a spree, and Ms. Windigo was 19 years old at the time. While the infractions committed during her release pending appeal are problematic, the Court has been advised that Ms. Windigo consumed a small amount of alcohol and, when arrested for this, she attempted to escape, but did not even get out of the police station itself.Her sentence was time served of seven days and her bail was not revoked.[7]While the Court is not prepared to say that the sentences when imposed were demonstrably unfit, we are satisfied that it is appropriate, based on the new information considered in all of the circumstances, to set aside the sentences and impose a global sentence of six-months to be served in the community, including three months on the electronic monitor, with strict conditions including a curfew, and 50 hours community service.Ms. Windigo has consented to taking any parenting training and any alcohol or drug assessment counselling or treatment as may be directed by the Supervisor.The exact terms of the Order are to be settled between the parties, subject to Court approval."}

(Oral):Juanita Johnson was convicted at trial with respect to a charge under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, 1996 c. 19.There was a voir dire held during the trial in which Charter arguments were raised.I ruled that there was no violation of the Charter rights of Ms. Johnson.At that point in time defence invited me to convict on the evidence that was before the Court in the voir dire and tendered into trial.[2]Crown is suggesting that a sentence of ten to 12 months be imposed in this case.Defence counsel is not taking huge issue with the range but is seeking that the sentence be served conditionally in the community.Crown counsel has pointed to some of the concerns generally, and the concerns particularly, in this case, with respect to the sentence that I will impose being served conditionally in the community.[3]The facts of this case are that the RCMP obtained a cell phone belonging to an aunt of Ms. Johnson’s.A phone call was made by an unidentified third person to this cell phone, seeking drugs, and, without going into great detail, subsequently the RCMP officers were informed by this third party that Ms. Johnson may be able to provide drugs.Contact was made between the RCMP officer and Ms. Johnson through the use of the cell phone text messaging system.Arrangements were made in short order to meet at a gas station in Whitehorse, and, when the RCMP attended there, they noted Ms. Johnson, arrested her, searched her, and found approximately four grams of uncookable cocaine.The cocaine they found on her was sufficient for the one transaction that she had agreed to make.Ms. Johnson would have been under the impression that she was arranging to meet her aunt to provide her aunt with the cocaine.[4]Ms. Johnson has no prior criminal history.She is currently 26 years of age.She has not used drugs since she was 22.The Crown submits that this is for profit trafficking.Defence counsel takes some issue with that, indicating that she was providing her aunt with the drugs that her aunt needed.I note that this third party, who is unidentified, was able to have information that Ms. Johnson would likely be able to obtain or had cocaine for sale, and certainly she was able to get her hands on the cocaine pretty quickly to provide to who she believed to be Ms. Tsandaya.[5]It is certainly a different case from a case where we have clear evidence, as in R. v. Naiker, 2007 YKTC 58 (CanLII), that he was a street level trafficker.We are not dealing with cocaine noted to be packaged in ways that several transactions were set to be made, but clearly it was known to at least one other individual that Ms. Johnson was able to provide cocaine quickly, which she did.So we are not dealing with an addict trafficker.There is an element of profitability here.[6]There is no question that in dealing with drug trafficking that the principles of denunciation and deterrence are paramount.There has been a considerable line of authorities in the Yukon that have dealt with the consideration of the principles of sentencing with respect to drug traffickers in our community.I refer to the comments of Faulkner J. in the case of R. v. Holway, 2003 YKTC 75 (CanLII), where he refers to R. v. Curtis, [1982] Y.J. No. 4, that spoke many years ago about this principle, saying that Curtis:...simply points out that northern communities are already struggling with disproportionately high rates of addiction, while scant resources are available to deal with the problem.The last thing we need is more drug traffickers.Courts in the North have quite properly held that they are entitled to take these local conditions into account and have consistently held that deterrent sentences are warranted and that, given our circumstances, the need to maintain a deterrent trumps other sentencing considerations in cases involving trafficking in hard drugs.[7]The harmful effects of cocaine on individuals in the north are well noted, and not just on the user, but on the user’s family and the user’s children.Our courts are often seeing, in one way or another, young children significantly impacted, many times simply by parents incapable of properly raising them, many times as a result of the impact of drugs on those parents.There are many innocent victims of the drug trade in the Yukon.[8]I do not propose to review the cases filed.They are informative and generally provide that ranges of sentences, depending on the particular circumstances of the offence and offender, go from six months to 12 months.Crown, quite fairly, pointed out that Naiker, at 14 months, would be at the higher end.[9]The concerns that the Crown points to with respect to a conditional sentence in this case are the safety of the community, the risk of reoffending, and the gravity of the harm of reoffending.Cases where we are dealing with hard drugs, certainly conditional sentences, while not to be rare, are imposed with careful consideration, as they should be in all cases, but in light of the fact that deterrence and denunciation are very important to send a message to people that we do not want drugs trafficked in our communities.[10]In this case, the pre-sentence report that was prepared was not done by a local bail supervisor or probation officer, but was done recently in Alberta, where Ms. Johnson had been living since October.It is not as comprehensive as our pre-sentence reports tend to be.It does not include risk assessments.I view it as generally positive with respect to family support, and Ms. Johnson not being in a high risk area of reoffending, while recognizing there is no actual risk assessment.I am careful in the weight that I put on the risk of reoffending that I view from the report.[11]Ms. Johnson is a member of the Kwanlin Dun First Nation.There is little doubt that the members of her extended family have struggled with fallout of, perhaps, to some extent, the residential school system.There is not much in the way of information in this regard.It is to be noted that Ms. Johnson’s mother, who does not, as I understand it, live in Whitehorse, appears to be one of the few in the large family circle that did not abuse drugs or alcohol.Ms. Johnson herself did spend the years from 18 to 21 struggling with addiction and abuse of substances.[12]Ms. Johnson currently has an 11-month-old daughter.She is expecting another child in August.Her partner is employed with his father’s Chilkoot steel company in Whitehorse, which I understand, has been here for a while.The job in Alberta did not work out as planned, which is why they have just moved back here.They are currently living in a basement suite rented from a friend in Whitehorse, with an intention, in approximately three months, to move to a single family dwelling in Whitehorse and pay rent.[13]One of the concerns with respect to a risk of reoffending is whether an individual has the means to earn enough money to make a living.In this case, I have no reason to believe the relationship is not stable, and no reason to doubt that Mr. Jensen has a job.I do not see that Ms. Johnson has a need or poses a significant risk of continuing to traffic in drugs in order to get by financially.There is another source of income.[14]When finding a fit and just sentence, all circumstances need to be taken into account and it is not at all unusual for first offenders to find themselves in real jail, doing real time, separated from society, from their family, from the life they knew, because the crime warrants it, and drug trafficking is one of those crimes where that is not at all unusual.There is a principle of restraint that runs in s. 718.2, as well as in s. 718, that speaks to the necessity or the separation of offenders from society where it is necessary to do so.It also speaks to the principle that all other sanctions other than imprisonment should be used, if the circumstances warrant it.Particular attention needs to be paid to the incarceration of offenders, with particular concern to the status of First Nation offenders.Sometimes we are dealing with comprehensive reports that can draw a distinct link between an individual’s First Nation status and their offending.Other times, the link is less tenuous, or there is not a link, and in this case, there is not a lot of information, so we do not have a clear, strong link that would lead to Ms. Johnson’s First Nation status being a significantly contributing factor to the offence that she has been convicted of committing on this date.[15]Section 742.1 stipulates that a conditional sentence can be imposed if the Court is satisfied that the service of the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community, and that it is consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing.Ms. Johnson has been on an undertaking given to a peace officer from April 7, 2009, until February 16, 2010.It was fairly minimal, requiring her to attend at the RCMP, not possess cell phones or other communication devices or be in motor vehicles where they are present, and not to possess or consume non-prescription drugs.This was changed to an undertaking to a judge or justice on February 16, 2010, to simply require her, in addition, to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and to report to the Court and to change the reporting from the RCMP to a bail supervisor.There has been no indication that there has been any concerns that she has been complying with these conditions.[16]I believe, from what she said to the Court, that Ms. Johnson is scared of being separated from her child, scared for herself and scared for her child.It is not a determinative factor by any means, because offenders that go to jail will be separated from their children, but it can be a factor in a person realizing the extent to which the consequences of their actions may harm other people.I believe Ms. Johnson is aware of that, that every day and at every opportunity a person needs to make the right choice, and regardless of what it might be like here in court looking at the possibility of leaving this courtroom and going directly into a jail cell, and what it will be like in a different environment, Ms. Johnson will need to continue to make the right choices.[17]While I do not have an abundance of information before me, I am satisfied that the service of this sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental principles and purposes of sentencing.If Ms. Johnson chooses to reoffend, and I do not see that there is a risk of that happening, but if she does, there will be significant consequences, and that can happen quickly.I believe that the principles of sentencing, besides deterrence and denunciation, such as rehabilitation in this case, which I believe is perhaps to be viewed in the context of reorientation, in that Ms. Johnson’s life appears not to have been oriented towards criminal activity before and does not appear to have been oriented to criminal activity since, will continue without her being involved in any criminal activity.[18]The sentence that I am going to impose is going to be a sentence of ten months to be served conditionally in the community on the following terms:1.Keep the peace and be of good behaviour;2.Appear before the Court when required to do so by the Court;3.Report to a Supervisor immediately and thereafter when required by the Supervisor and in the manner directed by the Supervisor;4.Remain within the Yukon Territory unless you have written permission from your Supervisor or the Court;5.Notify the Supervisor or the Court in advance of any change of name or address, and promptly notify the Court or the Supervisor of any change of employment or occupation;6.Reside as approved by your Supervisor and not change that residence without the prior written permission of your Supervisor;7.At all times you are to remain within your place of residence except with the prior written permission of your Supervisor.You must present yourself at the door or answer the telephone during reasonable hours to ensure that you are complying with this condition.Failure to do so will be a presumptive breach of this condition;[19]Certainly, as your counsel pointed out, conditional sentences can be difficult.You do not have a choice when you are in jail as to where you are going to be.People on conditional sentences have a choice in the sense they can try not to comply with the term that requires them to stay in their residence.They can walk out, but the consequences are significant.So this is difficult, but there are permission exceptions.I am not going to limit them to anything specific, and they are not generally granted lightly.There needs to be a legitimate reason, but also, in this jurisdiction, it has been my experience that supervisors are sensitive to the needs of individuals, whether it is counselling, employment, or education, to allow them the permissions they need to ensure that the sentence is not unduly harsh, given what is hopefully to be the redirection of a person’s life.8.You are to abstain absolutely from the possession or consumption of alcohol and controlled drugs or substances, except in accordance with a prescription given to you by a qualified medical practitioner;9.You are not to attend any bar, tavern, off-sales or other commercial premises whose primary purpose is the sale of alcohol;[20]It is somewhat unusual.I am not certain whether there is any need for any programming or counselling clauses in this case.Ms. Grandy, do you see any need for that in this case?[21]MS. GRANDY:Well, there’s not exactly enough information to really make that determination.A general clause, I mean, would at least leave the rehabilitative benefit option open.[22]THE COURT:Right.You are quite correct, we do not have a lot of information in this report.I am going to include a clause:10.Take such assessment, counselling and programming as directed by your Supervisor;There will be community service.I appreciate that the community service can be more difficult when you have a young child, but there may be viable options there.I am going to order:11.That you perform 50 hours of community service as directed by your Supervisor or such other person as your Supervisor may designate.This community service is to be completed by the end of the eighth month of this order.At the discretion of the Supervisor, any hours spent in programming or counselling may be counted as community service hours;There certainly might be the availability of some programs that involve you and your child assisting other mothers; I do not know.12.That you participate in such educational or life skills programming as directed by your Supervisor;13.That you provide your Supervisor with consents to release information with regard to your participation in any programming, counselling or educational activities that you have been directed to do pursuant to this conditional sentence order.Are there any of those terms or any additional terms that counsel wish to address?[23]MS. GRANDY:The only thing I would suggest, Your Honour, is to add to the house arrest condition that if she is exercising permission, that she carry a copy of that on her person.It would have the benefit of avoiding unnecessary detention if she does have permission, but the RCMP aren’t aware of the exception, so then she would be able to, essentially, go on her way because she would have that permission on her person.[24]THE COURT:I have had counsel before me on that very issue talk about the propriety of making, whether you carry it or did not carry it, a breachable condition.I have heard different submissions on that and I have done both, depending on the circumstances.Do you have anything?[25]MS. POLLAK:My advice to Ms. Johnson, I don’t say this as a waiver entirely of my privilege, but I have already discussed with Ms. Johnson the importance that if she is out of the house, she must have that with her.Whether it ought to be a condition of the order, it certainly is in her interest to have it with her for exactly the reason that my friend has suggested, and I expect she will and it need not be part of the order.[26]THE COURT:I think the last time this argument was before me I strongly recommended that it be carried, but I acceded to defence counsel’s submissions in that case that I should not necessarily make it a term in the sense that it is going to put her in risk of having the entire conditional sentence collapsed, which is always the risk.It is presumptive, really.It does not always, or in this jurisdiction, even necessarily happens that a sentence is collapsed completely, but I am just, because I have not really discussed this with my other judges.Ms. Grandy, you have raised this with the other judges on other occasions.Generally, what has been your experience?[27]MS. GRANDY:It is definitely an issue that’s come up in other courts, and it is a condition that has been put on when I’ve requested it.It’s an issue that’s come up through, as well, through probation and the RCMP making comments to our office, and we’ve discussed it as an office as well.So it’s definitely an issue that’s come up of late and that’s sort of our response to it, for the reasons that I suggested, and I haven’t before had difficulty on either side, quite frankly, in having it put in, because, as I say, it has, you know, an obvious benefit.[28]THE COURT:There is no question about the benefits.I think everyone agrees that it would be foolish to be outside without it, because all you are doing is setting yourself up to spend a night in jail or until someone can prove that you actually had the permission, so I expect this issue is going to be looked at a little more closely in future.I think, in this case, this is not the kind of case where we are dealing with employment or situations where you are going to end up with a less highly detailed circumscribed set of permissions.I think it is going to be pretty easy to carry it with you.I am going to put it on.14.If you have written permission to be outside of your residence, you must carry that permission with you at all times.It is for your own good, in the end.[29]MS. POLLAK:Sorry, and there was -- that was actually one of the questions I had.And the other one was about a medical emergency exception.It stands to reason that the medical emergency would be good enough reason to be out of the house, but I have actually recently had it come up where somebody on the way to the hospital ended up going into custody instead.And in particular, given Ms. Johnson’s current state, I would ask that the Court consider adding that as an exception.Medical emergency for herself or her child.[30]THE COURT:You know, I will do it for clarity, because at least it gives an individual that may be concerned about a breach, a reason to look at a situation, but you are quite correct, that it is a defence in law in any event.[31]MS. POLLAK:It was actually a situation where a person ended up having to have his second heart attack in jail while he was on his way to the hospital for the first heart attack.[32]THE COURT:I will add a separate clause to the house arrest rather than trying to redo it.15.You are allowed to be outside of your residence for medical emergencies for yourself or your child, including travel directly to and directly from a physician or hospital.That makes it pretty limited.It is pretty direct.[33]MS. POLLAK:Thank you, Your Honour.Sometimes it’s best not to leave the discretion.[34]THE COURT:All right.I am going to add another clause with respect to the cell phone issue.I am not going to prohibit you from having a cell phone, but there will be a term:16.That you are to provide your Supervisor, upon request, your cell phone records, with --I do not want to invade her privacy too much in this regard, but.[35]MS. POLLAK:Your Honour, it is actually a condition that I had discussed with Ms. Johnson prior and she said she had no objection to disclosing the phone numbers or the bill that would have the phone numbers on it, if that’s what Your Honour was --[36]THE COURT:Well, I was wondering to the extent I should require her to divulge information related to whose numbers the individuals are, but I think I will leave it at that:provide cell phone records upon request.[37]I am not going to impose probation in this case.There has been a substantial period of time under fairly minimal supervision.This is not a case where it appears that ongoing counselling and programming are going to be necessary to provide every opportunity for rehabilitation.Ms. Johnson is going to be busy, and I believe in this case the resources that we have would be better put supervising other individuals.If Ms. Johnson continues on the law-abiding journey she appears to be on now, at the end of this conditional sentence order she will be free to make the choices in her life that are best for her and her family without the need of supervision from Probation Services.[38]There is going to be a mandatory s. 109 firearms order for a period of ten years.That is automatic with this conviction.That prohibits you from possessing any firearm, cross-bow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition and explosive substance.[39]There will also be a forfeiture order under s. 16 of the CDSA with respect to the cell phone that was involved in this case and, of course the drugs, by law, and the drug packaging materials that were seized.[40]Victim fine surcharge:Part of the presumption here to some extent is that this is a family that is not going to be in dire financial circumstances, but.[41]MS. POLLAK:That’s true.Mr. Jensen is fully employed.[42]THE COURT:However, it is ordering him to make the payment, I suppose.Crown?[43]THE ACCUSED:Did I just get a fine?[44]THE COURT:No, do not worry about it.[45]THE ACCUSED:Oh, sorry.[46]THE COURT:I am going to waive it.Community service will be more meaningful in this case.________________________________COZENS T.C.J."}

King, for the CrownA.Alawi,for the Accused))HEARD:January16, 2017REASONS FOR JUDGMENTWoollcombe J.A.Introduction[1]On July 29, 2016, I released my written reasons for judgment in this case and found Mr. Kelly guilty of the three counts charged in the indictment: robbery, being disguised with a face-mask with the intent to commit an indictable offence and operate motor vehicle in a manner that was dangerous to the public.He is to be sentenced.B.The Factsa)Circumstances of the Offences[2]In my reasons for judgment, now reported at 2016 ONSC 3850, I set out the circumstances of the offences.I will not repeat those in detail here.[3]Suffice it to say that on the evening of March 23, 2014, Mr. Kelly, along with three others, went to the door of an apartment rented by three women.They were masked.They knocked.When the door was answered by Kristine Villeneuve, they forced their way in.They were holding knives.[4]Inside the apartment, one of the intruders stayed in a bedroom at the end of the hall with Ms. Villeneuve while the others went around the apartment taking electronics. They were inside the apartment for about ten minutes.Given that Mr. Kelly’s thumbprint was identified on a television that was in Ms. Villenueve’s bedroom, and which was moved during the robbery, it seems likely that he was not the individual who stayed with Ms. Villeneuve during the robbery.[5]On May 27, 2014, the police attempted to arrest Mr. Kelly.They used their vehicles to try to box in his vehicle.He managed to escape from them and drove his vehicle at a high rate of speed through an intersection where a police officer was directing traffic.The issue in relation to this count was whether Mr. Kelly had been the driver, as the fact that the driving was dangerous was conceded.b)Circumstances of the Offender[6]Mr. Alawi has provided me with some background in relation to Mr. Kelly and two letters of support were filed.[7]Mr. Kelly is twenty-one years old and was nineteen at the time of the offences.He is a Canadian citizen.He grew up in a single parent household in relative poverty.He comes before the court with no criminal record.He has completed high school.He has not been working since his arrest as he has been on restrictive bail conditions flowing from unrelated charges.[8]Mr. Kelly appears to have a loving and supportive family.His mother, aunt and sister all attended at the sentencing hearing.The letters before me from his sister-in-law and cousin demonstrate that his family is very supportive of him and believe strongly that he has strong rehabilitative prospects.[9]Mr. Kelly is in a committed relationship with his long term girlfriend.She has a child whom they raise together and with whom he has a close bond.They are hopeful of having children together.[10]Mr. Kelly’s family suggests that he has learned from his mistakes and wishes to take steps to move his life forward in a positive direction.[11]When provided with an opportunity to address the court, Mr. Kelly asked me to be lenient and to provide him with time to demonstrate that he can be a good person.c)Victim Impact[12]The Crown has filed a Victim Impact Statement of Kristine Villeneuve, who was the only person present in the apartment when Mr. Kelly and the other men forced their way into the apartment and robbed her.[13]In her Victim Impact Statement, Ms. Villeneuve describes how during the robbery, she felt scared and like it was her fault for having opened the door.Immediately after the robbery, she felt uncomfortable and paranoid being around strangers.She also felt scared about being alone.She has had some sleepless nights and nightmares.She is also fearful for her security, as evidenced by her reluctance to answer the door and by her having had to ask her roommates to let her know in advance if they are having male visitors to the apartment.[14]Ms. Villeneuve had to take time off work for court.She also had to pay the $500 insurance deductible for the items that were stolen.C.Positions of the Parties[15]It is the Crown’s position that a sentence of three to four years is appropriate for the three offences.Crown counsel submits that home invasion robbery is a very serious offence and warrants a penitentiary term in order to give effect to the principles of general deterrence and denunciation.[16]The Crown also seeks ancillary orders including a DNA Order, a weapons prohibition and restitution.Mr. Alawi takes no issue with these orders being made.[17]Mr. Alawi seeks a reformatory sentence in the range of twelve to eighteen months, to be followed by a period of probation.He emphasizes that Mr. Kelly is a youthful first offender with a supportive family and good prospects for rehabilitation.He says that a penitentiary sentence would be crushing for Mr. Kelly and that the cases he has provided support the imposition of a reformatory term of imprisonment.[18]Counsel focused their submissions on the totality principle, with both of them acknowledging that the offences from March 23, 2014 were by far more serious.I was invited to impose a sentence of between four months (by the defence) and six months (by the Crown) for the dangerous driving, and invited to make this concurrent with the robbery sentence, notwithstanding the three month time lapse.D.Legal Principles and Jurisprudence[19]Section 718 of the Criminal Code sets out that the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect society and to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.[20]At the same time, in accordance with s. 718.1, a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.[21]Section 718.2 states that a court that imposes a sentence shall take into consideration the following principles:(a)a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender…(b)a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;(c)where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh.[22]Section 348.1 mandates that home invasion is an aggravating circumstance:If a person is convicted of an offence under section 98 or 98.1, subsection 279(2) or section 343, 346 or 348 in relation to a dwelling-house, the court imposing the sentence on the person shall consider as an aggravating circumstance the fact that the dwelling-house was occupied at the time of the commission of the offence and that the person, in committing the offence,(a)knew that or was reckless as to whether the dwelling-house was occupied; and(b)used violence or threats of violence to a person or property.[23]The jurisprudence makes clear that when imposing sentence on those convicted of home invasion robbery, the objectives of protection of the public, general deterrence and denunciation take priority: R. v. Hill, 2013 ONCA 572 (CanLII) at paragraph 4.Though rehabilitation should be considered, \"a stiff penitentiary sentence is generally called for\": R. v. Wright [2011] O.J. No. 4870 (C.A.) at paragraph 24.[24]The Court of Appeal has emphasized that the task of arriving at an appropriate range of sentence for home invasion robbery is challenging because of the many different ways in which such a crime may be committed.A nuanced approach is thus warranted.Consideration is to be given to the circumstances of the particular case, the nature and severity of the criminal acts perpetrated in the course of the home invasion and the situation of the individual offender.[25]The parties have each provided me with casebooks to assist me in reaching a fit sentence.While I have reviewed all of these decisions, I find the following to be of particular assistance.[26]In R. v. Drepaul, 2013 ONSC 8023 (CanLII), Molloy J. imposed a four and a half year sentence on a youthful first offender convicted of a number of offences including robbery, wear a disguise with intent, forcible confinement and possessing and trafficking in stolen property.The accused and two others entered a private home wearing face masks.One of the intruders attacked the teenaged daughter with a knife to her throat, punched her in the head and threatened to kill her.The accused had family and work support and rehabilitation was a realistic prospect.The sentencing judge found that nature of the offence and its impact on the victim were aggravating.[27]In R. v. Loots-Scott, [2015] O.J. No. 6160, Donohue J. imposed a sentence of four years in the penitentiary.The accused was one of three males who broke into a residence knowing that the home was occupied.They went to the victim’s bedroom and demanded to know where the valuables were.The trial judge found the accused was threatening and was masked with a knife.Aggravating factors included the accused’s lengthy youth record, the fact that he was under supervision at the time of the offence, the fact that he was masked with a knife and the fact that there was unnecessary violence to the homeowner.By way of mitigation, the accused was 18 years old at the time of the offence.He appeared to have turned his life around from his troubles with the law by the time of sentence.He had a supportive family and was a caregiver to his younger siblings.[28]In R. v. McNulty 2015 ONCA 776 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal considered the appellant’s appeal from the imposition of a two years less a day sentence.The appellant was convicted in the Ontario Court of Justice of assault and break, enter and commit assault.She surreptitiously obtained keys to the premises and was then involved with two others in a home invasion.She used or threatened violence on the victim.There was a favourable pre-sentence report and she had shown “admirable rehabilitative efforts”.The Court of Appeal concluded that a conditional sentence was not fit and noted at paragraph 10 that “indeed, the trial judge might have imposed a penitentiary sentence and would not have erred in principle had he done so.”E.Aggravating and Mitigating Factors[29]I find that the following circumstances are aggravating:•There was some degree of planning on the part of the group that committed the robbery.They asked Ms. Villeneuve where the drugs and money were, clearly believing, albeit incorrectly,that such items would be found in this particular apartment;•There were four male intruders who, together, pushed their way into the apartment of a lone female occupant;•The intruders were masked;•The intruders carried knives.While the defence submits that I cannot be sure that Mr. Kelly had a knife, the evidence of Ms. Villeneuve was that they had knives;•This was a violation of the sanctity of a private residence.[30]At the same time, there are important mitigating circumstances:•Mr. Kelly is a young man;•Mr. Kelly has no criminal record;•Mr. Kelly has a supportive family who is committed to assisting in his rehabilitation;•While frightening for the complainant, the offence was of a relatively brief duration;•There was no gratuitous violence or threats made to Ms. Villeneuve;F.The Sentence to be Imposed[31]In my view, notwithstanding the mitigating circumstances, a penitentiary sentence is required for the March 23, 2014 offences.I view this case as less serious than those in both Drepaul and Loots-Scott and think a lower sentence is warranted.[32]However, this was a brazen robbery of Ms. Villeneuve’s home committed by overpowering her to gain access and then terrifying her through the use of masks and knives in order to steal the electronics.Not surprisingly, this has had a significant effect on Ms. Villeneuve.I do not think that the principles of sentencing can be properly achieved with anything short of a penitentiary sentence.I find that a sentence of three years, given the circumstances, is appropriate.[33]Mr. Kelly will be sentenced to three years for the robbery in count one and to one year, concurrent for having his face masked with intent to commit an indictable offence in count two.[34]In my view, the dangerous driving conviction warrants a sentence of five months.It was conceded at trial that the driving described by the officers at trial was dangerous.The dangerous driving included backing into Officer Tidball and Officer Neglia’s vehicle, driving forward and colliding with Detective Constable Talsma’s vehicle, driving over the curb twice to escape, proceeding along Aquitaine Avenue at a very high rate of speed, failing to stop when directed to do so by Constable Wang, crossing into the path of oncoming traffic and then continuing at a high rate of speed through a residential area.The issue at trial was whether the Crown had proven this was Mr. Kelly. I was satisfied that it was.[35]This was a serious offence that put many peoples’ lives in danger.It was a cowardly response by Mr. Kelly to the fact that the police were trying to arrest him.While it would certainly be open to the court to impose a consecutive sentence for the dangerous driving, given the totality principle, which counsel invite me to apply, I order that the five month sentence be concurrent.Had I made it consecutive, I would have been inclined to decrease the sentence for counts one and two in order to give effect to the principle of totality as in my opinion, a total sentence of three years for all three offences is appropriate.[36]Mr. Kelly is to be credited three days for the two days of pre-sentence custody he has served.[37]In addition, I impose the following ancillary orders:a.a firearms and weapons prohibition under s. 109(2)(a) of the Criminal Code for ten years and under s. 109(2)(b) of the Criminal Code for life;b.aprimary DNAorder under s. 487.051 of the Criminal Code;c.a restitution order for $500 under s. 738(1)(a) to Ms. Villeneuve.Woollcombe J.Released:February 2, 2017CITATION: R. v.

Nickerson, for the applicantKen Fiske, Q.C., for the respondentApplication Heard:June 14, 2000Decision Delivered:June 14, 2000BEFORE THE HONOURABLE JUSTICE ELIZABETH ROSCOEIN CHAMBERSROSCOE , J.A. (In Chambers) (Orally):[1]This is an application for release pending the appeal, made pursuant to s. 679 of the Criminal Code.[2]The appellant was convicted by Associate Chief Justice MacDonald at Shelburne on January 20th and 27th on counts of sexual assault on B.M. (his former wife), contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code, assault on B.M. contrary to s. 266 of the Code, uttering a death threat to B.M. contrary to s. 264.1(1) of the Code and pointing a firearm at B.M. contrary to s. 86.1 of the Code (two counts).[3]The appellant was sentenced to a total of four years on those five offences, two years for the sexual assault, six months consecutive for the assault, six months concurrent on uttering a death threat, one year consecutive on the first pointing a firearm, and six months consecutive on the second pointing a firearm.[4]The appellant is appealing his conviction on one of the pointing a firearm charges, but not appealing the other four convictions and he also appeals the total sentence of four years.Counsel agree that in those circumstances s. 679.1(b) and 679.4 are applicable.[5]In his notice of appeal the appellant sets out the grounds of appeal as follows:1.It is respectfully submitted that the learned Trial Judge erred as a matter of law in that the Appellant’s right to make full answer and defence and right to a fair hearing, pursuant to Sections 7 and 11 (d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, was infringed.The Appellant submits that he was not afforded the opportunity to prepare for the case which was presented by the Crown against him, in that having met the case by the Crown in establishing an alibi for the 24th day of June, 1998 on which, the Crown’s main witness had alleged the Appellant had committed the offence of Pointing a Firearm, contrary to Section 86 (1) of the Criminal Code of Canada, the learned Trial Judge concluded that the offence had occurred on the 26th day of June, 1998, a day on which the accused did not have an alibi, contrary to the testimony of the complainant for the Crown.2.It is respectfully submitted that the learned Trial Judge erred as a matter of mixed law and fact in that by concluding that the accused had committed an offence on the 26th day of June, 1998, when the Crown had adduced evidence that the offence had occurred on the 24th day of June, 1998, he did rule incorrectly on the evidence presented at trial, which bore directly on the issue of guilt or innocense and also failed to appreciate the effect of this evidence on the issues of credibility and reasonable doubt as they related to the complainant.It is, therefore, respectfully submitted that the conclusions reached by the learned Trial Judge were unreasonable and were unsupported by the evidence adduced at trial.3.It is respectfully submitted that the learned Trial Judge erred in that he failed to apply the principles of consistency and totality in sentencing the Appellant, as expressed in Section 718.2 (b) and (c) of the Criminal Code of Canada.4.Such other grounds of appeal as may become apparent upon review of the transcript and file.[6]On a sentence appeal, leave has to be granted, according s. 679.1(b), before I can go on to consider whether or not the appellant should be released.In order to grant leave to appeal sentence, I must be satisfied that the grounds of appeal are not frivolous and that they raise arguable issues.[7]I am not positive that that section has to be complied with in this case, because it says “against sentence only” and I guess it is, with respect to sentence only for the four charges or convictions that are not being appealed, but because of my uncertainty about that, I’m going to grant leave to appeal.I don’t want to deny the bail on that ground in case it might not be even applicable when there is a conviction appeal at the same time, and I haven’t had a chance to research that.[8]In any event, moving to s. 679(4).That provides that the appellant may be released pending appeal if he establishes that:5.the appeal has sufficient merit that, in the circumstances, it would cause unnecessary hardship if he were detained in custody;6.he will surrender himself into custody in accordance with the terms of the order; and7.his detention is not necessary in the public interest.[9]As noted during the submissions, at this stage of the proceeding, the appellant no longer has the benefit of the presumption of innocence.The Crown is opposed to the release of the appellant, submitting in relation to the first and third factors, that there is not sufficient merit in the appeal and on the grounds that it is not in the public interest to release the appellant.[10]The second factor is not of too much concern, that is, that he will surrender himself into custody in accordance with the terms of the order.[11]As to the first factor, while I share the Crown’s skepticism that the sentence appeal would be successful to the point of reducing the sentence to a conditional sentence, I am prepared to accept that it is possible that the sentence could be reduced to such an extent that L.D.M. would serve longer than is required at this stage of his sentence if the appeal is successful.The main issue though, in my mind, is the question of the public interest and whether or not the appellant has established that his detention is not necessary in the public interest.Whether it is in the public interest involves the consideration of both public safety and public confidence in the administration of justice.I must be concerned with the possibility of whether the appellant might reoffend if released, and also whether in light of the violence involved in these offences and the use of firearms, that informed fair minded members of the community would think it reasonable to release the appellant at this stage of the criminal process, that is, after he has been found guilty.[12]In cases of spousal assault and family violence there is also the apprehension about and concern for physical safety of the victim of the crimes, and I note in the pre-sentence report, the very last sentence:“The victim of these offences indicated she was very fearful of the accused due to his explosive personality, and also his fascination with guns”.[13]Taking all of these matters into consideration, including the submissions of counsel, I am not satisfied that the appellant’s detention is not necessary in the public interest.I am not convinced that the public safety concerns arising from the circumstances of these offences and this offender would be adequately addressed if he were released.[14]For these reasons, the application is dismissed.Roscoe, J.A."}

R.IN THE QUEEN’S BENCHJUDICIAL CENTRE OF REGINABETWEEN:HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN- and -CHARLES HERRYE LAVALLEEM.T. Beatonfor Her Majesty the QueenD.W. Andrews, Q.C.for Charles Herrye LavalleeSENTENCINGBALL J.September 26, 2002[1]Charles Herrye Lavallee has entered a guilty plea to a charge that on September 12, 1996, he unlawfully caused the death of Lester Clayton Crowe and did thereby commit manslaughter.FACTS[2]I do not propose to repeat all of the facts presented at the sentencing hearing. However, a brief summary will follow.[3]On September 12, 1996, Lester Crowe died as a result of a single stab wound administered by Charles Lavallee. Mr. Crowe was 26 years old at the time of his death. The stabbing occurred after Charles Lavallee and an accomplice, Maxwell Ponace, consumed a substantial amount of alcohol and drugs and then went to the Crowe residence looking for drugs and money. Upon arriving at the residence, they demanded Talwin and Ritalin (T\u0026R's). Lester Crowe told them that he had no drugs and asked David Crowe, his nephew, to take Lavallee and Ponace next door. Messrs. Lavallee, Ponace and David Crowe went next door. While they were gone, two waistband pouches containing drugs, money, identification and keys were taken upstairs by Crowe family members who, in the words of Crown counsel, believed that \"something was up\". Shortly thereafter, Charles Lavallee and Maxwell Ponace returned to the residence, banged on the front door, entered and confronted Lester Crowe.[4]While Maxwell Ponace kept Lester Crowe's sister, Lenore, in another room, Charles Lavallee confronted Mr. Crowe, stating: \"I just got out of jail and you owe me money\".Mr. Crowe then called for the two waistband pouches to be brought downstairs to him, but by the time the pouches arrived Charles Lavallee had stabbed him with a knife. Lavallee and Ponace then left the residence with the two waistband pouches, advising Mr. Crowe that they would kill him the next time. Shortly thereafter, Lester Crowe collapsed and died from a stab wound to the chest.[5]A few hours later, Messrs. Lavallee and Ponace held a knife to the throat of a taxi cab driver, demanding money. After giving them $60.00 the driver attempted to escape. He was caught by the two men, assaulted and stabbed. Charles Lavallee and Ponace ran away when the cab driver screamed for help. The driver sustained two minor stab wounds, neither of which were life threatening.[6]Charles Lavallee was arrested in mid-October of 1996. Both he and Maxwell Ponace were charged with first degree murder as a result of the death of Mr. Crowe, and both were charged with robbery with violence as a result of the robbery of the taxi cab driver.[7]On January 22, 1998 a judge and jury found Charles Lavallee guilty of second degree murder and Maxwell Ponace guilty of manslaughter. On January 29, 1998, Mr. Lavallee was sentenced to life in prison with no eligibility for parole for 13 years. On February 13, 1998, he was sentenced to four years in prison for robbery with violence, that sentence to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed for second degree murder.[8]On March 21, 2001, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal set aside Charles Lavallee's conviction for second degree murder and ordered a new trial. On September 17, 2002, the Crown indicted Mr. Lavallee for the included offence of manslaughter, to which he now pleads guilty.[9]Since his arrest in October, 1996, Mr. Lavallee has spent six years in custody. Two of those years were spent on remand awaiting trail and/or sentencing for the offence to which he now pleads guilty. The other four years have been spent in a Federal Penitentiary serving his sentence for robbery with violence.THE ACCUSED[10]Charles Lavallee is now 33 years old. He is one of seven children. His father was an abusive alcoholic who, if he was not drinking, was away working. Mr. Lavallee lived on the Sakimay Reserve near Grenfell until he was five. He attended a series of elementary schools in Regina and then went to school in Grenfell, where he completed grade 8. He has been on his own since his early teens, and apart from occasional seasonal work his life has been earmarked by alcohol and drug abuse with a series of break, enter and theft convictions. Other convictions more relevant to this ofence are as follows:November 21, 1988AssaultNovember 28, 1988Possession of a weaponFebruary 13, 1990AssaultOctober 1, 1991Obstructing a Peace OfficerFebruary 21, 1995Obstructing a Peace Officer[11]Charles Lavallee's mother, who is very ill, has taken responsibility for the care and upbringing of his son, who is now 14 years old. In a letter to the court she states her desire to have Mr. Lavallee released from custody so that he can take responsibility for his son. Although Mr. Lavallee has had very little connection to the Sakimay Reserve, the Chief of the Sakimay First Nation has written a letter outlining the resources available on the Reserve if he should choose to relocate to Sakimay and to seek assistance with rehabilitation and reintegration.[12]While incarcerated, Mr. Lavallee has improved his education to grade 10 equivalent and taken courses to assist him with certain life skills, including, for example, anger management and addictions. In court, he accepted responsibility for his actions, stating that he never intended to cause Lester Crowe's death and apologizing to the Crowe family for his actions.PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[13]The purpose and principles of sentencing are outlined in s. 718 of the Criminal Code which states:718The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.[14]The following sections of the Code are also relevant:718.1A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.718.2A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:. . .(b)a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;(c)where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;[15]In applying these principles I consider the following factors to be aggravating:➢Mr. Lavallee's voluntary consumption of alcohol and drugs. While that consumption clearly affects the legal consequences of his actions, it will not mitigate his sentence for manslaughter contrary to s. 236 of the Criminal Code.➢Mr. Lavallee has a previous criminal record. Even though his record of offences against other persons is not nearly as lengthy or as serious as the prior criminal record of Maxwell Ponace filed with the court, Mr. Lavallee's previous criminal record places him in a different position from someone with no record at all.➢It was Charles Lavallee who stabbed Mr. Crowe with a knife, causing his death.➢The stabbing and resulting death of Lester Crowe was the first of two violent offences carried out by Messrs. Lavallee and Ponace, both of which involved the use of a knife and injuries. From a sentencing perspective the manslaughter charge cannot be viewed in isolation from the violent robbery of the taxi cab driver by the same two men a few hours later. It may fairly be said that the two of them embarked on a drug and alcohol fuelled night of terrorizing others.[16]The following are factors I consider to be mitigating:•Charles Lavallee has been incarcerated continuously since his arrest for these offences in mid-October of 1996. Two of those six years were on remand awaiting trial. Both parties agree that the six years Mr. Lavallee has already spent in prison, with two of those years on remand, should provide him with credit for eight years actually served.•Lester Crowe sustained one stab wound only. It seems clear from the facts presented at the sentencing hearing that Mr. Lavallee did not intend or expect the wound to prove fatal.•In court, Mr. Lavallee accepted responsibility for his actions and apologized to the Crowe family members.[17]Section 718.2(b) of the Code directs that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. That direction means that I must consider the sentences imposed upon Maxwell Ponace for his participation in the events of September 12, 1996, and his resulting convictions for manslaughter and robbery with violence.[18]On August 25, 1998, Maxwell Ponace was found to be a long term offender pursuant to s. 753.1 of the Criminal Code. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison for manslaughter with no eligibility for parole for five years. Because he was found to be a long term offender under s. 753.1, the court also made a supervision order for an additional five years upon his release. For his role in the robbery and assault of the taxi cab driver, Maxwell Ponace was sentenced to four years in jail to be served concurrently with his 10 year sentence for manslaughter.[19]The Crown submits that because Mr. Ponace spent two years on remand awaiting trial and sentencing, and because he would have been given credit for four years served for those two years on remand, his 10 year sentence for manslaughter was the equivalent of a 14 year term.[20]The defence also suggests that the sentence imposed upon Maxwell Ponace was unusually high for manslaughter because the Crown applied to have him designated as a dangerous offender. This was followed by an agreement between the Crown and Mr. Ponace whereby Ponace did not oppose designation as a long term offender or the 10 year sentence.[21]I do not agree that the sentence imposed on Ponace was inordinately high for manslaughter. On the contrary, his sentence appears to have been within the recent range having regard to the circumstances and his lengthy record for offences involving violence against others.[22]The sentences of 10 years for manslaughter and four years for robbery with violence imposed upon Maxwell Ponace were to be served concurrently. The sentence I now impose upon Charles Lavallee for manslaughter will be served consecutively to the four year sentence he has already served for robbery with violence. This differentiates his situation from that of Ponace and makes s. 718.2(c) of the Code relevant. That section states that where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh.[23]The Crown submits that if Charles Lavallee is now sentenced to six years incarceration, to be served in addition to the equivalent of eight years already served, both Ponace and Lavallee will have received the equivalent of 14 year sentences. The defence points out that by the end of August, 2003, Ponace will have served five years of his 10 year sentence and will be eligible to apply for parole. The defence suggests that a sentence of two years less one day in the Provincial Correctional Centre would be appropriate since, if Maxwell Ponace is released on parole next year, it would effectively result in both Lavallee and Ponace actually being incarcerated for a similar period of time.[24]I do not propose to speculate on the outcome of any application for parole Maxwell Ponace may make upon the expiration of the first five years of his 10 year sentence. Whether he is successful or not, as a long term offender he will be subject to close supervision in the community for a term of five years following his release. In those circumstances, I cannot ensure that Charles Lavallee spends precisely the same amount of time actually incarcerated as his accomplice, Maxwell Ponace.[25]Both the Crown and the defence have provided the court with numerous cases to review which have been of assistance to me.[26]In considering an appropriate sentence in the circumstances, I know that whatever sentence is imposed can never restore Lester Crowe to his family, and in particular to his school-aged son. In those terms no sentence will ever be enough.[27]Having considered the circumstances of the offence as presented by the Crown and as accepted and explained by your counsel, I accept the plea of guilty to manslaughter. Having regard to the purposes and principles of sentencing, I have decided that a sentence closer to the six years recommended by the Crown would be more appropriate than the two years recommended by defence. Accordingly, I sentence Charles Lavallee to five years in a Federal Penitentiary. Given that this term will be served consecutively to the time and credited time already served, this will be equivalent to a 13 year term of incarceration.[28]Pursuant to s. 109 of the Criminal Code I make an order prohibiting Charles Lavallee from possessing any firearm, cross bow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition and explosive substance for life. He shall have 30 days in which to lawfully dispose of any of the above items and to surrender every authorization, licence and registration certificate currently held by him relating to anything, the possession of which is now prohibited. If he fails to lawfully dispose of the above items they shall be forfeited to Her Majesty the Queen and may be disposed of as the Attorney-General directs.[29]I make an order in form 5.04 pursuant to s. 487.052(1) authorizing the taking, from the accused, for the purposes of forensic DNA analysis, of any number of samples of one or more bodily substances that is reasonably required for that purpose by means of the investigative procedures described in s. 487.06(1) as I am satisfied it is in the best interests of the administration of justice to do so.J."}

Blackwell (2007), 2007 BCSC 1486 (CanLII), B.C.J. No. 2168, a decision of Justice D.M. Smith of the British Columbia Supreme Court, released October 3, 2007.Justice Smith concluded in reviewing the case law that the court may order non-consensual psychiatric assessments pursuant to s.672.11 of the Criminal Code to aid in a determination of whether an accused is fit to stand trial or whether an accused is Not Criminally Responsible under Part XX.1 of the Mental Disorder sections of the Criminal Code, but may not order non-consensual assessments pursuant to that provision of the Criminal Code for sentencing purposes.For sentencing purposes, the court must look to s.721(4) and s.723(3).[5]His case review in Blackwell, supra, persuaded him that the issue of whether a non-consensual assessment may be ordered for sentencing purposes pursuant to ss. 721(4) and 723(3) of the Criminal Code is left open.[6]There appears to be consistency in the reported Alberta cases that trial judges have found jurisdiction to order these assessments as part of the pre-sentence report, provided some logical nexus or relevance to the matter under consideration is established.[7]Justice Smith found the distinctions in the case law compelling.In Blackwell, supra, he found that “some logical nexus or relevance between what is being ordered to be produced and the matter under consideration” is to be given a broad interpretation.He stated at paragraph 32, “concerns about the random, unprovoked, inherently dangerous and violent nature of an offender’s actions could meet the criterion for logical nexus or relevance.”[8]I completely agree with the broad interpretation.The court’s discretion to order assessments pursuant to ss. 721(4) and 723(3) of the Code must be exercised in aid of determining an appropriate sentence.The specific assessment ordered must be relevant to that issue.In Blackwell, supra, Justice Smith ordered the offender to undergo a psychiatric assessment for sentencing purposes, under ss. 721(4) and 723(3) of the Criminal Code in order for the court to fulfill its obligations under the sentencing provisions, ss. 718, 718.1 and 718.2 of the Code.He further noted that as this was an out of custody assessment, the offender is to be invited to participate in the assessment process by the probation officer who is preparing the pre-sentence report.If the offender declines to participate, the qualified professional conducting the assessment may examine collateral material in order to produce a report for the court for sentencing purposes.[9]Aside from Blackwell, supra, the other decisions referring to ss. 721(4) and 723(3) of the Code are:R v. D.D.S. (2006), 2006 NSCA 34 (CanLII), 207 C.C.C. (3d) 319 (N.S.C.A.), where at paragraph 6, Saunders J.A. noted, in passing without expressing any disapproval, the following:The sentence hearing was adjourned from time to time, both for the preparation of a pre-sentence report and to deal with certain challenges including theneed for – and the jurisdiction of the court to order – a comprehensive sexual offender assessment pursuant to Sections 721(4) and 723(3) of the Criminal Code.The assessment was eventually ordered and prepared.In R v. McCrea 2007 BCPC 258 (CanLII), [2007] B.C.J. No. 1786, (B.C. Prov. Ct.), Brecknell J. ordered a psychiatric assessment under ss.721(4) and 723(3) of the Code for sentencing purposes, but then relied on R v. Gettliffe-Grant 2006 BCSC 1943 (CanLII), [2006] B.C.J. No. 3335 at the time of the sentencing and concluded that the jurisdiction to do so was exceeded.Again, I agree with and rely on the Blackwell, supra decision which is to the contrary.[10]In relation to Mr. Challes, the Crown seeks a sexual behaviour assessment including phallometric testing to assist the court with the issue of whether or not the offender is a paedophile, and to assess his risk in the community.The offences of which he has been convicted involved pre-adolescent girls through to adult women.The assessment, I find, will assist with risk assessment, and as to whether or not he has a paraphilia, and if there should be a s.161 order, and what treatment if any can be required.[11]I am satisfied that the sexual behaviour assessment including phallometric testing has a logical nexus to the facts as established in this case which are to be considered in sentencing.Mr. Challes has been convicted of multiple acts of sexual assault of young pre-pubescent girls, to girls in their adulthood.The issue of risk and paraphilia are germane to an appropriate sentence.Mr. Challes is remanded out of custody, and he need not co-operate with the assessment, or certain aspects of the assessment, if he so chooses.The information however, provided by such an assessment would greatly assist the court in understanding his conduct in the offences, as opposed to only having the nature of the offences themselves to consider.[12]Mr. Challes objects to the phallometric testing aspect of the assessment as being overly intrusive, embarrassing and humiliating, and causing him great anxiety.In spite of his position, I find the information sought from such an assessment will be highly relevant to the sentencing process, as only one piece of evidence to be considered.This case is distinguishable from R v. Rayworth [1999] O.J. No. 5289, where McIsaac J. held that phallometric testing would be superfluous as the offender was a sexual sadist whose very condition motivated the offence.These are not the facts before me.[13]I therefore find that sexual behaviour assessment can be properly ordered as part of the sentencing process under ss.721(4) and 723(3) of the Code once relevance to the matter under consideration by the court has been established, and that the offender is advised that he or she can decline to participate or co-operate in all or some aspects of the assessment, as he or she decides.I find the court has jurisdiction to order a sexual behaviour assessment for sentencing purposes under ss.721(4) and 723(3) of the Code to determine an appropriate sentence.[14]Order to go that the probation officer assigned to complete the pre-sentence report is also directed to arrange Mr. Challes to attend for a sexual behaviour assessment to include phallometric testing, to be completed by a qualified professional.The results of the sexual behaviour assessment are to be included as part of the pre-sentence report.____________________________________MADAM JUSTICE HELEN MacLEODReleased:March 25, 2008COURT FILE NO.:16404/05DATE:March 25, 2008ONTARIOSUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICEB E T W E E N:HER MAJESTY THE QUEENplaintiff-and –ALFRED CHALLESdefendantREASONS FOR JUDGMENTMACLEOD J.Released:March 25, 2008"}

DerrickHeard:December 10, 2015Decision:January 6, 2016Charges:section 236(b) of the Criminal Code.Counsel:Susan MacKay, for the CrownJoel Pink, Q.C. and Nasha Nijhawan, for Vanessa BurgessBy the Court:Introduction[1]In criminal cases involving a death almost always there are family members and friends who bear witness to the legal proceedings while enduring their unique experiences of loss and grief. When the victim and the perpetrator are related there are additional dimensions to the grief and in this case, the pain of ruptured family bonds and relationships. As two of the victim impact statements have said, the family that included David Burgess and Vanessa Burgess is now “broken.”[2]The sentence I am imposing on Ms. Burgess cannot restore these relationships, return David Burgess to those who loved him, or reflect what Mr. Burgess meant to his family. Sentencing Ms. Burgess is “governed by fixed principles” of law applied to the facts and circumstances of the case. The sentence imposed does not represent “the intrinsic value or worth of the deceased.” (R. v. Costa, [1996] O.J. No. 299, paragraph 42) Its fundamental purpose is to “contribute…to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions…” (section 718, Criminal Code)[3]On July 31, 2015 after a trial totaling eleven days I convicted Vanessa Burgess of manslaughter in the death of her father, David Burgess. I found the trial evidence established that on the evening of July 20, 2011 in a momentary surge of anger and frustration Ms. Burgess committed the objectively dangerous act of shoving her father hard enough that he fell down steep basement stairs at his home. The propelled fall left Mr. Burgess with catastrophic head injuries. (R. v. Burgess, 2015 NSPC 47 (CanLII), paragraph 316) He died in hospital on July 26, 2011. (R. v. Burgess, paragraphs 1, 243)[4]In determining Ms. Burgess’ sentence I have been confronted by the very difficult task of balancing the principles and factors I am required to take into account.This case brings into sharp focus the delicate and nuanced exercise that must be undertaken in crafting a proportionate sentence, the formulation of which is “a profoundly subjective process.” (R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] S.C.J. No. 52, paragraph 46)The Position of the Crown and Defence[5]The Crown has recommended a sentence of eight years for Ms. Burgess. It is Ms. MacKay’s submission that there are significant aggravating factors in this case that call for a substantial penitentiary term.[6]Ms. Burgess accepts that a penitentiary sentence is required in her case. She understands that a non-custodial sentence is not an option. It is only manslaughter cases with exceptional circumstances that have received non-custodial sentences and changes to the Criminal Code have made conditional sentences unavailable. It is Mr. Pink’s submission on Ms. Burgess’ behalf that a three year prison term is the appropriate sentence. He takes issue with what the Crown has identified as aggravating factors.The Victim Impact Statements[7]Mr. Burgess’ death and the circumstances under which it occurred have had a devastating effect on the individual members of his family and their relationships. Six family members provided victim impact statements in which they movingly expressed their profound grief and heartache. Mr. Burgess’ wife, Lynda, referring to him as her “soulmate”, spoke of how much she misses him. His three sisters described their brother as loving and caring. They grieve their loss and the broken family relationships. Mr. Burgess’ youngest sister, Christine, has experienced a deterioration in her health since he died. She characterized the description of her brother as “a good guy”, offered by many people who have spoken to her since her brother’s death, as a perfect description. In her words, “not perfect, but a good guy.” Mr. Burgess’ sister-in-law, the sister of Lynda Burgess, mourns someone she loved and, as with everyone else who provided statements, laments the deeply painful divisions that now exist in the family. Family members also spoke about the grief experienced by Mr. Burgess’ now 95 year old mother who struggles to understand the circumstances of her son’s death. She too provided a victim impact statement.[8]Mr. Burgess’ alcoholism is mentioned in some of the victim impact statements as is the love he had for his family, including his love for Ms. Burgess.Vanessa’s Burgess’ Background and Circumstances[9]Interviewed for her pre-sentence report, Ms. Burgess described an unhappy and stressful childhood and adolescence. She was bullied at school and verbally abused at home. She felt emotionally deprived by her parents whom she said were not affectionate with her or with each other. Ms. Burgess had a better relationship with her father than with her mother. She left home at 15 and developed a substance abuse problem. She used illegal drugs and became an alcoholic. Around the age of twenty she overcame her substance abuse dependency and has been sober for over eight years. The evidence at trial indicated Ms. Burgess’ belief that her father was resentful of her successful recovery. Although he had been sober for many years while Ms. Burgess was growing up, about eleven years before his death he began drinking again which led to a pronounced deterioration in their relationship.[10]Ms. Burgess moved back to live with her parents about 15 to 16 months prior to July 2011 so that she could focus on obtaining her high school diploma. She told police that the atmosphere at home prior to July 20 had been “very, very toxic.” In her police interrogation and her testimony at trial Ms. Burgess said her father had subjected her to name-calling and disparaging comments. She told the police investigators that her father would try to get a reaction out of her by belittling her in various ways. (R. v. Burgess, paragraph 51)[11]Prior to returning to live with her parents as a 28 year old, Ms. Burgess had been in several relationships during her 20’s which, she told the author of the pre-sentence report, had turned violent. She had become a mother at 20. Her son lives with his father and Ms. Burgess sees him regularly on access visits. Several victim impact statements referred to the importance of Ms. Burgess’ son to the extended family. Lynda Burgess spoke in her statement about the close bond between Ms. Burgess and her son. Ms. Burgess’ Elizabeth Fry Society support worker also remarked on Ms. Burgess’ deep love for her son.[12]Ms. Burgess is now 32. She is involved in a dating relationship with a 39 year old man who is very supportive of her. He is aware that Ms. Burgess has been convicted of manslaughter. He provided a letter of support for her sentencing. Ms. Burgess told the author of the pre-sentence report that her boyfriend is “a strong person with strong family values which is good for her…” She believes the relationship will continue. (pre-sentence report, page 4)[13]Ms. Burgess advised the author of the pre-sentence report that she obtained her Grade 12 with very good marks and attended the Maritime Business College in 2013 for a Business Development Certification. She has worked in various jobs, including most recently as a house painter, but is currently unemployed. The foreman with the painting company where Ms. Burgess had been employed told the author of the pre-sentence report that Ms. Burgess was a reliable and responsible worker who got along well with the other employees and established positive relationships with clients.[14]Ms. Burgess has been an active and enthusiastic volunteer with Search and Rescue and her church. She was an energetic contributor to the activities of the Student Association at the Nova Scotia Community College where she took her Grade 12. As I will mention shortly, Ms. Burgess is highly valued by her friends, a number of whom have submitted supportive letters on her behalf.[15]Ms. Burgess has accessed various counselling programs and services in the past including substance abuse counselling and anger management. She has been attending sessions with an Elizabeth Fry support worker since 2013 and her family doctor has prescribed medication to help with sleep disturbance issues and mild depressive symptoms. Her doctor told the author of the pre-sentence report that Ms. Burgess “has a great deal of anger and frustration.” (pre-sentence report, page 6) Ms. Burgess also reports significant grief over her father’s death, telling the author of the pre-sentence report: “I miss him so much. I have had no closure…” (pre-sentence report, page 8)[16]Ms. Burgess’ Elizabeth Fry Society Support worker described her as a “very spiritual person” whose spirituality has been helping her cope with the stress of the court proceedings. She indicated that Ms. Burgess “has a positive outlook” toward having a productive future and “is not blaming anyone for this scenario.” (pre-sentence report, page 7) She suggested that Ms. Burgess can benefit from further counselling.[17]In the pre-sentence report Ms. Burgess indicated an awareness that she needs to continue in her efforts to identify and address her issues. She told the author of the report: “I have to deal with my anger. I am a good person. Something bad has happened to me and I am willing to take responsibility for it.” The pre-sentence report concludes by stating that Ms. Burgess’ “level of commitment to maintaining abstinence from drugs and alcohol is commendable, however that level of commitment to addressing her grief and mental health would benefit [her] as well.” (pre-sentence report, page 8)Character References from Ms. Burgess’ Friends[18]I was provided with five letters from friends of Ms. Burgess in support of her good character and pro-social orientation. She is described in these letters as having “a huge heart” and a positive, generous nature. Despite the challenges she has faced as a result of her manslaughter conviction, such as being let go from jobs, she is said to have continued “to try and make things better for her own life and that of those around her.” Her friends note Ms. Burgess’ devotion to her son and her commitment to being involved in his life. She is described as someone who “always looks at problems as an opportunity to improve things.” She is said to consistently show a “genuine kindness” and to maintain a positive outlook. Her boyfriend comments on Ms. Burgess’ “wonderful relationship” with her son and her “sweet, caring and loving” disposition. One friend views Ms. Burgess as “the sister I had always needed” and calls her “my rock.” It is apparent that Ms. Burgess’ friends have found it rewarding to have invested in a relationship with her.[19]Ms. Burgess’ friends also describe her as having loved her father and being remorseful and grief-stricken about what happened.[20]The Crown took no issue with the character reference letters. The letters confirm that there are always more dimensions to a person than is apparent through the evidence at trial. I accept that Ms. Burgess’ friends have offered sincere expressions of their love and respect for the friend they know. I do not question their experience of Ms. Burgess’ positive qualities.[21]However, I do want to comment on the characterization in two of the reference letters of the events of July 20, 2011 as “an accident.” Mr. Burgess did not die because there was an accident. Mr. Burgess died because Vanessa Burgess pushed him in anger. That unlawful assault which propelled him down a steep set of stairs led to his death. Ms. Burgess did not intend for her father to be hurt or die. That is why Ms. Burgess was not charged with and prosecuted for murder. What Ms. Burgess is guilty of is a culpable homicide that was not murder. It will not assist her to come to terms with what her anger caused if those who love and support her insist on treating what happened to Mr. Burgess as an accident.[22]I dealt with the same issue in R. v. Isenor, [2007] N.S.J. No. 487, a one-punch manslaughter case where similarly there were references in support letters to the victim’s death having been “an accident”. The terminology of “accident” suggests there is no culpability. In Isenor I said it must be understood, not only by the offender, but also by the broader community, that where an unlawful assault leads to a person dying, it is a culpable homicide. The fact that the person committing the assault did not intend to kill the victim is what makes it manslaughter and not murder. (paragraph 36)The Purpose and Principles of Sentencing[23]The sentencing of Ms. Burgess is governed by the sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code. Section 718 of the Criminal Code sets out the objectives a sentence must achieve: denunciation, deterrence – both specific and general, separation from society where necessary, rehabilitation of the offender, reparations by the offender, and the promotion of a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.[24]Section 718.2 recites the other sentencing principles that the sentencing court is mandated to take into consideration, which for the purposes of this case are, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and parity – that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.[25]Sentencing is profoundly individualized. (R. v. Ipeelee,2012 SCC 13 (CanLII), [2012] S.C.J. No. 13, paragraph 38; R. v. Wust, 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII), [2000] S.C.J. No. 19 paragraph 21; R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] S.C.J. No. 28, paragraph 92; R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] S.C.J. No. 52) In determining a fit sentence, “…the sentencing judge should take into account any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances (s. 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code), as well as objective and subjective factors related to the offender's personal circumstances.” (R. v. Pham, 2013 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2013] S.C.J. No. 100, paragraph 8; R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2010] S.C.J. No. 6, paragraph 44) Sentencing judges “must have sufficient maneuverability to tailor sentences to the circumstances of the particular offence and the particular offender.” (R. v. Ipeelee, paragraph 38)[26]Assessing moral culpability is a critical aspect of determining any sentence: a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. (section 718.1, Criminal Code) Proportionality is “closely tied to the objective of denunciation”, promotes justice for victims, and seeks to ensure public confidence in the justice system. The principle of proportionality,…ensures that a sentence does not exceed what is appropriate, given the blameworthiness of the offender. In this sense, the principle serves a limiting or restraining function and ensures justice for the offender. In the Canadian criminal justice system, a just sanction is one that reflects both perspectives on proportionality and does not elevate one at the expense of the other. (R. v. Ipeelee, paragraph 37)[27]In the Supreme Court of Canada’s most recent decision on sentencing -helpfully supplied by Ms. MacKay - the Court has held that, “Individualization and parity of sentences must be reconciled for a sentence to be proportionate: s. 718.2(a) and (b) of the Criminal Code.” (R. v. Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII), paragraph 53) The Court goes on to note: “…The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a highly individualized exercise that goes beyond a pure mathematical calculation. It involves a variety of factors that are difficult to define with precision.”(paragraph 58)Sentencing for Manslaughter[28]A manslaughter sentence must be tailored to the offender’s degree of moral fault for the harm that has been done. Manslaughter “can occur in a wide variety of circumstances” making it necessary that the penalties for it be flexible. (R. v. Creighton, 1993 CanLII 61 (SCC), [1993] S.C.J. No. 91, paragraph 86)[29]This is a case of unlawful act manslaughter. The push Ms. Burgess gave her father was an assault which is, of course, an unlawful act.[30]Mr. Burgess’ death was the unintended consequence of Ms. Burgess’ unlawful assault. Ms. Burgess is at fault for Mr. Burgess’ death and although she did not intend to kill her father when she pushed him, she is required to take responsibility for all the consequences of her actions. (R. v. Creighton, paragraph 95)[31]In R. v. Henry, 2002 NSCA 33 (CanLII) the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal identified the role of moral blameworthiness in the broad sentencing range for manslaughter cases. Roscoe, J.A. indicated that,…The court, while of course giving due weight to all the principles of sentencing must assess the extent of moral blameworthiness in a particular case, and should consider where on the spectrum, from almost accident to almost murder, the particular offence falls. Obviously, the nearly equivalent to murder offences will, in general, attract a sentence higher than the majority…and those closer to an accidental killing will generally fall below the average. (paragraph 19)[32]In the moral blameworthiness assessment in unlawful act manslaughter cases it is what the unlawful act involved that is relevant. A range of considerations must be assessed: the nature of the unlawful act; the degree of force used by the offender in perpetrating the act; the degree of violence or brutality; whether a weapon was used; the extent of the victim’s injuries; whether there was gratuitous violence; the degree of deliberation involved in the act; the extent to which forethought or planning was involved; the complexity of the act; what, if anything, provoked the act; the time involved in perpetrating the act; and the element of chance involved in the resulting death. (R. v. Tower, [2006] N.S.J. No. 293 (S.C.), paragraph 30)[33]Manslaughter can occur in diverse circumstances. Mr. Pink submits that the circumstances of Ms. Burgess’ offence are most like the one-punch manslaughter cases that have happened in our community, for example, R. v. Henry, 2002 NSCA 33 (CanLII), [2002] N.S.J. No. 113 (S.C.), R. v. Isenor, [2007] N.S.J. No. 487 (P.C.), R. v. Hickey, [2011], N.S.J. No. 244 (S.C.), and R. v. Whitehead,[2014] N.S.J. No. 667 (S.C.). I will discuss these cases next including why the Crown views them as dissimilar. I will then review some of the cases provided by Ms. MacKay.The One-Punch Manslaughter Cases[34]Mr. Henry, like Ms. Burgess, went to trial on a charge of manslaughter and was convicted. The trial judge found that on leaving a downtown bar at closing time, Mr. Henry noticed a man – Mr. Johnstone – strike a young woman twice after she had pushed or shoved him. Mr. Henry intervened immediately by pinning Mr. Johnstone against a wall, berating him for hitting a woman. He let Mr. Johnstone go but decided to follow him along the street. He caught up to him and tapped him on the shoulder. When Mr. Johnstone turned around Mr. Henry “sucker-punched” him which caused Mr. Johnstone to fall backwards and hit his head on the pavement. The impact knocked Mr. Johnstone unconscious and the head injury he sustained was fatal. Mr. Henry abruptly left the scene as bystanders began to gather. Very shortly afterwards he noticed the police had arrived where Mr. Johnstone was lying.[35]Mr. Henry had been overheard to say to Mr. Johnstone just before punching him, “this is what you get for hitting a girl” “or words to that effect.” (R. v. Henry, paragraph 5) After leaving the scene, Mr. Henry encountered the young woman and offered her a drive home. He was found to have said in her presence that he “took care of it” referring to the assault by Mr. Johnstone that Mr. Henry had witnessed.[36]The trial judge rejected Mr. Henry’s claim of self-defence and found that his motivation for assaulting Mr. Johnstone was a form of vigilante justice. (R. v. Henry, paragraphs 6 and 8) The Court of Appeal agreed with the Crown’s description of the aggravating factors: that Mr. Henry engaged in “a cowardly attack” on the victim; that he acted as “a vigilante, a predator”; that “His objective was to strike an unanswered blow”; that he acted out of anger “that he chose not to control”; that “at least part of his motivation was a desire to impress” the young woman whom Mr. Johnstone had assaulted. It was noted that Mr. Henry did not render any assistance to Mr. Johnstone and instead immediately sought out the woman, telling her that he “took care” of the man who had assaulted her. (R. v. Henry, paragraph 23, citing the Crown’s appeal factum)[37]Mr. Henry had no criminal record and although in his interview for the pre-sentence report he expressed remorse for Mr. Johnstone, he was not viewed as remorseful for “his reaction to the events” of the fateful evening.[38]A successful Crown appeal saw Mr. Henry receive a four year penitentiary sentence instead of the conditional sentence of two years less a day imposed by the trial judge. The Court of Appeal found the trial judge “overemphasized restorative objectives and gave little regard to the principles of denunciation and general deterrence.” The original sentence was described as “clearly inadequate and excessively lenient.” (paragraph 12) The Court subsequently referenced an earlier decision, R. v. Myette, where it was held that, “Lenient sentences have been imposed only where very strong mitigating factors exist or where the act, though culpable, was close to being an accident.” (R. v. Henry, paragraph 19, citing R. v. Myette, [1985] N.S.J. No. 472, paragraph 47.) In Myette, the Nova Scotia Appeal Division noted that sentences in the “great majority” of manslaughter cases range from four to ten years.[39]In increasing Mr. Henry’s sentence, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal referred to the aggravating circumstances of the case – Mr. Henry’s “continued notion that his action was justified, and the predatory callousness of his intentional assault on a smaller, intoxicated man…” The Court held that Mr. Henry’s moral blameworthiness was “well beyond the near accident point” on the manslaughter sentencing “spectrum” and required a sentence that emphasized denunciation and deterrence. (paragraph 29)[40]In Isenor, I distinguished the Henry case and imposed a shorter sentence of imprisonment, a penitentiary term of three years. Isenor was another case where the unlawful act was a single punch. There was no gratuitous violence and no weapon was used. Mr. Isenor decided to “stand up to” the victim’s drunken behaviour by punching him. He had concluded that Mr. Moore, who had been verbally abusive, “had earned himself a punch in the mouth.” (R. v. Isenor, paragraph 8)I found that the period of Mr. Isenor’s deliberation before punching Mr. Moore lasted no more “than a matter of seconds.” Mr. Isenor was not expecting that the much taller and heavier man would be knocked down. He thought Mr. Moore would come looking for him to settle the score. (Isenor, paragraph 26)[41]The Hickey case, like Henry and Isenor, also involved a trial and an unsuccessful claim of self-defence. Mr. Hickey punched the victim once in anger. It was a deadly punch. In his sentencing decision, Cacchione, J. noted that Mr. Hickey delivered a punch “with such significant force that it shattered many of Mr. Carter’s facial bones and caused his brain to rotate in his skull.” (R. v. Hickey, paragraph 19) Mr. Hickey’s anger toward Mr. Carter had been simmering because of comments Mr. Carter had made and “his temper reached the boiling point when he perceived Mr. Carter as calling him a liar.” (paragraph 58) Cacchione, J. found the aggravating factors to be: Mr. Hickey’s involvement in a dispute between Mr. Carter and Mr. Hickey’s employer that was none of his business; Mr. Hickey’s use of violence in response to a verbal dispute; his knowledge that Mr. Carter was under the influence of alcohol; the degree of force used; and Mr. Hickey’s continued belief that what he did was justified. (R. v. Hickey, paragraph 46)[42]Cacchione, J. concluded that Mr. Hickey’s case “straddled” the Isenor and Henry cases and imposed a three-and-a-half year penitentiary sentence. He emphasized denunciation and general deterrence and held: “It must be understood by the community at large that violence will not be tolerated and that a simple assault can have tragic consequences and serious repercussions.” (R. v. Hickey, paragraph 64)[43]Unlike Mr. Henry, Mr. Isenor, and Mr. Hickey, Jason Whitehead pleaded guilty to committing a one-punch manslaughter. There had been an incident at a downtown bar between the victim’s drunk and aggressive brother and Mr. Whitehead. Outside the bar, Mr. Whitehead walked quickly in the direction of the victim, James Mattatall, and his brother. Mr. Mattatall raised his arms to diffuse the situation. Arnold, J. found that Mr. Whitehead, “fueled by alcohol”, punched Mr. Mattatall once in the face breaking his orbital bones and knocking him to the ground “with such force that he suffered significant trauma to his brain and died.” (R. v. Whitehead, paragraph 42)[44]Arnold, J. found it to be aggravating that Mr. Whitehead had a significant weight and strength advantage over the victim possibly outweighing him by as much as 100 pounds. (R. v. Whitehead, paragraph 42)[45]The Crown in the Whitehead case sought a four year prison sentence. The Defence submitted that two years was appropriate. Taking into account the mitigating factors of Mr. Whitehead’s guilty plea, his acknowledgement of responsibility and expression of remorse, Arnold, J. imposed a three year penitentiary term.[46]Ms. MacKay does not see any similarity between the one-punch manslaughter cases and Ms. Burgess’ unlawful assault of her father. In her submission the following factors differentiate these cases: Ms. Burgess’ unlawful pushing of her father at the top of steep stairs was more objectively dangerous than a single punch in the street where harm but not death was foreseeable; Ms. Burgess’ assault of her father occurred in a private home in contrast to the one-punch cases which happened in public areas where the presence of people meant help would be available; and Ms. Burgess was completely sober whereas Mr. Isenor, Mr. Hickey and Mr. Whitehead had all been drinking. (I note that Mr. Henry was described as “not under the influence of alcohol.” (R. v. Henry, paragraph 3)) In the course of the discussion that follows I address Ms. MacKay’s points.Unlawful Acts that are Objectively Dangerous and the Foreseeability of Life-Threatening Injuries or Death[47]Ms. MacKay provided me with a number of cases that she relies on to support the Crown’s position that Ms. Burgess should be sentenced to eight years in prison. R. v. Cottreau, [2011] O.J. No. 6245 (C.J.) involved the offender giving the victim “a tackle/shove” which the court found had “unpredictable consequences” in that “death was not foreseeable.” (R. v. Cottreau, paragraph 10) Ms. MacKay submits that this “is in stark contrast” to Mr. Burgess being pushed at the top of a steep set of stairs. Mr. Cottreau was sentenced to four years.[48]Several of the other cases provided by Ms. MacKay involved stabbings that resulted in death. In R. v. Kanate, [2011] O.J. No. 5953 (C.J.), Mr. Kanate was originally charged with second degree murder and pleaded guilty to manslaughter during the course of the preliminary inquiry. (R. v. Kanate, paragraph 1) There had been drinking and arguing between Mr. Kanate and the victim which culminated in the victim producing a knife. Mr. Kanate took the knife and stabbed the victim in his left arm above the elbow, severing an artery and causing the victim to bleed to death. In R. v. Reid, [2012] O.J. No. 6313 (S.C.J.), Mr. Reid stabbed his sister’s boyfriend in the abdomen after they had been fighting. Mr. Reid pled guilty to manslaughter following his preliminary inquiry on a charge of second degree murder. In R. v. Sinclair, [2011] A.J. No. 1161, Ms. Sinclair stabbed a close friend in the chest after becoming very angry over her suspicion that the friend had been unfaithful to her fiancé who was Ms. Sinclair’s brother. The Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench observed that stabbing someone in the chest, “objectively assessed…obviously subjects the victim to risk of life-threatening injury.” (R. v. Sinclair, paragraph 14) The court found that the stabbing was spontaneous and impulsive and inferred that Ms. Sinclair “did not subjectively intend to cause [the victim] life-threatening injury.” (R. v. Sinclair, paragraph 16)[49]I understand Ms. MacKay to be saying that Ms. Burgess pushing her father at the top of the steep basement stairs was as objectively dangerous as the stabbings in Reid and Sinclair even though no actual weapon was used. As I have already noted, it is Ms. MacKay’s submission that the one-punch manslaughter cases occur in circumstances that are less objectively dangerous.Assessing a Range of Considerations in Determining Moral Blameworthiness[50]In my trial decision I found that on the evening of July 20, 2011, Mr. Burgess was verbally abusive to Ms. Burgess and likely intoxicated when he returned home from visiting family nearby. (R. v. Burgess, paragraphs 70 and 75) Although Ms. Burgess had enjoyed a positive relationship with her father when she was growing up, once he started drinking again their relationship deteriorated. (R. v. Burgess, paragraphs 49 – 50) Jonathan Burgess’ evidence that Mr. Burgess was capable of name-calling when he was drinking was confirmatory of Ms. Burgess’ claim that she experienced this behaviour while living at home with her parents in 2011.[51]I said the following in my decision:The atmosphere in the Burgess home on July 20, 2011 was tense. Mr. Burgess was drinking which seems to have had the effect of fueling a hostile attitude toward Vanessa. Vanessa has been consistent in describing her father’s treatment of her on July 20 as nasty. She testified to this effect and spoke about it to her brother, in various text messages and in her statements to the police. (R. v. Burgess, paragraph 117)[52]I found the evidence at trial established that Ms. Burgess pushed her father at the top of the basement stairs in “a momentary surge of anger and frustration” because of his “drunken, obnoxious verbal abuse.” She “snapped” and lashed out at him. Referring to one of the texts Ms. Burgess sent on July 21 I found that she had “had enough of his mouth” and pushed him. (R. v. Burgess, paragraph 317) The force she used propelled him to the bottom of the basement stairs where he hit his head and sustained fatal injuries. (R. v. Burgess, paragraphs 315 and 316)[53]I also found that Ms. Burgess did not tell her mother the truth of what had happened until the next morning after they had both left the house. Ms. Burgess told Lynda Burgess on the night of July 20 that Mr. Burgess had “fallen drunk” which I inferred was the reason Mrs. Burgess left her husband at the bottom of the stairs. Ms. Burgess did nothing to ensure that her father was checked out for injuries even though her brother had urged her to call an ambulance. (R. v. Burgess, paragraphs 258 and 303)[54]The evidence at trial led me to conclude that Ms. Burgess did not know her father had been severely injured until later on July 21. By then she had told her mother the truth. Before she knew that Mr. Burgess was in intensive care, Ms. Burgess had texted friends saying she had “thrown” him down the stairs. (R. v. Burgess, paragraph 308) I found that this language “indicates the extent of the force she used” on her father. (R. v. Burgess, paragraph 306)[55]As I said in my trial decision, it was after Ms. Burgess learned her father was in intensive care with grave injuries that she “revised her narrative.” (R. v. Burgess, paragraph 308)Aggravating Factors[56]My trial findings identify a number of aggravating factors:•Ms. Burgess used considerable force against her father in objectively dangerous circumstances at the top of a steep set of stairs;•Ms. Burgess was larger, stronger and sober. Her father was of slight stature and intoxicated;•Ms. Burgess did not do anything to have Mr. Burgess assessed for injuries he might have sustained in such a serious fall, a fall from the top to the bottom of the stairs. She did not tell her mother the truth about how Mr. Burgess had fallen until the next morning after they had both left the house and Mr. Burgess was still at the bottom of the stairs.[57]On this last point - that Ms. Burgess withheld the truth from her mother until the morning of July 21 - while it is a fact that Lynda Burgess did not call 911 even once she learned from her daughter what had actually happened, Ms. Burgess could not have known what her mother might have done if she had been told the truth the night before. The aggravating nature of Ms. Burgess withholding the truth from her mother on the night of July 20 is not diminished by the fact that Lynda Burgess did not call 911 the next morning after her daughter told her what had really happened.[58]The fact that Lynda Burgess ultimately did not obtain help for Mr. Burgess until the late afternoon of July 21 when she returned home from work does not alleviate the responsibility that rested on Ms. Burgess to ensure her father was not injured. Ms. Burgess could have done what her brother urged and called an ambulance right away. The evidence at trial indicated that medical intervention probably would have not have changed the outcome but it would have resulted in Mr. Burgess receiving appropriate care much sooner.What are Not Aggravating Factors[59]The aggravating factors I have identified are amongst the aggravating factors which the Crown has submitted I should take into account. Ms. MacKay describes some additional factors which I do not view as aggravating.[60]Ms. MacKay submits it is also aggravating that Ms. Burgess “was the adult child of the victim, whom the victim had permitted to come back to live in his residence in order to assist her” and adds that “The victim was in his own home, and was entitled to be free from any violence, especially from a member of his own family.” (Written submissions by the Crown dated December 9, 2015)[61]There is no evidence that Ms. Burgess returned to live with her parents harbouring any intention of creating conflict. She accepted their invitation to move back home so that she could get her Grade 12. Although I found the atmosphere was “fraught” and there were “lots of arguments” (R. v. Burgess, paragraph 48), by July 20, 2011 Ms. Burgess had lived with her parents uneventfully for 15 or 16 months. She achieved what she and her parents had hoped for and graduated with her high school diploma. She was planning to move out before the end of the summer.[62]The tragedy of Mr. Burgess’ death happened because of the dynamics in the family home and, ultimately, Ms. Burgess’ inability to control her anger and frustration. I do not find there is any basis for a determination that a manslaughter occurring in a family context is automatically aggravating. I do not find that it would be appropriate to refer to what Ms. Burgess did to her father as a “betrayal” which is language used in R. v. Reid, one of the cases supplied by the Crown.Raymond Reid and his victim, Jesse Low, knew each other well. Mr. Low lived with Mr. Reid’s sister. (R. v. Reid, paragraph 1) At one point when they were fighting before the stabbing, Mr. Reid told Mr. Low: “I love you, we’re family.” (R. v. Reid, paragraph 9) The sentencing court, listing the aggravating factors, included the fact that Mr. Low and Mr. Reid were friends and stated: “Mr. Reid betrayed that friendship when he stabbed Mr. Low.” (R. v. Reid, paragraph 49)[63]I have found that Ms. Burgess pushed her father at the top of the stairs in a spontaneous eruption of anger and frustration. In doing so she committed an unlawful assault that led to his death. The circumstances in Reid were quite different. The fighting between Mr. Reid and Mr. Low that led to Mr. Reid fatally stabbing Mr. Low was apparently over “someone getting lippy.” (R. v. Reid, paragraph 8) The young men were heavily intoxicated and an evenly-matched fight was taken to an entirely different level by Raymond Reid plunging a knife into his friend’s abdomen.[64]A very unhealthy dynamic existed between Ms. Burgess and her father in July 2011. It tragically played itself out in the family home where Ms. Burgess was living temporarily. The significance, as an aggravating factor, of the location of the culpable homicide committed by Ms. Burgess is that there was no one present to assist Mr. Burgess. I have already identified as an aggravating factor that Ms. Burgess did not call an ambulance. I find that to be what is significant about the offence being committed in Mr. Burgess’ home. He was more vulnerable there because there was no opportunity for someone to come to his aid unless Ms. Burgess or her mother called 911. Had an ambulance been called the fact of the assault occurring in a private home rather than the street would not have mattered.[65]I will now review the range of considerations that must be assessed in determining Ms. Burgess’ moral culpability and in doing so address facts that Ms. MacKay has asserted are aggravating.[66]The circumstances to be considered in assessing Ms. Burgess’ moral culpability are: the nature of the unlawful act – a forceful shove or push; the degree of force used by Ms. Burgess – significant, as it propelled Mr. Burgess from the top to the bottom of the stairs; the degree of violence or brutality – it was a single, forceful shove or push; the extent of the victim’s injuries – fatal head injuries consistent with the fall; whether there was gratuitous violence – there was none; the degree of deliberation involved in the act – it was “a momentary surge of anger and frustration”; the complexity of the act – it was a simple push or shove; and the time involved in perpetrating the act – it all happened very quickly.[67]A somewhat more detailed examination is required for the following elements: whether a weapon was used; the extent to which forethought or planning was involved; and the element of chance involved in the resulting death.Whether a Weapon was Used[68]A weapon was not used by Ms. Burgess but as I mentioned earlier in these reasons, Ms. MacKay has argued that the shove at the top of the stairs was as objectively dangerous as the use of a weapon in an unlawful assault. I do not agree. Stabbing someone or beating them severely is a more objectively dangerous and escalated form of violence than what Ms. Burgess did when she pushed her father. It remains true that pushing someone at the top of a steep set of stairs is objectively dangerous. A reasonable person would appreciate that the victim in these circumstances could be badly hurt by the ensuing fall.The Extent to Which Forethought or Planning was Involved[69]In my trial decision I described a telephone call made by David Burgess to his brother-in-law, David Crocker, on the night of July 20. Mr. Burgess told Mr. Crocker that Ms. Burgess had threatened to kill him, he wondered if he should call 911 and was afraid to go to sleep. I found that Mr. Burgess’ statements to Mr. Crocker confirmed that he and Ms. Burgess had been arguing although at the time of the call, the arguing had subsided. Mr. Burgess told Mr. Crocker that Ms. Burgess was “locked” in her room and would not speak to him. (R. v. Burgess, paragraph 291)[70]Ms. MacKay has submitted that the telephone call is “evidence of [Ms. Burgess’] prior animus toward [Mr. Burgess] that day” which constitutes an aggravating factor. I do not agree. While the evidence from the trial does establish that Ms. Burgess and her father were having conflict on July 20 and that in the evening it became heated enough for Ms. Burgess to threaten him, I stated as follows in my decision: “…I do not find that it was ever Vanessa’s intention to hurt or kill her father.” (R. v. Burgess, paragraph 294)[71]I did not find that prior animus played a role in what happened at the top of the stairs. Ms. Burgess shoved her father in circumstances where their arguing had resumed and she reacted in “a momentary surge of anger and frustration…” (R. v. Burgess, paragraph 316) There was no evidence at trial that indicated any forethought or planning by Ms. Burgess even if earlier she had been angry enough to utter a threat.The Element of Chance Involved in the Resulting Death[72]I find there was an element of chance in Mr. Burgess’ death. The chance lies in the uncertain effect of a shove at the top of a set of stairs. An unlawful assault of this nature could propel the victim to the bottom of the stairs as it did in this case but how far the person would fall or how severely he would be injured would depend on how fast he was moving. There is nothing in the medical evidence from the trial to establish that shoving someone at the top of a set of steep stairs would always be fatal.Mitigating Factors[73]Ms. Burgess’ previous good character and lack of a prior record are mitigating factors. She has endeavoured to be a contributing member of the community through her Search and Rescue volunteer work and has been supportive and helpful to her friends. She has shown herself to be a good, reliable employee. She is to be credited for attending counselling sessions through the Elizabeth Fry Society and for maintaining sobriety after a struggle with substance abuse issues.[74]Ms. Burgess’ remorse is also a mitigating factor entitled to some, albeit limited weight. Ms. Burgess is described as remorseful in the pre-sentence report which indicates that she accepts responsibility for her actions and does not rationalize or deny her behaviour. However Ms. Burgess qualified her role by stating: “apparently my push pushed him down the stairs but there was no intent to hurt him. I would never hurt my father. This hurts me a great deal…” As I mentioned earlier in these reasons, she also told the author of the pre-sentence report: “…I am a good person. Something bad happened to me and I am willing to take responsibility for it.” (pre-sentence report, pages 7 and 8) It seems obvious that Ms. Burgess has not fully recognized the extent of her responsibility for her father’s death.[75]Ms. Burgess does not get the mitigating benefit of a guilty plea, a mitigating factor that has been present in some of the cases I have reviewed. She was entitled to go to trial. Her decision to do so is a neutral factor in the sentencing analysis.Provocation[76]A factor I have not yet addressed is provocation. The moral culpability assessment includes, as I noted earlier in these reasons, consideration of “what, if anything, provoked the act.” (R. v. Tower, paragraph 30)[77]In Ms. MacKay’s submission, provocation is not a factor that should be taken into account in this case. At the sentencing hearing she submitted that “Verbal abuse does not rise to the level of legal provocation to operate as a mitigating factor.”By “legal provocation” I believe Ms. MacKay means the provocation that could reduce what was charged as murder to a conviction for manslaughter.[78]I find the provocation that can be taken into account at sentencing does not have to satisfy the criteria for the defence of provocation which may be invoked against a charge of murder. Consideration for the moral culpability assessment of “what, if anything, provoked the act” was given in R. v. Tower, a decision of Wright, J. of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court. In his consideration of what provoked Mr. Tower’s assault of the victim, Wright, J. reiterated a passage from the decision in R. v. Laberge of the Alberta Court of Appeal (R. v. K.K.L., 1995 ABCA 196 (CanLII), [1995] A.J. No. 434, paragraph 23), which was cited with approval by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Stone, 1999 CanLII 688 (SCC), [1999] S.C.J. No. 27, at paragraph 247. In Stone, the Supreme Court held: “In reaching a sentence which accurately reflects a particular offender’s moral culpability, the sentencing judge must consider all the circumstances of the offence, including whether it involved provocation…” (paragraph 234)[79]In a case provided by the Defence, R. v. Simcoe, [2002] O.J. No. 884, a manslaughter sentencing, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that “where the existence of clearly provocative conduct affects the moral culpability of [the offender], that conduct can and should be taken into account when considering the appropriate sentence.” (paragraph 17) That is consistent with the Supreme Court of Canada’s determination in Stone, a second degree murder prosecution where the defence of provocation had been accepted by the jury with the result that they returned a verdict of manslaughter. There is nothing in Stone that limits the application of facts relating to provocation to cases where murder has been reduced to manslaughter. (And I note, there is no indication in Simcoe that it was charged as a murder case and “pled out” as manslaughter.)[80]Provocation is relevant to an offender’s state of mind and is considered in mitigation of sentences in cases where an unlawful assault does not result in death. It is relevant to Ms. Burgess’ state of mind that when she pushed her father, as I have already said, his verbal abuse and their arguing caused her to react in “a momentary surge of anger and frustration.”[81]I found on the trial evidence that Mr. Burgess was intoxicated and verbally abusive prior to being pushed. There was an argument underway between him and Ms. Burgess. (R. v. Burgess, paragraph 295) Ms. Burgess should have left him alone, as she had been doing earlier. She should have left the house or called a friend to come and get her. She should not have given in to her anger and frustration. She should not have resorted to violence. However the evidence established that Ms. Burgess’ violent reaction did not come out of the blue. In no way was she justified in reacting to Mr. Burgess violently but sentencing her must take into account the context in which she shoved him and her state of mind at the time of doing so.Determining the Appropriate Sentence for Ms. Burgess[82]Earlier in these reasons I noted the appellate decision in Myette found that the sentencing range for most manslaughter cases is between four and ten years. In its recent decision of Lacasse, the Supreme Court of Canada had the following to say about sentencing ranges:…Sentencing ranges are nothing more than summaries of the minimum and maximum sentences imposed in the past, which serve in any given case as guides for the application of all the relevant principles and objectives. However, they should not be considered “averages”, let alone straightjackets, but should instead be seen as historical portraits for the use of sentencing judges, who must still exercise their discretion in each case…(R. v. Lacasse, paragraph 57)[83]The Court went on to say that sentencing ranges “must in all cases remain only one tool among others that are intended to aid trial judges in their work.” (R. v. Lacasse, paragraph 69)[84]In employing the tools available to me for crafting Ms. Burgess’ sentence, I find strong parallels between the one-punch manslaughter cases I have referred to and the circumstances of this culpable homicide. And notwithstanding R. v. Berry, [2015] O.J. No. 2002 (S.C.J.) which Mr. Pink referred me to for the proposition that a push involves a “somewhat different” intent than a punch (paragraph 34), I do not find the push Ms. Burgess gave her father to be readily distinguishable from the punches delivered by Mr. Henry, Mr. Isenor or Mr. Whitehead. Those punches propelled the victims to the ground causing their fatal head injuries. Ms. Burgess’ push, delivered in anger, had the same effect.[85]I find that the circumstances of this manslaughter fall, as do many of the one-punch manslaughter cases, neither near the accident nor near the murder end of the moral culpability spectrum but at some mid-point. There is a need to emphasize denunciation and deterrence where, as here, a spontaneous eruption of anger into violence causes a death. A momentary loss of control has had unintended but devastating consequences.[86]I find there are features of this case, discussed in these reasons, that justify a longer sentence than was imposed in Henry, Isenor, and Whitehead, the cases I regard as most comparable having regard for the principles of proportionality and parity. For example, notwithstanding the punishment aspect of the punch delivered by Mr. Henry to Mr. Johnstone, a punch that appears to have been intended to deliver a message and involved deliberation and forethought, I find the circumstances in which Ms. Burgess pushed her father to be more aggravating. I am referring to the fact that, in circumstances where there was no one around to intervene and assist Mr. Burgess once he fell, Ms. Burgess did nothing to have her father assessed for injuries.[87]I do not however regard Ms. Burgess’ actions as similar to those of the offender in Tower, where a conviction for manslaughter produced a five-year prison sentence. (R. v. Tower, paragraph 50) The Crown had argued for 12 years. (paragraph 24) Mr. Tower was described at sentencing as having \"exhibited predatory callousness in his intentional assault on a smaller intoxicated man.\" He chose to act as a neighbourhood enforcer and confront the victim who was causing a ruckus. He used garden shears, described as an \"improvised weapon” to strike the victim on the back with two blows delivered by a baseball swing. This “excessive and unwarranted response to the situation at hand” caused internal injuries that led to the victim’s death. (paragraph 31)[88]I have concluded that the aggravating factors in Ms. Burgess’ case drive her moral culpability above what a three year sentence represents in terms of proportionality. A proportionate sentence for Ms. Burgess has to be greater than three years. However I am satisfied that the mitigating factors in this case and the similarities with the one-punch manslaughter cases bring this case well below the eight year sentence being sought by the Crown. I find that an eight year sentence would be a grossly disproportionate sentence in the circumstances. An eight year penitentiary term does not constitute an appropriate assessment of Ms. Burgess’ moral blameworthiness and all the other factors I have been discussing.[89]Taking into account all the circumstances in this difficult and mercifully uncommon case and the aggravating and mitigating factors, I find that a proportionate sentence for Ms. Burgess is four years in prison. This is a significant sentence by any measure and particularly so for someone who has never been subject to the criminal justice process before. It is a denunciatory and deterrent sentence. It is also a sentence that takes into account the principle of restraint and recognizes the importance of Ms. Burgess’ rehabilitation which cannot be exclusively addressed in the federal penitentiary system. A critical feature of Ms. Burgess’ rehabilitation will be her relationship with her son. She should return to the community while there is still time for her to discharge, for his benefit and hers, a parenting role during his formative years. A sentence of four years properly balances the necessary emphasis on denunciation and deterrence and the essential objective of Ms. Burgess’ rehabilitation. I will refer again to the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Lacasse where the Court said:One of the main objectives of Canadian criminal law is the rehabilitation of offenders. Rehabilitation is one of the fundamental moral values that distinguish Canadian society from the societies of many other nations in the world, and it helps the courts impose sentences that are just and appropriate. (paragraph 4)[90]I will sign the ancillary orders for DNA and a weapons prohibition for life pursuant to section 109.[91]Ms. Burgess’ warrant of committal shall be endorsed with my recommendation to the Correctional Service of Canada that Ms. Burgess receive appropriate mental health counselling for anger and grief and that ongoing access to her son be supported throughout her sentence."}

[orally]: Donald Glenn Ball has pleaded guilty to ten charges of either gross indecency, indecent assault or sexual assault, namely:1. Committing an act of gross indecency on E.W.F., by performing oral sex, contrary to s. 157 of the C.C.C.2. Committing an act of gross indecency on W.B., by fondling his genitals, contrary to s. 149 of the C.C.C.3. By committing an act of gross indecency on W.B., by fondling his genitals, contrary to s. 157 of the C.C.C.4. Committing an act of gross indecency on N.R.S., by fondling his genitals, contrary to s. 157 of the C.C.C.5. Committing an act of gross indecency on D.B., by fondling his genitals, contrary to s. 149 of the C.C.C.6. Committing an act of gross indecency on D.B., by fondling his genitals contrary to s. 157 of the C.C.C.7. Committing an act of gross indecency on B.L.S., by fondling his genitals contrary to s. 157 of the C.C.C.8. Committing an act of gross indecency on L.W.R., by having him perform masturbation, contrary to s. 157 of the C.C.C.[2]The foregoing offences occurred at Port Anson, Newfoundland between 1969 and 1973.[3]En two separate Informations the accused also has the following charges against him which were committed at Stanhope in the Province of Newfoundland, namely:9. That between the 1st day of January, A.D., 1974 and the 31st day of December, A.D., 1980 at or near Stanhope, in the Province of Newfoundland, did unlawfully commit an indecent assault on E.L.C., a male person, thereby committing an offence contrary to s. 156 of the Criminal Code of Canada, and10. That between the 4th day of January, A.D., 1983 and the 31st day of December, A.D., 1983 at or near Stanhope, in the Province of Newfoundland did unlawfully commit a sexual assault on R.C., contrary to s. 246.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada.[4]All the victims were young boys who ranged in age from six to twelve years.[5]Convictions have been entered against the accused on all counts.[6]A publication ban was ordered and remains in effect respecting the publication or broadcasting of any evidence which might lead to the identity of the victims.[7]The facts presented by the Crown, and accepted by counsel for the accused, indicate that Mr. Ball committed the offences at Port Anson while employed there as a young teacher.[8]The offence of gross indecency against E.W.P. involved the accused occasionally bringing the young victim to his office and either performing oral sex on him or having the young boy do the same to the accused.[9]While at Port Anson, Ball was a boarder at the home of W.B. for approximately three years and during this period of time would have W.B. masturbate him at different times or would engage in masturbating the victim or stroking his penis.[10]The facts relating to the offences against N.R.S. and B.L.S. indicate that the accused would keep these boys behind after school and while alone with them would rub or stroke their genital or private areas.[11]The complainant, D.B., was often fondled and masturbated by the accused during the period of time he resided in Port Anson.[12]The facts indicate that L.W.R. was given money by the accused who brought him to an outhouse where he had the complainant masturbate him while he fondled the boy outside his clothing.[13]On more than one occasion R.C. was fondled in the genital area by the accused while the accused masturbated himself.[14]On one occasion the accused placed his hands inside the shorts and on the penis of E.L.C. and on another occasion both of them had their pants down and stroked each other’s penises.[15]No force or violence was used by the accused against his victims in the commission of the offences. However, on occasion Ball told them not to tell anyone of the incidents. At the time of the offences the accused was either the victim’s school teacher or Sunday school teacher and in my opinion, a person in a position of trust to these boys.[16]Ball is a forty–two year old resident of Stanhope, in the Province of Newfoundland. He is married and has three children. Two of these children are teenagers and the third is a ten year old son with a serious illness presently in remission. A positive presentence report indicates that except for the deviant behaviour for which the accused is before the court, Ball is regarded as an excellent father dedicated to his family. His employment history shows he has always been gainfully employed and a good provider for his family. The accused’s behaviour with young boys has cost him employment opportunities in the teaching profession and he has lost his most recent employment as a sales representative because of the charges against him.[17]Although charged with ten offences the accused comes to this court as a first time offender.[18]The presentence report indicates Mr. Ball was himself sexually molested as a young boy.[19]In Victim Impact Statements which were filed B.L.S., N.S. and D.B. expressed the fact that because of the accused’s actions they lost interest in school, were fearful of attending school, and neither victim completed a high school education. W.B. gave evidence that this also happened to him. E.F. expressed his feelings that while a boy he was of the opinion no one cared about him or the actions of the accused, and he has carried this with him into his married life. E.F., B.L.S., N.S. and D.B. all feel over–protective of their own children because of their personal incidents as young boys at the hands of the accused.[20]In determining an appropriate sentence for offences such as this a sentencing court must give consideration to numerous factors which were best enunciated by Goodridge, C.J.N., in R. v. Atkins (K.J.) (1988), 1988 CanLII 201 (NL CA), 69 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 99; 211 A.P.R. 99 (Nfld. C.A.) who stated at p. 103:“There are many factors to be considered in imposing sentence in any case. In cases of sexual assault these factors include the extent of the assault (for sexual assault encompasses a very wide range of human behaviour), the degree of violence or force used, the impact of the crime upon the victim, the family of the victim and the offender, the degree of trust involved, public abhorrence to the type of crime involved, the attitude of the offender to what he has done, his plea, the biological and psychiatric factors that lead to the commission of the offence, the need for specific and general deterrence, the prospect of successful rehabilitation, the antecedents and age of the offender, the time spent in custody prior to trial, and sentences imposed by other courts in Newfoundland and elsewhere in Canada.”[21]Sexual assaults, by their nature, are reprehensible offences. They become more repugnant when committed against young, defenceless children vulnerable to the deviant ways of an adult seeking sexual gratification without thought or care of the emotional harm inflicted on the victim.[22]The actions of the accused against the young boys have varying degrees of seriousness which are aggravated by the number of charges and victims involved over the time span of the offences. I am of the opinion it shows Mr. Ball’s propensity to commit such acts.[23]Children must be protected from this type of behaviour. I concur with the comment of Clarke, C.J., of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in R. v. Wood (1986), 74 N.S.R.(2d) 31; 180 A.P.R. 31, who stated at p. 33:“If defenceless children are to receive some measure of protection, the message must be sent to those who would be inclined to take advantage that such will not be tolerated.”[24]I have considered the sentencing principles which guide a sentencing court, the submissions of counsel, the presentence report together with the Victim Impact Statements and the facts relating to each of the offences.[25]Any mitigating factors in favour of the accused include:1. The guilty pleas of the accused sparing the victims any further pain or aggravation.2. The accused has no previous criminal record.3. The positive presentence report.4. No violence was used in the commission of the offences.5. There was nothing to indicate similar incidents since 1980.6. The accused’s present marital and family status.These mitigating factors have been considered together with all other factors which must guide me in determining an appropriate sentence for the accused. As there were separate acts against different individuals I have determined what I feel to be an appropriate sentence for each offence, giving consideration to the principle of totality. The accused is sentenced to a total period of twenty–three months (23) imprisonment as follows:1. On the charge of gross indecency against E.W.F. the accused is sentenced to eight months (8) imprisonment.2 and 3: On the two charges of gross indecency against W.B. the accused is sentenced to three months (3) imprisonment on each charge, concurrent to each other but consecutive to the previous sentence.4. On the charge of gross indecency against N.R.S. the accused is sentenced to one month (1) imprisonment to be served consecutively.5 and 6. On the two charges of gross indecency against D.B. the accused is sentenced to three months (3) imprisonment on each charge, concurrent to each other but consecutive to the other sentences.7. On the charge of gross indecency against B.L.S. the accused is sentenced to one month (1) imprisonment to be served consecutively.8. On the charge of gross indecency against L.W.R. the accused is sentenced to three months (3) imprisonment to be served consecutively.9. On the charge of indecent assault against E.L.C. the accused is sentenced to two months (2) imprisonment to be served consecutively.10. On the charge of sexual assault against R.C. the accused is sentenced to two months (2) imprisonment to be served consecutively.[26]In addition to the terms of imprisonment that I have imposed I am placing the accused on probation with respect to each indictment for a period of two years from the day of his release from prison on the following terms and conditions:(a) That he keep the peace and be of good behaviour and appear before this court when required to do so.(b) That he report to a Probation Officer within seven days of his release from prison and thereafter as required by the Probation Officer.(c) To accept and be under the supervision of a Probation Officer and to obey his instructions as to the obtaining of any treatment or counselling or the attendance of any group sessions with the goal of providing rehabilitation to reduce the risk of committing future sexual deviant acts.[27]Pursuant to s. 100 of the Criminal Code I am ordering that the accused be prohibited from having in his possession any firearm or any ammunition or explosive substance for a period of five years from today’s date.[28]In view of the accused’s financial circumstances and the term of imprisonment imposed I am satisfied it would be a financial hardship to impose a victim surcharge fine and I am waiving same.[29]The Clerk of the court will ensure that s. 737(4) of the Criminal Code is complied with by causing the Probation Order to be read to the accused and giving him a copy of same. In compliance with s. 740 of the Code I am informing you that any failure to comply with the Probation Order will constitute a separate offence for which a separate charge can be laid. Accused sentenced."}

(orally)This is a Crown appeal against a conditional sentence of two years less one day of imprisonment to be served in the community, plus one year of probation.The sentence was imposed in respect of a conviction under s. 271 of the Criminal Code for a sexual assault upon the respondent's fourteen-year-old step-daughter.The respondent was also convicted of two counts of committing indecent acts, contrary to s. 173(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, one in respect of the same step-daughter and one in respect of her sixteen-year-old cousin.The first sentence was imposed with respect to the sexual assault.Identical sentences were imposed with respect to the indecent acts, but were to be served concurrently with the first.The sexual assault on the step-daughter consisted of rubbing her breasts and genitalia.The indecent acts involved watching pornographic movies in the presence of the girls, inviting them to watch him masturbate, masturbating in front of them, and making related lewd remarks to them.The respondent is 39 years of age.He has spent a good part of his adult life in prison by reason of a fifteen year sentence for manslaughter.He also has convictions for assault causing bodily harm, assault of a police officer, possession of a weapon, violation of mandatory supervision terms, and trafficking in narcotics.The sentencing judge was apparently moved to impose the conditional sentence because the respondent was taking treatment for his antisocial personality disorder, and substance abuse disorder (cannabis and cocaine dependance) which would not be available to him in prison.The judge apparently placed the possibility of rehabilitation of the respondent above all of the other factors usually taken into account in sentencing.I will deal first with the sentence imposed in respect of the conviction under s. 271 of the Criminal Code.The conditional sentence was imposed under the authority of s. 742.1 of the Criminal Code which provides as follows:742.1Where a person is convicted of an offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, and the court(a)imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years, and(b)is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community,the court may, for the purposes of supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions of a conditional sentence order made under section 742.3.Section 742.1 was amended, effective May 2, 1997, by changing subparagraph (b) to read as follows:742.1(b)is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 and 718.2.The effect of the amendment is to codify the law as stated by this Court in R. v. Van de Wiele, (unreported Sask. C.A., 24 January 1997); R. v. McDonald, (unreported Sask. C.A., 5 March 1997) (per Sherstobitoff J.A.), and R. v. Boreen, (unreported Sask. C.A., 3 April 1997), to the effect that a judge, when deciding whether or not to impose a conditional sentence, is required to take into account all of the sentencing purposes and principles contained in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code and not just the safety of the community.In this case, the judge erred in finding, if he so did, that the conditional sentence would not endanger the safety of the community.He did not mention the safety of the community, aside from saying that he was taking \"a calculated and what may be considered a controversial risk\" in imposing the conditional sentence.The pre-sentence report said this:Dr. Blenkinsop advises while [D.W.C.]’ drug use can be controlled and a measure of success can be obtained, there is little satisfactory treatment for [D.W.C.]’ anti-social personality.Dr. Blenkinsop was very clear in his statements to this writer that those with an anti-social personality disorder have little conscience, are difficult to treat, and will throw all caution to the wind in order to obtain immediate gratification despite harming others in the process.Given this information, sex offender treatment may have little or no impact on [D.W.C.]’ thinking.The report of Dr. Blenkinsop himself made clear that it was too early in therapy to give a reliable prognosis, and it concluded with no more than a vague prognosis that the problems created by the personality disorder should be moderated, not cured, and then only if the respondent could stay away from drug abuse:The manifestation of the personality disorder (failure to conform to social norms, deceitfulness, impulsivity, need for instant gratification etc) should be moderated if the substance abuse remains in full remission.This, taken alone, cannot support a finding that the safety of the community would not be endangered by a conditional sentence.This conclusion is reinforced when one considers the background of this respondent and his record.Aside from the safety of the community, the sentence is not proportional to the gravity of the offence as is required by s. 718.1, nor is it adequate to either denounce the offence or deter others from committing like offences as required by s. 718.Finally, it violates the principle of parity stated in s. 718.2(b).The sentence is set aside, and a sentence of two years less one day of imprisonment is substituted therfor.The respondent will have credit for time already served in the community against the sentence; that is to say he will serve two years less one day, less the five months and a fraction already served.The convictions under s. 173(1)(b) of the Criminal Code are summary conviction matters.The appeals should have been taken to a Summary Conviction Appeal Court.With the consent of both counsel, I declare myself to be sitting as a Summary Conviction Appeal Court.The sentences will be set aside for the reasons stated above.Sentences of six months imprisonment on each charge are substituted therefor.The sentences will be served concurrently with each other and concurrently with the sentence imposed for the sexual assault."}

B.K.. On October 31, 2014 Mr. K. was found guilty of the following offences:•One count of sexual assault contrary to s. 271 of the Criminal Code of Canada;•One count of unlawful confinement contrary to s. 279(2) of the Criminal Code;•One count of assault causing bodily harm contrary to s. 267(b) of the Criminal Code;•One count of uttering a threat to cause death contrary to s. 264.1(1)(a) of the Criminal Code;•One count of uttering a threat to damage property contrary to s. 264.1(1)(b) of the Criminal Code; and•One count of theft under contrary to s. 334(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code.[2]On February 3, 2015, I heard sentencing submissions from both Crown and Defence Counsel. I have also received and reviewed written submissions from Crown and Defence Counsel, a Pre-Sentence Report and a Victim Impact Statement.[3]I have now had the opportunity to review and consider all of the information supplied to me and the following is my sentencing decision in this matter.FactsCircumstances of the Offences[4]The circumstances of the offences in question were reviewed in detail in the decision rendered on October 31, 2014.[5]In summary, this proceeding involves a series of events which occurred in the overnight period from January 22 to January 23, 2014. Prior to the offences occurring, the offender and the victim were in a relationship. They had known each other for somewhere between 5-6 years. They had initially been friends, but for 2 years preceding the events in question they had been more than friends. They had an intimate relationship. There was no history of violence in the relationship prior to January 22, 2014.[6]The offender spent some time in jail in the months preceding the offences now before the Court.He was released on or about December 20, 2013 and then moved into the victim’s trailer located at […], […], Nova Scotia.The parties continued to reside together for a number of weeks. At some point in the middle of January, 2014, the offender moved out of the home. The exact nature of this separation was the subject of some dispute but they continued to have contact.[7]On January 22, 2014, the offender was told by a friend that the victim had been cheating on him with her former boyfriend. The offender went to the victim’s home and arrived at about 9:30 in the evening. The events that followed the offender’s arrival that night are the basis for the offences before the court for sentence. The offender readily admitted that he snapped when he saw pictures of the victim and her former boyfriend on the victim’s phone. He began hitting the victim. He admitted to a lack of control of himself during various periods of time over the course of the night. My findings can be largely summarized by the following quotation from the Decision:What I do believe is that the complainant was subject to a violent and volatile environment throughout the night in question. The accused would get mad, lose his temper and hit her. He hit her many times. He inflicted multiple significant injuries.He threatened her when he was hitting her. He would calm down and feel remorse then lose his temper again. In this environment, he took her money and he had sex with her. And it was his evidence that she could have left if she wanted to go.[8]I went on to find that the victim was not free to leave throughout this course of events. She did not have that opportunity until the next morning, January 23, 2014 at about 7:30 am. She fled to a neighboring house. She was then observed to be injured and distraught. She was taken to the hospital and received medical attention. Her numerous injuries were documented and presented to the court during the trial of the matter.Circumstances of the Offender[9]The offender is now 26 years old. He is a young man. He was born in […], Nova Scotia. He has a Grade 12 education. He graduated from […] in […] with a vocational program in […]. He has little work experience. He last worked when he was 20 years old. His plan is to obtain a trade and go west for work.[10]The offender is an only child to his parents. His parents separated when he was 3. In his formative years, he lived with his mother and spent weekends with his father. He says that his basic needs were always met but he did have challenges in his early life. First, he was subject to physical abuse at the hands of his mother’s boyfriend, later step-father. Second, at a young age, the offender was diagnosed with ADD and was followed by a pediatrician. His mother reported that the offender adjusted well in school in spite of his challenges. Third, the offender’s father died about 7 years ago. It would seem that this was a very significant event for the offender. His mother observed behavior problems and negative social influences soon after. He had run-ins with the police. His mother identified that the offender had increasingdifficulty controlling his emotions, particularly his anger. His brother corroborates these observations and adds that the offender began to attract bad people who began to “take advantage” of him after the death of his father. Both the offender’s mother and brother identified the offender’s anger issues as a significant issue. Both expressed concern over the offender’s mental health.[11]The offender says that he has attempted suicide. He admits to recreational drug use in significant quantities but denies any substance abuse issues. He readily admits that many of his closest friends are “known criminals in the drug trade”.He admits that he has a problem with anger. He admits that this contributed to the offences now before the court. He accepts responsibility and expresses remorse for the offences with the exception of the sexual assault. He denies committing a sexual assault.[12]The offender has a significant criminal record. He has previous convictions for offences dating back to January of 2010. Notably, the offences include breaches of court orders, previous threats to cause death or bodily harm, criminal harassment, simple assault, assault with a weapon, assault causing bodily harm and unlawful confinement.[13]He was in custody from December 6, 2011 until December 20, 2013. He was back in custody by January 23, 2014 and has remained there since. Previous to these periods in custody, the offender served a period of probation. Throughout this entire period, the offender has had opportunities to obtain services for substance abuse and anger management but failed to complete any programs. Predictably, he has had disciplinary issues in custody, being disciplined 30 times for breaking facility rules and engaging in confrontations with other offenders. Not surprisingly, the Pre-Sentence report concludes by noting that the offender is a high risk to re-offend unless he takes steps to deal with his issues.[14]More will be said about the offender’s criminal record below.Impact on the Victim or the Community[15]The victim filed a victim impact statement and read the statement during the sentencing hearing. She said that the offences took place during the “most traumatic night of her life” and since that time her life has changed for the worst. She described being in love with the offender and offering her support to him, then feeling betrayed by his violence against her.[16]Following the assaults, the victim said that she continued to go to school for months even with her injuries which included 2 black eyes. With support, she was able to complete the first year of a […] course. After the loss of her father in […], she was unable to cope and couldn’t complete her course. She reports now being terrified to be alone and stressed in every situation. She says that she doesn’t trust anyone and can’t sleep at night. She has dreams of being held captive and being chased for her life. She feels that she will not love again and fears that she will always be a cold person.Legal Parameters[17]As noted, Mr. K. is before the Court today for sentence on multiple offences. The Crown and Defence agree that the most serious of these offences is the sexual assault. The offender in this case is not eligible for a Conditional Sentence Order given the nature of the offences. More will be said about the range of sentences available for the various offences below.Position of the Crown and Defence[18]Both the Crown and Defence agree that the offences before the court will result in a federal custodial sentence.The Defence does not object to the Crown’s request for ancillary orders including a DNA Order, a lifetime weapons ban and a SOIRA order.Beyond that there is disagreement.The Crown Position[19]The Crown takes the position that a global sentence of 6-7 years is appropriate. This is broken down as follows: 3 years for the sexual assault, 2 years consecutive for the assault causing bodily harm, 1 year consecutive for the unlawful confinement and 4 months each for the remaining offences. It further submits that the offences of assault, sexual assault, unlawful confinement and threats were prolonged, significant and degrading and should be considered serious violent offences.[20]The Crown says that the sentence it seeks takes into consideration the totality principle. As set out in the Crown submissions, this position also considers the criminal record of the offender, the circumstances of the offences, including domestic violence, and the sheer nature and number of offences that are before the Court for sentence.The Defence Position[21]On behalf of the offender, it is submitted that a “go forward” sentence of approximately 2 years is appropriate. This sentence is broken down as follows; 2 years for the sexual assault, 1 year consecutive for the assault causing bodily harm with sentences on the remaining offences to be served concurrently.[22]The offender has been on remand for these offences since January 23, 2014. It is acknowledged that this offender was sentenced for other offences on January 8, 2015 and is currently serving an 8 month sentence in relation to those offences.The calculation of remand credit should be limited to the period from January 23, 2014 to January 8, 2015.The parties agree to a 1.5 to 1 remand credit for this period which totals a possible remand credit of 525 days or 1 year, 5 months and 10 days. The Defence says that with a 1.5 remand credit, the total sentence imposed would be just under 3.5 years.Case Law[23]Both the Crown and Defence supplied case law in support of their respective positions. I have now had an opportunity to review the cases provided. Although no two cases are identical, the authorities provided did assist in determining the appropriate sentence in this case.[24]Counsel for the Crown provided an extensive number of cases. I do not intend to review all of them but simply highlight those that were a particular source of guidance.[25]First, in R. v. Howe, 2014 CarswellNS 722, Chief Justice Kennedy sentenced an offender on one count of sexual assault. In my view, the circumstances of that particular case are distinguishable but at paras 7-8, Chief Justice Kennedy concluded:7Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code states that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. Section 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code, a sentence should be similar to the sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.8Let’s be specific about sexual assault, it is difficult to describe a precise sentencing range. Cases bearing similarity to this one suggest that sentences in this province, in Nova Scotia would, even in the absence of a criminal record….would generally not attract less than two years federal time.[26]Chief Justice Kennedy then went on to refer to a number of cases with sentences ranging from 3-5 years depending upon the circumstances.[27]One of the cases relied upon by Chief Justice Kennedy in Howe, supra, was R. v. W. (J.J.), 2012 NSCA 96 (CanLII), 2012 CarswellNS 699. In that case, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal dealt with an offender who had been convicted of 1 count of sexual assault and 2 counts of assault, all in a domestic context. The sentencing judge sentenced the offender to a global sentence of 16 months including a 5 month custodial term in relation to the sexual assault. The offender had no prior record. The Crown appealed and the Court of Appeal found the 5 month sentence demonstrably unfit. A sentence of 2.5 years in custody would have been an appropriate sentence in the circumstances. In so finding, Oland J.A. extensively reviewed the range of sentences for sexual assaults from various jurisdictions and directed at para. 32, in part:32 … Persons convicted of serious sexual assaults must appreciate that the principles of sentencing include specific and general deterrence and denunciation and such offences will attract serious consequences. The five month sentence of imprisonment for sexual assault does not send that message. In my view, considering the principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code, it is clearly unreasonable.[28]In that case, the jurisprudence indicated that a major sexual assault involving intercourse, particularly in the spousal context, mandated a term of imprisonment of at least two years less a day, and frequently a term of between 3 and 5 years. The starting point approach to sentencing was rejected.[29]The decision in R. v. W. (J.J.) was considered by Judge Whalen of the Provincial Court in R. v. Dennis, 2013 CarswellNS 793. In Dennis, supra, case, the offender was convicted of sexual assault against his former spouse as well as a number of other offences including assault. The sexual assault involved 2 separate acts. There was a significant prior criminal record. The offender pled guilty to the offences. Crown counsel relied upon the decision on R. v. W(J.J.), supra,and argued that the appropriate range was from 2 to 5 years for similar offending behavior. Judge Whalen concluded that a fit and just sentence for the sexual assault was 4 years with a 1 year sentence for assault and several 6 month sentences to be served concurrently. In imposing this sentence, Judge Whalen concluded that the sexual assault “offended the core values of society” and that the offender must be deterred. She referred to the decision of Fry, J. in R. v. Kennedy, [2013] N.J. No. 113 (N.L. T.D.) at para. 58:Any sentence imposed must denounce the unlawful conduct and in this case a custodial sentence is required. Deterrence is necessary for two purposes, specifically for the defendant and generally for others who may be tempted to engage in similar behavior. These two sentencing principles have been recognized as the most significant for consideration in sentencing for sexual assault. However, other sentencing principles must also be considered. The message must be sent that society will not tolerate sexual assault.[30]Similar reasons were set out in R. v. Martin, 2014 ONSC 973 (CanLII). In that case, an offender was before the court for sentence on both assault and sexual assault. The offender was 28 years old with an extensive criminal record which included escalating violence. Sentence imposed was 4 years for the sexual assault and 6 months for the assault.S.C. Hill J. reasoned that general deterrence was the dominant sentencing principle as the accused was a recidivist in the use of violence who employed physical force to violate the complainant’s sexual integrity.[31]In R. v. Nelson, 2012 ONSC 4248 (CanLII), an offender was sentenced to 5 years for threatening death or bodily harm, unlawful confinement, sexual assault causing bodily harm and assault with a weapon. The offender was 31 years old with no prior criminal record. This case did not involve a spouse or former spouse.[32]Finally, in R. v. H. (R.), 2012 ONCJ 674 (CanLII), an offender was sentenced to 4 years in custody for assault, assault causing bodily harm and sexual assault on his spouse. In passing sentence, the sentencing judge adopted the following passage from the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada R. v. McGraw, 1991 CanLII 29 (SCC), [1991] S.C.J. No 69 as a powerful reminder of the harm caused to victims of sexual assault. At paragraphs 29-32, Justice Corey said:29It seems to me that to argue that a women who has been forced to have sexual intercourse has not necessarily suffered grave and serious violence is to ignore the perspective of women. For women, rape under any circumstance must constitute a profound interference with their physical integrity. As well, by force or by threat of force, it denies women the opportunity to exercise freedom of choice as to their partner for sexual relations and the timing of those relations. These are choices of great importance that may have a substantial effect upon the life and health of every women. Parliament’s intention in replacing the rape laws with the sexual assault offences was to convey the message that rape is not just a sexual act but is basically an act of violence…30It is difficult if not impossible to distinguish the sexual component of the act of rape from the context of the violence in which it occurs. …Necessarily implied in the act of rape is the imposition of the assailant’s will on the victim through the use of force. Whether the victim is so overcome by fear that she submits or whether she struggles violently is of no consequence in determining whether rape has actually been committed. In both situations, the victim has been forced to undergo the ultimate violation of personal privacy by unwanted sexual intercourse. The assailant has imposed his will on the victim by means of actual violence or the threat of violence.31Violence and the threat of serious bodily harm are indeed the hallmarks of rape. While the bruises and physical results of the violent act will often disappear over time, the devastating psychological effects may last a lifetime. It seems to me that grave psychological harm could certainly result from the act of rape.32The psychological trauma suffered by rape victims has been well documented. It involves symptoms of depression, sleeplessness, a sense of defilement, the loss of sexual desire, fear and distrust of others, strong feelings of guilt, shame and loss of self-esteem. It is a crime committed against women which has dramatic, traumatic impact…To ignore the fact that rape frequently results in serious psychological harm to the victim would be a retrograde step, contrary to any conceptof sensitivity in the application of the law.[33]In its submission, Defence counsel relied upon the sentencing range set out in R. v. W. (J.J.), supra. Two further decisions were submitted as support for the offender’s position on sentence. First, theCourt was provided with the decision of Judge Tax of the Provincial Court of Nova Scotia in R. v. Lemoine, 2014 NSPC 49 (CanLII). However, I find this decision distinguishable from the present case in many respects, principally due to the fact that it involved a sexual assault by a stranger but also due to the fact that the offender in that case had no prior criminal record. I find the decision of Chief Justice Kennedy in R. v. Wournell, 2014 NSSC 305 (CanLII) distinguishable for similar reasons.[34]Having reviewed the authorities submitted by the parties, I conclude that the appropriate sentencing range for sexual assault is anywhere from 2 to 5 years but typically 3 to 5 years depending upon the relevant circumstances, and the weight to be given to the sentencing objectives and principles.Principles of Sentencing[35]The purpose and principles of sentencing are found at s. 718 of the Criminal Code. As codified in s. 718, the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions. The sanctions imposed should have one or more of the following objectives:(1)To denounce unlawful conduct;(2)To deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(3)To separate offenders from society when necessary;(4)To assist in rehabilitating offenders;(5)To provide reparations to victims or the community; and(6)To promote a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and the community.[36]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code provides that the sentence imposed must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. Section 718.2 codifies additional sentencing principles and, among other things, obligates the sentencing judge to increase or reduce a sentence to account for any aggravating or mitigating factors relating to the offence or offender.Section 718.2(a)(ii) specifically deems it an aggravating factor when there is “evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s spouse or common-law partner.”[37]The totality principle must be considered when imposing sentence for multiple offences.[38]In R. v. Field, 2013 NSPC 51 (CanLII), 2013 NSPC 51 (N.S.Prov. Ct.), Derrick J. states at para. 2:2My task is to determine the appropriate sentence for Mr. Field. Sentencing is a “profoundly subjective process.” (R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] S.C.J. No. 52, paragraph 46) Determining “a just and appropriate sentence is a delicate art” which requires a careful balancing of “the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence…” (R v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] S.C.J. No 28, paragraph 91) An appropriate sentence cannot be determined in isolation. Regard must be had to all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender. (R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2010] S.C.J. No.6 paragraph 44) It is a “profoundly contextual” process in which the sentencing judge has broad discretion. (R. v. L.M., 2008 SCC 31 (CanLII), [2008] S.C.J. No. 31, paragraph 15) That discretion is structured of course, by how the various sentencing objectives are to be weighed for certain offences….Mitigating and Aggravating Factors[39]I move now to a consideration of the mitigating and aggravating factors.[40]Having heard and considered all of the relevant evidence as to the offender’s sentence, I consider the following to be aggravating factors:(a)The offender assaulted a former intimate partner in her own home. In doing so, he breached a position of trust and committed an offence against the core values of society. Perhaps more importantly however, the offender harmed the victim’s sense of safety and security in her own home, and left her with both physical and psychological trauma;(b)The offender has accumulated a serious criminal record of related and progressively serious offences. The offender’s criminal record shows a disturbing pattern of escalating violence against intimate partners.(c)The Presentence Report is troubling. It indicates that the offender has anger management issues, possible substance abuse issues and underlying mental health challenges. All of these unresolved issues contribute to the offender’s recidivism. The offender has had prior opportunities to obtain treatment and manage these risk factors but he has been intransigent about taking advantage of the opportunities made available to him. Without support, he poses a high risk to reoffend.[41]I consider the following to be mitigating circumstances:(a)The offender has taken responsibility for most of his actions and exhibits remorse, the notable exception being the offence of sexual assault; and(b)The offender is a young man and the prospect of rehabilitation cannot be abandoned;Reasons[42]Having reviewed all of the foregoing, the issue remains – what is a fit and proper sentence to impose on Mr. C. K.?[43]The offender in this case remains a young man. His life to this point exhibits challenges. He endured the separation of his parents as a young child and abuse from a step-father during his formative years. He was diagnosed with ADD but persisted and completed his education. He had love and support in his early life and he was able to overcome his challenges. He developed a plan for further education and employment.[44]Unfortunately, the offender’s path was interrupted. I find that a significant event in the life of the offender was the death of his father. In the wake of this loss, the offender began to have difficulty with his relationships, he attracted negative influences, he was increasingly challenged by his anger and there were signs of unresolved mental illness. He developed a dependence on substances which he began to use in significant amounts. He developed friendships with those who would take advantage of him. Not surprisingly, he came into conflict with the law.[45]As he comes before the Court today for sentence, I am mindful of the offender’s path to this point. He is only 26 years old. The period of time since the death of his father has been a troubled and troubling one. But his age requires that serious consideration be given to the possibility that he can get his life back on its original track and that he can one day be a productive member of society with healthy relationships in his life. In order to do this, he will have acknowledge his barriers to rehabilitation. He will have to be open to treatment for his anger and substance abuse. There is some indication that he is ready to do this now. I must say however, given his recent history, including his disciplinary history during remand, that I am less than persuaded that he is ready to embrace these opportunities.[46]This brings me to the dominant considerations in the present case. The offender has a serious criminal record. It is a related history of escalating violence toward his partners and general disrespect for the law. In combination with the absence of any meaningful efforts to deal with anger issues and substance abuse, he is presently a high risk to re-offend. In short, he is a danger to women.[47]This offender has failed to respond in a productive way to some of his previous sentences. He has failed to avail himself of prior opportunities to rehabilitate himself. Rather than learn from his previous mistakes, his behavior has further deteriorated. He has graduated from violence, abuse and intimidation to sexual violence. This is a serious escalation.Moreover, the evidence suggests that this offender continues to lack insight into the very serious nature and consequences of his behavior toward women. All of this mandates that the court focus on a sentence that achieves denunciation, deterrence and separation from society.[48]Such a focus is further supported by the very nature of the offences before the Court for sentence. They are despicable acts of a man that admittedly could not control his rage. He assaulted a women who had once his greatest source of love and support. This women has now been victimized. She suffered physically and her emotional trauma endures. The Court must condemn this behavior is strong terms. Intimate partners and trust relationships cannot be the subject of dominance and violence.[49]I am persuaded that a fit and proper sentence for this offender is one in which the goals of deterrence (both general and specific) and denunciation dominate but which also affords the offender the opportunity to change his life if he is open to such a course.[50]This sentencing involves multiple offences all of which occurred in the period between 9:30 pm on January 22, 2014 and 7:30 am on January 23, 2014. Although the offender attributes most or all of his behavior to a fit of rage, I find that separate and distinct offences occurred throughout the period. I am mindful of the totality principle as I impose the following sentences:Final Decision[51]For the offence of sexual assault, the sentence shall be 3 years;[52]For the assault causing bodily harm, the sentence shall be 1 year which shall be served consecutively to the sentence for sexual assault;[53]For the offence of unlawful confinement, the sentence shall be 1 year, to be served concurrently to the sentence for sexual assault;[54]For the offence of threat to cause death, the sentence shall be 6 months to be served consecutively;[55]For the offence of threat to damage property, the sentence shall be 6 months concurrent; and[56]For the offence of theft, the sentence shall be 6 months concurrent.[57]The total custodial sentence imposed is therefore 4.5 years. It is my hope that this sentence balances the need to give effect to the dominant sentencing objectives with a sentence length that doesn’t crush the prospect of rehabilitation.[58]I am prepared to allow a 1.5 remand credit to January 8, 2015 which results in remand credit of 525 days. I calculate the remaining custodial sentence for these offences to be 3 years and 23 days.This sentence shall commence with the expiry of the offender’s current sentence.Ancillary Orders[59]The Crown seeks a number of ancillary orders and I am prepared to grant those orders.Gogan, J."}

Jones, 2008 NSCA 99Date: 20081022Docket: CAC 286990Registry: HalifaxBetween:Robert Paul JonesAppellantv.Her Majesty the QueenRespondentJudge(s):Roscoe, Bateman \u0026 Hamilton, JJ.A.Appeal Heard: September 12, 2008, in Halifax, Nova ScotiaHeld:Leave to appeal granted, but appeal dismissed per reasons for judgment of Hamilton, J.A.; Roscoe and Bateman, JJ.A. concurringCounsel:Christopher Manning, for the appellantSusan Y. Bour, for the respondentReasons for judgment:[1]The appellant, Robert Paul Jones, applies for leave, and if granted, appeals his ten year sentence that was imposed following his guilty pleas.Of his ten year total sentence, he received six years concurrent on each of the drug offences, conspiracy to traffic in cocaine (s.465(1)(c) Criminal Code), conspiracy to traffic in ecstasy (s.465(1)(c) Criminal Code) and possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking (s.5(2) Controlled Drugs and Substances Act), three years for living off the avails of prostitution (s.212(1)(j) Criminal Code), consecutive, and one year for assault (s.266 Criminal Code), consecutive.The ten year sentence was reduced by eight months in recognition of four months he spent provincially on remand.[2]The facts relating to this appeal are set out in the decision of Cacchione, J., reported at 2007 NSSC 309 (CanLII), [2007] N.S.J. No. 428, 258 N.S.R. (2d) 339.Briefly, the appellant and Cecil Hatch roughly shared the spot of second in command in a 24/7 dial-a-dope and crack house operation headed by Richard Bonin.The judge found their function in the operation was to ensure a vehicle was available to transport the drugs, that persons were available to man the vehicle and the phone that went with the vehicle.The appellant arranged for others, including his girlfriend, a young person and an older woman with no prior criminal record, to sell, transport, deliver and hide drugs and money for him.The judge found the appellant was not an addict and was involved in the well planned business solely for profit.[3]The appellant’s girlfriend was actively employed as a prostitute in Niagara Falls under the direction of the appellant.She deposited money directly into his bank account.The assault charge arose from an event where he struck her on the head with a gun which caused her injuries that required medical attention at the hospital.[4]Mr Hatch was sentenced prior to the appellant and Mr. Bonin was sentenced subsequently.Mr Hatch was sentenced for the same three drug offences among other offences.He received five years incarceration concurrent for each drug offence.Mr. Bonin was sentenced for conspiracy to traffic cocaine and possession for the purpose of trafficking cocaine among other offences.He received concurrent sentences of ten and one-half years for each of these drug offences.[5]In reaching his decision the judge considered the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code and the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, including the relevant mitigating and aggravating factors, and concluded that the factor to be stressed in sentencing the appellant was the protection of the public given the nature of these offences and the length and nature of the appellant’s criminal record.[6]The appellant argued: (1) that his sentence should be reduced because the judge erred by failing to properly apply the sentencing principles of parity and totality; or (2) that his sentence should be vacated and a new sentencing ordered because a reasonable apprehension of bias arose from the judge’s sentencing him after he had heard a bail application involving Mr. Bonin over one and one-half years earlier.[7]I will first deal with the alleged errors.[8]Section 687(1) of the Criminal Code sets out the jurisdiction of this Court with respect to sentence appeals:s.687(1) Where an appeal is taken against sentence, the court of appeal shall, unless the sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against, and may upon such evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to receive:(a) vary the sentence within the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the accused was convicted; or(b) dismiss the appeal.[9]Appellate courts must show great deference in reviewing decisions of trial judges where appeals against sentence are concerned and should only intervene where the sentence imposed is demonstrably unfit; R. v. L.M., 2008 SCC 31 (CanLII), [2008] S.C.J. No. 31, 2008 S.C.C. 31, ¶ 14 and 15.[10]Justice Bateman recently explained the standard of review on sentence appeals in R. v. Metzler, [2008] N.S.J.No. 124:[24]Sentences are afforded a deferential standard of review on appeal.This has been articulated in a number of ways.In R. v. C.A.M., 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500; S.C.J. No. 28 (Q.L.), Lamer, C.J.C., for a unanimous Court, said:[90]Put simply, absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit.Parliament explicitly vested sentencing judges with a discretion to determine the appropriate degree and kind of punishment under the Criminal Code ...[91]. . . The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which attempts to balance carefully the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence, while at all times taking into account the needs and current conditions of and in the community.The discretion of a sentencing judge should thus not be interfered with lightly.[11]This is the standard I will apply in considering the appellant’s argument that the judge erred by failing to properly apply the sentencing principles of parity and totality.[12]The appellant pointed to Mr. Hatch’s five year sentences for the same offences, as compared to his six year sentences, in support of his argument that the judge failed to properly apply the parity principle embodied in s.718.2(b) of the Criminal Code requiring similar sentences to be imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.[13]He also argued that the principle of parity was not properly applied because Mr. Bonin, the head of the operation, will spend less time post-sentencing in jail than he will because of the credit Mr. Bonin received for the time he spent in jail on remand prior to his sentencing.[14]These arguments have no merit.As the appellant acknowledged, differences in the level of involvement of the various offenders and differences in their criminal records can justify different sentences even if they have been convicted of the same offences; R. v. Price (2000), 2000 CanLII 5679 (ON CA), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 343 (Ont. C.A.),¶ 55.[15]There were significant differences between the criminal records of the appellant and Mr. Hatch.The appellant had thirty-nine prior convictions including possession for the purpose of trafficking in 2003.Mr. Hatch had thirteen prior convictions most of which were property offences.In addition the sentence imposed on Mr. Hatch was the result of a joint recommendation after a very early guilty plea and before preliminary inquiry which was not the case for the appellant.The difference in the sentences imposed are rationally explicable and do not offend the principle of parity.[16]With respect to Mr. Bonin, it is the ten and one-half year sentences that are to be compared, not the time he will spend in jail post-sentencing as a result of the substantial time he spent on remand prior to sentencing.Considering that Mr. Bonin’s sentence was four and one-half years longer than the appellant’s in recognition of his being the head of the operation, that six of his ten prior criminal convictions were for drug offences and that his sentence was also the result of a joint recommendation, the difference in the sentences is supportable and does not offend the principle of parity.[17]The appellant also argued that the judge erred by failing to properly apply the principle of totality provided for in s.718.2(c) of the Criminal Code:718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:. . .(c) where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;[18]The appellant argued that while his sentences for each individual offence were fit, they were at the high end of the range and taken together in light of the totality principle should have resulted in a lower sentence.[19]In R. v. C.A.M., 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] S.C.J.No.28, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, the Supreme Court of Canada stated:42In the context of consecutive sentences, this general principle of proportionality expresses itself through the more particular form of the \"totality principle\". The totality principle, in short, requires a sentencing judge who orders an offender to serve consecutive sentences for multiple offences to ensure that the cumulative sentence rendered does not exceed the overall culpability of the offender. As D. A. Thomas describes the principle in Principles of Sentencing (2nd ed. 1979), at p. 56:The effect of the totality principle is to require a sentencer who has passed a series of sentences, each properly calculated in relation to the offence for which it is imposed and each properly made consecutive in accordance with the principles governing consecutive sentences, to review the aggregate sentence and consider whether the aggregate sentence is \"just and appropriate\".Clayton Ruby articulates the principle in the following terms in his treatise, Sentencing, supra, at pp. 44‑45:The purpose is to ensure that a series of sentences, each properly imposed in relation to the offence to which it relates, is in aggregate \"just and appropriate\". A cumulative sentence may offend the totality principle if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of a sentence for the most serious of the individual offences involved, or if its effect is to impose on the offender \"a crushing sentence\" not in keeping with his record and prospects.[20]It is clear the judge considered the totality principle in sentencing the appellant.He referred to it three times in his decision:[18] As I said, I do give you the benefit of the doubt that this contact with your daughter has perhaps opened your eyes a little and that you do hope to change your ways. So I have reduced the sentence based on this fact and the totality principle. But there still must be a message sent to others and a message must be sent to you as well so that you do not lose sight of it that this type of behaviour just will not be tolerated.. . .[23] The common assault, although it is a common assault, at least a plea was entered, there is evidence before me that it was a serious assault, an assault that required some degree of hospitalization.Not a lengthy stay, but some degree.The fact that this was your girlfriend or common law partner and the fact that you used a weapon, a pistol to beat her, shows the severity of that particular offence.There will be a one year consecutive sentence for the assault on Diane Acker.And I have said, I have considered totality.[24] I told you before the sentence I had in mind was lengthier, but given the principle of totality, your pleas of guilty, I have decided that the fit and proper sentence for all of these offences is a global sentence of ten years incarceration.(Emphasis added)[21]The appellant has not satisfied me that the judge erred in applying the totality principle.His decision makes it clear he considered it and reduced the total sentence he imposed based on that principle.The cumulative sentence is not substantially above the normal level of a sentence for the most serious of the individual offences involved, nor is its effect such as to impose on the appellant \"a crushing sentence\" not in keeping with his record and prospects.[22]The appellant’s final argument was that his sentence should be vacated and a new sentencing ordered because a reasonable apprehension of bias arose from the judge sentencing him after the judge had conducted Mr. Bonin’s two day bail application one and one-half years earlier and denied bail, which was unknown to the appellant at the time of sentencing.[23]He argued that a reasonable apprehension of bias arose from the fact he was not told that the judge had heard Mr. Bonin’s bail application, that he did not know what intercepted communications were heard by the judge at Mr. Bonin’s bail hearing, what might have been said about him at that bail hearing or what use the judge made of information before him at the bail hearing in sentencing him.[24]The respondent dealt with this issue in it’s factum:61.There is a strong presumption that judges will carry out their oath of office to render justice impartially. The fact that a trial judge may have previously heard prejudicial evidence in a similar proceeding, such as a bail hearing or a voir dire, does not in itself result in a reasonable apprehension of bias. R. v. S.(R.D.), supra at paras. 117.R. v. Perciballi (2001) 2001 CanLII 13394 (ON CA), 154 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont. C.A.), aff'd (2002) 2002 SCC 51 (CanLII), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 480 (S.C.C.) 51.62.In R. v. Perciballi, supra, the defence alleged that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias after a wiretap authorization was granted by a judge who had previously presided over an unsuccessful bail review brought by one of the accused parties five weeks earlier. The defence argued that the judge was biased because he had earlier heard \"prejudicial evidence\" on the bail review that was not part of the authorization package, and that he had made \"strong comments\" about the strength of the case in his reasons for dismissing the bail review. The application, characterized as a Charter application, failed. Justice Charron (as she then was) explained the principles of the law:[17] There is no allegation of actual bias in this case. The issue is one of reasonable apprehension of bias. The onus of demonstrating bias is on the person who alleges it. The Supreme Court of Canada recently affirmed the test for finding a reasonable apprehension of bias in R. v. S. (R.D.) 1997 CanLII 324 (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484, 118 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.) at para. 111 [pp. 530-31 S.C.R.]. Cory J., in writing the majority judgment for the court, stated as follows:The manner in which the test for bias should be applied was set out with great clarity by de Grandpré J. in his dissenting reasons in Committee for Justice and Liberty v. Canada (National Energy Board), 1976 CanLII 2 (SCC), [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369 at p. 394, [68 D.L.R. (3d) 716]:[T]he apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. . . .[The] test is “what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically – and having thought the matter through – conclude.”This test has been adopted and applied for the past two decades. It contains a two‑fold objective element: the person considering the alleged bias must be reasonable, and the apprehension of bias itself must also be reasonable in the circumstances of the case. See Bertram, supra, at pp. 54‑55; Gushman, supra, at para. 31. Further the reasonable person must be an informed person, with knowledge of all the relevant circumstances, including “the traditions of integrity and impartiality that form a part of the background and apprised also of the fact that impartiality is one of the duties the judges swear to uphold\": R. v. Elrick, [1983] O.J. No. 515 (H.C.J.), at para. 14. See also Stark, supra, at para. 74; R. v. Lin, [1995] B.C.J. No. 982 (S.C.), at para. 34 [summarized 27 W.C.B. (2d) 199].[18] Cory J. also stated that there is a presumption that judges will carry out their oath of office. He noted at para. 117 [P. 533 S.C.R.] that \"[t]his is one of the reasons why the threshold for a successful allegation of perceived juridical bias is high. However, despite this high threshold, the presumption can be displaced with 'cogent evidence' that demonstrates that something the judge has done gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.\"Charron J.A. then rejected the defence argument:[21] In my view, there is no reason to interfere with the trial judge's decision on this Charter application. The mere prior involvement of the authorizing justice in an earlier proceeding does not, without convincing evidence to the contrary, displace the presumption of judicial integrity and impartiality. Hence, the bare allegation that Hamilton J. heard \"prejudicial evidence\" on the bail review that did not form part of the authorization package is meaningless. Trial judges routinely exclude evidence that they have heard on a voir dire, or hear confessions or guilty pleas by co‑accused, and go on to preside over the trial of an accused.[22] Further, there is nothing inherent in the nature of the decision that must be made on either application ‑ the bail review or the wiretap authorization ‑ that gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias where the same justice presides over both proceedings. Although it is necessary in each proceeding to make an assessment of the evidence presented by the prosecution, the tests are very different and their application does not require any determinative findings on the guilt or innocence of an accused person. The allegation of bias must be based, rather, on what actually transpired during the specific proceedings.(Emphasis in respondent’s factum).R. v. Perciballi, supra at paras 17‑22.63.Even where an accused has appeared before the same judge in previous cases, and where adverse findings of credibility have been made against the accused, there may be no reasonable apprehension of bias; See R. v. Novak (1995) 1995 CanLII 2024 (BC CA), 59 B.C.A.C. 152 (B.C.C.A.) at paragraphs [7] to [10]. R. v. Bolt 1995 ABCA 22 (CanLII), [1995] A.J. No. 22 (Alta. C.A.). R. v. G.H. 2002 CanLII 49363 (ON CA), [2002] O.J. No. 3635 (Ont. C.A.) at paragraphs [6] to [8]).(Emphasis added)[25]Mr. Bonin’s bail application took place more than one and one-half years prior to the appellant’s sentencing.The sole focus of the judge at the bail application was whether Mr. Bonin should be released from jail pending trial.He would not have made any other findings with respect to him.The sentencing followed the appellant’s guilty plea and was based on the statement of facts in the respondent’s brief and viva voce evidence to supplement it.The judge made no comments at the sentencing hearing about credibility or the strength of the case. If the judge remembered Mr. Bonin’s bail hearing after such a long time, he made no mention of it or of any extraneous matters at the appellant’s sentencing.[26]The case law is clear that the mere fact that a judge heard another related matter is not sufficient to disqualify a sentencing judge.The appellant has not met the threshold of presenting cogent or substantial evidence required to establish a real likelihood of a reasonable apprehension of bias.There was nothing but bare speculation that the sentencing judge's prior dealing with Mr. Bonin would have had any effect on his impartiality and ability to preside fairly and impartially over the sentencing hearing. There is nothing requiring the intervention of this Court.[27]I would grant leave but dismiss the appeal.Hamilton, J.A.Concurred in:Roscoe, J.A.Bateman, J.A."}

Moore....................................................................................................................for the CrownR. McDonald............................................................................................................for the accusedCOLE J.:ISSUE[1]What is the appropriate custodial sentence to be imposed on an offender who has intercourse with an unconscious woman?FACTS[2]After hearing the evidence adduced by the Crown at a preliminary inquiry, the offender entered a plea of guilty before me to a charge that on July 1, 2008, he sexually assaulted M.H. Counsel agreed that the facts described by the Crown witnesses could be applied to support the plea of guilty.[3]By way of background, the complainant described that on April 18, 2008 – some 2 ½ months before the date of the offence under consideration here - she, the accused and other friends had gone to a club to celebrate her birthday; at the end of the evening, all had returned to her apartment, whereupon she went to sleep. She awoke a little while later to find the accused kissing her and trying “to pull my shirt up”. She screamed at him and ordered him to stop and to leave her apartment. She did not see him again until the evening of June 30-July 1, 2008.[4]On the evening of June 30, 2008 the complainant and several of her friends went to a nightclub. While enjoying themselves there, the complainant coincidentally met the accused. He approached her to apologize for his behaviour a few weeks before. He blamed his alcohol consumption for his improper advances to her.[5]Apparently the complainant forgave the offender, because she invited him and several of her friends to accompany her back to her apartment after the nightclub closed. The friends continued to drink, listen to music and “hang out” at the apartment. Though the complainant said that she was “sober” when she left the nightclub, she agreed that she consumed several drinks at the apartment, to the point where – though she has little memory of this – her friends put her in her bed and left her “to sleep it off”. She had no memory of anything else that happened to her until she woke up the next morning.[6]Because of the complainant’s lack of memory about what happened in the apartment, the remaining evidence came from some of her friends. They testified that after they put her in her bed, and closed her bedroom door, they checked on her from time to time. At one point one of the witnesses noticed that the offender was not in the living room, so he checked to see if he was in the bathroom. When he could not find him he decided to check the complainant’s bedroom. He opened the door to find the offender in her bed, on top of the complainant, apparently having intercourse. He told the offender to stop, which he refused to do; in fact, he asked the witness if he “wanted some too”. The offender only desisted after he climaxed. He then got dressed and left the apartment.[7]All witnesses agreed that the offender had consumed alcohol both at the club and at the apartment, though some said that he did not seem particularly intoxicated. (Through counsel, the offender also claimed that he had ingested cocaine at some point that evening). By his plea, the offender conceded that when he was discovered in the bedroom, he had penetrated the complainant; he also admitted through counsel that he was not wearing a condom during intercourse.POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES[8]Counsel were in agreement that a custodial sentence should be imposed. Where they differed was on the length of the custodial term. Crown counsel proposed that a sentence of either two years or two years less a day should be imposed. Defence counsel argued that a sentence of eight months would adequately address the various principles of sentencing I must balance.[9]Both counsel were in agreement that a term of probation should be imposed, to commence on the expiry of the custodial sentence. They also agreed that I should make a series of ancillary orders - a “weapons prohibition”, an order for the provision of a DNA sample, and registration of the offender on the federal sex offender registry (SOIRA).BACKGROUND OF THE OFFENDER[10]Before describing the contents of the Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) prepared for my assistance, there are two matters that I consider appropriate to dispose of from the outset.[11]The first is that while the offence date was July 1, 2008, the guilty plea was not entered until some 28 ½ months later. Crown counsel says that this disentitles the offender to make any claim for a reduction in sentence on the basis of an early guilty plea. While I entirely agree with Crown counsel that this would normally be the case, the reasons for the delay require some further explanation. By coincidence, I happened to be presiding many months ago in a court to which apparently delinquent accused are referred when they seem to be taking an inordinate amount of time to retain counsel. Mr. Laz-Martinez was referred to my court for that reason. When I queried him, he indicated that because his financial situation was fluid as he went in and out of a series of part-time jobs, Legal Aid Ontario was refusing to grant him a legal aid certificate. He produced documentation to this effect. I decided to seize myself with that aspect of his case to monitor his progress. I soon satisfied myself through his presentation of documents that he was not malingering in his efforts to obtain counsel. While it took a very long time for him to get matters straightened around with Legal Aid Ontario, defence counsel came “on board” as soon as a certificate was granted. Unfortunately, all of this further delayed the process of setting a date for a preliminary inquiry. Notwithstanding these very regrettable delays, in a matter as serious as this, I am certainly not going to penalize an accused person who experiences difficulty in retaining counsel. I thus disagree with Crown counsel that this fact alone disentitles the offender to consideration for a reduction in sentence because of his failure to enter a guilty plea early in the proceedings.[12]Crown counsel’s second argument was that it was not until after the evidence had been heard at the preliminary inquiry that the accused decided to change his plea to guilty. She said that this further disqualifies the offender from any sentence reduction, on two bases. She first asked me to keep in mind that the offender’s insistence on his right to hear the evidence tendered against him at a preliminary inquiry further delayed the “day of reckoning”. Defence counsel responded to this argument by suggesting that because his client’s position was that he had consumed considerable quantities of both alcohol and drugs, he was not at all clear as to what had happened that evening, and he therefore needed to hear the evidence of the Crown witnesses before he could make an informed decision about changing his plea to guilty. As soon as he satisfied himself that the evidence given under oath confirmed what he anticipated would be forthcoming from the disclosure, he instructed counsel that he withed to enter a plea of guilty to the charge.[13]I think both counsel have some support for their positions on this branch of Crown counsel’s argument. Unless there were quite unexpected differences between what the defence received by way of disclosure of witness statements and their actual evidence – and I have not heard anything on point – the evidence of the various witnesses who testified could easily have been anticipated by the accused. The witnesses who were called to testify seemed to have no particular animus towards the accused; from what I was able to tell, they gave their evidence fairly and objectively. Having said this, of course any accused person is fully entitled to hear the case against him before entering a plea of guilty; after all, this is one of the purposes of a preliminary inquiry. While I am prepared to allow the offender some reduction of sentence by way of recognition of the importance of his plea of guilty, in my judgment, he loses some entitlement to a further reduction for an “early” plea.[14]Crown counsel also argued that the position taken by the accused meant that the complainant was required to testify, which likely added to her trauma. I did not call on defence counsel to respond to this argument. Given that the complainant testified that she had no recollection of the sexual assault – which was presumably known to Crown counsel before she testified -I have little idea what she added to the Crown’s case when she was called as a witness for the Crown at the preliminary inquiry. If Crown counsel called her as a witness to confirm that fact, it was something that the Crown felt she needed to do to buttress her case; with respect, unless there was something I was not told, it seemed unnecessary to call the witness for any other purpose. In any event, it was clear that the defence did not insist that this witness be called. The defence has no control over which witnesses the Crown elects to call.[15]The Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) discloses that offender is 32 years of age. He has a very minor record – one conviction in 2002 for failing to comply with the terms of a bail order – which seems irrelevant for current purposes. Born in Guatemala, he was raised in Canada, and appears to have lived in the Toronto area since he was a young child. He was not successful at school, and joined the workforce in his late teens. He was employed as a welder for several years, and now works as a self-employed sub-contractor for renovation work.[16]The laying of this criminal charge seems to have had a salutary effect, in that it seems to be one of the factors that has persuaded the offender that he needs to moderate his pattern of alcohol consumption. His mother reported to the writer of the PSR that she and other family members urged the offender for many years to reduce or cease his excessive drinking, but that he was not very receptive to this advice. The offender conceded that in the past “he would go out on weekends with friends on a regular basis and that he would often consume significant amounts of alcohol and that this use would lead to his ‘passing out and not remembering much later’”. His mother notes that since (a) the offender has been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes (b) he has changed his pattern of friendships and his circle of friends (c) he has become involved in a serious romantic relationship, and (d) he has been charged with this offence, he has significantly reduced his alcohol consumption.[17]The offender has been romantically involved and living with Ms Sonia Marroquin for about the past two years. She reported to the writer of the PSR that she agrees with the offender’s mother that the offender’s alcohol consumption has “subsided considerably” since he has distanced himself from his previous peer group. However, she remains convinced that he could benefit from alcohol abuse counselling because she has seen occasions when he has either become angry or sexually inappropriate while intoxicated. (The victim of this offence reported to the writer of the PSR that she too has seen instances where the offender would get into fights at bars or clubs while intoxicated).[18]As previously indicated, as part of his guilty plea, the offender admitted through counsel that he had consumed cocaine on the night he violated the victim. (Interestingly, he told the writer of the PSR that he had also consumed marijuana). Neither the offender nor family members nor Ms Marroquin consider this to be an ongoing problem.[19]Ms Marroquin submitted a letter to the court in which she described the offender as a good provider, a good influence in her life (and that of her 10 year-old son), and that “he has become a good role model as a parent, husband and friend”.[20]I have carefully read all of the materials submitted. The overall picture presented is that the offender is finally growing up. Nevertheless, the writer of the PSR expressed concern about some of the offender’s general attitudes towards women. The writer quoted the offender as follows: “[W]omen will sometimes say things just to get men in trouble and that ‘they add to the story, they have that gift’. The subject also indicated that there are times when a woman may say no and resists sexual advances but may still want a man to continue…the woman may do that because ‘they may not want to seem easy’”.[21]The writer also expressed concern about the offender’s attitude towards the victim of the offence (who had apparently been his friend for about 15 years prior to the incident): “When questioned about the impact that the offence might have had on the victim, the subject indicated that she likely feels hurt and angry because of his actions and also felt that he had betrayed their friendship. The subject also noted that he felt ‘bad and embarrassed about what I did’. However, he also took the opportunity to describe the victim as ‘a good woman but a party woman who is constantly going out and leaving her kid, she did drugs and drank and would pass out. She got into a lot of fights”.[22]The writer concluded: “Although [the offender] accepts responsibility and expressed regret for the harm caused to the victim, both were tempered with caveats and explanation. In discussing the offence, the subject repeatedly offered his intoxication as the reason that he acted out sexually. There are also concerns noted with attitudes that appear hostile towards women as well as his use of sex as a coping mechanism” (emphasis added).[23]Not surprisingly Crown counsel requested that I pay particular attention to the quotes from the offender and the PSR writer’s concerns. She suggested that the offender’s attitude to women generally and to the victim specifically clearly indicate that the offender is in considerable need of exposure to programming that will show him how wrong and dangerous his attitudes are. While Ms Moore did not go so far as to say that the offender’s likelihood of recidivating is clearly and obviously heightened as reflected by these totally inappropriate comments and attitudes, she argued that he needs ongoing institutional and community programs that may help him address these issues. She explained that this was why in her submissions Crown counsel restricted herself to seeking a maximum of two years incarceration, as any custodial sentence in excess of two years would remove my jurisdiction to impose a period of probation.With this I agree. The offender needs to think and learn about and completely revise his attitudes towards women, at the very least because he is now acting as a father figure to a boy who will soon be entering puberty.THE VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT[24]In addition to consenting to be interviewed by the writer of the PSR, the victim filed a written Victim Impact Statement (VIS). Its brevity made it accurate and powerful, so I will quote from it directly, rather than summarizing it. She wrote: “It is hard to trust people. It prevents me from wanting to make friends. It still puts me in a state of shock. I sometimes break down and think of the situation and feel stressed out. It makes me mad at myself for allowing this to happen to me. It makes me feel low to know that my family had to find out what happened to me. I feel embarrassed to think that my son might find out about this in the future. It makes me sad, mad and I stress when I think I ever trusted someone like you”.[25]I pause in the narrative to comment about the last sentence of this VIS. As I have previously indicated in para. 3 of these reasons, a few weeks before the incident for which I am about to sentence the offender, he had attempted to take advantage of the victim in very similar circumstances, in that he had sexually assaulted her while she was asleep in her own apartment. Against this backdrop, I find that the complainant’s express reference to the offender’s breach of trust is a particularly aggravating factor on sentence. I shall return to this later in these reasons.[26]The written VIS was of course prepared before the date set for oral submissions in this case. The victim was in court when I heard the arguments of counsel. It turned out that her friends – no doubt out of delicacy – had not given her full details of the extent of the offender’s sexual assault on her. I gather from Crown counsel that it was not until the victim heard the lawyers talk about it in court that she realized for the first time that the offender had both penetrated her and ejaculated while not wearing a condom. Not only must this have been a dreadful shock to her, but she must also now be concerned about the possibility of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). While this is beyond my powers, I do hope some way can be found to allay concerns the victim may have about the offender’s physical condition – if any.CASE LAW CITED BY COUNSEL[27]Crown counsel began her review of case law by referring to R. v. J.R.\u0026 J.D. 2008 ONCA 200 (CanLII), [2008] O.J. No. 1054, where the Ontario Court of Appeal considered the appropriate sentence to be imposed in a fact pattern somewhat similar to the case at bar. In that case the complainant and the two accused were among several young persons who had attended a small party in a hotel room. The complainant drank liquor and ingested some drugs. She fell asleep sometime after 3:30 a.m. She awoke the following morning alone in the hotel room, lying naked on the bathroom floor. She had no memory of engaging in sexual intercourse. In the weeks following the party she began to ask her friends what they knew or heard had happened, and she came to believe that the two accused had sexually assaulted her. This was confirmed by a DNA sample taken from her vagina during the afternoon following the party; it indicated the presence of semen from each of the two accused, together with that of an unknown third party. At trial the accused were acquitted of gang sexual assault but were convicted of sexual assault. Crown counsel asked for and the trial judge imposed custodial sentences of two years (supplemented by DNA and SOIRA orders).[28]On appeal the Crown consented to a reduction of J.R.’s sentence on the basis of a ground not argued before the trial judge, namely that such a reduction would allow the offender to launch an immigration appeal against a deportation made consequent upon the sentence being imposed for this offence (para.22). However, in the absence of Crown consent, the Court of Appeal refused to reduce the two-year sentence imposed on J.D., despite the fact that he was a first offender. The court wrote: “in the circumstances of this case, where each man took advantage of the complainant when she was incapacitated, leaving her in a state where she woke up naked, helpless and alone on the bathroom floor of the hotel room, the two-year sentence is at the low end of the appropriate range of sentence” (para. 25; emphasis added). The court further noted that part of what was “reprehensible” in the conduct of J.D. was that he was “her good friend”, who took advantage of her friendship to commit “a significant breach of their long-standing friendship…[to] treat K.P. as an object and [to violate] her body solely for [his] sexual gratification” (Reasons for Sentence of Ducharme J. [2006] O.J. No. 4777, para. 5).[29]I note one further point from a comparison of that case to the case at bar. J.D. was 23.8 years old at the time of the commission of the offence for which he was ultimately sentenced, while Mr. Laz-Martinez was 29.8 years old. Both levels of court in R. v. J.D. commented positively on the relatively youthful age of that offender. In my judgment, Mr. Laz-Martinez’ age works against him here; though he is (essentially) a first offender, he can in no way be classified as a youthful offender.[30]Crown counsel next referred to R. v. H.H. 2002 CanLII 41397 (ON CA), [2002] O.J. No. 1509, where the offender took advantage of an 18 year-old employee. Under the pretext of insisting that she come to his home during lunch hour, he plied her with alcohol, ignored her request to return to work, and waited until she passed out. He undressed her and had intercourse with her in his teenage daughter’s bed, during the course of which she awoke and demanded that he stop, which he ignored. The Court of Appeal held that, “[h]aving regard to the gravity and seriousness of the offence and the respondent’s degree of moral blameworthiness, including his abuse of a position of authority, the fact that he took advantage of the complainant while she was unconscious and his failure to heed her plea to ‘stop’ when she realized what was happening…a penitentiary term was appropriate” (para. 5; emphasis added). However, mainly because by the time the appeal was heard the offender had already served most of the conditional sentence that the trial judge had erroneously imposed, the court varied the sentence to one of 18 months incarceration. Crown counsel argues that, substituting the offender’s breach of trust (described supra) for H.H.’s abuse of a position of trust, either a maximum reformatory term or a minimum penitentiary term is an appropriate sentence. Defence counsel replies to this by quite properly reminding me (a) that H.H. was convicted following a trial, while Mr. Laz-Martinez entered a plea of guilty, and (b) the complainant in the case at bar was never awake enough to plead that the offender should stop, which he suggests was an extra aggravating factor that obviously influenced the Court of Appeal in that case (see para. 5).[31]In support of her submission that generally sentences of more than two years should be imposed for assaults on unconscious victims, Crown counsel then referred to the by now somewhat hoary[1] authority of R. v. Glassford [1988] O.J. No. 359. The complainant in the case had gone drinking with her boyfriend and other friends at a bar. When they left she remained at the hotel and continued to drink until she was quite intoxicated. On her way to retrieve her bicycle she met three men, one of whom was the accused. They invited her to another hotel, where she was ultimately propositioned by at least two of these men. She refused and left the hotel. The accused followed her, dragged her into a garden, pulled down her pants, and when she resisted he punched her several times until she “blacked out”. When she regained consciousness her pants were down and her pantyhose was ripped. She did not know whether he had had sexual intercourse with her; the medical and other evidence on this point was inconclusive. Following a Crown election to proceed by indictment, the offender was convicted at trial of assault causing bodily harm. The trial judge imposed a sentence of 90 days intermittent, followed by probation.[32]Upon hearing a Crown appeal against the sentence imposed, the Court of Appeal was quite clear that “[t]he brutality of the attack on the complainant’s person and the callousness of leaving her beaten unconscious and partly clothed required a sentence which was a substantial term of imprisonment. We think that a penitentiary term of more than two years would have been a fit one notwithstanding that the respondent had no previous record and a not unfavourable pre-sentence report” (emphasis added). (Because the offender had already served part of his intermittent sentence by the time the appeal was heard, in result the court increased the sentence to two years less one day).[33]Defence counsel correctly stressed that the facts of R. v. Glassford involved considerably more violence than in the case at bar. Seen in this light, he argued that that case was properly decided. But counsel went on to suggest that because there was no additional violence to the complainant in the case at bar (other than the sexual assault itself), the sentence I should impose should be considerably reduced. With respect, I think this is a slippery slope argument, unfortunately very capable of perpetuating the very stereotypes that the reforms to Canada’s sexual assault legislation and practice were in large measure designed to halt. As the Alberta Court of Appeal aptly commented in its firm rejection of a trial judge’s “indefensible...interpretations” of why a fact pattern involving “forced intercourse…on a passed out complainant” in R. v. Arcand, discussed infra, merited only a 90-day custodial sentence:269Another interpretation rests on a familiar rape myth. That is the notion that non-consensual sexual intercourse is only a \"real\" major sexual assault if the complainant has been violated by a stranger who has, for example, broken into her home or pulled her off the street. On this theory, if the unlawful act is not in this category - if the complainant has drunk too much or was imprudent as to her safety - it does not qualify as a major sexual assault. But even where a complainant has done either, this does not offer the slightest mitigation in sentence. This thinking perpetuates pernicious rape myths that the courts have repeatedly sought to eradicate. It has no place in sentencing for sexual assault in this country.270Further, the suggestion that this is \"not the ordinary scenario\" for a sexual assault also reflects flawed reasoning. Even if it were not the \"ordinary scenario\", whatever that might mean, it remains a major sexual assault. More important, though, this suggestion also ignores reality. Sexual assault does not come calling only in the form of a masked intruder. As many women and men in this country have found to their everlasting regret, sexual assaults can be perpetrated - and often are - by offenders known to their victiMs Therefore, we reject the notion that because the complainant knew the offender, and she invited him to her family home and they sat on a bed together, that this makes the non-consensual sexual intercourse something other than a major sexual assault.271The purpose of sentencing is to contribute to the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society. A just society is one which rejects improper myths and stereotypes about people. A peaceful society is one in which the criminal law adequately controls those whose actions violate the security of others. A safe society is one in which people can fall asleep in their home without being sexually molested; and if they are, where the criminal law responds effectively with just sanctions.272Non-consensual sexual intercourse under any circumstances constitutes a profound violation of a person's dignity, equality, security of the person and sexual autonomy. It bears emphasizing that this complainant had passed out fully clothed while she and the offender were sitting up talking before she was sexually assaulted. There was no consent to the sexual intercourse. Nor was any sought. In summary, this offence ought to have been sentenced as a major sexual assault. It was not. This had serious negative implications for the adequacy of the sentence imposed. (footnotes omitted).[34]I completely agree with the Alberta Court of Appeal that arguing that a sexual assault is somehow less serious where an offender takes advantage of an unconscious victim who is incapable of putting up resistance than a sexual assault where an offender overcomes a victim’s active physical resistance seems to me to ignore the social reality of where so many sexual assaults take place – in a complainant’s bedroom, the very place where she should feel most safe at home. Of course the lustful bully such as Mr. Glassford must be severely punished, as the Court of Appeal stressed by its emphasis on the need for sentences of “more than two years” in such cases. However, in my view it does not at all follow that the “moral blameworthiness” of an offender who sneaks into a complainant’s bedroom to take advantage of her unconsciousness state is much lower. As pithily noted by Ducharme J. in his reasons for sentence in R. v. J.D., supra, the lack of an aggravating factor does not turn its absence into a mitigating factor (para. 27). With all due respect to defence counsel, what he wishes to have me do is exactly that – to rule that the absence of actual violence should somehow morph into being conceptualized as a mitigating factor. As the Ontario Court of Appeal case law amply demonstrates, that was wrong before Arcand, and it is even more wrong now.[35]If anything, the facts in the case at bar are more aggravated than in R. v. Arcand. Clearly M.H. was not in any position to give any consent to have the accused enter her bedroom, let alone to consent to sexual activity. Furthermore, I again stress when his pawing of her on a previous occasion had recently resulted in his ejection from her apartment, he certainly was on notice (a) that he was not welcome in her bedroom and (b) that she was not interested in him as a sexual partner.[36]While this case was on remand pending the preparation of the PSR, the Alberta Court of Appeal released its very lengthy judgment in R. v. Arcand 2010 ABCA 363 (CanLII), [2010] A.J. No. 1383. Because of the factual similarity between that case and the case at bar, I drew R. v. Arcand to the attention of counsel; however, given the Ontario Court of Appeal’s explicit rejection of the “starting point” methodology in R. v. Glassford and subsequent cases, I stressed to them that I was not interested in hearing argument as to the correctness of the “starting point” methodology reinvigorated by the Alberta Court of Appeal, but that I was rather interested in hearing their views as to the Court’s analysis of aggravating and mitigating factors in a case involving intercourse with a sleeping or unconscious complainant.[37]Crown counsel directed my attention to one paragraph of the judgment that she says captures the way I should conceptualize the “moral blameworthiness” of the offender in the case at bar:Sexually assaulting an unconscious victim elevates an offender's degree of responsibility for the crime beyond the norm contemplated by the three year starting point. An offender who sexually assaults a person who is asleep or passed out is treating that person as if the person were an object to be used - and abused - at will. Since the offender knows full well that the person is not consenting, this reveals an enhanced degree of calculation and deliberateness by the offender. Further, at that point, the person is at their most vulnerable, unable to defend themselves in any way and unable to call for help from others. The offender knows this too, adding further to the high level of moral blameworthiness for the illegal conduct. The place people most expect to enjoy security of their person is in their home. This complainant was entitled to assume that she could sleep in a bed in her family home without having her clothes removed while in a vulnerable state and penetrated sexually without her consent. For these reasons, sexually assaulting an unconscious victim is an aggravating circumstance (para. 283, footnotes omitted).[38]For his part defence counsel made no express reference to R. v. Arcand beyond reminding me that the “three year starting point” originally articulated by the Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v. Sandercock (1985) 1985 ABCA 218 (CanLII), 22 C.C.C. (3d) 79, now repeated in R. v. Arcand, is not and has never been the law in Ontario. He cited several Ontario cases which he says should incline me to imposing the eight-month custodial sentence that he says is appropriate here.[39]Before turning to those cases, I wish to refer briefly to two other Ontario cases cited by Crown counsel. R. v. J.W.M. [2004] O.J. No. 1295 (Sup. Ct.) was a summary conviction appeal in which an eighteen-month sentence had been imposed following a trial. The facts were that the victim had become extremely intoxicated at an office Christmas party, and had “passed out”. She awoke the next morning to find herself in the offender’s bed. A defence based on consent was rejected on the basis that the complainant was incapable of consenting to sexual activity due to the extreme effects of alcohol. The trial judge had found as a fact that the offender found the complainant “passed out” and had taken advantage of this to have intercourse with “a young and naïve employee”. In upholding the sentence imposed a trial, the Summary Conviction Appeal Judge characterized the offence as “a gross abuse of trust…[by violating] an extremely intoxicated 20 year-old at a time when she was in his charge because she could not look after herself” (para. 69). Crown counsel suggests that, even though that case was prosecuted by way of summary conviction, the trial and appellate decisions support the kind of range of sentence she seeks here. Defence counsel invites me to distinguish this case on two bases: (a) that unlike the case at bar, J.W.M. insisted on a trial and continued to minimize his responsibility for the offence even after a finding of guilt had been made, and (b) unlike the case at bar, J.W.M. had two previous offences for which he had “fared poorly under community supervision”. I agree with defence counsel that those were aggravating factors that are not present in the case at bar.[40]Crown counsel’s final Ontario sentencing case was R. v. P.G. [1994] O.J. No. 4079 (Sup. Ct.), where a sentence of 27 months was imposed on an offender who had no previous adult record and a positive pre-sentence report. Crown counsel concedes that it was implicit in the jury verdict in that case that the offender’s “moral blameworthiness” was higher than in the case at bar, because there was clear evidence that he “was stalking [the unconscious victim]…and it is evident that his exploitation of [the victim] was not a spontaneous or spur of the moment impulse, but rather something that had been contemplated over the span of several hours and was executed with ruthless dispatch when the occasion presented itself” (para. 6). She nevertheless argues that this case is within the range which she seeks once that aggravating factor is discounted. Defence counsel again reminds me that there was no guilty plea in that case.[41]In addition to seeking to distinguish the cases cited by Crown counsel on their facts, defence counsel drew my attention to three recent Ontario trial judgments. In R. v. San Salvador [2007] O.J. No. 3352 there is unfortunately not much detail about the offence contained in the reasons of the trial judge, no doubt because it was an oral judgment. From what I can discern, it appears that the offender had sexual intercourse with a friend who was so intoxicated that she could neither resist nor even speak. P.A. Harris J. found as a fact that there was “no gratuitous violence, no lasting injury, no planning to speak of…no confinement or drugging” (para. 5). Defence counsel therefore suggests that this is quite factually similar to the case at bar; however, he reminds me that the offender in that case insisted on a trial, and that the trial judge was right to find that “[t]here is no demonstration of remorse” (para. 6). Mr. McDonald of course contrasts that with the plea of guilty entered here.[42]Though the Crown in R. v. San Salvador sought the maximum custodial sentence (18 months) for a summary conviction offence, Harris J. was not prepared to go that far. Given that one of His Honour’s principal concerns was that the offender was the sole parent of an 11 year-old child, and that it seemed entirely possible that the child would become a ward of the Crown if his father were to be incarcerated, he offered the offender a choice between (a) “a ten-month straight imprisonment sentence with probation for one year”, or (b) “a 90-day intermittent sentence during which Mr. San Salvador will be on probation for 12 months. For the first six months, there will be a strict confinement to the home [during the week]…for the remaining six months, he will be subject to a relatively early curfew of about 6:00 p.m. at night [subject to certain exceptions]” (paras. 55-56).[43]This case was decided before the very recent Court of Appeal decision in R. v. Bankay 2010 ONCA 799 (CanLII), [2010] O. J. No. 5074, where the court struck down a probation condition that amounted to what the court called a “disguised conditional sentence” (para. 2) expressly imposed by the sentencing judge to get around the fact that in that case a conditional sentence was not available as a matter of law. While probation conditions containing curfews have been found to be lawful where they are intended to contribute to the offender’s rehabilitation, I doubt that Harris J. could today have proposed the second choice of sentence in the face of R. v. Bankay.[44]Nevertheless, defence counsel’s point that in slightly more aggravating circumstances a maximum sentence of 10 months custody was proposed by a very experienced judge of this court remains valid. Crown counsel replies by first noting that Harris J. expressly found (para. 18) that the offender in that case presented neither a danger to the victim nor to society at large. Ms Moore contrasts this to the offender here. Not only has he in fact committed two sexual assaults on this victim[2], but she also reminds me of the potential danger he presents to other women given the tenor and content of some of his statements to the writer of the PSR. While I would not go as far as Crown counsel, at the very least I am far from being as certain about Mr. Laz-Martinez’ rehabilitative potential as Harris J. was about Mr. San Salvador’s lack of dangerousness.[45]Crown counsel also sought to distinguish R. v. San Salvador on the basis that it was entirely clear on the evidence before him (see paras. 58 ff.) that Harris J. was significantly influenced by the fact the apparent unavailability of someone to look after his child (except perhaps on a limited basis on weekends). In the case at bar, it is clear that Ms Marroquin will look after her child when Mr. Laz-Martinez is incarcerated; thus, the dilemma of which Harris J. was well aware simply does not exist in this case.[46]I would also distinguish R. v. San Salvador on one other basis. At paragraph 43 of his reasons Harris J. says that had the Crown in that case elected to proceed by indictment, that would have “change[d] the equation immeasurably”. Here the Crown has elected to proceed by indictment, and while that election does not in any way fetter my sentencing discretion – except of course in a procedural sense – it is something that I am entitled to take into account in considering range of sentence. In this case, I do take that into account.[47]Defence counsel next referred to R. v. Dahouky [2008] O. J. No. 1665, a case in which, following a trial, the offender was sentenced to nine months in custody in circumstances somewhat similar to those in the case at bar. Both the victim and the offender had been drinking together earlier in the evening. She permitted him to remain in her home on condition that he slept on the couch. She went to her bedroom, closed the door and went to sleep. She woke to find the offender lying on top of her attempting to penetrate her with his penis. She pushed him off, whereupon he left immediately.[48]To my mind this case can be very easily distinguished on the basis of lack of penetration. Concurrent with these reasons I am today releasing reasons for sentence in R. v. G. (D.), a case involving digital penetration by a father on his teenage daughter. In that decision I trace a line of authority from the Supreme Court of Canada and the Ontario Court of Appeal in which I find consistent recent support for the notion that actual penetration is considered by appellate courts to be a significantly aggravating factor. I shall not repeat in these reasons what I said in that case; I have extra copies of that decision for counsel. With that in mind, I view R. v. Dahouky to be irrelevant to the seriousness of the matter I am dealing with here.[49]Similar comments may be made about the summary conviction appeal decision of Baltman J. in R. v. Wahid [2008] O.J. No. 2213 (Sup. Ct.), the final case cited by defence counsel. This was a Crown appeal against fines totalling $3,000 in circumstances where, under a pretext, the offender invited the victim into his friend’s home, where she consumed both alcohol and marijuana. She described her condition as “woozy but not drunk”. The offender “pushed himself on top of her, trying to remove her shirt and bra. He pulled her bra up and touched her breasts. She told him to stop but he continued. He tried unsuccessfully to kiss her and remove her pants” (para. 7). The Crown appeal was allowed, and on the sexual assault charge a sentence of 90 days custody was substituted. Baltman J. characterized the sexual assault as “not a momentary lapse in judgment but a fairly serious sexual assault” (para. 34). Once again, I see this case as simply irrelevant given the lack of penetration – or, for that matter, even attempted penetration.[50]After considering the arguments and case law presented by both counsel, in my judgment, what this case ultimately comes down to is this: the suggestion in R. v. Priest (1996) 1996 CanLII 1381 (ON CA), 110 C.C.C.(3d) 289 (Ont. C.A.) to the effect that “the primary objectives in sentencing a first offender are individual deterrence and rehabilitation” must be read against the very next words in the judgment “[e]xcept for very serious offences and offences involving violence” (pp. 294-5). The offender here is essentially a first offender, but the offence is both very serious and quite violent. When one examines both prongs of the proportionality test set out in s. 718.1 of the Code, there can be no doubt that both the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender are very elevated, particularly given the history of sexual rejection, the unconscious state of the complainant and the location where the sexual assault took place. Thus, in my judgment a sentence with a significantly denunciatory component must be imposed. A reformatory term, even close to or at the maximum level, would not adequately express societal denunciation for the offender’s act. He is sentenced to two years in the penitentiary. I will endorse on the Warrant of Committal that I recommend that he be exposed to sex offender and substance abuse treatment programming while incarcerated.[51]I should also say that I have given serious consideration to imposing a sentence higher than that sought by Crown counsel, in the range of about three years (after making allowances for the offender’s lack of previous record and his plea of guilty). However, I think that Ms Moore has it right when she suggests that the offender’s rehabilitation will likely be assisted if there is a period of probation following the expiration of his penitentiary sentence. He is therefore placed on probation for a period of three years. The optional conditions of probation will be as follows:-he will report to his probation officer within 48 hours of the commencement ofhis probationary period and thereafter as directed;-he will take such sex offender and substance abuse counselling as may be rec-ommended by his probation officer and will not discontinue such counsellingunless discharged by his therapist or counsellor;-he will sign such releases as are necessary to authorize his probation officer tocommunicate with his treating therapist or counsellor;- he will abstain from the purchase, possession or consumption of any non-medically prescribed medication or intoxicating substances;- he will have no contact directly or indirectly with M.H. He will not knowinglybe within 100 metres of any place he knows her to live, work or be.I have considered, but reject, the PSR writer’s recommendation that he “abstain from the purchase, possession or consumption of any alcohol”. I believe that alcoholism is largely a medical problem, which should be dealt with by medical practitioner and/or mental health professionals, rather than by court ordered prohibition.[52]The offender is subject to a “weapons prohibition” as proscribed by s. 110 of the Code for a period of 10 years.[53]There will be an order for the production of a DNA sample pursuant to s. 487.051(4) of the Code.[54]The offender will be designated as a person convicted of a designated offence pursuant to s. 490.011(1)(a) of the Code for a period of 20 years.Released:March 2, 2011Signed: “Justice D.P. Cole”[1] I have used this term deliberately, as I doubt whether an appellate court would today base its reasoning so squarely on the need for “the element of general deterrence”, given the growing judicial and academic recognition of the validity of criticisms of the notion that exemplary sentences actually act as “a warning to others that such attacks would bring serious penalties”. See for example, R. v. M. (C.A.) (1996) 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), 46 C.R. (4th) 269 (S.C.C.); R. v. Wismayer (1997) 1997 CanLII 3294 (ON CA), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 18 at 36 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Proulx (2000) 140 C.C.C. (3d) 436 (S.C.C.); R. v. C.N.H. (2002) 2002 CanLII 7751 (ON CA), 170 C.C.C. (3d) 253 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. D.G.F. 2010 ONCA 27 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 127 (Ont. C.A.).[2] I am well aware that he was not charged with the April 18, 2008 offence, and I must therefore be careful not to punish him for that offence. However, on the basis of cases such as R. v. Roud \u0026 Roud (1981) 58 C.C.C. (2d) 226 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Edwards (2000) 2001 CanLII 24105 (ON CA), 155 C.C.C. (3d) 473 (Ont. C.A.), I am entirely satisfied that I may consider this incident as evidence of the character of the offender."}

Walsh, Esq. for the RespondentTHE COURTThe term of the firearm prohibition is varied to ten years. The sentence is confirmed, and the other grounds of appeal are dismissed. Rice, J.A. dissenting would have allowed the appeal, and set aside the Order made under s. 743.6(1) of the Criminal Code.LARLEE, J.A.1Derek Cormier seeks leave to appeal sentence because of errors made by the trial judge. After a trial Mr. Cormier was found guilty of two offences: break and enter into the residence of his former girlfriend (s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada), and of her attempted murder (s. 239 of the Code). I would grant leave.Facts2On May 1, 1997 the appellant broke down the door of Ms. Martin's residence, attacked her with a knife and slit her throat. Mr. Cormier carried out the assault in a brutal and callous manner. He gained entry by smashing in the door without warning. The victim was a person who wanted to end a relationship. He threatened her by saying things like \"this is the night you die,\" and \"if I cannot have you nobody can.\" After slitting her throat, which left a 15 cm diagonal laceration, he dragged her from the house and continued to assault her. A friend tried to intervene, and Mr. Cormier threatened her with similar treatment. In attempting to run away, Ms. Martin fell backwards over the railing to the ground. The trial judge describes the rest of the assault in this way:... and as he continued the attack, he told her that she was going to die. She was forced over the railing and fell to the ground. She attempted to run away but was pursued and caught and dragged back to her residence during which time she was told that if he couldn't have her, nobody else would. He began cutting at his own wrists. She subsequently ran away from her residence a second time and was pursued by Mr. Cormier. He continued to stab at her with the knife and he cut his other wrist and neck saying they would bleed to death together. ...[Page 2]3The judge imposed a sentence of nine years for the attempted murder, and two years concurrent for the offence of break and enter. In addition, he fixed parole eligibility at one-half of the sentence pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Code, and he imposed a lifetime firearm prohibition order pursuant to s. 100(1) (b) of the Code.4Counsel for the prosecution concedes that the life term for the firearm prohibition is incorrect, and that it should be for ten years because this was the appellant's first conviction for an indictable offence involving violence against the person. I agree. The trial judge applied the wrong subsection.5The Crown concedes that the judge made a second error in taking into account as an aggravating factor the appellant's failure to accept responsibility for the crimes. It insists, however, that these two errors did not lead the judge to impose a sentence that is demonstrably unfit.6The appellant in his oral argument relied on three grounds. He submitted that the judge put too much weight on the factor of premeditation. He argued that the sentence was excessive, and that the case did not warrant invoking s. 743.6 of the Code, the power of the Court to delay parole.Premeditation as an aggravating factor7With respect to the argument about premeditation, the judge considered it along with a number of other factors.[Page 3]Indeed, he comments that there was no evidence of a deliberate plan to murder Ms. Martin.8The judge did not put undue emphasis on this factor, and made no error in identifying it as an aggravating one. With respect to the issue of aggravating factors in general, s. 718.2 of the Code specifies a number of aggravating circumstances, although as the section mentions, it is not a closed class.Section 718.2 reads as follows:A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:a)a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,(i)evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice, or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation or any other similar factor,(ii)evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender's spouse or child,(iii)evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, or(iv)evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal organizationshall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;[Page 4]9In arriving at an appropriate sentence, the judge reviewed what he considered to be the aggravating factors. From the text of his decision, they can be summarized as follows:▪The maximum sentence prescribed by the Criminal Code for this offence is life imprisonment.▪The degree of violence used in this attack and the duration of the attack.▪The fact that Mr. Cormier drove from Moncton to Baie Ste. Anne indicates a degree of premeditation.▪The horrendous impact the assault had on the victim.▪The need to protect the public, particularly in an area, like the Miramichi, where crimes of this nature are so prevalent.▪Mr. Cormier's failure to accept responsibility.▪Mr. Cormier's previous criminal record of an assault on a former girlfriend.▪The fact that the assault took place in the context of the breakdown of a domestic relationship.[Page 5]10These are all pertinent factors that the judge can take into account in arriving at a proper determination of sentence, but they cannot be categorized collectively as aggravating factors. For example, the penalty section of the Code may reflect the seriousness with which the legislators view the offence, but it is not, as viewed by the sentencing judge, an aggravating factor. The need to protect the public is likewise not an aggravating factor. In my opinion, the trial judge enunciated these factors because, taken together, they militate in favour of a lengthier sentence.Lack of remorse as an aggravating factor11Included among the factors that the judge considered is Mr. Cormier's failure to take responsibility for his acts. The judge may certainly refer to this and is entitled to take it into account as he sentences. Remorse shown-by-an accused can be viewed as a mitigating factor. The sentencing judge may also take it into consideration as a facet of the accused's character. However, the consideration of a lack of remorse by an accused as an aggravating factor is incorrect. In R. v. E.S. (1998), 1997 CanLII 11513 (NB CA), 191 N.B.R. (2d) 3 (C.A.), at p. 12, para. 6, Ryan J.A. admonished:... A failure to express remorse after a plea of guilty may be taken into consideration by the sentencing judge as callous but it is not an aggravating factor. More so, if an accused is found guilty following a trial. Lack of remorse after a finding of guilt is not a factor to be considered. The conclusion of the trial judge or a jury as to the accused's guilt is an opinion based upon the[Page 6]evidence presented. It is not an absolute. Many persons have had their convictions reversed.Fitness of the sentence12Even though the judge erred, this does not automatically lead to a reduction in sentence; the sentence imposed may, nevertheless, be fit. In my opinion, taking into account the other factors that the judge considered in conjunction with the principles of sentencing lead to the conclusion that the sentence imposed is fit. See R. v. Joyce, 1998 CanLII 12216 (NB CA), [1998] N.B.J. No. 312 (QL).13This crime justifies a sentence of nine years or more. The sentence is fit and well within the range for similar offences. See R. v. Wu (M.F.) (1994), 1994 CanLII 6468 (NB CA), 145 N.B.R. (2d) 107, in which the appellant was sentenced to nine year's imprisonment for aggravated assault.Order under section 743.614Section 743.6 of the Code vests in the sentencing judge the discretion to limit the eligibility for parole until one half the sentence is served. Following a request by the Crown, which puts the accused on notice, the judge may if satisfied:743.6(1) ... having regard to the circumstances of the commission of the offences and the character and circumstances of the offender, that the expression of society's denunciation of the offences or the objective of specific or general deterrence so[Page 7]requires, order that the portion of the sentence that must be served before the offender may be released on full parole is one half of the sentence...Application of section 743.6(1)15In the case of Nash-Levy v. R. (7 December 1998), 170/98/CA (N.B.C.A.) [unreported], this Court referred to the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in R. v. Goulet (1995), 1995 CanLII 1198 (ON CA), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 61, in which it took the position that s. 743.6(1) of the Code should only be invoked in exceptional circumstances where the Crown has satisfied the Court on clear evidence that an increase in the period of parole ineligibility is required. However, in that appeal the ratio of our decision was based on the fact that the appellant was not notified that the Crown would seek such an order and was not given the opportunity to address the court on the issue.16I do not share the opinion of the Ontario Court of Appeal in this regard. Section 743.6(1) of the Code does not require exceptional circumstances before it can be applied. What is required is for the Crown prosecutor to persuade the sentencing judge that the criteria set out in the section have been satisfied by the facts of the case. Parliament has set out the criteria for delay of parole in the section. These criteria are the denunciation by society of the offences or that it is necessary in order to achieve an objective of general or specific deterrence. Factors which must be taken into account, once the sentencing judge determines that any of these criteria are met, include the circumstances of the commission of the[Page 8]offence, and the character and circumstances of the accused, which may include, pursuant to s. 743.6(2) of the Code, a consideration of the offender's prospects for rehabilitation. These are the factors, which according to the section, are be taken into account; it is not for sentencing judges to improvise except in the most unusual circumstances.Prospects of rehabilitation17In R. v. Osborne (1996), 1996 CanLII 980 (ON CA), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 161, the Ontario Court of appeal again set aside an order under the section because, among other things, the appellant was a first offender and there was no evidence that he could not be rehabilitated within the normal parole eligibility time. The Court relied on its earlier decision of Goulet, in which Griffiths J.A. stated at p.67:The distinguishing characteristics of the offender may provide more fruitful grounds for invoking s. 741.2 as an exceptional measure. Where the Crown has adduced clear evidence that the offender will not be deterred or rehabilitated within the normal period of parole ineligibility, an order under [s. 741.2] will be appropriate. A history of prior parole violations, or violations of other forms of conditional release, or evidence that significant prior custodial sentences have had little impact would be appropriate factors to consider in applying [s. 741.2].[Emphasis added]18I disagree with this very limited approach. Rehabilitation is only one factor to be taken into consideration having regard to the character and circumstances[Page 9]of the offender. To hold that the Crown must produce evidence that the offender will not be rehabilitated places an unwarranted burden on it and adds a criterion that Parliament has not imposed. In fact, Parliament, in subsection 743.6(2) of the Code, emphasized that:For greater certainty, the paramount principles that are to guide the court under this section are denunciation and specific or general deterrence, with rehabilitation of the offender, in all cases, being subordinate to those paramount principles.19In this case the judge had earlier commented on the character and circumstances of Mr. Cormier in the sentencing decision. The Court of Appeal of Alberta approves of this approach. In R. v. Matwiy (1996), 1996 ABCA 63 (CanLII), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 251, the Court states at p. 266:Where the sentencing judge fully sets out the circumstances of the offences, as well as the circumstances and record of the accused in dealing with the sentence to be imposed, it is sufficient if the trial judge refers to and incorporates those comments in general terms in disposing of the s. 741.2 application. ...20In the instant case the sentencing judge referred to the age of the offender, that he was 27 at the time of imposition of sentence. He noted that he was a native of Montreal, from an upper-middle class family. Mr. Cormier lacks a few credits to complete a university degree. He has a good work record. The judge also commented that Mr. Cormier had one previous conviction which was an assault against a girlfriend.[Page 10]He has no problem with drugs or alcohol, although those substances played a role in this offence. His pre-sentence report is favourable. Notwithstanding this, the trial judge was of the opinion that the objective of specific deterrence required him to make the order to delay Mr. Cormier's eligibilty for parole.21The sentencing judge's reasons for giving the order reflect the necessity to impose a sentence that denounces this odious vicious assault, and reflect both general and specific deterrence. He states at p. 18 of his decision:Considering the very unusual nature of this attack, the degree of violence and the brutality, the length of the attack and the fact that it occurred in the sanctity of Ms. Martin's home after a violent entry into it and considering the need to express society's denunciation of such crimes and the need to deter, not only yourself and others from such attacks in the context of a domestic relationship, I order that you serve one half of your sentence before you are considered to be eligible for full parole.22The sentencing judge correctly determined that the essential criteria for an order under s. 743.6 of the Code had been met. He further took into account the relevant factors, in light of the facts of the case. The order was properly made. In my opinion the judge made no error in exercising his discretion in this manner.[Page 11]Disposition23For the reasons given, I would vary the term of the firearm prohibition to ten years. In all other respects, I would confirm the sentence and dismiss the other grounds of appeal.[S]M.E.L. LARLEE, J.A.I CONCUR[S]LEWIS C. AYLES, J.A.RICE, J.A.1I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of my colleague Larlee, J.A. and the facts need not be repeated.2While I agree with her that the sentence imposed was a fit one and that the time of firearm prohibition should be varied to one of ten years, I do not, with respect, agree with her as to the application of section 743.6(1)(2) of the Criminal Code of Canada by the sentencing judge.3The accused-appellant was 27 years of age at the time of the commission of the offence. He has a good work record and a university education. He has one conviction of assault on a girlfriend in 1993 for which he was sentenced to one year probation and conditional discharge.4He had no involvement with the law since 1993. He does not have alcohol or drug problems although they played a role in these offences. His favourable pre-sentence report concludes in this way:... He and others report that his mental and emotional state has improved over the last couple of weeks given the fact that he was prescribed Prozac as well as the counselling he has been receiving from a local priest and mental health worker. He contends that his intentions are to secure all the programming available while incarcerated, including anger management, and to return to Montreal following release where he has a job with his father.[Page 2]5The trial Judge predicated his application of section 743.6(1) (2) on the following:Considering the very unusual nature of this attack, the degree of violence and the brutality, the length of the attack and the fact that it occurred in the sanctity of Ms. Martin's home after a violent entry into it and considering the need to express society's denunciation of such crimes and the need to deter, not only yourself and others from such attacks in the context of a domestic relationship, I order that you serve one half of your sentence before you are considered to be eligible for full parole.6I am of the view that the sentencing judge made an error in principle when he failed to address \"the character and circumstances\" of the accused in the circumstances of this case notwithstanding that section 743.6(2) relegates rehabilitation to a secondary consideration.7The slight criminal record of the accused, the favourable pre-sentence report, with its reference to the improvement of emotional problems with counselling and treatment, as well as his out of character actions in this crime ought to have been weighted by the sentencing judge in his application of section 743.6 See Williston and Zinck issued this date and authorities referred to therein.8I would have also allowed the appeal to strike the order made under 743.6(1) of the Criminal Code.[S]ROBERT C.

(Oral):Jason Johnson has entered a plea of guilty to the charge of assault causing bodily harm upon one Justin Fromme on September 24, 2010.Mr. Johnson was originally charged with aggravated assault under s. 268 of the Criminal Code, but the Crown consented to a guilty plea to the lesser included offence under s. 267.The Crown has also elected to proceed summarily on this matter, and I am sitting in my capacity as Territorial Court Judge for this sentencing.[2]The circumstances of the offence are that Mr. Johnson and Mr. Fromme were in the Foxy’s Cabaret in Whitehorse on the evening of the offence.Mr. Fromme had recently broken up with a girlfriend, who was known to Mr. Johnson.The two were drinking, I gather, and there was some form of misunderstanding about what happened in the breakup between Mr. Fromme and his girlfriend.There were some loud verbal exchanges between the two and eventually they were both escorted out of the cabaret.Mr. Fromme was taken to the back door and Mr. Johnson was taken to the front.One of the comments made by one of the bouncers of the behaviour of the two gentlemen inside the tavern was to describe them as having “a puffing out of chests.”[3]Moments later, Mr. Fromme appeared at the front of Foxy’s Cabaret and the two got into a fight.Mr. Johnson says that it was Mr. Fromme who was the initial aggressor by starting to punch.In any event, blows were exchanged.The two bouncers came out of the cabaret and witnessed a portion of the fight after it had started.At one point, they were rolling around on the ground.At another point, Mr. Fromme said twice that he was “done,” and held his hands up.However, Mr. Johnson continued to kick him. Some bystanders intervened and, as Mr. Fromme started to get up, Mr. Johnson kicked him again in the head, knocking him unconscious.He attempted to kick Mr. Fromme one more time, but was restrained by the bystanders.[4]Mr. Johnson himself was injured in the fight with a cut to the top part of his forehead, which did require some sutures.Mr. Fromme similarly had a cut to the side of his scalp which required six sutures to close, and he also reported some difficulty with his breathing.When questioned at the hospital, Mr. Fromme had very little or no memory of the incident.The Crown says that there is no information as to any lasting injuries on the part of Mr. Fromme.[5]The circumstances of the offender are that he is 27 years old and is a member of the Kluane First Nation.I am informed that he has been in a long-term and stable common law relationship for approximately five years.He has no dependents.He was employed with the Sun Dog Carving Retreat in Whitehorse for about three years in a teaching capacity, and was employed in that capacity at the time of this offence.He since took brief employment as a driller’s assistant in the spring and early summer of 2011.Subsequent to that, he was unemployed for about one month, but then gained employment as an apprentice carpenter for Ketza Construction.He was employed by Ketza from September 1 of this year until about ten days ago, but I am informed by his counsel this morning that he has work to return to for Ketza in Haines Junction starting tomorrow.[6]His counsel also informs me that as a youth Mr. Johnson volunteered for the Blue Feather Youth Centre in Whitehorse and has done some community service work at that institution.[7]Mr. Johnson has a criminal record.In 2003, Mr. Johnson was convicted of a driving over 80, unauthorized use of a credit card, and failing to attend court, as well as possession of counterfeit money and failing to comply with a recognizance.There appears to be no criminal activity until 2008, when he was convicted of an offence under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.He has no prior record for violence.[8]Mr. Johnson was released on an undertaking following his arrest for the offence on September 24, 2010, with a number of conditions, including abstaining from alcohol and drugs, not to attend any bar, tavern, or off-sales, or other commercial premises where the primary purpose is the sale of alcohol, and not to have any contact with Mr. Fromme.[9]Defence counsel informs me that he has spoken with Mr. Johnson’s bail supervisor who described Mr. Johnson as a model client and indicated that there have been no breaches on that undertaking.Defence counsel also informs me that following the 2008 drug conviction, which resulted in a four-month conditional sentence, there were no subsequent breaches.[10]Turning to the case law provided by the Crown, R. v. Derkson, [2009] Y.J. No. 128 (S.C.) is distinguishable for a number of reasons.Firstly, that was a matter involving a charge of aggravated assault under s. 268 of the Criminal Code.It involved a victim who was a stranger to the offender with more serious injuries including a fractured jaw and a skull fracture.The victim in that case had to receive his nourishment through a straw for a period of eight weeks.There was a conviction following a trial, and the offender had a prior assault on his criminal record.[11]The R. v. Malcolm, 2008 YKTC 45 (CanLII) decision is also distinguishable in that it was also an unprovoked and gratuitous attack.The offender there apparently had two prior assaults, or at least more than a single assault on his criminal record, as well as a robbery conviction.There was some issue with the offender having been detained, then released, and then being found to be absent without leave from the Yukon Adult Residential Centre where he was supposed to be residing.[12]The decision of R. v. Germaine and Moses, 2007 YKTC 90 (CanLII) was tendered by the Crown primarily with respect to the sentence imposed on Mr. Germaine, which was 15 months imprisonment in addition to time served.However, that matter similarly involved a gratuitous and unprovoked attack which was commenced by Mr. Moses, but willingly joined into by Mr. Germaine.Mr. Germaine also had a criminal record which was described as “only slightly less breathtaking” than that of Mr. Moses, who was described by the sentencing judge in that case as having an absolutely horrendous criminal record.The victim in that case also received numerous cuts and bruises.[13]The R. v. Glover, 2003 YKTC 61 (CanLII) decision is distinguishable because it involved an unprovoked attack involving the use of a knife to cut the victim’s throat, which was described by the sentencing judge as an unprovoked, gratuitous and deadly act.[14]The aggravating circumstances in the case at bar are that Mr. Johnson administered one kick too many to the victim, and would have kicked him yet again but for the fact that he was restrained by a bystander.[15]The mitigating circumstances are that it appears the victim was the aggressor, as Mr. Johnson maintains, because of the fact that he quickly came around to the front of the cabaret after being escorted out the back, in what would seem to be a provocative circumstance, all things being considered.It is also mitigating that Mr. Johnson has no prior record for violence and that he performed as well as he has done on his undertaking, as well as having no prior difficulties with the conditional sentence which was imposed in 2008.It is mitigating that Mr. Johnson has been steadily employed for approximately the last four years, and has been in a stable common law relationship for about five years.It therefore appears that this incident was out of character for him.[16]It is a neutral factor that both the victim and the offender in this case received cuts to the scalp, which required stitches.[17]The Crown’s position on sentence is that a conditional sentence would be inappropriate because the last time that Mr. Johnson received one in 2008 it did not have a deterrent effect upon him, and that in this case, specific deterrence and denunciation are the primary sentencing principles to be addressed.That those are the primary principles involved is not disputed by the defence.However, the defence focuses on the fact that this was an unprovoked attack, which is out of character for Mr. Johnson, and that he would otherwise appear to be a suitable candidate for a conditional sentence.[18]It must be noted that a conditional sentence is a sentence of imprisonment which is allowed to be served conditionally in the community under strict conditions which are intended to have a punitive effect and, in many respects, can be as difficult for the offender as a jail sentence.In these circumstances, I am satisfied that a conditional sentence can meet the objectives of specifically deterring Mr. Johnson from future like-minded behaviour, as well as denouncing the vicious attack with the last kicks to Mr. Fromme.[19]The length of the conditional sentence will be 15 months, and will involve the statutory terms as well as the following conditions:1.That Mr. Johnson will reside as approved by the sentence supervisor at 161 Dalton Drive in Haines Junction, and not change that residence without the prior written permission of the supervisor;2.Mr. Johnson will be under house arrest for the duration of the conditional sentence, which means that at all times he is to remain within his place of residence except with the prior written permission of his supervisor, except for purposes of employment, including travel directly to and directly from his employment.He must also present himself at the door and answer the telephone during reasonable hours for curfew checks.Failure to do so will be a presumptive breach of this condition;3.He is to abstain absolutely from the possession or consumption of alcohol, controlled drugs or substances, except in accordance with a prescription given to him by a qualified medical practitioner;4.He is to provide a sample of his breath for the purposes of analysis upon demand by a peace officer who has reason to believe that he may have failed to comply with this condition;5.He is not to attend any bar, tavern, off-sales, or other commercial premises whose primary purpose is the sale of alcohol;6.He is to have no contact directly or indirectly, or communication in any way with Mr. Fromme, and he is not to attend at or within 50 metres of the residence of Mr. Fromme;7.He is to make reasonable efforts to find and maintain suitable employment and provide his supervisor with all necessary details concerning those efforts;[20]Given the fact that this does appear to be an out-of-character act for Mr. Johnson, which was executed in the heat of the moment in the midst of an argument with someone that he knew over a friend, it appears that there is not a sufficiently compelling reason for Mr. Johnson to undertake any form of counselling, and I decline to make that a condition of this order.However, I will impose a period of community service work because Mr. Johnson has some abilities in the carving and artistic traditions of his First Nation, and has some capacity to provide benefit in that regard to his community.I do so, not in an attempt to impose a rehabilitative component to the sentence, but to add a denunciatory component to the sentence.So, I will require that:8.Mr. Johnson is to perform 50 hours of community service as directed by his supervisor or such other person as his supervisor may designate, and that community service is to be completed within the first six months of the conditional sentence.[21]Now, nobody addressed it, but I understand that a s. 109 firearms order is mandatory, is it?[22]MS. PHILLIPS:Yes.I believe it’s also -- no.[23]THE COURT:That is for a ten-year period, is it?[24]MR. CAMPBELL:It’s a discretionary firearms order because we proceeded summarily, I believe.[25]THE COURT:Where are we?[26]MR. CAMPBELL:Under a summary conviction.I believe it’s a s. 110 discretionary firearms order.I’m just looking at the grid in Martin’s, and I would note that he’s already in the midst of a firearms order, in any event.Not that that doesn’t mean that another --[27]THE COURT:Sorry, where do you read in s. 110 that it is discretionary?I see the title, but in terms of it being a summary matter.[28]MR. CAMPBELL:I was getting that from the grid in -- at the back of Martin’s.[29]MS. PHILLIPS:Section 109 has the word \"indictable\" actually in that section, whereas s. 110 does not.[30]THE COURT:So s. 109 is not applicable, but s. 110 is?[31]MS. PHILLIPS:Section 110 is, yes.[32]THE COURT:All right.In the circumstances, I have declined to make a firearms prohibition order.Are there any other collateral orders that the Crown is seeking that have not yet been addressed?[33]MS. PHILLIPS:No.[34]THE COURT:I will order that the victim fine surcharge be imposed, and I think that is a standard amount, is it not?[35]MR. CAMPBELL:Fifty dollars.[36]THE COURT:Fifty dollars, and two weeks to pay.[37]MR. CAMPBELL:Two weeks time to pay, yes.[38]THE COURT:Anything else that I have omitted?[39]MS. PHILLIPS:No, Your Honour.[40]THE CLERK:Sorry, Your Honour, I’d just like to verify that the Supreme Court charges are withdrawn?[41]MS. PHILLIPS:Yes, the Crown will withdraw those.[42]THE COURT:All right, so the indictment has been stayed, then, or withdrawn?[43]MS. PHILLIPS:Yes.________________________________GOWER T.C.J."}

Tax, J.P.C.Oral Decision:November 6, 2013Charges:Please see Appendix “A”Counsel:Janine Kidd, for the CrownAlfred Seaman, for the DefenceBy The Court (Orally):INTRODUCTION:[1]Devon McKay has entered guilty pleas to ten (10) offences which were committed on several different dates between March 27, 2011 and February 26, 2013.The issue before the court is to determine a fit and appropriate sentence in the circumstances of this consolidation of 10 offences for this particular offender and the circumstances of the offences for which he has entered guilty pleas.POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES:[2]It is the position of the Crown Attorney that a fit and appropriate sentence for each of the 10 separate charges, taking into account all the purposes and principles of sentencing at play in the circumstances of this case would result in a total global sentence in the range of four years in custody less credit for pretrial custody. The Crown Attorney submits that the most serious of the charges for which Mr. McKay has entered guilty pleas were the charges of committing a robbery contrary to section 344 of the Criminal Code on February 2, 2012 and the break enter and theft of a business premises contrary to section 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code on February 26, 2013.[3]In addition, the Crown seeks stand-alone restitution orders under section 738 of the Criminal Code for the mischief charge which occurred on March 27, 2011 as well as the damage to the business premises which was occasioned during the break and enter and theft charge which occurred on February 26, 2013. The Crown also seeks an order that Mr. McKay provide a sample of his DNA as a result of the robbery charge which is a primary designated offence for the purposes of obtaining samples of DNA pursuant to section 487.051 of Criminal Code and a section 109 Criminal Code mandatory 10 year firearms order. The Defence does not oppose these applications.[4]Defence Counsel submits that Mr. McKay has been held in custody since February 26, 2013 to the date of these submissions on September 9, 2013 which amounts to a total of 196 days. Based on R. v. Carvery, 2012 NSCA 107 (CanLII), it is the position of the Defence that, pursuant to section 719.3 of the Code, Mr. McKay should receive an enhanced credit for presentence custody of 1.5 days for each day served from February 26, 2013. If that total amount of time was not granted on the enhanced credit for pretrial custody, Defence counsel submits that the enhanced credit should extend from June 2, 2013 to today’s date since Mr. McKay was prepared to deal with these matters on that date, but due to other cases being scheduled by the court, there was insufficient time to make these submissions on that day. The Crown Attorney does not oppose that enhanced credit for pretrial custody of 1 ½ days for each day served from June 25, 2013 to today’s date.[5]It is the position of the Defence that Mr. McKay is a youthful adult offender with no prior adult convictions or youth court dispositions, and as such, his pre-sentence custody represents a sufficient period of time in custody for the charges of robbery and break enter and theft. For the balance of the charges, the Defence position is that the fit and appropriate disposition for all of those charges would be a suspended sentence with a lengthy period of time under terms probation or under terms of a Conditional Sentence Order (“CSO”) of imprisonment in the community.[6]In the alternative, Defence counsel submits that the court should rely upon several cases from other jurisdictions in which courts have determined that robberies may occur in many different circumstances. Furthermore, counsel submits that, in the circumstances of this case, the court ought not to conclude that the robbery was a “serious personal injury offence” under section 752 of the Criminal Code, so that a CSO of imprisonment would still be an available sanction. If the court concurred with that submission, then, it is the position of the Defence that all of the presentence custody, including any period of time where there would be enhanced presentence custody on a 1 ½ day to one day basis, could be credited towards the break and enter charge, so that Mr. McKay would be in a time served situation for that charge. In that event, a CSO followed by probation would be the fit and appropriate disposition for all of the other charges.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCES:[7]As I indicated at the outset, Mr. McKay comes before the court today for the determination of a fit and appropriate sentence on a consolidation of 10 charges which occurred between March 27, 2011 and February 26, 2013. Briefly stated, the facts and circumstances of the charges for which Mr. McKay has entered guilty pleas are as follows:1)Mischief Charge - section 430(4) Criminal Code - March 27, 2011. On that date, around 10:30 PM, Mr. McKay was staying at the residence of Ms. Tyla Robb, in Eastern Passage, Nova Scotia and had just returned from a party. Mr. McKay was a friend of Ms. Robb’s son. Ms. Robb confronted Mr. McKay about paying some rent for living at her house. There was an argument which became heated and physical and, at a certain point, Mr. McKay left the house and as he walked down the driveway, he used his elbow to smash the driver’s side window of Mr. Scott Perkins’ car which was parked there. Mr. Perkins was Ms. Robb’s boyfriend at that time. Damage to the vehicle was $821.04. Mr. Perkins requests restitution.2)Theft under Charge - section 334(b) Criminal Code - December 7, 2011- On that date, at about 4 PM, a loss prevention officer observed Mr. McKay enter the Atlantic Superstore located at 3601 Joseph Howe Dr. in Halifax. Mr. McKay took 4 Play Station III games and one other game plus a digital photo frame from the electronic section of the Superstore. He placed those items in a plastic bag and walked out the store without any attempt to pay for them. When an alarm went off, Mr. McKay was stopped outside the store by the loss prevention officer and the property valued at $459.93 was recovered.3)Failure to appear on Appearance Notice - section 145(5) Code - January 16, 2012 - Mr. McKay was given an appearance notice on the theft charge from December 7, 2011 to make of his first appearance in Halifax Provincial Court on January 16, 2012. He failed to appear as he was required to do on that date.4)Failure to appear on Recognizance - section 145(2)(a) Code - May 28, 2012- Mr. McKay was then released from custody on a Recognizance on April 18, 2012 with respect to the theft charge from December 7, 2011. Pursuant to that Recognizance he was required to attend court on May28, 2012 and he failed to appear as required.5)Theft under Charge - section 334(b) Code - December 13, 2011On this date, loss prevention officers at the Shoppers Drug Mart located at 118 Wyse Rd, in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, observed Mr. McKay take about 20 Nintendo Wii games, put them under his arm and run out of the store, without any attempt to pay for those items. Loss prevention officers pursued Mr. McKay outside the store and the police were called to the Shoppers Drug Mart. Mr. McKay was detained by the loss prevention officer and at that time some of the video games were recovered, but others had been dropped along the way and were not recovered. It is estimated that videogames with a value of $360 were not recovered on Mr. McKay’s arrest.6)Failure to appear on Appearance Notice - section 145(5) Code - January 24, 2012 - Mr. McKay was released on an Appearance Notice with respect to the Theft charge from December 13, 2011 and he was required to attend court on January 24, 2012. Mr. McKay failed to attend court as he was required to do on that date.7)Assault charge - section 266(b) Code - January 7, 2012 - Around 8:00 PM on that date, A. J. was walking home and was near the corner of Merrimac and Sillistra Drive, Cole Harbor, Nova Scotia. He saw Mr. McKay and a young woman who did he did not recognize walking towards him. Mr. J. knew Mr. McKay as they both went to the same high school and there had been issues between them in relation to Mr. J.’ sexual orientation. As Mr. McKay walked by Mr. J., he threw the contents of a Tim Horton’s ice cappuccino beverage at him, which struck him on the left side of his face.8)Robbery charge - section 344 Criminal Code - February 2, 2012 – On this date, around 1 AM, Mr. McKay entered the Irving convenience store located at 1207 Cole Harbor Road, Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia. There was one clerk on duty, Mr. Robert Coish. Mr. McKay asked him for a package of cigarettes and then made 2 unsuccessful attempts to pay for the cigarettes with his Interac debit card as there were insufficient funds in the account. At that point, Mr. McKay picked up the cigarettes with his left hand and the clerk said that he then pulled out a black, pointed object from his pocket and held it in his right hand. The clerk could not specifically state that the object was a knife. Mr. McKay pointed the black object at Mr. Coish and at the same time stated “this is a robbery” and then he fled from the store with the package of cigarettes. Police confirmed that Mr. McKay used his debit card and his own P.I.N. number at the store.With respect to this charge, the Defence does not admit that the object in Mr. McKay’s hand was a knife. The position of the Defence is that the clerk only saw a dark or black pointed object in Mr. McKay’s hand, but he did not describe it as a knife. During the sentencing submissions, Defence counsel advised the court that there was a dispute as to whether that object was, in fact, a knife. However, it was agreed by counsel that there would be no need to hold a hearing to resolve that factual dispute as the Defence did not dispute the fact that Mr. McKay had made some threatening gesture with a black object in his hand which was outside of his pocket. The Defence also acknowledged that all of the essential elements of the robbery charge were established by the Crown and admitted by the Defence in entering the guilty plea to this charge.9)Break, enter and theft charge – section 348(1)(b) Code – February 26,2013- On this date, around 1:45 AM, Mr. McKay and another individual broke into the Habaneros restaurant located at 380 Pleasant St., Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. Initially, there was an attempt to gain entry to the restaurant through a rear door and at that time a security camera and light were removed. When they were not able to gain entry through the rear entrance, Mr. McKay and the other individual went to the front of the restaurant and threw a rock through the front window. They entered the restaurant and after examining the cash register and determining that there was no cash, the two individuals fled from the premises. Mr. McKay was found by the K-9 unit in a nearby property at 2:40 AM. The damage occasioned at the restaurant was $1929.74. The insurance company which reimbursed the restaurant owner seeks restitution of that amount.10)Breach of Recognizance - section 145(3) Criminal Code -February 26, 2013 - Mr. McKay had been placed on a recognizance entered into before justice on October 25, 2012 and one of the conditions contained in that order was to “keep the peace and be of good behavior.” By acknowledging his responsibility for the break, enter and theft charge on February 26, 2013, Mr. McKay also acknowledged that he had breached that condition in his recognizance.VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS:[8]Mr. A. J. filed a victim impact statement with respect to the assault on January 7, 2012 committed by Mr. McKay. Although he had lived in Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia all of his life, after this incident, for the first time, he said that he did not feel safe in his neighborhood. He did not walk the streets alone, constantly asked for a drive back home from work or took a longer route to go home to ensure that he avoided contact with Mr. McKay.[9]In addition, Mr. Bill Pratt, the owner of the Habaneros Modern Taco Bar, whose business was broken into by Mr. McKay on February 26, 2013, filed a victim impact statement. While large parts of this Victim Impact Statement express his opinion on sentencing options, Mr. Pratt discussed the financial impact of the break-in. He pointed out that this break-in resulted in property damage which caused the business to be closed for a period of time. Since restaurants have a small margin for profit, being closed for even a short period of time can affect whether he can make the payroll for his employees.CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER:[10]The court had the benefit of a Pre-Sentence Report which indicated that Mr. McKay is a 22 year old, first time adult offender with no prior involvement in the criminal justice system. He is single at the moment, but has been with his girlfriend in an on-off relationship for the last three years and indicated that when he is released from custody, he plans to live with his girlfriend and her family.[11]Mr. McKay stated that his parents separated when he was very young and he has no relationship with his father who has been in and out of jail all of his life. He left his mother’s residence at age 17 or 18 and stated that the relationship with her was up and down and that she could be mentally abusive.[12]According to his mother, Mr. McKay has an issue with substance abuse. She also added that her son has developed a new group of friends and has moved away from the group of friends with whom he was spending time at the time of these offences. She also added that when her son is taking his medications as directed, she sees a huge difference in his behavior and it is “like night and day.” Mr. McKay said that he was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyper-Activity Disorder [ADHD] when he was in elementary school and he was put on medication. He stopped taking medication in grade 4 due to the side effects, but again took the medication for a short time in grade 7.[13]Mr. McKay has a grade 11 education. He has been working on and off since he was 15 years old, most recently with a waste management company as a crew on a garbage truck and a roofing company. Prior to that, he had worked at a fish plant, removed asbestos, did carpentry work, concrete work and worked for a moving company as well as other temporary labor services. Mr. McKay would like to complete his grade 12 education or a GED and then attend the Nova Scotia Community College to obtain certification for a trade in the oil industry.[14]In the Pre-Sentence Report, Mr. McKay said that he has a prescription for an antipsychotic drug and he was waiting for medication for his ADHD. He added that he ran out of his medications when he lost his job and could not refill the prescriptions, and then, he started using street drugs which he feels contributed to him being involved in the various offences. Mr. McKay confirmed that street drugs have been an issue for him during the last five or six years and that he used “hard drugs” such as cocaine, crack cocaine or dilaudids for the last two years. He also indicated that the most recent offences were alcohol-related and he has had alcohol abuse problems. He has had mood swings and personality changes, but believes that his mental health is now stabilizing because he has received medications while being held in custody and he is now motivated to take the ADHD medication.[15]During his submissions, Defence counsel filed several letters of support from the family and friends of Mr. McKay. The letters recognized that Mr. McKay was diagnosed with ADHD as a young person, had a difficult childhood and has had substance abuse as well as mental health issues. Based upon these letters and the presence of family members in court on previous occasions and again today, I have no doubt that he has strong family support in the community.[16]Defence counsel also submits that, since Mr. McKay has been held in custody, he has gained insight and has been accepted into the Harvest House residential program to address those substance abuse issues. In addition, counsel indicated that while being held in custody, Mr. McKay has been one of the people involved in the “Woof” program, attended school and he has not any institutional incidents. Moreover, since February, 2013, he has taken steps to better himself by taking advantage of the every program that was available to him at the correctional center. This period of time in custody has been a “wake-up” call and he realizes that he has several problems to address through the programs, counseling and medication offered at the correctional center.APPLICABLE PURPOSES \u0026 PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING:[17]In all sentencing decisions, determining a fit and proper sentence is highly contextual and is necessarily an individualized process which depends upon the circumstances of the offence and the particular circumstances of the specific offender. On this point, the Supreme Court of Canada stated, in R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 SCR 500 at paras. 91 and 92, that the determination of a just and appropriate sentence requires the trial judge to do a careful balancing of the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the gravity of the offence while at the same time taking into account the victim or victims and the needs of and the current conditions in the community.[18]The purposes and principles of sentencing are set out in sections 718, 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code. In this case, I find that the primary objectives are the denunciation of the unlawful conduct, specific deterrence of Mr. McKay and general deterrence of like-minded offenders, the protection of the public as well as to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender. In addition, there is no doubt that the principal of proportionality found in section 718.1 of the Criminal Code must also be considered in this case which requires the court to determine a sentence that is proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of the responsibility of the offender.[19]Parliament has also spelled out other sentencing principles in section 718.2 of the Criminal Code which must be considered by the court in imposing a just sanction which will contribute to respect for the law and maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society. Given the facts and circumstances present in the case, the court is required to increase or reduce the sentence to be imposed by taking into account any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender [section 718.2(a)].[20]In addition, the parity principle which is outlined in section 718.2(b) requires the court to take into account the fact that similar sentences should be imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.[21]Finally, the court must also consider, in this case, the totality principle which is found in section 718.2(c) which requires the court to consider, where consecutive sentences are imposed, that the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh. There is no doubt that this totality principle will be in play in this case and must be considered by the court in determining and imposing the appropriate sentence for a youthful, first time adult offender in relation to 10 separate charges which occurred over a two-year period.[22]With respect to the totality principle, in R. v. M (CA), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 SCR 500, the Supreme Court of Canada stated, at para. 42, that the totality principle, which requires the sentencing judge who orders an offender to serve consecutive sentences for multiple offences, is to ensure that the cumulative sentence rendered does not exceed the overall culpability of the offender. The court approved Clayton Ruby’s articulation of this principle in his Sentencing treatise which stated that the purpose is to ensure that a series of sentences, each properly imposed in relation to the offence to which it relates, is in aggregate “just and appropriate.” A cumulative sentence may offend the totality principle if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of a sentence for the most serious of the individual offences involved, or if its effect is to impose on the offender “a crushing sentence” not in keeping with his record and prospects.[23]In addition, in view of the fact that Mr. McKay is a youthful first-time adult offender, I find that it would also be appropriate to consider the impact of this sentence on his rehabilitation. This principle of restraint in imposing a first sentence of imprisonment was succinctly stated by Rosenberg J.A. in R. v. Priest, 1996 CanLii 1381 (Ont. C.A.) at page 5:“Even if a custodial sentence was appropriate in this case, it is a well-established principle of sentencing laid down by this Court that the first sentence of imprisonment should be as short as possible and tailored to the individual circumstances of the accused, rather than solely for the purpose of general deterrence.”AGGRAVATING/MITIGATING FACTORS:[24]In terms of mitigating factors present in this case: (1) Mr. McKay is 22 years old, he has no prior adult convictions or any prior youth court dispositions and as such, he is a youthful, first-time adult offender; (2) He has entered early guilty pleas on most of the charges before the court without setting trial dates; (3) Mr. McKay has entered early guilty pleas to consolidate several matters, thus saving substantial court time as well as the requirement for numerous witnesses to come to court in relation to these charges; (4) He has expressed his remorse for his actions and accepted full responsibility for them; (5) There is a generally positive Pre-Sentence Report and letters of support from members of his family which highlight his family support in the community and (6) He has worked on a regular basis at several jobs since he was 15 years old.[25]In terms of the aggravating factors present in this case: (1) The break and enter charge cannot be regarded an impulsive action as there was a prolonged effort to gain entry into the restaurant through the back door, damaging the security light and camera to conceal their actions and then gaining entry by breaking the front window; (2) The charges before the court result from 10 different and unrelated incidents which occurred over a period of almost 2 years between March 27, 2011 and February 26, 2013;ANALYSIS:[26]As I indicated at the outset of this decision, there are significant differences between the sentencing recommendations made by the Crown Attorney and Defence Counsel.[27]The Crown Attorney’s recommendation of a four-year global sentence, less any pretrial custody, is largely based on a recommended sentence for the robbery charge of 30 months together with 12 months consecutive for the break and enter charge, with recommendations for 15 to 30 days for the balance of the charges, most being served on a consecutive basis.[28]Defence Counsel has recommended that, given the fact that Mr. McKay is a youthful, first time adult offender, the period of presentence custody would be a fit and appropriate sentence for either the robbery charge or the break and enter charge or both of those charges. Assuming that his client was in a “time served” situation for one or both of those charges, then a lengthy period of time under terms of suspended sentence and probation or under terms of a CSO of imprisonment in the community would be a fit and appropriate sentence for all of the remaining charges.[29]Looking at the various charges before the court for disposition in this afternoon, I find that for the purpose of applying the proportionality principle found in section 718.1 of the Code, there is no doubt that the gravity of the robbery charge contrary to section 344 of the Code and the break and enter charge contrary to section 348(1)(b) of the Code are the most serious offences before the court. Given the somewhat unusual and apparently spontaneous manner in which the robbery was committed, I find Mr. McKay’s degree of responsibility to be slightly lower than would normally be the case for such a serious offence. However, with respect to the break, enter and theft charge, I find that Mr. McKay’s degree of responsibility for that offence is high, as I find that it required planning and persistence in a concerted effort by Mr. McKay to gain entry into the restaurant in committing this offence when his initial efforts to enter the building, had failed.[30]The Crown Attorney has recommended periods in custody of 15 days or 30 days for the balance of the offences. With respect to those offences, I agree with the Defence counsel that, for a first time adult offender without any prior youth court dispositions, a fit and appropriate sentence for the charges of failing to attend court would likely have been fines and then elevated fines, before some form of incarceration would have been imposed.[31]With respect to the one mischief charge and the two theft under $5000 charges, again, considering that Mr. McKay had no prior adult criminal record or any prior youth court dispositions at the time of those offences, a fit and appropriate sentence for those three charges would likely have been a suspended sentence with a period of probation to address any issues relating to Mr. McKay’s rehabilitation. At the same time, in dealing with a consolidation of several charges involving multiple thefts and multiple failures to appear, then the court must also be consider the principle of totality to ensure that the total combined sentence is not unduly long or harsh.[32]With respect to the assault charge on January 7, 2012, looking at the gravity of this offence from the point of view of physical injuries, I find that there is no evidence that there any physical injuries were suffered by the victim. However, I find that Mr. McKay’s actions did cause an emotional and psychological impact on the victim of the assault. Looking at the degree of responsibility for this offence, I find that Mr. McKay’s actions were planned and calculated as he saw the victim walking down the street towards him before he threw the cold coffee at the victim’s head. There had been no interaction between the victim and Mr. McKay before the assault, although the evidence established that they knew each other prior to the incident. In these circumstances, I find that this assault was essentially an incident of bullying and as such I find that Mr. McKay’s degree of responsibility for this offence is very high. In assessing a fit and appropriate sentence in the circumstances of this offence and this offender, I find that an appropriate sentence would focus on specific and general deterrence as well as denunciation of this unlawful conduct. With respect to this charge, I find that a fit and appropriate sentence likely have been to order a lengthy period of probation or a short CSO of imprisonment in the community followed by a lengthy period of probation.[33]With respect to the robbery charge, Defence counsel referred to several cases from other jurisdictions where the court concluded that a fit and appropriate sentence for the robbery of a store clerk resulted in a lengthy CSO of imprisonment or a jail sentence of less than two years. Defence counsel cited those cases for the proposition that those courts had concluded that a CSO of imprisonment in the community was both an available sanction and at the same time was also a fit and appropriate sanction.[34]In support of his recommendation for consideration of a CSO of imprisonment or a short period of incarceration for the robbery offence, Defence Counsel referred to the following cases:1)R. v. Otter, 2010 ABPC 218 (CanLII) - the court concluded that, in the circumstances of the case, this was not a “serious personal injury offence” as defined in section 752 of the Criminal Code as there was no use or attempted use of violence. The case involved a robbery by words. Mr. Otter was extremely intoxicated when he walked into a convenience store and went behind the front counter. The clerk warned him that he should not be there and Mr. Otter answered, “you should open your till, I am robbing you”. A short struggle ensued, the clerk wrestled Mr. Otter to the ground and he was held until arrested by the police. No weapons, threats or violence were used against the clerk, nor was anything taken. The court considered that these were “exceptional circumstances” of the lowest level of a robbery, there was full compliance with bail conditions and successful completion of the treatment. The court ordered a two-year less one day CSO followed by two years on probation;2)R. v. Pearson, 2012 ABQB 240 (CanLII) - the court ordered a two-year less one day CSO in applying the reasoning used in R. v. Ponticorvo, 2009 ABCA 117 (CanLII). The court held that, based upon the specific facts of the case, there was no evidence as to the size or shape of the knife or what the accused did with it other than hold it out towards the store clerk, he was not disguised or concealed in any way and was equivocal in his demand for money. In those circumstances, the judge concluded, at para. 47, that the accused’s actions fell “within the exception” mentioned in Ponticorvo that “not every threat with a weapon involves the use or attempted use of violence.”The court was referred to the decision of R. v. Griffin, 2011 NSCA 103 (CanLII), but concluded that Mr. Pearson’s case was distinguishable from the facts in the Griffin case.3)R. v. McLeod, 2010 ONCJ 354 (CanLII) - the accused was before the court to be sentenced on 2 robbery charges contrary to section 344 of the Criminal Code. Mr. MacLeod approached a clerk at a gas station and handed the clerk a note which stated that he wanted all of the money in the store and that he had a gun. On the first occasion, Mr. McLeod fled with $180. The next day Mr. MacLeod came back to the same gas station and handed a note to the attendant which read “I have a gun. I want $500 now.” Mr. McLeod obtained some money from the clerk and fled the store. He was arrested shortly after the incident and after search incidental to arrest, the police found the note in question on him, $100 in cash, but he was not in possession of a gun. The trial judge concluded that the robberies had an element of “an attempted use of violence” and therefore the accused had committed two “serious personal injury offences.”As such, a conditional sentence of imprisonment was not an available sanction and taking into account all of the facts and circumstances of the case the judge ordered concurrent 90 day terms of incarceration to be served on an intermittent basis to allow Mr. MacLeod to continue his treatment program for substance abuse.4)R. v. Kotelko, 2011 MBPC 76 (CanLII) - in this case there was unusual fact situation as Mr. Kotelko and his co-accused Ms. Lindell were boyfriend/girlfriend at the time of this incident. Ms. Lindell was the assistant manager at a store and they planned to have her boyfriend stage a robbery while she was in the store. Mr. Kotelko came in the store wearing a balaclava and had a knife in his pocket and went directly to the back office where he knew Ms. Lindell would be counting money. However, when he entered that room, there was another female employee with Ms. Lindell. He ordered both of them to the ground and said “I have a knife in my pocket.” To the unsuspecting employee, who had no part in the staged event, the robbery was very real and terrifying. There was no allegation that the knife was pointed at any one or used in the menacing way. Mr. Kotelko grabbed the cash, pulled Ms. Lindell out of the room and fled through a back door of the store. A few moments later, Ms. Lindell called 911 and falsely told the police that she had been robbed. The couple met later and split the $3000 cash that was stolen. In the final analysis, with favorable presentence reports and youthful first time adult offenders, the court ordered four months incarceration for each offender and a $2000 fine. In doing so, the court concluded, at paras. 156-157 that, based on the particular facts and circumstances of the case, a threat of violence did not involve the “use or attempted use of violence” for the purposes of section 752 of the Criminal Code in determining whether it was a “serious personal injury offence.”[35]During her sentencing submissions, the Crown Attorney submitted that, while the cases from other jurisdictions may be informative or even persuasive, they are not binding on this court. However, it is the position of the Crown that the cases of R v. Bourassa, 2004 NSCA 127 (CanLII) and R. v. Griffin, 2011 NSCA 103 (CanLII) are, in fact, binding decisions on this court.[36]In Bourassa, supra, the issue was whether a robbery had occurred on the facts of the case. The Court of Appeal noted that a robbery may be committed in more than one way according to section 343 of the Criminal Code. The robber approached a bank teller’s wicket and pulled out a note and told her, by a motion in a grunting fashion, that he wanted her large bills. He kept his hand in his pocket at all times. Although the bank teller could not see it, she assumed that he was holding a weapon of some sort. When the teller froze and could not hand over the money, the robber came across her wicket, reached in the till grabbed packages of bills and then fled.[37]The Court of Appeal held in Bourassa, supra, at para 7 that the difference between a “robbery” and a “theft” is that the “robbery is committed by confronting and intimidating the person whose property is taken.” The Court of Appeal added, at para. 15, that a trial court should examine the entire sequence of events in the incident without simply isolating one or two actions in order to objectively determine in looking through the eyes of a reasonable observer, whether the bank teller’s fear was reasonable. In Bourassa, the accused had a hood over his head, had sunglasses on and kept his right hand in his pocket when he passed a note to the teller. At the same time, there was the gesture and grunting sounds which made it clear that he wanted the large bills. Looking at the definition of “robbery” in section 343(a) of the Code, the court concluded that the clerk had been the victim of a robbery.[38]More recently, in R. v. Griffin, 2011 NSCA 103 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal dealt with the issue of whether the robbery had been committed with violence. Ms. Griffin was 21 years old, a first time adult offender on disability benefits with a history of mental health and substance abuse issues, all of which is quite similar to the circumstances of Mr. McKay. Just before 5 PM, Ms. Griffin entered a service station wearing jeans, a black hoodie pulled over her head and sunglasses. She unfolded a 10 inch knife and tapped it on the counter. The attendant asked what she wanted and Ms. Griffin replied “cash.”The attendant opened the till and asked “how much?” Ms. Griffin replied “all of it.” The attendant gave some cash and then Ms. Griffin said “the rest.” After receiving the balance of the cash from the till, Ms. Griffin fled from the store. The clerk followed her, notified the police and she was arrested a short time later. The trial judge imposed a CSO based upon the positive Pre-Sentence Report, the absence of a criminal record and the fact that he had concluded that Ms. Griffin had not committed a “serious personal injury offence” because no violence had been used in the commission of the robbery.[39]In overturning the trial judge’s decision, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal stated, at para. 22 that the term “violence” is not defined in the Criminal Code. In the facts of this case, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge had erred in making a finding of fact that violence was not used in the commission of this offence. The Court held in Griffin, supra, at para. 27, that as a matter of law, overt threats are not necessary to constitute robbery under section 343(a) of the Code. The court pointed out that all that is required to establish a robbery is an implied threat accompanied by reasonable apprehension of physical harm on behalf of the victim.[40]The Court also stated, at para. 30 of Griffin, supra, that the display of the knife in the circumstances of this case, which included the wearing of a disguise and the demand for money all constituted a threat of violence. The court also held that “the threat of violence in the circumstances of this case, was itself an act of violence” in concluding that the trial judge had erred in law by finding that no violence was used and that therefore no serious personal injury offence had occurred. Based on that determination, the court stated, at para. 32 that, “it follows that a conditional sentence was legally unavailable to Ms. Griffin” and that the trial judge had erred in imposing one.[41]In the Griffin case, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal recognized, at para 36, that robbery is a serious offence requiring an emphasis on deterrence and denunciation. “A first offender may expect a term of three years [R. v. Johnson, 2007 NSCA 102 (CanLII) at para 37]. However, “in exceptional cases,” a less onerous sentence has been imposed.” For example, the court refers to R. v. Benoit, 2007 NSCA 123 (CanLII) where an 18-year-old with an extensive record received a sentence of 2 ½ years less remand time.[42]In the final analysis, the Court of Appeal determined in Griffin that because the offender had made significant progress on her rehabilitation during the 16 months that she had been subject to the terms of the CSO, it would not be in the public interest to incarcerate her at that point. Instead, the Court of Appeal determined that the appropriate sentence of incarceration would be 16 months which was then deemed fully served and that she would then begin a period of approximately 32 months on probation.[43]As I indicated previously, the cases referred to by Defence Counsel from other jurisdictions are informative and persuasive, but they are not binding on this court. However, decisions of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal are binding on this court and must be considered in determining what would be a fit and appropriate sentence for the robbery charge.[44]Keeping in mind the comments made by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in Griffin, I find that, in this case, Mr. McKay displayed a black pointed object and made a gesture with that object at the clerk, just prior to or at the same time that Mr. McKay stated “this is a robbery” and then fled from the convenience store with a package of cigarettes. From those facts, I agree with Defence counsel that there were no other aggravating circumstances such as the wearing of a disguise, there was no statement or note that he had a weapon, there was no overt verbal threat to harm the clerk nor was there a demand for money from the till. However, I find that the facts present in this case do establish that Mr. McKay’s words and gestures with a black pointed object in his hand were meant to intimidate the clerk and thereby amounted to, at the very least, an implied threat of violence. Although it was not established that the black object in Mr. McKay’s hand was actually a knife, I find that the black, pointed object used by Mr. McKay was “weapon” as defined in section 2 of the Criminal Code, as that object was used “for the purpose of threatening or intimidating any person” in committing the robbery offence. I have no doubt that the implied threat, in these circumstances, caused a reasonable apprehension of physical harm on behalf of the victim, and as such, all of the essential elements of the robbery offence were established.[45]It is evident from several sentencing decisions which involved robberies, such as R. v. Leet (1989), 88 NSR (2nd) 161 (NSSC-AD) at para. 15; R. v. Johnson, 2007 NSCA 102 (CanLII) at paras. 32 to 39 and Griffin, supra, at para 36 that our Court of Appeal has recognized that robbery is a serious offence which is subject to a maximum term of imprisonment of life. Moreover, the Court of Appeal noted in those cases that, in imposing a sentence, the seriousness of the offence requires an emphasis on deterrence and denunciation.While there may be some “exceptional cases” where less onerous sentences have been imposed, the Court of Appeal has established that even a youthful first time offender may expect a term of three years unless there are some unusual or special circumstances or other mitigating factors that would lower that so-called “starting point” to two years: see R. v. Butler, 2008 NSCA 102 (CanLII) at para. 23.[46]Looking at the facts and circumstances of this case, I find that there was an implied threat of violence and that all of the essential elements of a robbery were established. However, given all of the circumstances of this case and the fact that Mr. McKay is a youthful, first time adult offender, I find that a fit and proper sentence for this robbery would be at the lower end of the range established by our Court of Appeal. In Griffin, supra, the court ultimately concluded, at para. 40, that an offender with a similar background to Mr. McKay who had committed the same offence as him in “the unique circumstances” of that case, would have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 16 months. Keeping in mind the parity principle and the proportionality principle, as well as the somewhat unique circumstances in which Mr. McKay committed this robbery, I find that the appropriate sentence for the robbery charge would be similar to Ms. Griffin, that is, a period of imprisonment of 16 months.[47]With respect to the next most serious offence for which Mr. McKay comes before the court for sentencing today, that is, the break, enter and theft of the restaurant business, since the Crown proceeded by indictment on that charge, Mr. McKay faces a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years. It is the position of the Crown that R. v. Zhong, [1986] NSJ No. 207 (NSCA) has established a three-year “benchmark” or “starting point” sentence for a break enter and theft involving a commercial premises. However, the Court of Appeal also noted in Zhong that the appropriate sentence may be one that moves up or down from that “benchmark” depending upon the circumstances of the offence, the particular offender and any aggravating or mitigating factors. Recently, our Court of Appeal has reiterated that three year “benchmark” for break, enter and thefts involving commercial premises: see R. v. McAllister, 2008 NSCA 103 (CanLII) and R. v. Adams, 2010 NSCA 42 (CanLII).[48]In this case, I find that the break-in at the Habaneros restaurant was the result of actions that were planned and took a concerted effort to eventually break-into the premises. In those circumstances, I cannot find that this offence was one that was impulsive in nature so as to lessen the degree of responsibility of Mr. McKay and given the circumstances of this offence, I find that the gravity of the offence remains high. Moreover, I find that it is a significant aggravating factor that the break, enter and theft at the restaurant occurred at a time when Mr. McKay had been recently released under the terms of a recognizance in relation to charges dating back to March 2011, which included the indictable offence of robbery, which were still before the court.[49]Looking the purposes and principles of sentencing which must be considered with respect to the break, enter and theft charge, I find that specific and general deterrence and denunciation of the unlawful conduct are the primary sentencing purposes to be considered. However, given the fact that there is a fairly positive Pre-Sentence Report and that Mr. McKay is a youthful first time offender, I find that it is also important to focus on rehabilitation of Mr. McKay as the Pre-Sentence Report does speak to substance abuse and mental health issues, which Mr. McKay has taken steps to address and wishes to take further steps to address in the future. Taking all those factors into account, I find that a fit and appropriate range of sentence for the break, enter and theft offence would be two years of imprisonment. Furthermore, given the fact that it occurred almost one year after the robbery charge, I find that the sentence for this offence should be served on a consecutive basis to the sentence imposed on the robbery charge.[50]However, keeping in mind the totality principle found in section 718.2(c ) of the Criminal Code that requires the court imposing a sentence to take into consideration the principle that where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh. That principle is also expressed in the principle of restraint which requires the court, in imposing a first sentence of imprisonment, to order a period of incarceration as short as possible and tailored to the individual circumstances of the accused, rather than solely for the purpose of general deterrence.[51]In this case, I find that ordering a 16 month period of incarceration for the robbery charge and two years consecutive for the break, enter and theft from the business premises would amount to that unduly long sentence for a youthful, first time adult offender. Having considered the parity, proportionality and totality principles with respect to break, enter and theft offence, I find that a sentence of 18 months of imprisonment would be, in the aggregate, a “just and appropriate” sanction. In addition, I find that it would be appropriate to make a stand-alone restitution order pursuant to section 738 of the Criminal Code in the amount of $1929.74 in favor of the Royal and Sun Alliance Insurance Company.[52]With respect to the balance of the other charges before the court for disposition this afternoon, when I take into account the principles of parity, totality and proportionality principle found in section 718.1 and 718.2 of the Criminal Code, I find that for the failures to attend court, those offences would have been addressed by imposing a fine and for subsequent offences an elevated fine. For the theft charges and the mischief damage to property charges, I have already indicated that a fit and proper sentence for those offences would have been to suspend sentence and order a period of probation.[53]As indicated previously, given all of the facts and circumstances relating to the assault charge, I find that a one-month CSO of imprisonment followed by probation would have been a fit and appropriate sentence for that offence. However, by virtue of section 731(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, I find that the court does not have the jurisdiction to fine and order Mr. McKay to comply with the conditions of a probation order if the offender is subject to a term of imprisonment exceeding two years.IS A CSO AN AVAILABLE SANCTION?[54]In analyzing this issue, it is important to note at the outset, that the criteria which must be established before a CSO would be available were recently amended by Parliament. The most recent amendments to section 742.1 of the Code came into effect on November 20, 2012.[55]As a result of those recent amendments, I find that issue of whether a CSO is an “available” sanction for Mr. McKay to serve a period of imprisonment in the community for the robbery offence, must be determined on the basis of the law as it stood on February 2, 2012, when that offence occurred. At the time of the robbery offence, section 742.1 of the Criminal Code read as follows:742.1 If a person is convicted of an offence, other than a serious personal injury offence as defined in section 752, a terrorism offence or a criminal organization offence prosecuted by way of indictment for which the maximum term of imprisonment is ten years or more or an offence punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, and the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years and is satisfied that the service of the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2, the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the offender’s compliance with the conditions imposed under section 742.3.[56]With respect to the issue of whether or not a CSO of imprisonment in the community was an available sanction with respect to the break, enter and theft charge of the business premises on February 26, 2013, that issue is determined by the provisions of section 742.1 of the Criminal Code which were in force at that time. The Safe Streets and Communities Act (S.C. 2012, c.1, s. 34) came into force on November 20, 2012 and amended section 742.1 of the Criminal Code dealing with the imposition of a CSO. As a result, whether a CSO was an “available” sanction at the time of the break, enter and theft offence which occurred on February 26, 2013, is governed by the recently amended provisions of section 742.1 of the Code which now reads as follows:742.1 If a person is convicted of an offence and the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years, the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the conditions imposed under section 742.3, if(a) the court is satisfied that the service of the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2;(b) the offence is not an offence punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment;(c) the offence is not an offence, prosecuted by way of indictment, for which the maximum term of imprisonment is 14 years or life;(d) the offence is not a terrorism offence, or a criminal organization offence, prosecuted by way of indictment, for which the maximum term of imprisonment is 10 years or more;(e) the offence is not an offence, prosecuted by way of indictment, for which the maximum term of imprisonment is 10 years, that(i) resulted in bodily harm(ii) involved the import, export, trafficking or production of drugs, or(iii) involved the use of a weapon; and(f) the offence is not an offence, prosecuted by way of indictment, under any of the following provisions:(i) section 144 (prison breach),(ii) section 264 (criminal harassment),(iii) section 271 (sexual assault),(iv) section 279 (kidnapping),(v) section 279.02 (trafficking in persons — material benefit),(vi) section 281 (abduction of person under fourteen),(vii) section 333.1 (motor vehicle theft),(viii) paragraph 334(a) (theft over $5000),(ix) paragraph 348(1)(e) (breaking and entering a place other than a dwelling-house),(x) section 349 (being unlawfully in a dwelling-house), and(xi) section 435 (arson for fraudulent purpose).[57]With respect to the availability of a CSO for the robbery charge which required an examination of the provisions of section 742.1 of the Criminal Code as it stood in February, 2012, I have come to the conclusion that this sanction is not an available option for the court to order. At that time, a conditional sentence of imprisonment in the community pursuant to section 742.1 of the Criminal Code was only available if the court concluded that the offender was not convicted of a “serious personal injury offence” as defined in section 752, there was no minimum term of imprisonment and the court imposed a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years.[58]After having reviewed all of the facts and circumstances of the robbery charge, I have found that Mr. McKay made an implied threat of violence in the commission of the robbery. Based upon the Court of Appeal decision in Griffin, I find that this robbery was, in fact, a “serious personal injury offence” as defined in section 752 of the Criminal Code as it involved the use or attempted use of violence against another person for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years or more. In this regard, I note that pursuant to section 344(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, the offence of robbery is subject to imprisonment for life. As a result of those determinations, I find that a CSO of imprisonment in the community would not be an available sanction for the court to order with respect to the robbery charge pursuant to the provisions of section 742.1 of the Criminal Code.[59]With respect to the availability of a CSO for the break, enter and theft charge on February 26, 2013, as I previously indicated, the provisions of section 742.1 of the Criminal Code were amended, effective November 20, 2012. In the most recent amendments to section 742.1 of the Code, Parliament has added several more limitations to the availability of a CSO for an order of imprisonment to be served in the community. As before, Parliament has stated that a CSO will not be an available sanction if the term of imprisonment is more than two years or there is a minimum term of imprisonment. With respect to the offence of break, enter and theft of a premises other than a dwelling-house, pursuant to section 348(1)(e) of the Criminal Code, the maximum term of imprisonment in the case of an indictable offence is 10 years. The Crown elected to proceed by indictment with respect to this charge and in reviewing the current provisions of section 742.1 of the Code, I find that a CSO of imprisonment is no longer an available sanction for the court to impose for a break, and enter of a premises other than a dwelling-house by virtue of section 742.1(f)(ix) of the Criminal Code.[60]Furthermore, with respect to the determination of whether a CSO of imprisonment in the community is available, I note that in R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1SCR 61, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that the conditional sentence is not available unless the judge is satisfied that the appropriate sentence for the offence is a custodial one of less than two years. While it is acknowledged that Mr. McKay has been in custody for several months prior to today’s decision, it is important to remember that pretrial custody cannot reduce the appropriate range of sentence to be considered at the first stage of the Proulx analysis when the court must determine whether a conditional sentence of imprisonment is an “available” sanction. The Supreme Court of Canada has clearly stated in R. v. Fice, 2005 SCC 32 (CanLII), [2005] 1 SCR 742 at para. 24, that time spent in pretrial custody is relevant only to the length of the conditional sentence, not to its availability. Time spent in pre-sentence custody in no way changes the gravity of the offence or the degree of responsibility of the offender.[61]For all of the foregoing reasons, I have concluded that the imposition of a CSO of imprisonment in the community is not an available sanction for either the offence of robbery which was the committed by Mr. McKay on February 2, 2012 or the offence of break, enter and theft from a business premises which was committed by him on February 26, 2013. Given those conclusions, I have determined that it is not necessary to conduct the detailed analysis necessary to determine whether it would have been “appropriate” to order a conditional sentence of imprisonment in the community and whether the court was satisfied that the service of that sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing.THE APPROPRIATE SENTENCE[62]At the outset, it is important to again underline the fact that the court is dealing with 10 different offences which were committed on several different dates over a period of almost 2 years. There are several offences where, objectively speaking, the court would certainly conclude that the gravity would be less serious than other offences, and as such, fines or probation would likely have been the outcome. At the other end of the spectrum dealing with the gravity of offences, Mr. McKay has committed two very serious offences, being a robbery and a break, enter and theft of a business premises. Given the fact that Mr. McKay is also a youthful, first-time adult offender and there are a number of charges to be addressed, this sentencing decision requires the court to take into account several sentencing objectives set out in Section 718 of the Code which are relevant in this case. As mentioned earlier those offences include specific and general deterrence, denunciation of the unlawful conduct and promoting a sense of responsibility for the harm done to victims and the community. The court must also be mindful of assisting the offender in his rehabilitation in imposing a just sanction to maintain a just, peaceful and safe society. Moreover, the court must also take into account the sentencing principles of proportionality, totality and restraint mentioned in sections 718.1 and 718.2 of the Code in imposing a series of sentences on a youthful first time adult offender.[63]Taking all of those purposes and principles of sentencing into account,I find that it would be “just and appropriate” to make the following orders:1)With respect to the mischief charge contrary to section 430(4) of the Criminal Code on March 27, 2011, I hereby order a period of 15 days in custody to be served concurrently with the sentences that I have ordered. In addition, there will be a section 738 stand-alone restitution order in the amount of $821.04 in favor of Mr. Scott Perkins;2)With respect to the theft under charge contrary to section 334(b) of the Code on December 7, 2011, I hereby order a period of 15 days in custody to be served concurrently with the sentences that I have ordered;3)With respect to the three failure to appear in court charges on January 16, 2012, January 24, 2012 and May 28, 2012, contrary to section 145(5) and section 145(2)(a) of the Criminal Code, I hereby order that his sentence for those matters will be one day which will be deemed served by his presence in court today;4)With respect to the theft under charge contrary to section 334(b) of the Code on December 13, 2011, I hereby order a period of 15 days in custody to be served concurrently with the sentences that I have just ordered;5)With respect to the assault charge contrary to section 266 of the Criminal Code which occurred on January 7, 2012, I find that the facts and circumstances surrounding this offence demonstrate that this was an unprovoked attack which occurred on the street as the victim walked to his house. In these circumstances, I find that, although the assault did not inflict any serious physical injuries, there was a psychological impact on the victim caused by Mr. McKay’s actions. However, if this offence came before the court for imposition of a just sanction without any other prior convictions, I find that sentence would likely have been a lengthy period on probation or a short CSO followed by a lengthy period of probation. In this case, I find that I must take into account the principles of totality and proportionality together with the relevant purposes of sentencing and the fact that I find that this was an incident of bullying which behavior must be denounced by the court. Having considered those purposes and principles as well as weighing all of the aggravating and mitigating factors relating to this offence and this offender, I hereby find that a sentence of 1 month of imprisonment to be served consecutively with the other sentences is a “just and appropriate” sanction in all the circumstances of this matter.6)With respect to the robbery charge contrary to section 344 of the Criminal Code, I have taken into account the principles of parity, proportionality, totality and restraint together with all of the aggravating and mitigating factors to determine the just sanction for this offence. For the reasons previously outlined in this decision, I hereby order a term of imprisonment of 16 months to be served consecutive to the other sentences of imprisonment that I have just ordered.7) With respect to the break, enter and theft charge, contrary to section 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, again, I have taken into account the principles of parity, proportionality, totality and restraint as well as all of the aggravating and mitigating factors. For the reasons which I have previously outlined in this decision, I hereby order a term of imprisonment of 18 months to be served consecutive to other sentences of imprisonment that I have just ordered. In addition, I find that it would be appropriate to make a stand-alone restitution order pursuant to section 738 of the Criminal Code in the amount of $1929.74 in favor of the Royal and Sun Alliance Insurance Company.8)With respect to the breach of recognizance contrary to section 145(3) of the Criminal Code which occurred on February 26, 2013 when, as a result of the break, enter and theft offence which occurred that same day, Mr. McKay failed to comply with the condition in the recognizance that required him to “keep the peace and be of good behavior.” In these circumstances, I find that the fit and appropriate sentence would be to order a period of 15 days in custody to be served concurrently with the other sentences that I have just ordered[64]As a result of all of the orders of imprisonment which I have just made on a consecutive or concurrent basis, Mr. McKay would be subject to a total term of 35 months which would be served in a federal penitentiary. However, as I have indicated previously, Mr. McKay has been held in custody since February 26, 2013. Counsel advised me that between February 26, 2013 and September 9, 2013 when the submissions were made, Mr. McKay had been held in pre-sentence custody for a total of 196 days.[65]However, as I have previously indicated in these reasons, Mr. McKay had asked to address all of these matters on June 25, 2013, but due to a very busy court schedule that day we were not able to address his matters and the earliest date that we could allocate the time for the sentencing hearing was September 9, 2013. At that time, I indicated that I was prepared to order under section 719(3.1) of the Criminal Code that, in my view, the circumstances justified granting him a credit of 1 ½ days for each day spent in custody between June 25, 2013 and today’s date. In the result then, I find that the presentence custody on a one-to-one basis would be 235 days as of today’s date with the last 115 days , that is, from June 25, 2013 being credited on the basis of 1 ½ days for each day spent in custody. Therefore, in addition to the 235 days which were accredited on a one-to-one basis of further 58 days should be added for the period which would be credited on a 1 ½ to one day basis, for a total of 293 days, which I find to be roughly equivalent to a period of 10 months of pre-sentence custody to be credited against the sentences that I have just ordered.[66]In the final result, on a go forward basis, I have ordered a total of 35 months of imprisonment to be served in a federal penitentiary, and after taking into account the 10 months of presentence custody, I find on a go forward basis that Mr. McKay shall serve a total of 25 months of imprisonment in a federal penitentiary.[67]In ordering this period of imprisonment in the federal penitentiary, based upon the Pre-Sentence Report, I trust that the authorities of the Correctional Service of Canada will assess Mr. McKay for substance abuse issues, mental health issues and anger management issues. While the Pre-Sentence Report was generally positive, I found that there were several areas that were identified by the probation officer where it was recommended that Mr. McKay get the appropriate counseling, treatment or programming to help him move forward with his life and a successful rehabilitation and reintegration into society. It is truly unfortunate that Mr. McKay did not actively participate when he was offered services and programs while he was under the auspices of the Mental Health Court. However, Mr. McKay has now taken several steps to address his long-standing issues and it is hoped that he will continue along that path while in custody and after his release.[68]Finally, in terms of ancillary orders, the Crown Attorney also seeks an order under section 487.051 of the Code as the robbery charge contrary to section 344 of the Code is a primary designated offence and the Break, enter and theft charge contrary to section 348(1)(b) of the Code which is a secondary designated offence for an order authorizing the taking of bodily substances for forensic DNA analysis. I will sign those orders momentarily.[69]In addition, the Crown seeks the section 109 Criminal Code mandatory firearms prohibition order, which in this case will be ordered under section 109(2) of the Code as this is Mr. McKay’s first conviction for an offence which would result in a firearms prohibition. I will sign this order in due course.[70]Given the fact that I have ordered a period of time to be served in a federal penitentiary, it would be an undue hardship to impose the victim fine surcharge on Mr. McKay for any of the charges that have been dealt with this afternoon.Order Accordingly,Judge Theodore K.

Hendrix (1999), 1999 CanLII 13907 (NL CA), 176 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 293, 137 C.C.C. (3d) 445 and affirmed in R. v. Renouf (2001), 2001 NFCA 56 (CanLII), 206 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 67, 160 C.C.C. (3d) 173, that the combined effect of section 731 of the Criminal Code and subsection 139(1) of the Corrections and Conditional Releases Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20 is that “[i]n a circumstance where a second sentence is imposed, while an earlier sentence imposed upon the offender remains unexpired, the two are to be treated as one sentence which commenced on the date that the first sentence was imposed and ends on the date that the last sentence to be served would expire in the ordinary course”.Where that unexpired “one sentence” exceeds two years, a probation order may not be imposed, and any probation order that may have been properly imposed, in respect of any prior sentence that is a component part of the “one sentence”, becomes invalid.[3]On November 20, 2007 the respondent, after pleading guilty, was convicted of several breaches of provisions of the Criminal Code.In respect of those convictions he was sentenced to a total of 2 years imprisonment.It was also ordered that he be placed on probation for 3 years following expiration of sentence.On January 16, 2009, at Moncton, New Brunswick, the respondent was convicted of a further breach of the Criminal Code.In respect of that conviction he was sentenced to 21 days imprisonment, consecutive to the sentence then being served.[4]The deemed “one sentence”, that results from those convictions and sentencing, exceeds 24 months.For the reasons expressed above, the probation order that was made on November 20, 2007, while valid at the time that it was made, became invalid when the second sentence was imposed on January 16, 2009.[5]Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed and the probation order made on November 20, 2007 is set aside. In all other respects the sentences imposed on that day remain unchanged.Wells, J.A."}

The second and third counts arose out of a search of a fortified residence, protected by a pit bull terrier where two men, including Mr. C.J.J., were arrested.Before the sentencing judge it was argued on behalf of the respondent that he was only 24 years old and was supporting a common law wife and two children aged 6 and 4 years. He had a grade 10 education and wished to upgrade himself in the area of computer technology. As a result of a motor vehicle accident a year earlier he was limited to a form of sedentary employment and required to follow a special diet. He had also suffered a very difficult upbringing as his father deserted the family when he was only 5 years old and his mother was an alcoholic. From the time he was 7 until he was able to support himself he was in the care of the Children's Aid Society and his mother and unfortunately during that time began to abuse both alcohol and drugs. He now wishes to turn his life around and since he had spent over a month in custody awaiting sentence his counsel suggested a term of 2 years in a penal institution would be appropriate.The Crown, however, pointed to a list of previous convictions, one of which was under the Narcotic Control Act and to the fact that the second offence to which he now pleads guilty was committed while he was on bail awaiting trial on the first count. Furthermore, Mr. C.J.J. was, on the day before, sentenced to a term of six months for a Criminal Code conviction for assault which the court was advised would have to run concurrently with any sentence then being imposed. The Crown suggested a lengthy period of federal imprisonment.As mentioned earlier the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 24 months in total.The Crown's motion for leave to appeal these sentences should be granted.This court has said repeatedly that the insidious dealing in cocaine by drug traffickers must be dealt with severely. The major emphasis must be on general deterrence when sentences are imposed. In our opinion the total sentence here was not sufficient in length to deter either the respondent or other persons willing to take a chance on trafficking to gain some easy money. In short, the sentence was unfit under all of the circumstances.We would increase the sentence for the first count to 12 months and for the second count to 24 months to run consecutively. The third count for possession of cannabis resin is confirmed at one month concurrent. The total sentence will therefore be increased from 24 months to 36 months which, in our opinion, is a fit proper sentence for the offences committed.Hart, J.A.Concurred in:Clarke, C.J.N.S.Chipman, J.A.CANADAPROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA1993Case # 112166IN THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIAAPPEAL DIVISIONon appeal fromTHE PROVINCIAL COURTHER MAJESTY THE QUEENversusC.J.J.HEARD BEFORE:His Honour Judge A.E.

C-46REASONS FOR JUDGMENTBurrage, J.:INTRODUCTION[1]On 17 May 2017 Pamela Pike was convicted of manslaughter in the death of Jason Skinner.On that date the Crown and defence provided a joint submission on an appropriate sentence.The issue to be decided is whether or not to accept that joint submission, and if not, what is a just and appropriate sentence in this case.background[2]Pamela Pike was charged with first degree murder in the death of Jason Skinner on 14 April 2013.Ms. Pike entered a plea of not guilty and her trial was to proceed before a judge and jury on 1 May 2017.On that date the jury was selected, but the trial did not commence.At the request of both the Crown and defence the matter was adjourned to the Thursday of that week, 4 May 2017.[3]On 4 May 2017 Ms. Pike re-elected from trial by judge and jury to trial by judge alone.The Crown consented in writing, and the jury was released.[4]While maintaining her innocence to the first degree murder charge, Ms. Pike stated her desire to plead guilty to the included offence of manslaughter.After reviewing the requirements of section 606(1.1) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, Ms. Pike’s guilty plea was accepted by the Court and her case set over to 17 May 2017 for facts and sentencing.The Crown confirmed that it had discussed the change of plea with the family of Mr. Skinner, as contemplated by section 606(4.1) of the Criminal Code.the facts[5]On 17 May 2017 the Crown and defence submitted an Agreed Statement of Facts, signed by counsel, as well as Ms. Pike, which the Crown proceeded to read into the record.The agreed facts are, as follows:1.On Saturday, April 13, 2013, Pamela Pike and Jason Skinner were using drugs together.The drugs included opiates and Ritalin.Mr. Skinner had just re-filled a prescription and was in possession of a large quantity of Ritalin.He was providing some of his pills to Ms. Pike.2.Ms. Pike was using the drugs intravenously at that time.3.After spending time together at residences of mutual acquaintances in Grand Falls-Windsor, including Ms. Pike’s residence, around midnight, Ms. Pike and Mr. Skinner went to Mr. Skinner’s temporary apartment in Grand Falls-Windsor, located at 5A 18th Avenue.4.After arriving at Mr. Skinner’s apartment Ms. Pike contacted Wanda Ash by phone at Ms. Ash’s residence asking Ms. Ash to come to Grand Falls-Windsor to hang-out and use drugs with her and Mr. Skinner.Eventually around 3:30 am on Sunday, April 14, Ms. Ash took a taxi cab from Queen Street to 5A 18th Avenue to meet up with Ms. Pike and Mr. Skinner.5.Through the early morning hours, Ms. Pike, Ms. Ash and Mr. Skinner were all using prescription drugs, mostly Ritalin that was being supplied by Mr. Skinner.At around 9:30 am Jason Skinner left his apartment to go speak to a friend.Ms. Pike and Ms. Ash remained at the residence while Mr. Skinner was gone.6.Mr. Skinner was gone for around thirty (30) to forty-five (45) minutes.During his absence, Ms. Pike and Ms. Ash began to talk about getting more Ritalin pills from Mr. Skinner by robbing him.This would be done by hitting him on the head with something to knock him out and then stealing the pills.A green glass 750 ml water bottle was identified by Ms. Pike as a possible weapon.An electric can-opener was also seen on the counter of the kitchen and identified as a possible weapon.7.Upon Mr. Skinner’s return, he went into his bedroom.Ms. Pike followed Mr. Skinner into the room while Ms. Ash remained in the kitchen area.8.Ms. Pike told Mr. Skinner that they were leaving.Mr. Skinner was upset to hear that.At that point, while both were sitting on the bed, Ms. Pike grabbed a 750 ml glass water bottle and she then hit him over the head with it.The blow did not knock Mr. Skinner out.9.Mr. Skinner reacted to this hit on the head and a struggle on the bed with Ms. Pike ensured at that point.Ms. Ash was standing in the kitchen looking into the bedroom where she could see the struggle.In response to seeing it, Ms. Ash grabbed the electric can-opener from the kitchen and threw it into the bedroom, striking Mr. Skinner on the back of his shoulder.10.Mr. Skinner’s attention then turned to Ms. Ash, who was still out in the kitchen.Mr. Skinner left the bedroom and went towards Ms. Ash.Ms. Pike followed behind him.All three were in a struggle at the apartment door.Mr. Skinner was yelling “Get the fuck out!”11.The struggle at the door involved Ms. Pike getting pushed to the floor into the closet, which caused the bi-fold closet door to break off its track.The struggle between all three at the door involved the apartment door itself being pulled open and pushed closed a number of times.12.In the struggle Ms. Pike grabbed a large kitchen knife, with a blade measuring approximately 8 inches, from the counter and waved it towards Mr. Skinner.Mr. Skinner attempted to get the knife from her and a struggle ensued.Mr. Skinner was unarmed before and during the struggle.At no point did he have control of the knife.13.In the struggle both Ms. Pike and Mr. Skinner fell on the floor near the doorway.Mr. Skinner sustained two cuts on the top of his head.The autopsy report describes these as incised wounds caused by an instrument with a cutting edge.There was one incised wound measuring 7 centimetres long to the right aspect of the scalp.Another incised wound measuring 6.5 centimetres long was observed on the back left of the scalp.14.The struggle continued inside the kitchen of the apartment and Jason Skinner was fatally stabbed in the area of his collarbone.The knife remained in that position.The autopsy report indicated that the blade of the knife penetrated 7.5 centimetres into the right chest.15.After the stabbing, Mr. Skinner retreated to the bedroom of the apartment.Ms. Pike and Ms. Ash followed him.He laid down on the bed, with the knife still protruding from his body.Pamela Pike was emotional and crying in the bedroom, saying that she was sorry.16.A few moments later, at around 11:30 am Cst. Rory Jeddore and Cst. Gregory Bowie of the RCMP arrived on the scene and knocked on the door, which was locked.17.After a brief delay of 15-30 seconds, Ms. Ash and Ms. Pike opened the door and walked out of the residence.Ms. Ash tells police “he’s a fucking psycho” and signalled towards the bedroom of the residence.Based on this, Cst. Jeddore believed there was a male still in the residence.18.To secure the scene of the apartment police told Ms. Pike and Ms. Ash to stand outside the apartment.Ms. Pike and Ms. Ash waited outside on and around the deck while police went into the apartment.19.Cst. Jeddore followed a trail of blood into the only bedroom in the apartment where he saw Jason Skinner laying on a bed with a knife protruding from his chest near his neck.Mr. Skinner had an empty pill bottle in his hand.When asked what happened by Cst. Jeddore, he said “she stabbed me to get my pills”.Cst. Jeddore asked who had done that.Mr. Skinner responded “the blond one, the tall fat one.”20.Cst. Jeddore went outside the apartment to where Ms. Pike and Ms. Ash were waiting.Based on Mr. Skinner’s description, Cst. Jeddore advised Ms. Pike of her Charter Rights and read her the police caution.21.Cst. Jeddore went back into the apartment and spoke to Mr. Skinner again.Mr. Skinner told Cst. Jeddore “she has my drugs in her pocket” and when asked who, he replied “the one who did this”.Based on that information, Cst. Jeddore went outside and placed Ms. Pike under arrest for assault with a weapon and searched her incidental to arrest.No pills, medications or drugs were found on Ms. Pike.22.Ms. Pike was visibly upset and apparently stomach sick.Cst. Jeddore transported her to hospital to get treatment for a cut between her thumb and index finger on her right hand, as well as shortness of breath.23.While at the hospital with Ms. Pike, Cst. Jeddore learned that Mr. Skinner died.An autopsy report cites the cause of death being a stab wound to the chest.Cst. Jeddore then placed Ms. Pike under arrest again.24.Ms. Ash remained at the scene for a while with Cst. Bowie.She was arrested, and to ensure officer safety a cursory search for weapons was carried out.No weapons were found on Ms. Ash.25.Ms. Ash was transported to the RCMP Detachment in Grand Falls-Windsor and placed in cells.A number of small white pills were later found leading to and inside a cell which had been occupied by Ms. Ash.26.These pills were identified as Ritalin.DNA from both Jason Skinner and Wanda Ash was detected on the pills.27.Of the three involved, only Jason Skinner had a supply of Ritalin pills at this apartment that night and morning.28.During the night of April 13 and morning of April 14, 2013, the individuals at Mr. Skinner’s home in Grand Falls-Windsor were injecting drugs including Ritalin, morphine, dilaudid.29.Ms. Pike is unable to estimate the quantity of Ritalin she had used leading up to the stabbing.During that period she also smoked marijuana.30.Ms. Pike accepts her involvement in this matter, in particular the stabbing of Mr. Skinner.Ms. Pike acknowledges that her stabbing caused Mr. Skinner’s death.32.Ms. Pike had no intention at any point in time to kill Jason Skinner.[6]The Crown called no further evidence and accepts that Ms. Pike did not have the requisite intent for murder.The Court agreed and on 17 May 2017 found her not guilty of the charge of first degree murder, and the included offence of second degree murder.[7]A person commits homicide when, directly or indirectly, that person causes the death of another human being.In the context of this case, Ms. Pike committed culpable homicide if she caused the death of Jason Skinner by means of an unlawful act (Criminal Code, subsection 222(5)).Culpable homicide that is not murder or infanticide is manslaughter (Criminal Code, section 234).[8]All unlawful act manslaughter cases have two elements in common; unlawful conduct by the offender which causes the death of another (the actus reus), where the offender does not have an actual intention (mens rea) to kill.Assuming the actus reus is proven, in order to convict of manslaughter, at a minimum, the mens rea requirement means that the Crown must prove objective foresight of the risk of bodily harm, which is neither trivial, nor transitory.[9]In the agreed facts Ms. Pike admits that in the course of a struggle she stabbed Mr. Skinner with a knife, causing his death.The struggle followed a botched robbery attempt, after she failed to knock Mr. Skinner unconscious with a bottle.[10]While Ms. Pike did not intend to kill Mr. Skinner, viewed from the perspective of the objective observer, the act of wielding a large kitchen knife in the course of a struggle and stabbing Mr. Skinner, subjected Mr. Skinner to the risk of bodily harm that was neither trivial, nor transitory.Based on the agreed facts, the Court was therefore satisfied that the Crown had proven the elements of the offence of manslaughter, contrary to subsection 236(b) of the Criminal Code.Accordingly, on 17 May 2017 Ms. Pike was convicted of manslaughter in the death of Mr. Skinner and remanded into custody for sentencing.the joint submission[11]The Crown and defence provided the Court with a joint submission on sentencing.The joint submission suggests that Ms. Pike should receive a sentence of seven and one half year’s imprisonment and that she receive a credit of one and one half days for every day served while in custody.[12]The Crown states that had the matter proceeded to trial it would have withdrawn the charge of first degree murder and replaced it with the included offence of second degree murder, there being no evidence that the death of Mr. Skinner was planned and deliberate.While the Crown submits that a conviction of second degree murder was possible, it concedes that its case was far from clear cut; a pre-trial ruling by this court excluded statements given by Ms. Pike, a key Crown witness (Ms. Ash) gave conflicting statements and would be the subject of a reliability warning (Vetrovec) to the jury, there were some inconsistencies in the dying declaration of Mr. Skinner (he had said that Ms. Pike had taken his drugs when, in fact, they were linked to Ms. Ash) and a jury previously convicted Ms. Ash of manslaughter.[13]On the other side of the coin, depending on how the evidence unfolded, it is at least conceivable that Ms. Pike could face a conviction for second degree murder, with its mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.[14]Considerations such as the foregoing were fodder for the resolution discussions and the joint submission.[15]In two recent decisions of this court, R. v. Fitzgerald, 2017 NLTD(G) 89 and R. v. Baker, 2017 NLTD(G) 90, Justice McGrath had occasion to review the legal considerations when the Court is faced with a joint sentencing submission.In Baker, Justice McGrath wrote (at paras. 7-11):7.In respect of a joint sentencing submission, the Supreme Court of Canada, in the recent case of R. v. Anthony-Cook, 2016 SCC 43 (CanLII), clearly expressed the principle that joint submissions should be accepted by the sentencing judge except in rare exceptional circumstances.In doing so, the court relied heavily on decisions of the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal,including R. v. Druken, 2006 NLCA 67 (CanLII) and R. v. Oxford, 2010 NLCA 45 (CanLII).8.In particular, at paragraph 32 of Anthony-Cook, the Supreme Court of Canada adopted the public interest test in determining whether a trial judge should depart from a joint submission.The public interest test requires the trial judge to accept a joint submission unless the proposed sentence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute or is otherwise contrary to the public interest.9.At paragraph 33 of the decision, the court referred with approval to Druken as follows:33.In Druken , at para. 29, the court held that a joint submission will bring the administration of justice into disrepute or be contrary to the public interest if, despite the public interest considerations that support imposing it, it is so \"markedly out of line with the expectations of reasonable persons aware of the circumstances of the case that they would view it as a break down in the proper functioning of the criminal justice system\". And, as stated by the same court in R. v. O. (B.J.), 2010 NLCA 19 (CanLII), 2010 NLCA 19 (N.L. C.A.) (CanLII), at para. 56, when assessing a joint submission, trial judges should \"avoid rendering a decision that causes an informed and reasonable public to lose confidence in the institution of the courts\".10.Further, at paragraph 34 of the decision, Justice Moldaver notes that rejecting a joint submission denotes that the submission is:…so unhinged from the circumstances of the offence and the offender that its acceptance would lead reasonable and informed persons, aware of all the relevant circumstances, including the importance of promoting certainty in resolution discussions, to believe that the proper functioning of the justice system had broken down.Justice Moldaver notes that this is an undeniably high threshold and for good reason.11.The Supreme Court of Canada acknowledged that trial judges should first approach a joint submission on an “as is” basis but secondly, should apply the public interest test when they are considering “jumping” or “undercutting” a joint submission (paragraph 52 of Anthony-Cook).[16]The Court is thus obliged to accept the joint submission unless the proposed sentence would bring the administration of justice into dispute, or is otherwise contrary to the public interest.Is the submission “markedly” out of line with the expectations of a reasonable public, informed of the circumstances of the case, such that to accept it would cause that public to lose confidence in the institution of the courts?[17]The answer to this question lies in a consideration of the principles of sentencing, as informed by the particular circumstances of this case, the antecedents of Ms. Pike and sentences imposed in similar circumstances.antecedents of ms. pike[18]Ms. Pike was 33 years of age at the time of the offence.After graduation from high school in Labrador she re-located for a period of time to Toronto, where she went to work initially with a family-run meat packing business.Unfortunately, she found herself in an abusive relationship and turned to drugs for escape.[19]After a period she returned to this province, where she was successful in upgrading her education; she obtained her tractor trailer and heavy equipment operator licences.[20]Ms. Pike then obtained work in Alberta.Unfortunately, she received a workplace injury for which she was prescribed opiates.Her addiction to prescription medicine escalated and upon her return home from Alberta, to quote her lawyer “she fell in with the wrong crowd”.She ceased work and relied on unemployment insurance for income.There were two failed attempts at addictions treatment in Humberwood, NL.[21]Ms. Pike has a prior unrelated criminal record which does not include crimes of violence.There are three convictions for theft under $5,000 dating from 2012 and eight convictions for uttering a forged document, all of which date from an offence committed on 18 December 2009.There’s a single conviction for breach of probation arising from one of the theft convictions in 2012.These were crimes committed by Ms. Pike to fuel her drug addiction.[22]While on remand, before obtaining bail, Ms. Pike attended programming at Clarenville for addictions and trauma.She informed the Court that it was her intention to enroll in federal programming with a view to getting off methadone and controlling her addictions.[23]Ms. Pike has been enrolled in the methadone treatment program for three years now, and remains in this program.In addition, while on bail Ms. Pike has been seeing a counsellor and psychiatrist, in an effort to control her demons.She is to be commended for these efforts.[24]Ms. Pike addressed the Court and apologized to the family of Jason Skinner for the pain and suffering she caused.She told the Court that she “wakes up every morning thinking about Mr. Skinner and his family”.It is not known when, if ever, the family of Mr. Skinner will accept Ms. Pike’s apology, but I am satisfied that it was honestly and sincerely given.[25]Ms. Pike has a loving and supportive family who have stood by her from the beginning.She will continue to need this support in the years ahead.the VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS[26]In this case Victim Impact Statements were provided to the Court, in accordance with section 722 of the Criminal Code, from the parents of Jason Skinner, Wanda and Melvin Skinner and two aunts, Mary Ellen Giles and Carmel Giles.Both aunts read their statements in court, albeit with some difficulty, such was their sorrow.[27]To paraphrase these statements in this decision would not do them justice.As the mother of Jason Skinner writes “The devastation that comes with the loss of a child cannot be captured in words”.It is apparent from the statements that the untimely death of Jason has left an immense gap in the lives of those who loved him the most.In the words of Jason’s father “Sadness spread throughout the family, who live all over Canada, and beyond”.[28]Victim impact statements assist the sentencing process by bringing home to the offender the consequences of his or her behaviour and alerting the Court to the very real damage done to the victims and community as a whole.Victim impact statements thus assist the Court in crafting sentences which acknowledge the harm done to the community and promote a sense of responsibility in the offender (R. v. Okemahwasin, 2015 SKPC 71 (CanLII) at para. 15).[29]At the same time, vengeance has no role in the sentencing process.Such statements must not serve to compensate grief through the imposition of a harsh sentence (R. v. Ralph, 2007 NLTD 42 (CanLII) at para. 19).[30]No sentence can compensate for the value of the life that has been lost.Rather, the objective is the imposition of an appropriate punishment for the crime that has led to the loss of that life.sentencing principles[31]As noted, a consideration of whether the acceptance of the joint submission would bring the administration of justice into disrepute requires the Court to assess that submission in the context of the principles of sentencing, as codified in sections 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code.[32]Section 718 provides that the fundamental purpose of sentencing is to protect society and to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society, by imposing just sanctions having one or more of the objectives set forth in that section.These objectives are to denounce unlawful conduct and the harm done to victims, or to the community, that is caused by unlawful conduct; deter the offender and other persons from committing offences; separate offenders from society, where necessary; assist in rehabilitating offenders; provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims or to the community.[33]I do not regard the need for specific deterrence as a significant factor in this case.While Ms. Pike has a prior criminal record, it does not include crimes of violence.Ms. Pike’s violent behavior on the morning of 14 April 2013 was fuelled by her addiction to prescription drugs, Ritalin, in particular, and was out of character for her.I would regard the likelihood that she will reoffend in the future as very remote.[34]That said, an innocent man is dead and the sentence to be imposed must be such as to denounce Ms. Pike’s conduct and deter others from travelling down the same tragic path.[35]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code sets out that the fundamental principle of sentencing is that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.[36]Proportionality is central to the sentencing process, as a sentence which properly respects this principle will at the same time ensure that the secondary goals of denunciation, restraint, promotion of justice for victims, and the maintenance of public confidence in the administration of justice are met (see R. v. Okemahwasin, at para. 21).[37]This principle applies to sentencing for all criminal offences including manslaughter.The appropriate range of sentence relates to the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.[38]In the case of manslaughter, in assessing the moral blameworthiness of the offender, the circumstances of the unlawful act are the most important factor.In R. v. Laberge, 1995 ABCA 196 (CanLII) the Alberta Court of Appeal stated (at para. 8):8.However, for sentencing purposes, a court is not limited to evaluating moral blameworthiness in terms of an offender's mental state. Indeed, it would be quite wrong to engage in that kind of a contextual analysis. That is because the offender's level of moral culpability will be influenced by other factors. In the case of unlawful act manslaughter, the most important of these will be what the unlawful act itself involved. The nature and quality of the unlawful act itself, the method by which it was committed and the manner in which it was committed in terms of the degree of planning and deliberation are all relevant to this inquiry.[emphasis added][39]The Court in Laberge then went on to identify three broad groups of unlawful acts which must be assessed (at para. 17):•Those which are likely to subject the victim to the risk of bodily harm which was neither trivial nor transitory.•Those which are likely to subject the victim to the risk of serious bodily harm.•Those which are likely to subject the victim to the risk of life threatening injuries.[40]When viewed objectively, the moral culpability of the offender increases as the risk to the victim increases.In each case, the moral culpability also increases where the offender is also subjectively aware of the risk.In other words, did the offender, knowing the probable consequence of the act, proceed recklessly in the face of the risk?If the offender knew that the act would cause the level of injury, or was willfully blind to this possibility, he or she is even more blameworthy.[41]On Sunday morning Ms. Pike did more than set out to rob Mr. Skinner, for the modus operandi of the plot required knocking him unconscious.[42]That the plan was anything but fool-proof would have been obvious to anyone not high on drugs.But by now Ms. Pike had been doing opiates and Ritalin all night and the previous day.The insatiable craving for more became too much.[43]Ms. Pike hit Mr. Skinner over the head with the bottle as planned, but failed to obtain the desired result.Instead, a struggle ensued between Ms. Pike, Ms. Ash and Mr. Skinner.During the course of this struggle, Ms. Pike grabbed a large kitchen knife and initially waved it in front of Mr. Skinner.As Mr. Skinner attempted to obtain the knife, the struggled continued, during which Ms. Pike sustained a cut to her hand and Mr. Skinner received two cuts to his head and a single (fatal) stab wound in the area of his collarbone.The stabbing brought the struggle to an end and there was no further gratuitous violence.The knife remained in Mr. Skinner as he retreated to the bedroom to lie down.Once Ms. Pike realized what had happened, she immediately began to say she was sorry.[44]The kitchen knife was not part of the original plan and its appearance was a spontaneous response to the struggle which was then underway.A struggle in which Mr. Skinner was perhaps understandably enraged, having first been struck on the head with a bottle and then hit with a can opener.Needless to say, Mr. Skinner did nothing to provoke the attack.[45]When viewed objectively, grabbing a large kitchen knife during the course of a struggle was an act which would likely subject Mr. Skinner to serious bodily injury, if not a life threatening injury.I agree with the Crown’s submission that under these circumstances Ms. Pike’s degree of moral culpability must be considered high.Aggravating and mitigating circumstances[46]Section 718.2 of the Criminal Code provides that a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence, or the offender.[47]The aggravating circumstances in this case are, as follows:•While Ms. Pike did not set out to kill Mr. Skinner, she did set out to rob him.The botched attempt set into motion the chain of events that led to his death.•Mr. Skinner was unarmed and in the sanctity of his own home when he was attacked.•A large kitchen knife was used in the attack, resulting in two cuts to Mr. Skinner’s head, before the lethal stab wound to his chest.[48]The mitigating circumstances are, as follows:•A guilty plea, particularly one early in the proceedings, may be considered a mitigating circumstance.The converse is not true, however, as the maintenance of one’s innocence cannot be an aggravating factor.In this case Ms. Pike plead guilty to the included offence of manslaughter, albeit, after the jury was chosen, but before the trial started.This plea was part of an agreement with the Crown which saw Ms. Pike acquitted of first degree murder.While the guilty plea came late, Ms. Pike’s acceptance of responsibility for unlawfully causing the death of Mr. Skinner has avoided a lengthy and difficult trial.Valuable judicial resources have been saved and the family of Mr. Skinner spared the ordeal and uncertainly that a trial brings.Under these circumstances I would regard the guilty plea as a mitigating factor.•I accept that Ms. Pike is very remorseful for causing the death of Mr. Skinner.Immediately after the stabbing she stated that she was sorry.Her apology to the family of Mr. Skinner was sincerely and honesty given.•Ms. Pike has a loving and supportive family who have stood by her throughout and no doubt will continue to be there for her in the future.•Ms. Pike has made a concerted effort to control her addiction and will continue to do so while in prison.case law[49]Subsection 718.2(b) provides that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences in similar circumstance.In other words, the principle of parity, that like cases should be decided alike.[50]That said, sentencing for manslaughter is a highly fact specific exercise, as the range of available sentences can be from a suspended sentence all the way to life imprisonment.This reflects the fact that the offence of manslaughter encompasses a broad range of conduct from what may be described as “near accident” to “near murder”.An appropriate sentence will depend on the specific circumstances of the offence and on the antecedents of the offender.[51]Recognizing that sentencing for manslaughter is highly fact specific, the Crown and defence provided the Court with the following decisions, as establishing the range of sentencing for manslaughter in circumstances similar to the present:•In Laberge, the Alberta Court of Appeal sentenced the offender to four and one half years imprisonment for the offence of unlawful act manslaughter in the death of his nine month old daughter.While attempting to change his daughter, Laberge “lost it”, striking her head on the concrete floor with such force as to cause multiple skull fractures and lethal brain injuries.The Court concluded that Laberge’s unprovoked assault was likely to cause serious bodily injury, when viewed objectively.The Court also observed that Laberge’s act was impulsive, without a high degree of deliberation and involved a single act of violence with grave consequences.However, there was no gratuitous violence involved.Laberge plead guilty after his preliminary inquiry and was genuinely remorseful.•In R. v. Marsden, 2004 MBCA 121 (CanLII) the Manitoba Court of Appeal reduced Marsden’s sentence for manslaughter from 14 years to ten years.In the course of robbing a taxi driver, Marsden grabbed the driver by his neck from behind.An accomplice of Marsden then proceeded to stab the victim, resulting in his death. The accomplice entered a plea of guilty to second degree murder.Marsden was guilty of manslaughter, as he formed the common intent to commit robbery with violence and any reasonable person would have foreseen the risk of harm to his victim.The Court found it a “critical fact” that Marsden did not bring weapons to the scene and did not know that his co-accused had a knife.Marsden was 20 years old at the time of his sentencing and while he had a criminal record, it was not extensive and contained no prior history of committing robberies or theft. That said, at the time of the offence he was out on bail in respect of mischief and breach of probation charges.•In R. v. Brisson, 2009 BCSC 1606 (CanLII), Brisson was convicted by a jury of manslaughter.He was 19 years old at the time of the offence.During an evening fueled by alcohol and cocaine he was attacked by another individual with a baseball bat.He grabbed a kitchen knife in response, stabbing his victim some 13 times.His excessive reaction went beyond what would be justified as self-defence.Brisson was gainfully employed and had no prior involvement with the law.Justice Joyce sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 58 and one half months for the offence of manslaughter.•In R. v. Ansari, 2009 BCCA 381 (CanLII) the British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld a five year term of imprisonment for manslaughter, following Ansari’s conviction by a jury.Ansari’s victim died of multiple stab wounds as a result of an encounter in a country club parking lot.The exact circumstances of the encounter were unclear, but Ansari was seen on a video camera dragging his victim’s body onto a grassy area.He then left the scene and attempted to cover his tracks by, amongst other things, sending two text messages to his victim’s cell phone.•In R. v. Dhillon, 2013 ABQB 365 (CanLII) Justice Jerke of the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench sentenced Dhillon to seven and one half years for manslaughter.Dhillon, who was the aggressor, got into a fight with his victim using a knife, similar to a baling knife used for cutting open packages and stabbed his victim eight times.One of the wounds, to his victim’s heart, proved fatal.Dhillon was 26 years old at the time.He had a positive pre-sentence report, with no prior criminal record, and was working as a truck driver.He pled guilty and was genuinely remorseful for his actions.Justice Jerke viewed as aggravating factors the repeated stabbing, which was not in response to any real threat of violence, and the fact Dhillon offered no assistance to his victim, but instead left the scene.In assessing moral blameworthiness, Justice Jerke placed the offence closer to near murder, than near accident.•In R. v. Green, 2014 NLTD(G) 49 Mr. Justice Goodridge, of this Court, accepted a joint sentence of six years imprisonment for manslaughter in the beating death of Green’s victim. Green, age 35, pled guilty to manslaughter after the jury had been selected, but just before the trial began.He was originally charged with second degree murder.Green beat his victim several times with his fists, fracturing three of his ribs, causing multiple abrasions to his face and head, and shutting off the blood supply to his brain.Green had a criminal record which was dated.There was no record of other criminal offences in the past 11 years and none involving violent crimes.•In R. v. Brinton, 2014 ONSC 5970 (CanLII) Justice Conlan, of the Ontario Superior Court, accepted a joint submission of five years imprisonment for the offence of manslaughter.Brinton was originally charged with second degree murder, but in a plea agreement with the Crown entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter, just prior to commencement of jury selection.The facts, as agreed, were that during an evening of drinking Brinton and the victim got into a fight, during which Brinton stabbed his victim once in the abdomen and once in the chest.The chest wound proved fatal.In accepting the joint submission Justice Conlan observed that based on the agreed facts, self-defence was at least a viable argument at trial and the case was not a “slam-dunk” for the prosecution.He accepted that Brinton was genuinely remorseful and treated his guilty plea as a “significant mitigating factor on sentence” (at para. 10).Brinton was 46 years old at the time of sentencing, with a good work history and an “old” and “completely unrelated” criminal record (at para. 18).•In R. v. Dick, 2014 MBQB 187 (CanLII) Justice Keyser, of the Manitoba Court of Queen’s Bench, sentenced Dick to seven year’s imprisonment, following a guilty plea to manslaughter.During an attempted drug transaction Dick struck the victim the side of the face, causing him to fall and hit his head on the pavement.Dick then left.Subsequently, his victim got up and fell down several more times hitting his head.He died in hospital approximately one week later.Dick, who was an aboriginal offender, was 20 years of age with a dysfunctional background characterized by domestic abuse and an early involvement with drugs and alcohol.He had an extensive criminal record for one so young, which included weapons offences, assaults, breaches and theft-related incidents.He presented a written statement to court professing that he was sorry, which, based on his intellectual abilities, Justice Keyser concluded was a “sham attempt to demonstrate any sense of true remorse” (at para. 14).As Dick was assessed as an ongoing risk to the community, deterrence and denunciation were viewed as the primary sentencing factors.Justice Keyser stated that he would have sentenced Dick to eight years imprisonment, but for the Gladue factors identified in the pre-sentence report.•In R. v. Corbett, 2015 ONSC 6118 (CanLII) Corbett was convicted by a jury of manslaughter in the stabbing death of his victim.The two engaged in an altercation, during which Corbett administered a single, lethal stab wound to his victim’s neck.Corbett left the scene and tried to hide the knife.He was 25 years old at the time with a minor criminal record, which did not involve crimes of violence.Justice Hambley sentenced Corbett to five years imprisonment.•In R. v. Plowman, 2015 BCCA 423 (CanLII) the British Columbia Court of Appeal affirmed two sentences of seven years imprisonment and a sentence of five years imprisonment for manslaughter in the “swarming” of a 21 year old.The victim left a bar and was attacked by the appellants, who together repeatedly punched and kicked him in the head and upper body.When the victim was turned over after the assailants left, it was observed that he had three stab wounds to his chest, two of which were fatal.The knife was never found and no evidence was led as to which assailant wielded the knife.The two appellants sentenced to seven years imprisonment were 29 years old at the time of the offence, with significant criminal records which included crimes of violence.The appellant sentenced to five years imprisonment was 23 years old at the time of the assault and had one prior conviction for assault.•In R. v. Bennett, 2016 NBQB 78 (CanLII), following a trial in which he was convicted by a jury of manslaughter, Bennett was sentenced to four year’s imprisonment in the stabbing death of his brother.His brother had developed a drug addiction and over the years came to terrorize his family.He got into a fight with one of Bennett’s friends and Bennett intervened, stabbing his brother six times.He was 18 years old at the time with no criminal record.Justice Christie found as an aggravating factor that stabbing his victim six times was a disproportionate response to the threat that existed at the time.•In R. v. Larson, 2017 ABQB 79 (CanLII) Justice Renke of the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta sentenced Larson to a period of imprisonment of five years and five months for manslaughter in the stabbing of his victim.In the morning, following a night of intoxication, Larson and the victim got into an verbal argument, followed by a physical altercation, during which Larson picked up a kitchen knife and stabbed the victim once in the armpit/shoulder area, severing his artery.Larson was age 23 at the time of the offence, with a lengthy criminal record, including convictions for crimes of violence; three assaults, one robbery, one attempted robbery and one possession of a weapon.He was remorseful and pled guilty.Justice Renke concluded that the swing of the happened-upon knife was unplanned and impulsive.[52]The foregoing authorities disclose a range of sentence from as high as ten years (Marsden) to as low as four years (Bennett).Considerations included the following:•The circumstances leading to the unlawful act, such as the degree of deliberation involved (the escalation of an argument (Larson, Brinton) and whether the act was impulsive (Laberge, Larson) as compared to a planned robbery (Marsden).•The degree of violence used.A single act of violence (Laberge, Dick, Corbett) as compared to a multiple stabbing (Brisson, Ansari, Dhillon, Bennett).•Antecedents of the offender, including whether there is a history of violent crime (Dick, Plowman).•Whether the offender left the scene (Corbett, Ansari, Dhillon).•Whether the offender plead guilty and/or was remorseful (Laberge, Brinton).other sentencing principles[53]Subsection 718.2(c) of the Criminal Code recognizes the principle of totality, by requiring that where consecutive sentences are imposed the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh.As we are dealing here with a single count of manslaughter this principle does not come into play.[54]Pursuant to subsection 718.2(d) of the Criminal Code, incarceration is used as a last resort, where less restrictive sanctions are not appropriate, and pursuant to subsection 718.2(e) all non-custodial sentences should be considered provided they are reasonable and consistent with the harm caused, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.[55]As evidenced by the joint submission, both the Crown and defence recognize that a just and appropriate sentence in this case requires that a period of incarceration be imposed.conclusion[56]Taking the principles of sentencing into account, the antecedents of Ms. Pike, the victim impact statements and the aggravating and mitigating factors, I am satisfied that the sentence of seven and one half year’s imprisonment, as jointly recommended by the Crown and defence, falls within the range of acceptable sentences for the offence of manslaughter, in circumstances such as that set forth in the agreed facts.[57]I am further satisfied that the sentencing objectives of denunciation and deterrence are met.At the same time, the sentence is proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of Ms. Pike.The acceptance of the sentence is not such as to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.dispositionManslaughter[58]For the offence of manslaughter in the death of Jason Skinner, Ms. Pike is sentenced to a period of imprisonment of seven and one half years.Credit for Time Served[59]The Supreme Court of Canada observed in R. v. Safarzadeh-Markhali,2016 SCC 14 (CanLII), citing its earlier decision in R. v. Summers, 2014 SCC 26 (CanLII), that a credit of one day for every day of pre-trial custody will “almost never” put the person on equal footing with those denied bail (at paragraph 1).Time spent in pre-trial custody does not count for the purposes of parole eligibility, earned remission and statutory release.[60]Therefore, Ms. Pike will receive a credit of one and one half days for every day spent in custody in relation to this matter, to be deducted from her sentence of imprisonment of seven and one half years, in determining the custodial term remaining.Firearms Prohibition[61]There will be the mandatory order under section 109(2) of the Criminal Code prohibiting Ms. Pike from having in her possession any firearm, ammunition or explosive devices (and any other items listed in section 109) for a period of 10 years and a lifetime prohibition on possessing any prohibited firearm, restricted firearm, prohibited weapon, prohibited device and prohibited ammunition.DNA Order[62]Manslaughter is a “primary designated offence” under section 487.04(a)(iii) of the Criminal Code.As such, there will be a DNA order under section 487.051(1) of the Criminal Code permitting the taking of bodily substances from Ms. Pike for DNA profiling and analysis.Victim Fine Surcharge[63]Finally, there will be a victim fine surcharge of $200 to be paid within 90 days of today’s date.The court officer will provide Ms. Pike with a notice in accordance with section 737(8) of the Criminal Code._____________________________Donald H.

Following his trial, I found him not guilty of possessing a loaded prohibited firearm.Circumstances of the Offences[2]On May 29, 2015, Mr. Adan was a passenger in a car that was shot at by unknown persons. The car was owned and driven by Mr. Adan’s friend, Adrian Hatami. Both Mr. Hatami and Mr. Adan were struck by the bullets and wounded. Mr. Adan and another passenger waved down a passing police car to help them. As the police car approached them, Mr. Adan attempted to dispose of a gun that was owned by Mr. Hatami by throwing it. The police found the gun, which had landed on the road several feet away from the car. The gun was loaded, although I found that the Crown had not proven that Mr. Adan knew that.[3]At the time, Mr. Adan was prohibited from possessing any weapons by reason of a s. 110 order made in 2012 following his conviction for theft under $5,000, uttering threats, and two counts of failure to comply with a recognizance.Legal Parameters[4]Both offences to which Mr. Adan pleaded guilty carry a maximum sentence of ten years in prison.Positions of the Parties[5]Mr. Stratos, on behalf of the Crown, submits that a total sentence of 30 months is the fit disposition in this case. After crediting Mr. Adan for the time he has spent in pre-trial custody, Mr. Stratos submits that a further sentence of 4½ months in prison followed by three years probation ought to be imposed.[6]Mr. Stratos also seeks a weapons prohibition order, and a DNA order.[7]Mr. Stastny, on behalf of Mr. Adan, submits that a global sentence of 12 to 18 months is the fit disposition for both offences. He also submits that in the circumstances of this case, the sentences imposed ought to be concurrent.Governing Sentencing Principles[8]In determining a fit sentence for Mr. Adan, I am guided by the sentencing principles set out in the Criminal Code.[9]The fundamental purpose of sentencing, as set out in s. 718 of the Criminal Code, is to \"contribute, along with crime prevention measures, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society\" by imposing sentences that have one of the following six objectives:1)denouncing unlawful conduct,2)deterring the offender and others from committing crimes,3)separating offenders from society where necessary,4)assisting in the rehabilitation of the offender,5)providing reparations for harm done to the victim or to the community,6)promoting a sense of responsibility in the offender, and7)acknowledging the harm done to victims and the community.[10]Any sentence I impose must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the responsibility of the offender: s. 718.1 of the Criminal Code.[11]I am also required by s. 718.2 to bear the following principles in mind when imposing sentence:❏the sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender;❏where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;❏the sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;❏offenders should not be deprived of liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate; and❏all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders.Circumstances of the Offender[12]Mr. Adan is 28 years old. He was born in Somalia, but came to Canada as a young child. He has five siblings ranging in age from 12 to 30 years. He resides with his parents, who continue to support him. He has a high school education, and limited work experience. He has worked in a call centre and doing manual labour.[13]Mr. Adan has a criminal record. In August 2012, he was convicted of theft under, uttering threats and two counts of failure to comply with a recognizance. He was sentenced to 75 days in prison and 12 months probation. In September 2012, he was convicted of assault, received a suspended sentence and 12 months probation. Finally, in April 2014, he was convicted of failure to comply with a recognizance and sentenced to 30 days in jail.[14]Mr. Adan has been in custody since his arrest on May 29, 2015 – 17 months.Aggravating and Mitigating Factors[15]I turn now to the aggravating and mitigating factors of this case, which I am required to consider.[16]The aggravating features of this case are obvious. Mr. Adan put the public at risk by throwing an illegal firearm, which turned out to be loaded, on to a public roadway. It goes without saying that the proliferation of illegal firearms in our community is an issue of grave concern.[17]Mr. Adan is not a first offender. He has three prior convictions for breaching a court order – two in 2012 and a further one in 2014. At the time of the commission of these offences, he had been released on a recognizance, one condition of which was not to possess any weapons. Mr. Adan appears to have difficulty complying with orders.[18]In mitigation, Mr. Adan is still relatively youthful. He has the support of his parents, who have attended in court. He has no firearm offences on his record, and although his criminal record is not envious, it is certainly not the worst I have seen. He did not use the firearm to menace anyone.[19]Importantly, Mr. Adan has taken responsibility for these offences. His intention was to plead guilty at an early stage of these proceedings. This was indicated to the judge who conducted the judicial pre-trial in the Superior Court and Mr. Stastny informed me that it was also his intention at the Ontario Court of Justice. The sticking point was Mr. Adan’s denial that he knew the gun was loaded. The fact that he has pleaded guilty, taken responsibility, and shown remorse, augers well for his rehabilitation.Sentences Imposed in Other Cases[20]I am also required to consider sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances. I turn to that now.[21]I have reviewed the decisions to which Mr. Stastny has referred in support of his position. Although the cases assist me in determining the governing principles that must guide my decision, a careful review of them demonstrates that sentencing is not an exact science. It is instead a profoundly individualized process driven by the unique facts of every offence and the unique characteristics of every offender. The circumstances of any case, including this one, can be readily distinguished from any other case.[22]What is clear from these decisions is that the sentencing goals of denunciation, deterrence and protection of the public are paramount in determining the fit sentence for firearm offences.What is the Fit Sentence?[23]Ordinarily, possession of a firearm in breach of a s.110 order by an offender like Mr. Adan, who has multiple convictions for breaching orders, would attract a penitentiary sentence. However, in the unusual circumstances of this case, in which Mr. Adan’s possession of the firearm was fleeting, a penitentiary sentence is disproportionate to Mr. Adan’s responsibility and the gravity of the offence.[24]Given Mr. Adan’s relative youth, his guilty plea, his prospects for rehabilitation, and the unique circumstances of this case, I am of the view that a global sentence of 21 months, before credit for pre-trial custody, is appropriate.[25]On count #2, possession of a firearm without a licence, Mr. Adan will be sentenced to 15 months. On count #8, possession of a firearm in violation of a s. 110 order, Mr. Adan will be sentenced to 6 months consecutive. The intentional violation of a court order that is made to protect the public must attract additional sanctions. In addition, Mr. Adan must be made to understand that court orders are to be complied with. For these reasons, I have made that sentence consecutive.[26]Mr. Adan will receive 21 months credit for the amount of time he has spent in pre-trial custody. I am therefore sentencing him today to one day in jail.[27]In addition, Mr. Adan will be placed on probation for a period of two years. In addition to the statutory terms, he will have no contact with Adrian Hatami and he will take any counselling for vocational or other issues as directed by the probation officer, and sign any releases necessary to permit his probation officer to monitor his compliance with this condition.Ancillary Orders[28]In addition, I make the following orders.[29]First, pursuant to s. 109 of the Criminal Code, I order that Mr. Adan be prohibited from possessing any weapon described in that section for ten years.[30]Second, given that Mr. Adan has been convicted of a secondary designated offence, I make a DNA order pursuant to s. 487.051(3) authorizing the taking of a DNA sample. Given all of the circumstances of this offence, and the relatively minimal impact that such an order would have on his privacy and security of his person, I am satisfied that this order is in the best interests of the administration of justice.[31]Finally, I impose a $200 victim fine surcharge on each count concurrent in keeping with the analysis of Justice Carey in the decision of R. v. Fedele 2016 ONSC 2305 (CanLII). Mr. Adan will have one year to pay that.___________________________________Corrick J.Released: October 28, 2016CITATION: R. v.

C-46 (the “Code”)) and luring a child via telecommunication (s. 172.1(1)(c) of the Code).A stay of proceedings was entered in respect of a charge of sexual assault (s. 271 of the Code) on the basis of the principle established in R. v. Kienapple, 1974 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729 (S.C.C.).[2]The reasons for entering the conviction were provided to counsel on the date of conviction.In summary, those reasons stated that Vergara-Olaya was a friend of the complainant's mother who socialized with the mother as well as the complainant and her siblings.At the time of the incident the complainant was 13 years of age while Vergara-Olaya was approximately 25 years of age.[3]As a result of certain information that came to the attention of the Winnipeg City Police, an investigation was commenced into internet correspondence between the complainant and Vergara-Olaya.[4]The internet conversations through the computer system between the complainant and Vergara-Olaya led to an encounter between the two in the back of a closed in truck near the complainant's home address.In the truck, Vergara-Olaya kissed the complainant and touched her breast with his hand under her clothing.The complainant testified that she had to physically resist his advances, but was able to leave the truck and return home.[5]At the trial of this matter, Vergara-Olaya gave evidence denying not only the fact that the internet conversations took place between him and the complainant, but that any encounter of a sexual nature ever occurred between the two of them.He continues to deny any involvement in the matter.[6]A pre-sentence report was prepared for the court.This report indicates that Vergara-Olaya has a close and supportive relationship with his parents and his siblings.He has no prior criminal record and is presently in a common-law relationship.He became a father in 2015.[7]Vergara-Olaya has completed grade 12 and obtained an auto mechanics diploma from Winnipeg Technical College.He has been employed by the same employer since 2010.He does not have a drug or alcohol problem.[8]The pre-sentence report notes that:Mr. Vergara-Olaya has no insight into his cognitive distortions leading to the offence and stands by his innocence. He displays no understanding of victim empathy and appears to be more self-focused than concerned about the trauma and long-term impact his behaviour will have on the victim.[9]The pre-sentence report also classifies Vergara-Olaya as a moderate to low risk to commit another sexual offence.[10]Both the complainant and her mother read victim impact statements at the sentencing hearing.[11]It is clear from the statement of the complainant that this incident has had a significant impact on her.She states that as a result of this incident she went into a depression and threatened to kill herself, but her mother stopped her.She said she cut her arms many times and blamed herself for what happened.She also hated every man and her mother.She states that it has had a significant impact on her social life, creating difficulties at school, with her friends and her mother.[12]In her statement, her mother states that the complainant has difficulty eating, she cries a lot, hardly speaks and is often alone in her room.[13]The penalty provided in respect of sexual interference pursuant to s. 151 of the Code at the time of the offence, is a minimum of 45 days imprisonment and a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment.[14]The penalty provided in respect of luring a child by means of telecommunication under s. 172.1 of the Code has a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment at the time of the offence, but there is no minimum period of imprisonment stipulated.[15]The purpose and principles of sentencing are set out at s. 718 of the Code.Those principles are relevant to every case in which a person is being sentenced.However, where the victim in a case is under the age of 18 years, s. 718.01 of the Code specifically provides:When a court imposes a sentence for an offence that involved the abuse of a person under the age of eighteen years, it shall give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence of such conduct.[16]In R. v. Sidwell, 2015 MBCA 56 (CanLII), 319 Man.R. (2d) 144, the court stated (at para. 53):It is impossible to list all the aggravating and mitigating factors that courts might consider. However, when weighing the nature of the sexual violation in a particular case, courts have looked to the following factors, among others:*The relative ages of the child and the accused;*The nature of the position of trust between the child and the accused;*The exact nature of the conduct involved;*The length of time the relationship existed and the frequency of the incidents;*Whether the sexual violations were accompanied by physical violence, threats of physical violence, or other forms of extortion or psychological manipulations; and*The impact on the child.[17]I would also note that while many sexual offence sentencing cases involve a consideration of how to categorize a particular sexual offence, in Sidwell the court observed that the Ontario Court of Appeal, as well as other appellate courts, treats cases of child sexual assault in a similar manner, regardless of the charge, for sentencing purposes.Steel J.A. states (at para. 45):... For example, in R. v. D.D. (2002), 2002 CanLII 44915 (ON CA), 157 O.A.C. 323, the court considered the appropriate range of sentence for adult offenders who engaged with children for sexual purposes. The court was unconcerned with the exact charges, describing them only in general terms as sexual abuse. Rather, it was concerned primarily with the nature of the sexual acts, the surrounding circumstances, and the effects such actions would have on the child. …[18]I agree with that approach.[19]In applying the factors identified in Sidwell, I would observe that the child in this case was in grade 7, sexually unsophisticated and below the age of sexual consent at the time of the offences.She was not legally capable of consenting and Vegara-Olaya knew her age as a result of his social interaction with the child, her siblings and her mother.In comparison, the accused was in his mid-twenties and had obtained a high school diploma as well as a post-secondary diploma.As noted in the pre-sentence report, he was sexually active with numerous partners.[20]Although there was not a position of trust between Vergara-Olaya and the complainant, he was a family friend who because of that friendship was able to build on that relationship in order to communicate with the complainant over the computer.He took advantage of that relationship in order to commit the offences.[21]On the basis of the evidence before me, I found that the sexual assault that did occur was more in the nature of an indecent assault.It involved touching the complainant’s breast with his hand while they were together in the back of a truck.[22]There was only one incident of sexual assault; however, this was not a spontaneous or spur of the moment assault.It was deliberate and planned as evidenced by the computer conversations that preceded and followed the incident.On the basis of those computer conversations, there is no question that had the opportunity presented itself again, or had the complainant not physically resisted the accused during the incident, the sexual assault would have progressed on that occasion or thereafter.[23]The sexual offence in this case was not accompanied by physical violence, threats of physical violence or extortion on the part of the accused.It is clear however, that the accused was attempting to psychologically manipulate this child in the course of the computer conversations in order to initiate a sexual relationship with her.[24]As stated earlier in these reasons, and as evidenced by her victim impact statement, the adverse impact on the complainant has been significant in terms of her relationship with her mother, her friends and on her self-esteem.[25]The Crown submits that a consideration of the factors in this case require a sentence with a starting point of four to five years imprisonment.Its submission is that there should be a sentence of three years for the offence of sexual interference and a consecutive two year sentence on the luring charge.[26]Counsel for Vergara-Olaya submits that the sentence should be a term of 90 days to be served intermittently for the offence of sexual interference and a one year conditional sentence to be served in the community on the luring charge.Furthermore, he submits that the court should impose a period of probation with appropriate conditions and that these measures would address the principles of denunciation and deterrence.[27]In support of this position, counsel states that Vergara-Olaya has no prior criminal record and there has been no reoffending behaviour since this incident.He states that the offending behaviour is limited to these facts and that he is of low risk to offend.He notes that as a result of these charges, Vergara-Olaya’s son was temporarily apprehended by Child and Family Services before being returned.He also lost employment as a result of these charges.[28]He further states that the sexual assault is in the nature of an indecent assault as opposed to an attempted rape and that this involved one act that was not repeated.He states that this did not involve a breach of trust and there was no physical violence on the part of the accused.The conduct stopped before the police became involved.[29]Counsel states that the incident itself was of short duration and that there were no threats or efforts to quiet the complainant.[30]In my opinion, the sentence proposed by counsel for Vergara-Olaya does not address the requirements of denunciation and deterrence when dealing with a case of abuse where the victim is under the age of 18.At the same time I am also of the opinion that while the Sidwell case is very helpful when considering an appropriate sentence in cases of sexual abuse, I do not agree that this is a case that warrants a sentence in the range of four to five years.[31]I am of the opinion that a consideration of the factors in Sidwell and the personal background of Vergara-Olaya justify the imposition of a term of incarceration in a gaol rather than a period of incarceration in prison.A sentence of less than two years would also permit the imposition of a period of probation, which in my opinion would benefit Vergara-Olaya.[32]Accordingly, I am imposing a sentence of two years less a day incarceration on the charge of sexual interference.I am imposing a sentence of one year incarceration in respect of the offence of luring, to be served concurrently.[33]There will be a two year period of probation following his release from gaol.The terms of the order of probation are as follows:a)he will keep the peace and be of good behaviour;b)he shall not contact the complainant, her mother or her siblings;c)he will report to a probation officer within 14 days of his release from custody; and;d)he will attend counselling, treatment or courses as directed by his probation officer.[34]In terms of the ancillary orders:a)Vergara-Olaya will provide a sample of his DNA within 14 days (s. 487.051(1) of the Code);b)he will comply with SOIRA for a period of 20 years (s. 490.013(2)(b) of the Code);c)he will be prohibited from owning or possessing firearms or weapons for 10 years (s. 109 of the Code);d)he will not communicate, directly or indirectly, with the complainant or her mother or her siblings while he is in custody (s. 743.21(1) of the Code); ande)he will pay a $200 victim surcharge within 90 days of his release from custody (s. 737(2)(b)(ii) of the Code).[35]Finally, the Crown has asked for an order under s. 161(d) of the Code.There will be an order that Vergara-Olaya not use the internet or other digital networks to access any social media sites in order to communicate with a person under the age of 18 years, for a period of 10 years following his release from custody.J."}

T.Date: 1996-06-12D. Bradford Wicks, for the Appellant;Harold Porter, for the Respondent.O’Neill, J.A. (Gushue, C.J.N., Concurring) - See Paragraphs 1 to 12;Steele, J.A., Dissenting - See Paragraphs 13 to 15.(File No. 1992 No. 256)June 12, 1996.[1]O’Neill, J.A.: This is an application for leave to appeal and, if leave be granted, an appeal from sentences of five years and three years imposed on the appellant following his conviction in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland, before a jury, for sexual assault, contrary to s. 271(l)(a) of the Criminal Code, and defamatory libel, contrary to s. 300 of the Criminal Code, respectively, the said sentences to be served consecutively.[2]There were basically three incidents giving rise to the charge of indecent assault which, according to the evidence of the complainant, occurred during the latter part of 1991, at which time the complainant was 18 years old and the appellant was 44. The complainant was a friend of the appellant’s daughter.[3]In the first incident, the complainant had gone to the appellant’s house and asked him for a drive to a shopping centre where she was to meet his daughter. Instead of driving to the centre, the appellant drove to a secluded place where he forcibly removed some of the complainant’s clothing and attempted to have sexual intercourse with her. The second incident occurred after the appellant had telephoned the complainant and asked her to go for a drive. She agreed. According to the complainant, the appellant was very angry. He drove to the same area as in the previous incident and again, there was a forced removal of some of the complainant’s clothing and he attempted to have sexual intercourse with her. Following the second incident, the appellant telephoned the complainant on several occasions and approximately three or four weeks after the second incident, the complainant, at the appellant’s invitation, again went for a drive in the appellant’s motor vehicle. He drove to a parking lot. Again, there was the forced removal of some of the complainant’s clothing and sexual intercourse occurred, which, according to the complainant, lasted approximately thirty seconds.[4]The basis of the defamatory libel charge was graffiti found in several places in the St. John’s area including on the doors and walls of cubicles in shopping centre washrooms, the side of a house, the walls of a shopping plaza and on sidewalks. The graffiti consisted of statements accusing the complainant of promiscuity and prostitution and stated that she had AIDS.[5]Counsel for the appellant argued that each of the sentences imposed was excessive and further, that the trial judge did not properly apply the principle of totality.[6]Counsel for the Crown argued that the trial judge had properly considered the principles of sentencing and that, although the sentences were high, they were not outside the range of sentences imposed in similar circumstances. In his submission, he outlined that the appellant had a criminal record dating back to 1970 which included convictions for sexual offences. Further, Crown counsel argued that the defendant had not shown any remorse and had denied having committed any of the offences with which he was charged. Actually, the appellant had pleaded not guilty at trial but had not given evidence. His denial of having committed the offences was in reply to the trial judge when he was asked if he had anything to say before sentence was imposed.[7]We do not minimize the seriousness of the offences of which the appellant has been convicted but we are all of the opinion that the sentences imposed are excessive.[8]The appellant has a criminal record but that in itself, while being a factor to be taken into consideration, must not result in the imposition of a sentence which is outside the acceptable range.[9]With respect to the sexual assault conviction, its circumstances were not such as to warrant a sentence of five years. That sentence is excessive.[10]With respect to the defamatory libel, the statements made by and in the graffiti, and particularly those with respect to the complainant having AIDS, are serious and must have been very damaging and hurtful to the complainant. However, the three year sentence imposed is excessive.[11]Leave to appeal is granted.[12]It now becomes the function of this court to impose fit sentences. In my view, a fit sentence to be imposed for the sexual assault is three years; a fit sentence with respect to the defamatory libel is one year. These sentences are to be served consecutively for a total of four years. In arriving at these sentences, I have considered the principle of totality.[13]Steele, J.A. [dissenting] [orally]: I am in agreement with Mr. Justice O’Neill’s opinion that the sentences of the trial judge of five years for the sexual assault (s. 271(1)(a)) and three years for defamatory libel, (s. 300) are, on the facts and circumstances, excessive - manifestly excessive. I agree therefore that the sentences are not fit sentences and must be reduced.[14]Accordingly, in respect to the sexual assault I would impose a sentence of three and a half years and for the defamatory libel, that in my opinion was malicious and intended to be insulting, injure the complainant’s reputation and expose her to contempt and ridicule, I would impose a sentence of one and a half years. The sentences are to be served consecutively.[15]In arriving at these two sentences I have considered the totality principle and have concluded that five years is a fit and proper sentence.Appeal allowed."}

We have before us a relatively serious sexual assault involving criminal misconduct on a young girl. Her testimony indicated that the criminal conduct began when she was about six years of age and continued to a time when she was about ten years of age. Furthermore, the appellant, who was living with the girl's mother, occupied a position of trust.[3]Given the position of the Crown at trial as well as what has been placed before us this morning by Mr. MacIsaac, we are prepared to exercise a measure of leniency by increasing this sentence to only two years less a day.[4]The Crown appeal is allowed and the sentence is increased to a term of imprisonment for two years less a day.Appeal allowed."}

He had been under constant surveillance by the OPP and Toronto Police Service during the short time he was in the community. Accordingly, the police observed Mr. Marsh entering the Bank of Montreal, masked, brandishing the pellet gun.[3]On the guilty plea, the Crown called a teller, Albert Bui. He testified that he observed the defendant enter the bank wearing a mask and yelling, “This is a robbery.” The defendant pointed the gun at Mr. Bui, who handed over between $1300 and $1600 in cash. Mr. Bui thought he was going to die.[4]Since he was under surveillance, the police observed Mr. Marsh to run from the bank, enter a car he had stolen, and drive to his van nearby where he was arrested in possession of the imitation handgun.[5]When the case appeared before me on April 16, the Crown made its intention clear that they would be pursuing a Dangerous Offender designation pursuant to s. 753 of the Criminal Code. The matter was remanded to obtain a psychiatric assessment, pursuant to s. 752.1, and approval of the Attorney General. Although I have no transcripts that record the subsequent remands over the next five years, it became a frustrating exercise in delay to schedule the Dangerous Offender application proceeding. Much of the delay was beyond the defendant’s control in that another lawyer had to take over his case, and a report from a defence psychiatrist was delayed. Finally, the application was heard over four days in late May, and early June, 2014.Dangerous Offender Application[6]Section 753.(1) is, as follows:753.(1) On application made under this Part after an assessment report is filed under subsection 752.1(2), the court shall find the offender to be a dangerous offender if it is satisfied(a) that the offence for which the offender has been convicted is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph (a) of the definition of that expression in section 752 and the offender constitutes a threat to the life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons on the basis of evidence establishing(i) a pattern of repetitive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, showing a failure to restrain his or her behaviour and a likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons, or inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons, through failure in the future to restrain his or her behaviour,(ii) a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour by the offender, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, showing a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the offender respecting the reasonably foreseeable consequences to other persons of his or her behaviour, or(iii) any behaviour by the offender, associated with the offence for which he or she has been convicted, that is of such a brutal nature as to compel the conclusion that the offender’s behaviour in the future is unlikely to be inhibited by normal standards of behavioural restraint; or(b) that the offence for which the offender has been convicted is a serious personal injury offence described in paragraph (b) of the definition of that expression in section 752 and the offender, by his or her conduct in any sexual matter including that involved in the commission of the offence for which he or she has been convicted, has shown a failure to control his or her sexual impulses and a likelihood of causing injury, pain or other evil to other persons through failure in the future to control his or her sexual impulses.[7]I heard from a forensic psychiatrist on staff at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Dr. Treena Wilkie, and the area director of the Toronto East Parole office, Ms. Sherri Rousell. The defendant spoke to the Court before a finding was made. Mr. Marsh is now 50 years old. I accepted the evidence in its totality from both Dr. Wilkie and Ms. Rousell. Both were knowledgeable, comprehensive, balanced and compelling.[8]On June 23, 2014, I concluded that Mr. Marsh met the definition in s. 753.(1)(a) and, as a result, I found him to be a Dangerous Offender. This was not a close call.Serious Personal Injury Offence[9]The robbery count was conceded by the defendant to be a serious personal injury offence as defined in s. 752. “Serious personal injury offence” means:(a) an indictable offence, other than high treason, treason, first degree murder second degree murder, involving(i)the use or attempted use of violence against another person, or(ii) conduct endangering or likely to endanger the life or safety of another person or inflicting or likely to inflict severe psychological damage upon another person,and for which the offender may be sentenced to imprisonment for ten years or more, or …[10]Robbery with an imitation handgun involves the use of violence. Alternatively, it is conduct that inflicts or is likely to inflict severe psychological damage upon another person. In this case, that psychological damage was inflicted on the bank teller. I find it to be severe.Repetitive Behaviour[11]In my view, the evidence establishes a repetitive pattern which illustrates an obvious failure to restrain his bank robbing activities. The repetitive pattern is starkly evident from the many related entries on his lengthy CPIC criminal record:•Armed RobberyOctober 17, 19885.5 years-the defendant robbed a bank with a sawed-off shotgun;-he did so while in possession of a stolen car.•Armed RobberyMay 23, 19917 years-the defendant robbed a Canada Trust on September 22, 1990, masked and armed with a pullet gun;-the defendant was on day parole from the previous robbery sentence;-the defendant fled in an automobile and was involved in a multiple vehicle collision;-the defendant jumped into a citizen’s vehicle and told her to drive.•Attempted Armed RobberyJanuary 23, 20014 yearsTheft Under-on June 21, 2000, the defendant was under surveillance by Edmonton Police;-the defendant was on parole from the previous robbery;-the defendant was arrested near the Canada Trust Bank with an unloaded, sawed-off shotgun in a van lent to him by his mother;-the defendant stole a car and circled the bank three times.•Armed RobberyJune 8, 20045.5 yearsFlight from Police-the defendant robbed a McDonalds while masked and armed with a butcher’s knife;-the defendant fled in a stolen car and took police on a 4-kilometre-long, high speed chase, wherein a 4-vehicle accident occurred after he disobeyed a red light.[12]One of the routes available for a finding of dangerous offender is through repetitive behaviour, which illustrates a failure to restrain his behaviour. If there is a likelihood of causing death or injury to other persons, or a likelihood of inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons through a failure to restrain that behaviour in the future, one could conclude that the defendant constitutes a threat to life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons.[13]Since Mr. March has carried a weapon into banks (4) and a restaurant in the past to commit robbery, yet he has physically hurt no-one inside, it would be difficult to conclude a likelihood of him causing death or physical injury to other persons in the future. However, equally so, there is very strong likelihood that his inability to restrain his behaviour will inflict severe psychological damage to others in the future.[14]As a result, the evidence establishes that the offender constitutes a threat to life, safety or physical or mental well-being of other persons. Because this robbery is a serious personal injury offence and part of the pattern, it is clear that the defendant meets the definition of dangerous offender in s. 753.(1), and I so find that he is a dangerous offender.Aggressive Behaviour[15]Although not necessary for designation, 753.(1)(a)(ii) provides a similar route to a finding of dangerousness if there is a pattern of persistent aggressive behaviour showing a substantial degree of indifference for the consequences of his behaviour to other persons. Again, while he has never physically hurt anyone during the armed robberies, it is difficult to define his persistent behaviour as anything but aggressive. If 753.(1)(a)(i) was not available, I would make a dangerous offender finding on the basis of 753.(1)(a)(ii).Police Chase[16]In this case, the defendant was arrested before he could drive away in his motor vehicle, and therefore does not face any driving related charges, which does not allow me to include driving behaviours in the calculus (there is a requirement that the defendant be convicted of a present offence which is part of the pattern). That said, on two prior occasions, after bank robberies, the defendant has initiated a police chase which resulted in multi-car collisions. In my view, this presents the greatest risk for physical harm or death from his repetitive, aggressive criminal behaviour. Again, since no driving offences are “present offences,” I cannot consider that risk in determining this application.Sentencing753.(4) If the court finds an offender to be a dangerous offender, it shall(a) impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period;(b) impose a sentence for the offence for which the offender has been convicted — which must be a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of two years — and order that the offender be subject to long-term supervision for a period that does not exceed 10 years; or(c) impose a sentence for the offence for which the offender has been convicted.(4.1) The court shall impose a sentence of detention in a penitentiary for an indeterminate period unless it is satisfied by the evidence adduced during the hearing of the application that there is a reasonable expectation that a lesser measure under paragraph (4)(b) or (c) will adequately protect the public against the commission by the offender of murder or a serious personal injury offence.[17]Dr. Wilkie responded to an assessment order pursuant to s. 752.1 of the Criminal Code by compiling a 108-page report dated August 17, 2009. She conducted three psychiatric interviews with the defendant, reviewed a psychological assessment report prepared by two psychologists, and consulted numerous correctional and criminal records. Since the application took an inordinate length of time to reach a hearing date, Dr. Wilkie met again with the defendant on April 25, 2014, and filed an addendum to the 2009 report on May 19, 2014.[18]Dr. Wilkie concluded that Mr. Marsh does not appear to suffer from a major mental illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, but clearly appears to meet the criteria for a diagnosis of anti-social personality disorder with borderline personality traits. He also meets the criteria for substance abuse disorders. Excerpts taken from pages 91 to 94 of the report:The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is a pervasive pattern of disregard for, and violation of, the rights of others, occurring since the age of fifteen, as indicated by three or more of:•Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviours [met]•Deceitfulness as indicated by repeated lying, use of aliases, or conning others for personal profit or pleasure [met]•Impulsivity or a failure to plan ahead [met]•Irritability and aggressiveness [met]•Reckless disregard for the safety of self or others [met]•Consistent irresponsibility as indicated by a repeated failure to sustain consistent work behaviour or honour financial obligations [met]•Lack of remorse, as indicted by being indifference to, or rationalizing, having hurt, mistreated, or stolen for another [met]Individuals with antisocial personality disorder are largely considered to be untreatable.Mr. Marsh also appears to manifest borderline personality traits. According to the DSM-IV-TR, borderline personality disorder is described as a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:•Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment•A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation•Identity disturbance•Impulsivity in at least two areas that are self-damaging (e.g. spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating)•Recurrent suicidal behaviour, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behaviour•Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood•Chronic feelings of emptiness•Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger•Transient, stress-related paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms.Mr. Marsh appears to meet some of the criteria noted above.Substance abuse disorders are generally defined as the use of substances in a fashion that has maladaptive social, occupational or physiological consequences. According to the DSM-IV-TR, substance abuse is defined by a pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by one or more of the following, occurring within a 12-month period:•Recurrent use of a substance resulting in a failure to fulfil major role obligations at work, school or home•Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous•Recurrent substance-related legal problems•Continued substance use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substanceRisk Assessment[19]Both Dr. WIlkie and Dr. Abramowitz (one of the psychologists) independently scored the defendant at 32 (out of 40) on the psychopathy checklistPCL-R.[20]That score places Mr. Marsh higher than 90% of individuals in the prison population. Anyone scoring higher than 30 is considered a psychopath. Anyone scoring higher than 25 have poor treatment prospects.[21]Mr. Marsh was also scored on the Violence Risk Appraisal Guide (VRAG). Dr. Wilkie scored him +18. Dr. Abramowitz at +15. This means the expected probability of violent recidivism is expected to range between 58% and 82% within ten years of opportunity.Correctional Services Canada[22]Ms. Rousell testified regarding the comprehensive recommendations made by Dr. Wilkie (see Appendix 1), and their relationship to available resources within Correctional Services Canada. Some of those recommendations, while valid, were not able to be fulfilled. Ms. Rousell’s office would be responsible for developing the correctional plan that drives the supervision and management of the offender while in custody. If the offender is paroled, on statutory release, and/or a Long Term Supervision Order, her office plans for the offender’s release into the community, and recommends to the Parole Board the structure and conditions that should be in place to manage the offender’s risk. The correctional plan is initiated when a federal sentence is given, during the first three to four months of incarceration at the Joyceville Assessment Unit.[23]The case law is clear that even in the presence of a comprehensive community management plan, the Court must consider “real world resourcing limitations,” which cannot be ignored or minimized when to do so would endanger public safety: R. v. DVB 2010 ONCA 291 (CanLII), 2010 OJ No 1577 at para 59, Ontario Court of Appeal.[24]Some of the limitations testified to by Ms. Rousell:•frequency of contact between parole office and an offender on a LTSO has been reduced from a minimum of eight times per month to four (not daily, as recommended by Dr. Wilkie);•daily checks on the defendant’s whereabouts when away from the community correctional centre cannot be accommodated;•any programming regarding antisocial attitudes or vocational programs are subject to potential waiting lists, although less likely if the defendant has completed a “core program” in the institution; in the case of vocational programs there are no specific programs;•dispensing and monitoring medication is largely left to the individual, who essentially has the medication stored at the centre;•residential drug treatment facilities, typically, will not accept offenders coming out of prison onto a LTSO. Intense monitoring and compliance with treatment is not possible.Submissions[25]Mr. Cawkell submitted that his client should not receive an indeterminate sentence under s. 753.(4)(a), and given the expert position of strict supervision, he should not receive a straight sentence under 753.(4)(c). As a result, he submits, I should take into account the pre-trial custody (close to six years) and impose either (1) time served followed by a ten-year Long Term Supervision Order (LTSO), or (2) two years incarceration followed by a five-year LTSO.[26]The defence also submits that, given that the offence date precedes the Truth in Sentencing Act, the pre-trial detention credit should be calculated on a two-for-one basis when both quantitative and qualitative factors are considered.[27]The Crown submitted that a determinate sentence followed by a ten-year LTSO was insufficient to adequately protect the public. Only an indeterminate sentence would suffice. However, he submitted, should this Court decide to impose some sentence other than an indeterminate sentence, a range of 12 to 15 years would be commensurate with the gravity of his crimes coupled with the moral blame-worthiness associated with his extensive and related criminal record.Findings[28]Dr. Wilkie summaries the report by opining that ”there is reason for pessimism, from a psychiatric perspective, regarding this individual’s future manageability within the community, even if strict conditions were in place, and Mr. Marsh were to agree to follow through with conditions and treatment recommendations.” She then outlines nine recommendations that would provide some structure if the defendant was eventually placed in the community.[29]In cross-examination, Dr. Wilkie agreed with the suggestion that impulsivity and aggression (two elements of his diagnosis) would decline with advancing years. In addition, if the defendant is contained in a supervised environment, again impulsivity and aggression would be attenuated.[30]During the first nine months of 2012, Mr. Marsh was admitted to the secure treatment unit at St. Lawrence Valley Treatment Centre (SLVTC) because of the “escalation of problematic behaviours displayed by the subject” after 38 months of administrative segregation in Central East Correctional Centre (CECC). This was done on an emergency basis given concerns around “psychiatric decompensation” and suicide risk. He had been banging his head against a wall for weeks. He swallowed a plastic spoon. By the end of the stay (discharge summary dated September 13, 2012) Mr. Marsh was diagnosed with delirium secondary to medication toxicity by Dr. Cameron. The medication he had been receiving was altered and by June 3, 2012, Dr. Cameron assessed the defendant to be stable on the new medication.[31]Dr. Wilkie agreed that:•most of the difficulties displayed by the defendant in custody occurred before June 3, 2012;•the defendant participated in four different groups after stabilization and was described as having a positive influence on the group. He was receptive to information, feedback, direction and correction. He progressed to an environment where he had more inter-personal control with others that lead to him being placed in the general population;•he did his best work at SLVTC;•that his current medication had the defendant feeling more positive, and that he reported having better control over his behaviours, and would seek mental health assistance; all of this resulting in a positive development;•after his release from SLVTC on September 17, 2012, there is no indication of any behavioural problems at CECC.[32]The case law dealing with the principles relevant to the appropriate sentence for serious personal injury offences committed by dangerous offenders occurring after the 2008 amendments, such as this case, suggest that neither party is required to satisfy a burden of proof (see R. v. Mumford, 2010 ONSC 5624 (CanLII)). However, given that s. 753.(4.1) mandates that the Court must impose an indeterminate sentence unless satisfied, by the evidence adduced during the hearing, that there is a reasonable expectation that a lesser measure under 753.(4)(b) or (c) will adequately protect the public, there exists a presumption that must be rebutted.[33]I must conduct a thorough inquiry to determine if, in the evidence, there exists a reasonable expectation that a sentence other than an indeterminate one can adequately protect the public. Although, as Dr. Wilkie testified, there are significant reasons for pessimism, I come to the conclusion that I can impose a determinate sentence in the penitentiary followed by a LTSO. In my view, the almost six years of jail served to this point, along with a period of penitentiary time wherein core programs will be available, followed by an extended period of supervision, provide the framework for the reasonable expectation.[34]The evidence which leads me to a reasonable expectation and rebuts the indeterminate sentence presumption is primarily founded on the positive developments which occurred at SLVTC after June 3, 2012, when the defendant’s medication regime was stabilized. As indicated above in paragraph 31, the defendant was able to engage in programming, connect with people, and comply with behavioural norms. And that was not just for a few months, but over two years now, where his prospects are moving in the right direction. Although I feel it is a minor factor, the experts agree that aggression and criminality attenuate with age, and the defendant is now 50.[35]The Crown took the position that if an indeterminate sentence was not imposed, a 12- to 15-year period of incarceration is a just sentence. I agree. Given the four prior armed robberies, and the commission of this armed robbery ten days after release, a sentence that emphasizes denunciation and deterrence is paramount. Given this was an early guilty plea and no physical violence was exacted, I am of the view that 13 years is the right sentence.[36]In written submissions, the Crown took the position that Mr. Marsh should be credited for pre-trial detention on a 2:1 basis (see paragraph 104, Exhibit 1(a) on Sentence). Mr. Westgate amended that position on the sentencing hearing to indicate that something less than that should be credited. Even prior to that alteration in position, I was not prepared to grant Mr. Marsh credit at 2:1. One of the principles underpinning enhanced credit is the unavailability of parole when detained before sentence. Mr. Marsh has virtually no chance of receiving either day or full parole. As a result, I take into account only the unavailability of statutory release at two-thirds (⅔) of the sentence as a quantitative factor. Other qualitative factors, such as the absence of programmes, and segregation, should be factored into the calculus. Far from a science, it seems to me that the most appropriate period of credit I can arrive at is 11 years for the close to six years of pre-trial detention.[37]Accordingly, the sentence from August 20, 2014, forward will be two years in the penitentiary. I concluded a lesser sentence of time served followed by an LTSO as submitted by defence, would not allow the defendant to be engaged in core programming in a federal institution. Without that component, I was not of the view that there existed a reasonable expectation the public could be protected.[38]I recommended Mr. Marsh serve his sentence in medium security and not maximum security for the simple reason that his access to necessary programming would be reduced if he were in maximum security. I realize, however, the decision regarding classification rests with Correctional Service Canada.[39]Again, in my view, the core programs available in the penitentiary could be continued in the community but would only have a reasonable possibility of success if the defendant was subject to the enhanced supervision available to a defendant subject to a LTSO. As a result, given the multiple problems the defendant faces which give rise to the pessimism expressed by Dr. Wilkie, only a maximum LTSO of ten years would provide the necessary supervision and controls.[40]A DNA database sample, and a lifetime prohibition to possessing the items listed in s. 109 of the Criminal Code were both ordered.Released:September 19, 2014Signed: “Justice Blouin”Appendix 1SummaryIn summary, I believe there is reason for pessimism, from a psychiatric perspective, regarding this individual’s future manageability within the community, even if strict conditions were put in place and Mr. Marsh were to agree to follow through with conditions and treatment recommendations. However, the question as to whether or not Mr. Marsh would meet criteria for a finding that he is a Long-Term Offender ultimately lies with the Court. I have outlined the above factors to assist the Court in its determination in this regard.Should the Court determine that Mr. Marsh would be suitable for designation as a Long-Term Offender, clinical/dynamic factors and criminogenic variables highlight areas where intervention should be attempted in order to try to manage the risk posed by Mr. Marsh in the community. In my opinion, if Mr. Marsh is placed in the community, the following structures and conditions should be put in place:1.Mr. Marsh has completed a variety of programs during his incarceration; it should be noted that his involvement in some of these programs may have inadvertently provided him with information and skills that may be used to manipulate treating professionals. He may, however, be exposed to programs during a period of incarceration, including but not limited to, programs to deal with antisocial attitudes. He should also be assisted in accessing vocational programs to assist him with any eventual transition to the community.2.Mr. Marsh may benefit from psychological treatment with a mental Health professional, specifically tailored to address affective instability (and other borderline personality traits), with regard to creating “structure” in his internal, psychological environment. Mr. Marsh may benefit from cognitive behavioural (CBT) or dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT), the mode of therapy shown to be best able to treat the symptoms of borderline personality disorder. DBT, specifically, addresses symptoms of affect dysregulation, anger, behavioural dyscontrol, fear of abandonment and difficulties with identity.3.Mr. Marsh should be followed by a mental health professional; the ongoing utility of medication treatment to address affective instability, anger dyscontrol, and impulsivity should be assessed on an ongoing basis. Medication with abuse potential (i.e. benzodiazepines) should likely not be prescribed to this individual.4.Mr. Marsh should be required to attend treatment programs for substance abuse, both while incarcerated and once out in the community. I would recommend treatment within a residential facility during the initial phase of any eventual release, with very intense monitoring of his compliance (i.e. random drug screens on at least a twice weekly basis and whenever substance abuse is suspected).He should also participate in relapse prevention programming in this regard.5.Mr. Marsh should be required to abstain from alcohol and street drug use and should be immediately returned to detention if there is any evidence of use in this regard.6.He should be subject to intense supervision upon any eventual release to the community, including residential placement in a correctional facility for an extended period of time, with privileges for any unsupervised time away from the facility being earned through demonstrated compliance with the programs and supervision.Any release should only take place on a graduated and slow basis, allowing for rapid intervention (breach) should Mr. Marsh fail to comply with all conditions.7.His whereabouts when outside the facility should be subject to verification initially on at least a daily basis and probation/parole officersshould make regular, unannounced visits if Mr. Marsh is living outside of a correctional facility.8.If Mr. Marsh enters into a further intimate relationship, that partner should be contacted by probation and parole and should be fully informed of Mr.Marsh’shistory and should be advised to contact policeimmediately if they haveany reason to believe Mr. Marsh is about toact in anaggressivefashion,haveaccessto aweaponorresume use of substances.9.Mr. Marsh should be prohibited from having contact with any criminally-oriented or substance-abusing peers outside of correctional facilities.The recommendations made above represent a somewhat more intense level of suggested supervision and treatment than Mr. Marsh has received in the past, reflecting my view that he represents a special group of high risk/high needs offenders. My hope would be that such an intensive level of supervision and treatment, while not eliminating risk posed by Mr. Marsh, might allow for intervention (i.e. breach) prior to his committing a further offense."}

AtwoodHeard:January 22, 2015, in Pictou,Nova ScotiaCharge:Para. 264.1(1)(b) and sub. s.349(1) of the Criminal CodeCounsel:Jody McNeill for the NovaScotia Public Prosecution ServiceRob Sutherland forAshleyDawn CooperBy the Court:[1]The court has for sentencing Ashley Dawn Cooper.Ms. Cooper is before the court to be sentenced for two counts; one an indictable charge of unlawfully entering a dwelling; the other a summary charge of uttering a threat to burn property.[2]The facts are that on 22 June 2012, just past midnight, RCMP were called to a residence in Linacy, Pictou County, Nova Scotia.The homeowner, a Ms. Brown, reported that Ms. Cooper was trying to break inside.[3]The police made an immediate patrol in response to that call.While en route, police were notified by their dispatcher that Ms. Cooper had a knife.When police arrived at the residence in Linacy, they found Ms. Cooper outside.They located a steak knife stuck into the ground.Ms. Cooper displayed strong signs of impairment by alcohol.[4]Ms. Brown reported that Ms. Cooper had been phoning her constantly.When police inquired how this tempest arose, Ms. Brown revealed that her fiancé, a Mr. Gillingham, had been involved recently in an intimate relationship with Ms. Cooper.Ms. Brown admitted to police that she had obtained Mr. Gillingham’s password to access his Facebook account, and, having accessed the account, had attempted to engage Ms. Cooper in a social-networking conversation to find out how far things had gone.[5]Ms. Brown reported to police that Ms. Cooper had said that she would barge the door down; she stated that she had pushed Ms. Cooper away and Ms. Cooper fell down the steps.Ms. Brown told police that, at that point, re-entered her home and locked the door.[6]Ms. Brown stated to police that she could see Ms. Cooper holding a knife, scraping the knife along a window and attempting to use it as a shim to open the door.[7]Ms. Cooper told Ms. Brown “I am going to slit your throat and fucking kill you.”Eventually Ms. Cooper was able to get the door open.She pushed the door open, and stuck her foot inside.Ms. Brown was able to hold the door shut until the police arrived.Ms. Brown had her small child in the home.[8]Ms. Cooper was released from custody later that morning at around 9:40 a.m. on a promise to appear and subject to terms in a form 11.1 undertaking.[9]Ms. Cooper was described by police as being uncooperative, angry and difficult in the beginning; however, she finally did calm down.The officer who released Ms. Cooper had her recite her bail conditions as set out in the form 11.1 undertaking; one of the conditions was that Ms. Cooper not contact or communicate with Ms. Brown in any way.Ms. Cooper refused to be driven home by police.[10]Police were contacted later that same day by Ms. Brown.Ms. Brown advised police that she had received a number of harassing telephone calls from Ms. Cooper.During one of those calls, Ms. Cooper stated:“I will burn your house down.You fucked my shit up.”[11]I have reviewed in detail the presentence report before the court.Ms. Cooper comes before the court as a first-time offender.The presentence report describes Ms. Cooper’s chaotic upbringing. In the third paragraph of the presentence report, the author of the report states as follows:The subject described her childhood as being “miserable, tormented, scary and she felt preyed on”.She stated that she did not feel protection from her family and self-reported sexual abuse as well as being medicated and recorded without her permission.Ms. Cooper explained her mother was not home often and she was left in the care of Mr. Gordon Cooper.She explained after reporting the same, she was placed into foster care at 13 years of age.She recalled her mother struggling with her mental health as a result of the same which Ms. Cooper indicated lead to her own struggle, ultimately attempting suicide.”Ms. Cooper noted she stayed for approximately one month each at the Bridges Program and the Janus Program.She stated she was then placed into foster care with Ms. Wendy Foley.The subject advised, after one month in the foster home, she was returned to the care of Ms. Sheila and Mr. Gordon Cooper.According to the offender, her parents never separated.Ms. Cooper also self-reported experiencing physical abuse “quite a bit”.[12]Ms. Cooper has held a number of what appear to have been minimum-wage jobs for short periods of time.She left school early, appears to have at least started grade 10, and has attempted to complete a GED Program.[13]She currently has no form of income.She has been involved in the drug culture for some period of time involving the use of cannabis, bath salts, as well as cocaine.Her use of bath salts lasted for approximately one year; according to Ms. Cooper’s testimony, which I heard a few minutes ago, and according to the presentence report, Ms. Cooper was under the influence of bath salts at the time of the commission of these offences.[14]Ms. Cooper has aspirations to pursue a career in either personal styling or music; Ms. Cooper has proposed to the court a plan that would have her released from custody and living with her parents, at least for an initial period of time.[15]It has been suggested to the court by defence counsel that the core issue for the court to consider is one of counselling.In fact, statutorily the core issue for the court to consider at a sentencing hearing is the fundamental purpose of sentencing, which is proportionality.A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.[16]The s. 349 offence, in particular, was gravely serious in my view.It involved Ms. Cooper attempting to force her way and, indeed, entering partially into Ms. Brown’s private home.Ms. Cooper went there to confront Ms. Brown; after Ms. Brown made the completely lawful and reasonable decision not to admit Ms. Cooper to her residence, Ms. Cooper used force, armed with a knife, to attempt to gain entrance.[17]Ms. Cooper used a steak knife in attempting to shim open the door to Ms. Brown’s residence.She displayed that knife in a menacing fashion and threatened to cut Ms. Brown’s throat.[18]In my view, this offence demonstrates a high degree of lethality.To characterize this as has been done here today as “just a foot in the door” is a reductive analysis of the facts that bears no relationship to reality.This was a serious offence for which Ms. Cooper was solely responsible that gave rise to an extremely high risk of lethality, and so an extremely serious offence for which Ms. Cooper was solely responsible.[19]I agree with the prosecutor that the uttering-threats charge was extremely serious as Ms. Cooper had only just been released from custody by police when she telephoned Ms. Brown and threatened to burn down her property.The protection of Ms. Brown was the entire focus of that form 11.1 undertaking and Ms. Cooper immediately acted contrary to the clear intent of the undertaking that she signed.[20]Ms. Cooper was AWOL on the day set for her trial; the court issued a warrant and she was taken into custody on 4 September 2014.She has been on remand since.[21]As our Court of Appeal outlined in R v. Cromwell,[1] an extensive period of time being AWOL from the process of the court is a factor that the court may take into account in ascertaining whether an offender might be a good candidate for a community based sentence, a type of sentence which typically obligates the offender to show up where and when ordered by the court or a sentence supervisor.[22]Neither of the offences before the court today is excluded from the conditional-sentencing regime.As pointed out correctly by defence counsel, the amendments to section 742.1 of the Code that resulted in section 349 offences, when prosecuted by indictment, being excluded from the conditional sentencing regime, did not come into effect until 20 November 2012 in virtue of SI/2012-48.Accordingly, neither of the offences before the court is excluded from the conditional-sentencing regime.[23]I am conscious, as well, that the court must apply the principles of restraint.The court must be mindful of the fact that an offender should not be deprived of liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; the court must consider, as well, that all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders.[24]However, it is clear to the court that among the major purposes of sentencing are the denunciation of unlawful conduct, and the deterrence of the offender and other persons from committing offences.Yes, rehabilitation must always factor into the making of a sentence, particularly for young adults; however, the court must be sure toprovide a sense of reparation for harm done to victims and to the community, and to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and to the community.[25]There is no victim impact statement before the court; nevertheless, I find that the court might infer reasonably from the circumstances that Ms. Brown was terrified by the threat to her personal safety posed by Ms. Cooper[26]I am cognizant, as well, of the impact that offences of this nature have on the sense of public safety.That was outlined by Beveridge J. when sitting as a judge of the Supreme Court in R. v. Stewart.[2]Offences that are tantamount to home invasions instill in the public a sense of fear as the home is seen no longer as a refuge or sanctuary or a safe harbour; accordingly, the court must take firm steps to deter not only Ms. Cooper but to deter others and to send a strong message of deterrence so that persons contemplating resolving interpersonal conflict through resort to violence, threats of violence and home invasion will understand that the consequences will be heavy.[27]I apply the principle set out in para. 718.2(b) of the Code, that a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.[28]Mr. McNeill has helpfully referred to R. v. Caverley.[3]That very recent sentencing decision out of this judicial centre involved two individuals who had been admitted to a home in Trenton where they proceeded to damage contents of the homeowner in a revenge-fueled rampage; they were motivated to do so because of the belief that the homeowner had been intimate with the common-law partner of one of the marauders.Their actions were without resort to knives or threats of death and did not involve forced entry into the residence of the homeowner.I imposed short penitentiary terms for each of those offenders.Ms. Cooper’s conduct was, in my mind, more serious, as she used a knife, gained entrance by force, and threatened her target with death.[29]Ms. Cooper has no prior record.I am mindful that the court must not impose a sentence that would crush the prospect of rehabilitation; however, given the seriousness, the great seriousness of these offences and the high risk of lethality, I have determined that sentences exceeding a term of two years must be imposed, so that a conditional sentence is barred by statute.[30]First of all, in relation to the unlawfully-in-a-dwelling charge, the court would have imposed a sentence of twenty-eight (28) months plus one (1) day imprisonment; however, applying the principles set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Carvery,[4] I do find it appropriate to give Ms. Cooper seven (7) months credit for the period of time that she has spent on remand.I reckon that to be 140 days on remand; therefore time and a half credit would be 210 or the equivalent of seven (7) months.[31]And so, in relation to the s. 349 charge, the sentence of the court will be twenty-one (21) months plus one (1) day.The court will order and direct that the warrant of committal as well as the information be endorsed in accordance with the provisions of the Truth in Sentencing Act, but for the remand time, the sentence for the s. 349 count would have been twenty-eight (28) months plus one day.[32]In relation to the uttering threats charge, which is a separate and distinct offence, the court imposes a sentence of three (3) months to be served consecutively, for a total sentence of twenty-four (24) months plus one (1) day or two (2) years plus one (1) day.[33]The court will sign a primary designated offence DNA collection order in relation to the s. 349 count.[34]In relation to the section s. 349 count, the court orders, as well, that Ms. Cooper be prohibited from possessing any firearm, other than a prohibited firearm or restricted firearm and any crossbow, restricted weapon, ammunition and explosive substance beginning today’s date and running for ten (10) years plus twenty-four (24) months and one (1) day and also that Ms. Cooper be prohibited from possessing any prohibited firearm, restricted firearm, prohibited weapon, prohibited device, and prohibited ammunition for life.[35]These offences occurred before the coming-into-force date of the provisions making mandatory the imposition of victim-surcharge amounts.I am satisfied that the imposition of victim surcharge amounts would work an unduehardship on Ms. Cooper and the court declines to impose them.[36]Although not sought, I do find that it is necessary that the court order and direct pursuant to the provisions of sub-section 743.2(1) of the Criminal Code that, while in custody, Ms. Cooper is to have no contact or communication with Ms. Samantha Brown, directly or indirectly.Atwood,JPC[1] 2005 NSCA 137 (CanLII) at para. 41.[2] 2009 NSSC 7 (CanLII) at para. 7.[3] 2014 NSPC 93 (CanLII).[4] 2014 SCC 27 (CanLII)."}

R, 2003 NSSC 016Date: 20030127Docket:SH No. 184620Registry:HalifaxBetween:Karl Michael CallaghanAppellantv.Her Majesty The QueenRespondentJudge:The Honourable Justice M. Heather RobertsonHeard:November 27, 2002, in Halifax, Nova ScotiaCounsel:Patrick J. Duncan, Q.C. for the appellantAnthony W. Brown, for the respondentBy the Court:[1]The appellant Karl Michael Callaghan appeals the sentence comprising a fine of $100 plus a victim fine surcharge imposed following his conviction pursuant to s. 334(6) of the Criminal Code in a trial before Judge Castor Williams in the Provincial Court.The appellant seeks to have the sentence set aside and have an absolute or conditional discharge ordered pursuant to s. 730 of the Code.[2]On January 18, 2002, Mr. Callaghan was returning merchandise to the Sears store located in Halifax.After making the exchange he spent 45 minutes shopping.He took three shirts into the fitting room.Shortly thereafter he left the store, carrying one of the shirts in a bag that he had with him.[3]When confronted by store security guards at his car, he denied taking anything unlawfully from the store.He was then arrested and returned to the store security office until the Halifax Regional Police attended and issued him with an appearance notice.The shirt was valued at approximately $45.[4]At the time of the sentencing, Mr. Callaghan was 43 years of age.He had been employed as a member of the Halifax Regional Police for more than 20 years.He had no criminal record.[5]The appellant says that the trial judge erred in law in considering that a refusal by an offender to admit guilt is an impediment to thegranting of a discharge and in deciding that in the circumstances of this offence, s. 718.2 (a)(iii) of the Criminal Code applied, in that the trial judge held that the offender abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim.And finally, the appellant says the trial judge erred in law in imposing a sentence that was not a fit and proper sentence having regard to the circumstances of the offender and the offence.[6]The standard of review of an Appellate Court is set out in R. v. Shropshire 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, Iacobucci, J. stated at paragraph 46:46The question, then, is whether a consideration of the \"fitness\" of a sentence incorporates the very interventionist appellate review propounded by Lambert J.A. With respect, I find that it does not. An appellate court should not be given free reign to modify a sentencing order simply because it feels that a different order ought to have been made. The formulation of a sentencing order is a profoundly subjective process; the trial judge has the advantage of having seen and heard all of the witnesses whereas the appellate court can only base itself upon a written record. A variation in the sentence should only be made if the court of appeal is convinced it is not fit. That is to say, that it has found the sentence to be clearly unreasonable.47I would adopt the approach taken by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in the cases of R. v. Pepin (1990), 1990 CanLII 2481 (NS CA), 98 N.S.R. (2d) 238, and R. v. Muise (1994), 1994 CanLII 4074 (NS CA), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 119. In Pepin, at p. 251, it was held that:. . . in considering whether a sentence should be altered, the test is not whether we would have imposed a different sentence; we must determine if the sentencing judge applied wrong principles or [if] the sentence is clearly or manifestly excessive.48Further, in Muise it was held at pp. 123-24 that:In considering the fitness of a sentence imposed by a trial judge, this court has consistently held that it will not interfere unless the sentence imposed is clearly excessive or inadequate.......The law on sentence appeals is not complex. If a sentence imposed is not clearly excessive or inadequate it is a fit sentence assuming the trial judge applied the correct principles and considered all relevant facts . . . . My view is premised on the reality that sentencing is not an exact science; it is anything but. It is the exercise of judgment taking into consideration relevant legal principles, the circumstances of the offence and the offender. The most that can be expected of a sentencing judge is to arrive at a sentence that is within an acceptable range. In my opinion, that is the true basis upon which Courts of Appeal review sentences when the only issue is whether the sentence is inadequate or excessive.The Sentencing Decision:[7]At the time of the sentencing hearing the learned trial judge seemed to be pre-occupied with the appellant’s absence of remorse.During submissions made by counsel, the trial judge addressed the fact that Mr. Callaghan appeared to marginalize the offence by saying that it was a situational offence and not anintentional offence.These comments were contained in the pre-sentence report prepared by a probation officer.[8]Mr. Callaghan had attended a psychologist for counselling apparently to deal with the personal stress following his arrest and suspension from the police force.His defence counsel referred to this but noted that the report was not before the court and that he was not trying “to suggest that what was dealt with with Dr. Ryan would have created a defence.”[9]The trial judge replied:Not created a defence.But would have given the Court some insight into the conduct or mind of the individual that may tend to prove whether he’s full of remorse, whether he’s not remorseful, or whether he accepts responsibility or not accept responsibility and the underlying factors that go towards that.[10]Further in addressing the issue of the appropriateness of a discharge in circumstances where the appellant did not acknowledge his guilt to the offence, the following exchange took place between defence counsel and the court.MR. DUNCANHe’s saying that situation led to his – to a finding of guilt, notwithstanding that he was maintaining his – an absence of the requisite mens rea.Your Honour felt otherwise.He accepts that.He has no choice but to accept it obviously.And so to engage in a discussions to what might have been and could have been serves no purpose today it’s to –THE COURTI understand.So are you then saying that a person does not admit wrong should be granted a discharge?MR. DUNCANI’m saying that the failure to acknowledge guilt in the sense of saying that – would – is no barrier or impediment to the granting of a discharge –THE COURTNo, no, no.I didn’t say failure to admit guilt.MR. DUNCANYes.THE COURTI said failure to admit morally wrongdoing.MR. DUNCANYes.THE COURTWhich is in the public interest.If people are granted discharge for nothing, so to speak, if they haven’t admitted that they have done something, what is the point?[11]In his oral decision, the trial judge notes:When I read the pre-sentence report, I note that in page five, paragraph – the last paragraph on that page, where the author of the report states:“The offender (inaudible) has not taken responsibility for the offenses before the court and indicated this was not an intentional offence but a situational offence.”Counsel for the defendant has tried somehow to explain that sentence.But I find it has not really been explained in a way to engender a confidence in (inaudible) that the accused has taken a moral responsibility of what this Court found that he has done on the evidence before it.True, one is not obliged to be remorseful.One is not obliged to admit to anything.Those are the rights of an individual under our law.But when an individual comes to the Court to seek mercy, so to speak, before the Court, that individual must come with clean hands.In my view, that individual must acknowledge that some moral wrong has been committed, a moral wrong over which the court has jurisdiction to grant some concessions.If there is no admittance, in my view, that it is something over which the court has the jurisdiction to grant some leniency, then of course the Court will feel that there is nothing really (inaudible) remorseful or admittance of wrong where the court, in exercising its public function and duty, can consider on the circumstances in mitigation the wrong that has been admitted.Here, we have no such situation.We have an individual who stands by his story, but now framed in a way to say what he did was situational.There is no doubt he may honestly believe that.That is his right, prerogative.By the evidence before this Court a determination has been made.And this Court found that it was a deliberate act.He may not wish to admit it.He may wish to still, as the Crown says, consider his reputation, that he’s not a thief.As I said, only one who admits that they have done a wrong can seek some mercy for the wrong which they have committed.[12]The trial judge does outline the principles of the sentencing in s. 719 and s. 718.2 of the Criminal Code.He references s. 730 of the Code and R. v. Fallofield (1973), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 450 (B.C.C.A.).He also concludes that there are a lack of mitigating circumstances in this case as might be considered under s. 718.2(a) of the Code.[13]However, the preponderance of his comment show a pre-occupation with mens rea and the acceptance of responsibility, to the extent that the lack of the appellant’s acknowledgment of wrongdoing, even “moral wrongdoing” is a bar to the granting of a discharge.The whole tenor of this decision suggests that such acknowledgment and a display of remorse is a pre-condition of discharge.The trial judge has erred in law by making this demand of the appellant.The refusal of an offender to admit guilt is not a bar to the granting of a discharge.[14]Section 730 of the Criminal Code sets out the condition’s precedents for granting a discharge:730. (1) Where an accused, other than a corporation, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence, other than an offence for which a minimum punishment is prescribed by law or an offence punishable by imprisonment for fourteen years or for life, the court before which the accused appears may, if it considers it to be in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of convicting the accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged absolutely or on the conditions prescribed in a probation order made under subsection 731(2).(2)...(3) Where a court directs under subsection (1) that an offender be discharged of an offence, the offender shall be deemed not to have been convicted of the offence except that(a) the offender may appeal from the determination of guilt as if it were a conviction in respect of the offence;(b) the Attorney General and, in the case of summary conviction proceedings, the informant or the informant's agent may appeal from the decision of the court not to convict the offender of the offence as if that decision were a judgment or verdict of acquittal of the offence or a dismissal of the information against the offender; and(c) the offender may plead autrefois convict in respect of any subsequent charge relating to the offence.Where person bound by probation order convicted of offence(4) Where an offender who is bound by the conditions of a probation order made at a time when the offender was directed to be discharged under this section is convicted of an offence, including an offence under section 733.1, the court that made the probation order may, in addition to or in lieu of exercising its authority under subsection 732.2(5), at any time when it may take action under that subsection, revoke the discharge, convict the offender of the offence to which the discharge relates and impose any sentence that could have been imposed if the offender had been convicted at the time of discharge, and no appeal lies from a conviction under this subsection where an appeal was taken from the order directing that the offender be discharged.R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 730; 1995, c. 22, s. 6; 1997, c. 18, s. 141.[15]In R. v. Fallofield, supra, the court set forth a series of conclusions it arrived at after considering the authorities relevant to granting of a discharge.At p. 454:(1)The section may be used in respect of any offence other than an offence for which a minimum punishment is prescribed by law or the offence is punishable by imprisonment for 14 years or for life or by death.(2)The section contemplates the commission of an offence.There is nothing in the language that limits it to a technical or trivial violation.(3)Of the two conditions precedent to the exercise of the jurisdiction, the first is that of the Court must consider that it is in the best interests of the accused that he should be discharged either absolutely or upon condition.If it is not in the best interests of the accused, that, of course, is the end of the matter.If it is decided that it is in the best interests of the accused, then that brings the next consideration into operation.(4)The second condition precedent is that the Court must consider that a grant of discharge is not contrary to the public interest.(5)Generally, the first condition would presuppose that the accused is a person of good character, without previous conviction, that it is not necessary to enter a conviction against him in order to deter him from future offences or to rehabilitate him, and that the entry of a conviction against him may have significant adverse repercussions.(6)In the context of the second condition the public interest in the deterrence of others, while it must be given due weight, does not preclude the judicious use of the discharge provisions.(7)The powers given by s. 662.1 should not be exercised as an alternative to probation or suspended sentence.(8)Section 662.1 should not be applied routinely to any particular offence.This may result in an apparent lack of uniformity in the application of the discharge provisions.This lack will be more apparent than real and will stem from the differences in the circumstances of cases.[16]In this case the trial judge’s preoccupation with the mens rea and the acceptance of responsibility outweighed his consideration of the only two true conditions precedent to the exercise of judicial discretion in granting a discharge:the best interests of the accused and the consideration that the discharge would not be against the public interest.[17]On the second ground of appeal, the trial judge appears to have instructed himself pursuant to s. 718.2 (iii) of the Criminal Code, where he stated:I’m also reminded in s. 718.2 that the a court that imposes sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles.(a)A sentence should be increased or decreased to account for any relevant, either (inaudible) or mitigating circumstances related to the offence or the offender and without limited the generality of the foregoing.(iii) Evidence that the offender in committing the offence abused the position of trust or authority in relation to the victim.[18]The trial judge then references the Crown submissions relating to the offender’s occupation, as a police officer who holds a position of public trust.It is not clear whether the trial judge concluded that Mr. Callaghan had abused a position of trust or authority.The offender’s position as a public servant was not apart of the offence.He was not on duty or in police uniform when the offence occurred.Section 728.2(a)(iii) of the Code could not apply as there was no victim in relation to this offence.[19]The fact that the offender was a police officer at the time of the offence should not be a bar to the consideration of discharge.At the time of sentencing Mr. Callaghan was to have shortly faced a review of his conduct pursuant to s. 4(3) of the Regulations made pursuant to the Police Act.The effect of a criminal conviction made it a forgone conclusion that he would be dismissed from the police force.Following his conviction, Mr. Callaghan resigned.[20]Where the trial judge has made an error in law, in applying wrong sentencing principles the reviewing court may examine the written record and make a determination of what is a fit and proper sentence having regard to the particulars of the offence and the age, character and circumstances of the offender.In this regard, I do not believe that the trial judge gave proper consideration to what is a fit and proper sentence.Had he done so, he might well have taken more time to weigh the particular circumstance of the offender’s life and reflect on how the public interest would best be served if a discharge were granted.[21]Before this offence, Mr. Callaghan had been of good character and was a law-abiding citizen.He is the father of two children.He was widowed in 1988.His son of that marriage is now 15 years old of age, lives with him.He also supports a child of a second marriage that he entered into in 1991, although it dissolved four years later.His ten-year-old daughter resides with her mother.[22]The pre-sentence report demonstrates that friends and family believed this incident to be out of character.He was described by his brother as a “responsible individual” of whom he was proud.He felt that his brother was “a good person who has had a rough time in life due to the passing away of his first wife and the fact he has had to bring up his son by himself.”[23]His girlfriend Joanne Weston said that he was “kind, easy going person ...it was not in his character to be dishonest.”[24]Michael Callaghan is well educated.He completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1991 at St. Francis Xavier University.He has developed an interest in information technology recently completing a programme as an Information Systems Specialist at the Halifax Computer College.He hopes to make a new career in this field.A large employer in this field is the Government of Canada.Mr. Callaghan is concerned that in making application for employment he will be unable to answer the routine question “Have you ever had a conviction entered against you, for a criminal offence?”[25]During the course of this application the Crown emphasized the need for deterrence and the necessity of alerting prospective future employers and the public that Michael Callaghan is a dishonest person.Mr. Brown believes that Mr. Callaghan may seek positions of trust and that potential employers will be misled as Mr. Callaghan answers any questions about past criminal convictions in the negative, if a discharge is granted.[26]In the event a discharge is granted, any employer is free to inquire of the Criminal Records section at the Halifax Regional Police or inquire of the court administration offices.The disposition of this case will be a matter of public record.It is true if such inquiries are not made then an employer would be relying on the integrity of the applicant, with respect to questions of past convictions or discharge from conviction.[27]In any event Michael Callaghan has been a productive honest member of society, until in the space of a few moments at a Sears store dressing room he changed his life forever.I believe it is in the best interests of Mr. Callaghan and in the public interest that he be given the opportunity to return to his earlier status as a productive and law-abiding citizen.He has suffered the severe consequence of his action in the loss of his career.However, he can and has rehabilitated himself and should have the opportunity to move on in life without the impediments of a criminal conviction.[28]I allow the appeal and set aside the conviction.In its place I substitute an absolute discharge.Justice M. Heather Robertson"}

In our view, having regard to the nature of the information that the accused wanted to bring to the court’s attention, namely, his remorse, it would not have changed the sentence imposed. It is clear on the record that the trial judge was well aware of and took into account the offender’s remorse.[4]In any event, and having regard to the second ground of appeal, we are of the view that the sentence was fit in the circumstances, including the monetary amount of the fraud, the breach of trust and the lengthy period over which the fraud took place.[5]The sentence appeal is dismissed.“John Laskin J.A.”“David Watt J.A.”“C.W.

Germain, sitting in Tuktoyaktuk, inthe Northwest Territories, on the 15th day of August,A.D. 2013.__________________________________________________________APPEARANCES:Mr. B. Demone:Counsel for the CrownMr. T. Boyd:Counsel for the Accused(Charges under s. 267(a) and 268 Criminal Code of Canada)Official Court Reporters1THE COURT:Mr. Fred Junior Gruben was2tried this week in his home town of Tuktoyaktuk3before a jury composed of his peers.4At the time when the jury was to hear their5final addresses by counsel, their jury charge,6and to commence deliberations, Mr. Fred Gruben7Junior entered a plea to a lesser and included8offence of assault causing bodily harm.Counsel9agreed that I should encourage the jury to return10a verdict of guilt to that count and they have11done so.In result, Mr. Gruben today is not12being sentenced for aggravated assault nor13assault with a weapon, he is being sentenced only14for assault causing bodily harm.15Assault causing bodily harm can be just16barely over a trifling matter such as a black eye17or a sore jaw or a swelling or a bruise, and it18can proceed in gradation until it almost19constitutes attempted murder or wounding, which20is aggravated assault.In this particular case,21Mr. Gruben's offence comes perilously close to22the line between assault causing bodily harm and23aggravated assault.24Mr. Gruben is an aboriginal and, in result,25the principles of sentencing under Section 718 of26the Criminal Code, which are sometimes difficult27to reconcile, specifically direct me, underOfficial Court Reporters11Section 718.2(e), to take into account his2situation in the community and in the jail3community of the issues that confront4aboriginals.We are disproportionately5represented in our jails by aboriginal offenders,6and some of the roots of aboriginal offenders7result from the limitations that society has8imposed on aboriginals, not deliberately or not9intentionally, but we have a history in this10country, in Australia, in the United States, in11other democratic countries, a history of12well-meaning people ending up inflicting13significant abuse and ill effects on the14aboriginal citizens.15Our Alberta Court of Queen's Bench R. v.16Gouda, 2013 ABQB 121 has recently suggested that17even in a joint submission of sentence, a18Gladue-Ipeelee type report prepared by a19probation officer should be prepared in all20cases.A more liberal and generous way of21interpreting that Alberta decision is to remind22judges that even in joint submissions Section23718.2(e) must be explored.24In the Northwest Territories, with the25isolated communities, the fly-in judges, the lack26of resources for adult probation services, and27the extremely competent and well-prepared legalOfficial Court Reporters21counsel who are live to these issues, it would2seem to me that if it becomes the rule of law in3the territories that there be an actual written4Ipeelee-Gladue report in every case, as correctly5pointed out by learned counsel Mr. Boyd, the6system would quickly become constipated and would7bog down and that people would be prejudiced8because while awaiting sentence, they would often9serve more time than their sentence and there10would be inherent delays, particularly when the11Court is imposed in part by travelling judges who12attend from other parts of Canada and who have13their own workload back home.Mr. Boyd reminds14me that while I am sitting as territorial judge,15the decisions of the Alberta Courts should be16highly persuasive but are not binding on me as17they might be in the Province of Alberta.I also18prefer to interpret the Alberta Court decision in19Gouda as not creating an absolute requirement to20order an Ipeelee-Gladue type report from21Probation Services when that information can be22gleaned elsewhere, through submissions from the23client or his competent counsel.Therefore, I24will not adjourn this case for an Ipeelee25decision.I am fortified in that by Mr. Boyd's26eloquent submissions and the fact that a joint27submission has been reached.Official Court Reporters31The joint submission in this case basically2starts with a global sentence of around fourteen3months.The parties have asked that I impose an4additional sentence of new time of six months.5In my respectful view, legal counsel have got it6right.Although Mr. Lucas was badly injured and7although Mr. Gruben's guilty plea was a late8train coming, it still nevertheless reflects9remorse and it reflects a willingness to stand up10in the community and admit wrongdoing.11I think we all wish that the community had12not been torn apart like this with people bearing13witness against loved ones, and jurors who know14the Gruben family, work for the Gruben family,15and are heavily knowledgeable about the important16things the Gruben family has done in this area of17the territory, didn't have to go through the18turmoil that they went through.But in any19event, Mr. Gruben still has pled guilty.In20light of that, I intend to accept the joint21submission of sentence.22Mr. Gruben, would you please stand.I23sentence you to a period of fourteen months in24prison, but I declare that eight months of it has25already been served by the time you have spent in26custody, and the official record today will27reflect that you are to serve six months of newOfficial Court Reporters41time.2Under Section 109 of the Criminal Code of3Canada, you are now facing a lifetime firearms4ban of all firearms, including handguns,5restricted weapons, and even non-restricted6weapons.However, I recognize and do accept,7notwithstanding the learned objections of Crown,8that there is an opportunity for you to9sustenance hunt, and if you are out in the --10away out on the land, away from the built-up11communities, it would be, in my view, dangerous12to prohibit you from having a firearm to hunt or13trap in order to sustain you or your person's14family.So under Section 113(1) of the Criminal15Code, I will lift the prohibition order for16sustenance or employment.But the firearm that17you have must be a long rifle, never a handgun,18you must have no alcohol whatsoever on the trip,19and you cannot hold or possess a firearm (someone20will have to bring it with them) while you are21within two miles of a circle around any built-up22community in the Northwest Territories.So it23has to truly be out on the land.24In addition, while in prison, a sample of25you DNA will be taken for future crime-fighting.26It will be a scrape from the inside of your

No. 1972Between:Her Majesty The QueenandWallace Carson BourneMercer, J.Counsel:Kathleen Healey, for the Crown;Jerome Kennedy, for the accused.[1]Mercer, J. [orally]: The accused (Bourne) was indicted on a charge of second degree murder and on May 3, 1996, following a jury trial was convicted of that offence. It is now my duty to impose sentence.Background:[2]The offence was committed on January 12, 1995 at 95 Casey Street, St. John's. It occurred at approximately 6:30 a.m. following an all-night drinking party. Several people were at the house including Bourne and Raymond Furlong, the victim, whom Bourne did not know well. Bourne had been ejected from the house as the women present were concerned by his strange, though passive, behaviour. He became enraged, and armed with two knives he obtained from a nearby house, he forcibly re-entered 95 Casey Street swinging the knives and threatening to kill the occupants. Hearing Bourne's threats Furlong entered the front hallway where Bourne was. Furlong was stabbed once in the upper chest. The stab wound perforated a large vein which caused extensive bleeding resulting in Furlong's death.[3]Bourne has prior convictions including assault with a weapon and aggravated assault. He was released on parole on December 22, 1994 and had left his halfway house in breach of his parole conditions on January 6, 1995. He had consumed significant amounts of valium and beer in the hours prior to the offence.Issue:[4]The sole issue is whether, and to what extent, the Court should increase the period of parole ineligibility. The Crown submits that the period should be in the middle of a 15-20 year range. Bourne's Counsel submits that an increase in parole ineligibility to 12 years would be a suitable disposition.Criminal Code Provisions:[5]Section 235(1) of the Criminal Code states:\"Everyone who commits first degree murder or second degree murder is guilty of an indictable offence and shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life.\"[6]A person sentenced to life imprisonment is eligible for parole subject to a specified minimum period of parole ineligibility which the Court has the discretionary power to increase. Section 742(b) specifies that the person convicted of second degree murder shall not be eligible for parole\"until he has served at least ten years of his sentence or such greater number of years, not being more than twenty-five, as has been substituted therefore pursuant to Section 744.\"[7]Section 744 specifies the factors to be considered by the sentencing judge and prescribes the limits of the Court's discretion. It states:\"... at the time of sentencing under paragraph 742(b) of an offender who was convicted of second degree murder, the judge who presided at the trial of the offender ... may, having regard to the character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, and to the recommendations, if any, made pursuant to Section 743, by order, substitute for ten years a number of years of imprisonment (being more than ten but not more than twenty-five), without eligibility for parole as the judge deems fit in the circumstances.\"[8]Section 743 requires that where a jury returns a verdict of second degree murder, the jury shall be asked whether it wishes to make any recommendation as to the number of years of parole ineligibility.Judicial Interpretation Of Section 744:[9]Certain judicial authority indicated that a period of parole ineligibility in excess of 10 years could not be justified unless there were unusual circumstances. See R. v. Brown (K.W.) (1993), 1993 CanLII 6882 (BC CA), 31 B.C.A.C. 59; 50 W.A.C. 59; 83 C.C.C.(3d) 394 (C.A.); R. v. Gourgon (No. 2) (1981), 1981 CanLII 328 (BC CA), 58 C.C.C.(2d) 193 (B.C.C.A.). The Supreme Court of Canada recently expressly disapproved of this approach stating:\"... this is too high a standard and makes it overly difficult for trial judges to exercise the discretionary power to set extended periods of parole ineligibility. The language of s. 744 does not require 'unusual circumstances'. As a result, to so require by judicial pronouncement runs contrary to parliamentary intent.\"In my opinion, a more appropriate standard, which would better reflect the intentions of Parliament, can be stated in this manner: as a general rule, the period of parole ineligibility shall be for 10 years, but this can be ousted by a determination of the trial judge that, according to the criteria enumerated in s. 744, the offender should wait a longer period before having his suitability to be released into the general public assessed. To this end, an extension of the period of parole ineligibility would not be 'unusual', although it may well be that, in the median number of cases, a period of 10 years might still be awarded.\" (R. v. Shropshire (M.T.), 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227; 188 N.R. 284; 65 B.C.A.C. 37; 106 W.A.C. 37; 102 C.C.C.(3d) 193, at p. 204)[10]Section 744 specifies factors to be considered by the sentencing judge in determining parole ineligibility. The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Shropshire placed these factors in the general sentencing context:\"... parole, ineligibility is part of the 'punishment' and thereby forms an important element of sentencing policy. As such, it must be concerned with deterrence, whether general or specific. The jurisprudence of this court is clear that deterrence is a well-established objective of sentencing policy. In R. v. Lyons (1987), 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), 37 C.C.C.(3d) 1 at p. 22; 44 D.L.R.(4th) 193 at p. 214; [1987], 2 S.C.R. 309, La Forest, J., held:'In a rational system of sentencing, the respective importance of prevention, deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation will vary according to the nature of the crime and the circumstances of the offender. No one would suggest that any of these functional considerations should be excluded from the legitimate purview of legislative or judicial decisions regarding sentencing.'\"Section 744 must be concerned with all of the factors cited in Lyons. In R. v. Luxton (1990), 1990 CanLII 83 (SCC), 58 C.C.C.(3d) 449; [1990] 2 S.C.R. 711; 79 C.R.(3d) 193, the importance of structuring sentences to take into account the individual accused and the particular crime was emphasized. This is also a factor that any order made pursuant to s. 744 ought to take into consideration.\" (p. 203)[11]The statutory criteria have been elaborated upon in recent Newfoundland cases. See R. v. Rideout (1994 St. J. No. 0460, sentencing decision of Puddester, J., dated August 1, 1995) and R. v. McKay (1995 St. J. No. 2261 and 3662, sentencing decision of Russell, J., dated November 22, 1995). In R. v. Rideout, Puddester, J., referred to the factors outlined in R. v. Brown including:\"(d) character of the accused, including previous record, life-style, age and relevant medical and psychiatric evidence;\"(e) nature of the offence and circumstances surrounding its commission including the participants and their respective roles in the crime and the attacks on and injuries done to others present at the time of the crime;\"(f) mitigating circumstances;\"(g) regard to public opinion;\"(h) deterrent to others;\"(i) denunciation of the crime itself, having regard to its nature and the circumstances being of such a kind that justified a lengthier banishment from society than the more ordinary types of second degree murder requiring a sentence of life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 10 years.\" (R. v. Brown p. 401)[12]Puddester, J., also referred to R. v. Barry ([1991] O.J. No. 2666 (Gen. Div.) where Watt, J., stated:\"It would be idle, if not mere pedantry, to endeavour an exhaustive catalogue of the matters which may be relevant in consideration of the four statutory factors which I have just described. Included, however, may be matters such as(a) the fact, nature and circumstances of any previous convictions involving violence to the person of another;(b) the age of the offender;(c) the presence or absence of any psychiatric disorder which would render an offender likely to re-offend in a similar or related way;(d) an offender's previous parole history, if any;(e) the role of the offender in the offence, both in general and relative to the participation of any others who may have been involved in its commission;(f) the manner in which death was caused, including the infliction of gratuitous, excessive or sadistic violence, mutilation or dismemberment; and,(g) the accompaniment of other offences or preconcerted activity, including potential interference with the administration of justice.\"[13]I now turn to a review of the relevant factors as they apply in this case.Nature Of The Offence And Surrounding Circumstances:[14]On the evening of January 11, 1995 Bourne consumed ten 10 mg valium tablets. These were taken on two occasions a few hours apart. Bourne had not been prescribed valium.[15]Later that evening following a quarrel with his former girlfriend Bourne went to 95 Casey Street where an all night drinking party occurred. Bourne consumed a significant amount of beer that night as did another two men, Raymond Furlong and Gerald Tucker. The two women at the party, Susan Whalen and Patricia Reid, became concerned about Bourne's allegedly strange, though passive behaviour. Reid in particular frequently accused Bourne of staring at her. Bourne was asked to leave by Reid on a number of occasions. He was finally escorted from the premises, likely after 6:00 a.m. on January 12.[16]There was evidence of a pushing incident between Bourne and Raymond Furlong immediately prior to this but there was no evidence of Bourne and Furlong arguing that evening, or of the two being enemies or bearing any ill-will towards each other. The two were recent casual acquaintances.[17]When Bourne was escorted to the front door he was pushed outside, and his kit-bag, containing all his belongings was placed outside. The front door was locked to prevent his re-entry. Bourne had been planning to stay at 95 Casey Street.[18]Bourne became suddenly enraged by this turn of events. He began screaming and crossed the street to 106 Casey Street, where he had been staying. He obtained two knives from the kitchen of that house. He returned to 95 Casey Street and re-entered. At that time or earlier he had smashed the window in the front door enabling him to unlock it.[19]Upon re-entry Bourne was swinging the knives and screaming threats at the occupants of 95 Casey Street, particularly Susan Whalen, whom he believed had been earlier \"coming on to\" him. Bourne threatened to kill them all and to cut their throats. Bourne was then standing in the small front hallway of 95 Casey Street. Susan Whalen was nearest to him, terrified and crying out for Bourne to leave. Raymond Furlong came from the kitchen to the hallway and moved past Susan Whalen saying to Bourne \"that's the way you want it, going to use knives\". Furlong was unarmed and there was no evidence of any threatening motion made by him towards Bourne. Bourne struck Furlong with a knife.[20]Furlong received one stab wound to the upper chest. It perforated a large vein. Furlong fell but was able to leave the hallway and go to the living room. He climbed out the living room window and staggered down the street where he collapsed on the steps of 89 Casey Street.[21]Following the stabbing Bourne stated to Susan Whalen that he had \"shanked your buddy\" indicating immediate knowledge of what he had done. Bourne left 95 Casey Street but remained outside uttering threats and obscenities. He was soon thereafter chased up the street by Susan Whalen's boyfriend, Roger Tobin. Tobin had been at the party briefly but had earlier gone to bed.[22]A police vehicle with two officers arrived at approximately 6:43 a.m. having been called by neighbours complaining of a disturbance. Bourne was encountered on the street bleeding (a result of breaking the glass in the front door) and with a knife in his hand. He ran from the police and was soon apprehended.[23]A second police vehicle arrived within minutes at 89 Casey Street where Raymond Furlong was lying. No vital signs were apparent. All resuscitation efforts then and soon after at the nearby St. Clare's Hospital failed and he was pronounced dead at approximately 7:45 a.m.[24]When Bourne was apprehended and during his subsequent treatment at St. Clare's Hospital that morning the police officers observed signs of impairment. Blood samples drawn for medical purposes at approximately 7:30 a.m. were later subject to forensic analysis. This analysis established that Bourne had 80 micrograms of diazepam (valium) and 17.5 micrograms of nordiazepam in his bloodstream. He had a blood alcohol reading of 101 milligrams %. His blood alcohol reading at 6:30 a.m. was estimated to be 111 - 121 milligrams %.[25]Blood samples were drawn from the victim at St. Clare's Hospital during the resuscitation procedure. Samples of blood and vitreous fluid were drawn at the Health Science Complex during the autopsy. There was a significant disparity between the two respecting the percentage of alcohol in the victim's blood stream. There is no doubt that the autopsy samples were correct. The forensic pathologist, Dr. Avis, stated that both yielded blood alcohol readings in excess of 200 milligrams %. The R.C.M.P. expert analyst obtained a consistent result from her subsequent tests.Age And Character Of Offender:[26]Bourne was born on December 17, 1964.[27]He testified at the trial but neither his direct nor cross-examination gave details respecting his family, early history or schooling.[28]There was no evidence of psychiatric disorder apart from the admission of a problem with alcohol and drugs.Prior Convictions/Parole:[29]Bourne has an extensive criminal record including numerous convictions for property offences. On three previous occasions he was convicted of violent crimes.[30]On November 24, 1987 he was convicted of aggravated assault and assault with a weapon for which he received 18 month sentences served concurrently. On January 18, 1990 he was convicted of aggravated assault for which he received a 30 month sentence. On July 16, 1992 he was convicted of break and entry with intent, break and entry and theft, uttering threats, assault with a weapon and assault. For the assault with a weapon, the assault and uttering threats he received six month consecutive sentences. He received 12 months consecutive sentences for the break and entry offences.[31]There was no evidence other than the record itself respecting the nature or circumstances of these prior offences.[32]Bourne had been released on parole on December 22, 1994. One of the conditions of his parole was that he reside at a specified half-way house. He left that facility on January 6, 1995 to reside with a former girlfriend at 106 Casey Street. He was therefore in breach of his parole at the time of the offence.Attitude Of Offender[33]Bourne pleaded not guilty. That is not an aggravating factor in sentencing.[34]Throughout the trial, including in his testimony, Bourne acknowledged causing the death of Raymond Furlong. (I observe that the evidence, apart from Bourne's testimony, clearly established that fact.) Bourne maintained that he was significantly impaired by the combination of beer and valium at the time of the offence, and that he did not intend to kill or cause bodily harm to Raymond Furlong. He stated that his intention that morning was only to threaten the occupants of 95 Casey Street, particularly Susan Whalen. His counsel submitted that he was guilty of manslaughter. The jury rejected that submission.[35]In his evidence Bourne expressed remorse at having caused the death of Raymond Furlong. In speaking to the Court at the sentencing hearing he reiterated his remorse.Victim And Victim Impact:[36]Raymond Furlong, a resident of St. John's, was 22 years old when his life was taken. He was well known in the downtown St. John's area as the operator of a hot dog vending stand, a business which he had hoped to expand.[37]Raymond Furlong was in good health. He walked with a noticeable limp as a result of a physical disability which he had from childhood and for which he had received considerable treatment. His family was proud of the determination he had shown in overcoming his disability and the good humour with which he lived his life.[38]A Victim Impact Statement prepared by a sister of the deceased was filed. At the sentencing hearing evidence of victim impact was given by the mother of the deceased. Both the statement and the testimony described in very moving terms the deep anguish and sorrow they have experienced. This was the second tragic loss for the family in less than a year. The deceased's only brother, Michael, was a homicide victim in 1994. I acknowledge the grief of the family in these horrendous circumstances.[39]It cannot be the purpose of this sentence to exact revenge for this murder. Nor do I understand the family, in their sorrow and their anger, to be calling for revenge. They properly want this court and the public to remember and acknowledge the victim and the loss that his family and society have suffered by this senseless murder.[40]In determining a sentence that will reflect society's denunciation and repudiation of this offence in all its circumstances I have considered the evidence of victim impact recognizing that no sentence which I impose can expunge the grief of the family.Jury Recommendation[41]In this case the jurors advised that they made no recommendation on parole ineligibility. This is not unusual, particularly following a lengthy and difficult trial. I concur with the view of Wells, J., in R. v. Druken that the absence of a recommendation is neutral. It neither supports nor opposes an increase in parole ineligibility. (See also R. v. Rideout per Puddester, J., at pp. 21-24)Decisions Cited[42]The Crown filed several authorities to show the ineligibility dispositions made under s. 744 in light of the factors existing in those cases. These were:R. v. Baker (R.) (1996), 1996 CanLII 11071 (NL CA), 139 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 58; 433 A.P.R. 58 (Nfld. C.A.)[43]The accused was convicted of second degree murder and attempted murder. The offences occurred following an extended quarrel between the accused and his victims. The offence was committed with a shotgun which the accused obtained after he was ejected from a dwelling following the quarrel. Parole ineligibility was set at 15 years.[44]The Court of Appeal upheld sentence without elaboration. Counsel informed me that Baker had a prior record including crimes of violence.R. v. Shropshire (M.T.), 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227; 188 N.R. 284; 65 B.C.A.C. 37; 106 W.A.C. 37; 102 C.C.C.(3d) 193[45]The accused pleaded guilty to second degree murder. The killing occurred in the course of a drug transaction but there was no apparent motive and the accused offered no explanation for his actions. The accused was 23 years old and had a criminal record for narcotic offences and robbery. Parole ineligibility was set at 12 years.R. v. Yaeck (1991), 1991 CanLII 2732 (ON CA), 50 O.A.C. 29; 68 C.C.C.(3d) 545 (C.A.)[46]The accused was convicted of second degree murder in the stabbing death of a woman who he had met several hours before. The deceased had been stabbed many times and her body mutilated. The accused was much bigger than the deceased and several of the wounds on the deceased were to her hands and appeared to be defensive wounds. The accused relied upon self-defence. The accused had a substantial criminal record. Parole ineligibility was set at 20 years.R. v. Strong (1990), 1990 ABCA 327 (CanLII), 111 A.R. 12; 60 C.C.C.(3d) 516 (C.A.)[47]Three persons, including the accused, entered the deceased's home looking for two persons who had won a large sum of money at a race track. They entered the deceased's bedroom where they found the deceased and one of the persons who had won the money. An argument ensued and the deceased was severely beaten by the intruders who were armed with a shotgun and a crow bar. When the deceased began to stir he was shot and killed. The accused had a lengthy record of violent crimes. Parole ineligibility was set at 15 years.R. v. Nepoose (1988), 1988 ABCA 382 (CanLII), 93 A.R. 32; 46 C.C.C.(3d) 421 (C.A.)[48]The deceased was strangled following substantial sexual abuse by the accused. The court concluded that the killing of the deceased occurred in a crime of drunkenness, brutality and degradation, contributed to in a large measure by the predatory actions of the accused. The accused had lengthy criminal record including two sex related offences and four offences involving violence or threats of violence. Parole ineligibility was set at 15 years.R. v. Klatt (S.T.). [1995] A.J. No. 395; 1995 ABCA 156 (CanLII), 165 A.R. 388: 89 W.A.C. 388 (C.A.)[49]The deceased was stabbed by the accused while responding to the sound of an intruder. The deceased bled to death in the presence of his family. The accused had an extensive criminal record and had tried to intimidate witnesses to lie on his behalf during the trial. Psychiatric assessment revealed an anti-social personality defect. The jury returned a recommendation for 25 years of parole ineligibility. Parole ineligibility was set at 25 years.R. v. Druken, [1993] St. J. No. 5240 (Nfld. T.D.)[50]The accused had a lengthy criminal record including armed robbery and aggravated assault. There was evidence of violence between the accused and his victim, who was his long time common law wife. The crime was termed \"most violent and brutal\". The deceased was stabbed many times and at least 7 or 8 of the wounds would have been fatal. Parole ineligibility was set at 14 years.R. v. Rideout, [1994] St. J. No. 0460 (Nfld. T.D.)[51]The accused arranged to meet her victim, a former sporadic boyfriend, on a deserted road. On a pretext of checking on engine problems she arranged for her victim to be standing in front of her car and deliberately ran into him. The deceased was not seriously hurt by the first impact but was dazed and was ran down a second time when the accused pursued him across a field in her car. The deceased was dragged under the car over 40 feet and subsequently died of injuries sustained. The deceased suffered excruciating pain at the time of the offence and during a lengthy subsequent hospitalization. The accused was a young woman without criminal record and with certain psychological problems. The accused consistently maintained that the events in question were accidental. Parole ineligibility was set at 12 years.R. v. McKay, [1995] St. J. No. 2261 (Nfld. T.D.)[52]The accused went to the victim's residence to obtain money. The victim was impaired at the time. The trial judge described it as \"a case where the accused punched and knocked the victim to the floor, and then stamped on his face with his shoe breaking literally all the bones in the face and then pulling the victim's head backwards and cutting his throat, including severing the windpipe with the sawing motion of a knife. It was a savage brutal murder.\" At the time of the murder the accused was on parole and had a lengthy criminal record, including violent crimes. There was also evidence of threats to witnesses. Parole ineligibility was set at 17 years.Decision Re: Parole Ineligibility:[53]I conclude that this is a case where the period of parole ineligibility should be greater than 10 years. Bourne's criminal record which includes crimes of violence and the fact that he was on parole at the time of the offence are the chief factors leading to that conclusion.[54]An aggravating factor in assessing the period of parole ineligibility in many cases is the finding of extreme brutality which warrants an expression of society's revulsion. This factor was present in R. v. Yaeck and R. v. Nepoose and in the recent Newfoundland cases of R. v. Druken and R. v. McKay. Intimidation of witnesses as in R. v. Klatt and in R. v. McKay is also a factor of considerable force. Neither of these factors is present in this case.[55]In determining the length of parole ineligibility careful consideration has been given to recent Newfoundland cases as an unwarranted disparity between sentences should be avoided.[56]I conclude that in the circumstances of this case a parole ineligibility period of 12 years should be imposed.Pronouncement Of Sentence[57]Having given my reasons I will now formally pronounce sentence.[58]Mr. Bourne will you please stand.[59]WALLACE BOURNE: You have been found guilty by a jury of the second degree murder of Raymond Furlong, and conviction is entered against you. I impose the following sentence upon you:1. Pursuant to the requirements of s. 235 of the Criminal Code you are sentenced to a period of imprisonment for life in a penitentiary, without eligibility for parole until you have served 12 years of your sentence.2. Pursuant to s. 100(1) of the Criminal Code you are prohibited for life from having in your possession any firearm or ammunition or explosive substance.3. Pursuant to s. 727.9 of the Criminal Code you shall pay a Victim Fine Surcharge of $35.00. This sum is to be paid within 90 days from this date. Accused sentenced."}

Nightingale of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting without a jury.REASONS FOR DECISION[1]The appellant pleaded guilty to counts of possession of a prohibited firearm together with readily accessible ammunition, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, flight from police and possession of marijuana under three kilograms for the purpose of trafficking.[2]The trial judge imposed a global sentence of 5.5 years (66 months) less credit of 25 months for time spent in predisposition custody, leaving a net sentence of 41 months in a federal penitentiary.[3]In this court, the appellant contends that the trial judge made two errors in principle. He says that the trial judge:i.failed to apply the principle of restraint when imposing a first sentence of imprisonment upon him; andii.imposed a sentence that was outside the range of sentence imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.[4]We do not give effect to either ground of appeal advanced on the appellant’s behalf.[5]We begin from a stance of deference. Absent an error in principle; a failure to consider a relevant factor; consideration of an irrelevant factor; or an over or underemphasis on relevant factors, we are disentitled to interfere unless the sentence is demonstrably unfit.[6]These were very serious offences. Denunciation and deterrence assume places of prominence in determining a fit sentence for crimes involving firearms, especially loaded semi-automatic firearms in the possession of drug traffickers. It is all the more so when the gun is tossed onto the street near a McDonald’s restaurant, where young persons might reasonably be expected to attend. The appellant’s driving over an extended distance, engaging police in a high-speed pursuit through municipal streets and controlled-access highways, put individual and public safety at substantial risk.[7]The trial judge did not lose sight of several mitigating factors. The relative youth of the appellant. His guilty plea, albeit after a preliminary inquiry. His efforts at self-improvement. His family’s support and reasonable rehabilitative prospects. And the fact that this would be his first jail sentence.[8]In our view, the trial judge imposed a fit sentence, mindful of the governing sentencing objectives and principles including proportionality and totality. We would not interfere. Leave to appeal sentence is granted, but the appeal from sentence is dismissed.\"David Watt J.A.\"\"Grant Huscroft J.A.\"\"G.T. Trotter J.A.\""}

The case was adjourned to June 12 for sentencing.Because of the trial judge’s illness, the June 12 sentencing hearing was adjourned to July 10.On that day, the hearing was suspended indefinitely again because of the trial judge’s illness.The trial judge resigned on April 15, 1996, and on May 21 the Crown requested that a new judge be assigned to sentence the accused.A new judge was assigned the next day.On June 27, before the new judge, defence counsel requested an adjournment until July 11.At that time the matter was adjourned to September 24 for a defence motion to have the charges stayed.On that date, the new judge granted the motion, holding that the 17‑month sentencing delay violated s. 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court of Appeal dismissed the Crown’s appeal.This appeal raises the same issues dealt with in R. v. MacDougall, rendered concurrently.Held:The appeal should be allowed and the case remitted to the trial court for sentencing.For the reasons expressed in MacDougall, the s. 11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time extends to sentencing.However, the accused’s s. 11(b) right was not violated in this case as the 17‑month sentencing delay was not unreasonable.The courts below mischaracterized the delay relating to the trial judge’s illness by wrongly considering it attributable to the Crown.The Crown only bears responsibility for the one‑month period between the trial judge’s resignation and the request for the assignment of a new judge.The accused is responsible for the three‑week delay resulting from his request for an adjournment.The remaining months of the delay are attributable to the inherent time requirements of the case, including the 10 months of delay relating to the trial judge’s illness.Delay related to judicial illness which takes places in the period before it is reasonable for the Crown to apply to have the judge removed is inherent delay and is not counted against the Crown.The delay of one month attributable to the Crown is not egregious and the evidence does not suggest that it prejudiced the accused.Cases CitedReferred to: R. v.

MacDougall, 1998 CanLII 763 (SCC), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 45:(1) whether the right to be tried within a reasonable time under s. 11(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms includes the right to be sentenced within a reasonable time, and (2) the proper characterization of delay related to judicial illness under s. 11(b).As in MacDougall, the sentencing delay that occurred in this case was primarily due to the prolonged illness of the trial judge.For the reasons I expressed in MacDougall, I am of the opinion that the s. 11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time extends to sentencing.However, in this case, as in MacDougall, I am of the view that the delay that occurred was not unreasonable and would allow the appeal and remit the case to the trial court for sentencing.II.Facts2On April 19, 1995, Gallant was charged with breaking and entering.He was also charged with 10 other summary conviction offences, which are not at issue in this appeal.Gallant appeared before Plamondon Prov. Ct. J. on April 24, 1995, and pleaded guilty to all charges.The matter was adjourned to June 12, 1995, to allow for the preparation of a pre-sentence report.The June 12, 1995, hearing was subsequently adjourned to July 10, 1995, due to the illness of the trial judge.On July 10, 1995, the case was adjourned indefinitely due to the illness of Plamondon Prov. Ct. J.Judge Plamondon resigned on April 15, 1996.3On May 21, 1996, Crown counsel wrote to Chief Provincial Court Judge Thompson, requesting that a judge be assigned to sentence Gallant.FitzGeraldProv. Ct. J. was assigned on May 22, 1996.At his first appearance before the new judge on June 27, 1996, Gallant’s counsel requested an adjournment to July 11, 1996.On July 11, 1996, the matter was adjourned to September 24, 1996, for a defence motion to have the charges stayed.On September 24, 1996, FitzGerald Prov. Ct. J. granted Gallant’s motion for a stay of proceedings based on a s. 11(b) Charter violation because of the delay in sentencing.The Crown’s appeal to the P.E.I. Court of Appeal was dismissed, and the Crown appeals to this Court by leave granted July 3, 1997, [1997] 2 S.C.R. xiv.III.Statutory Provisions4Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms11.Any person charged with an offence has the right(a)to be informed without unreasonable delay of the specific offence;(b)to be tried within a reasonable time;(c)not to be compelled to be a witness in proceedings against that person in respect of the offence;(d)to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal;(e)not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause;(f)except in the case of an offence under military law tried before a military tribunal, to the benefit of trial by jury where the maximum punishment for the offence is imprisonment for five years or a more severe punishment;(g)not to be found guilty on account of any act or omission unless, at the time of the act or omission, it constituted an offence under Canadian or international law or was criminal according to the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations;(h)if finally acquitted of the offence, not to be tried for it again and, if finally found guilty and punished for the offence, not to be tried or punished for it again; and(i)if found guilty of the offence and if the punishment for the offence has been varied between the time of commission and the time of sentencing, to the benefit of the lesser punishment.IV.Judgments BelowA.Prince Edward Island Provincial Court5FitzGerald Prov. Ct. J. heard the applications for stays of proceedings in this case andin MacDougall together, and provided one set of reasons for the two cases.He concluded that a trial, as considered under s. 11(b), “includes all of the various phases of a trial including the sentencing process”.In his view, though “it is more important. . . for the fact-finding aspect of a trial to proceed expeditiously than it is for the sentencing aspect of a trial to proceed expeditiously”,s. 11(b) applies to both stages.FitzGerald Prov. Ct. J. found that the sentencing delay in both cases violated s. 11(b) as the delay was mainly attributable to the Crown’s failure to take steps to have the cases reassigned once the first judge became indefinitely unavailable.He ordered a stay in each case as a remedy for the violations.B.Prince Edward Island Supreme Court, Appeal Division,[1997] P.E.I.J. No. 12 (QL)6The Prince Edward Island Court of Appeal,per Mitchell J.A., dismissed the Crown’s appeal.Relying on the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Bosley (1992), 1992 CanLII 2838 (ON CA), 59 O.A.C. 161, Mitchell J.A. concluded that s. 11(b) includes the right to be sentenced within a reasonable time.In his view, s. 11(b) was violated both in this case and in MacDougall, and FitzGerald Prov. Ct. J. was correct in granting stays.V.Issues7(1)Does the s. 11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time apply to sentencing?(2)When does delay in sentencing related to a judge’s illness violate s. 11(b)?VI.Analysis8The first issue in this appeal and in MacDougall is whether the s. 11(b) right to be tried within a reasonable time includes the right to be sentenced within a reasonable time.In MacDougall, I concluded that it does.I reached this conclusion based on the wording of s. 11(b) and the interests — both those of accused persons and those of society — the section is meant to protect.9The second issue in this appeal and in MacDougall is how delay related to judicial illness should be characterized for the purposes of s. 11(b).Where the trial judge falls ill and is expected to return, the Crown must balance two competing factors:(1) the need to proceed with the utmost care and caution when considering the removal of a judge seized with a case in order to protect judicial independence and fairness to the accused, and (2) the need to protect the accused’s s. 11(b) rights and prevent undue prejudice to the accused.In light of the balancing which the Crown must undertake, delay related to a judge’s illness can be characterized as inherent delay, Crown delay, or systemic delay, depending on the circumstances of the case.Delay related to judicial illness which takes places in the period before it is reasonable for the Crown to apply to have the judge removed is inherent delay and is not counted against the Crown.Delay which occurs after the point when it is reasonable for the Crown to apply to have the judge removed is Crown delay.Delay in replacing a judge which transpires after the point when it is reasonable for the Crown to apply to have the judge removed due to lack of judicial resources is institutional or systemic delay, counting against the Crown if the lack of resources is unreasonable having regard to the particular pressures on the court system at issue.10Given that s. 11(b) includes the right to be sentenced within a reasonable time and taking into account the appropriate manner in which to characterize delay related to judicial illness, it remains to be considered whether there was a s. 11(b) violation in this case.11The total delay between the charge and the hearing of Gallant’s s. 11(b) motion of approximately 17 and a half months, was excessive and meets the threshold test requiring courts below to examine whether the delay was unreasonable under s. 11(b).In my view, however, the courts below proceeded on the wrong principles by mischaracterizing the delay relating to Judge Plamondon’s illness and wrongly considering itattributable to the Crown.12There is little dispute about the characterization of the delays other than those related to Judge Plamondon’s illness.For the record, I will briefly review them.Gallant was charged on April 19, 1995, and first appeared a week later, at which time he pleaded guilty.The case was adjourned to June 12, 1995,for sentencing and for the preparation of a pre-sentence report.The period from April 19, 1995, to June 12, 1995, is attributable to the inherent time requirements of the case.Similarly, the period between the assignment of FitzGerald Prov. Ct. J. on May 22, 1996, and Gallant’s first appearance before the new judge on June 27, 1996, as well as the period from July 11, 1996, to the hearing of the s. 11(b) motion on September 24, 1996, are attributable to the inherent time requirements of the case.The two-week adjournment from June 27, 1996, to July 11, 1996, was requested by Gallant’s counsel.Therefore, it must be considered as waived, and cannot be used in support of the claim that a s. 11(b) violation has occurred.On June 12, 1995, the case was adjourned for one month due to the trial judge’s illness.A further, indefinite, adjournment occurred on July 10, 1995.The case was not assigned to a new judge until May 22, 1996.The period between Judge Plamondon’s resignation on April 15, 1996, and the request for the assignment of a new judge on May 21, 1996, is delay attributable to the Crown.13As discussed in MacDougall, the contentious 10-month delay between the first adjournment on account of Judge Plamondon’s illness on June 12, 1995, and Judge Plamondon’s resignation on April 15, 1996, did not result from unreasonable Crown conduct and did not constitute unreasonable systemic delay.14When Judge Plamondon fell ill, the expectation was that he would soon return to his judicial duties.On the justifiable assumption that Judge Plamondon would return, the Crown proceeded in accordance with the general rule that an accused should be sentenced by the judge who took the plea or presided at the conviction phase of the trial.The Crown was required to proceed cautiously in moving to replace Judge Plamondon.Against this I balance the right of the accused to be tried within a reasonable time and ask whether the circumstances required departure from the usual rule that the judge seized of the case retains jurisdiction over it until its conclusion.The Crown had no information suggesting that Judge Plamondon would not be returning, nor that his absence would be unduly lengthy.It became apparent that he would not return only upon the announcement of his retirement.The delay in question was 10 months long.However, it occurred in the post-conviction phase of proceedings when the interests engaged by s. 11(b) were more attenuated, in the circumstances, than in the pre-conviction phase.Furthermore, there was no indication that the delay would cause the accused any significant prejudice.In these circumstances, I cannot conclude that the Crown erred in not moving prior to Judge Plamondon’s resignation to remove and replace him.Crown delay is therefore not established.15Similar considerations resolve the question of whether the failure to replace Judge Plamondon earlier constituted unreasonable systemic delay.The occasional illness of trial judges is an inevitable and unfortunate incident of any system reliant on human endeavour.Delay related to the illness of a trial judge is part of the inherent time requirements of a case where the Crown has acted reasonably and there is no shortage of resources.A case for unreasonable systemic delay would only have arisen in this case if an order to replace Judge Plamondon had been made but been impossible to put into effect because there was no replacement judge available.That was not the case here.16In sum, the delay in this case is attributable as follows: the accused bears responsibility for two weeks of the delay.The Crown bears responsibility for one month of the delay.Approximately six of the months are attributable to the inherent time requirements of the case.The final 10 months due to the illness of Judge Plamondon cannot be considered as Crown delay or unreasonable systemic delay but as an inherent time requirement of the case.Neither the Crown nor the system operated unreasonably in not removing Judge Plamondon bearing in mind the exceptional nature of such action.This leaves a net Crown delay of approximately one month.This delay is not egregious nor does the evidence suggest that the delay prejudicedGallant.There is thus no evidence capable of justifying a claim under s. 11(b) of the Charter.17I conclude that Gallant’s claim of unreasonable delay in breach of s. 11(b) of the Charter should be dismissed.VII.Conclusion18I would allow the appeal and remand the case to the Prince Edward Island Provincial Court for sentencing.Appeal allowed.Solicitor for the appellant:Crown Attorney’s Office, Charlottetown.Solicitor for the respondent:Prince Edward Island Legal Aid, Charlottetown."}

Vertes, at F[…] in the NorthwestTerritories, on June 14th A.D., 2007._________________________________________________________APPEARANCES:Mr. J. MacFarlane:Counsel for the CrownMr. B. Gaunt:Mr. G. Boyd:Counsel for the Accused----------------------------------------Charge under s. 153(1)(a) Criminal Code of CanadaBan on Publication of Complainant/WitnessPursuant to Section 486 of the Criminal CodeOfficial Court Reporters1THE COURT:The offender, Marvin Noel2Lizotte, has pleaded guilty to three charges of3sexual exploitation, contrary to4Section 153(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.5The offence of sexual exploitation is6committed when an adult person, who stands in a7position of trust or authority vis-à-vis a young8person, abuses that trust or authority by9engaging in sexual activity with that young10person.The consent or acquiesence of the young11person to that activity is irrelevant as far as12the law is concerned.The aim of the law is to13put the responsibility on the adult for his or14her behaviour.15In this case the offender abused a position16of trust because he was the school teacher of the17three complainants.18The jurisprudence demonstrates that teachers19who breach their position of trust and authority20are treated severely.That is because, as many21cases have said, teachers are responsible for22maintaining an appropriate and professional23relationship with their students.They are the24ones responsible for ensuring that the25professional relationship does not become26distorted with a personal relationship.Those27who take the calculated risk of allowingOfficial Court Reporters11themselves to give in to their personal desires2will be punished for their breach of the trust3and the duty they owe to their students and to4the community.5For these reasons, the law places emphasis6on deterrence and denunciation as the primary7principles in sentencing for this crime.8The offences in this case occurred between91999 and 2002 when the offender was a teacher at10the […] School here11in F[…].He was between 29 and 3112years of age in those years.13The first charge relates to one incident of14sexual intercourse with the complainant J. M. in152002.The complainant was in Grade 8 and the16offender was her physical education teacher.She17was 14 years old.J. M. and the offender started18by exchanging e-mails.The offender invited her19to his residence.She went and they ended up20having sexual intercourse.21The second charge also relates to one22incident of sexual intercourse, this time with23the complainant L. L. who was 16 years old at the24time.The offender and the complainant exchanged25e-mails and eventually he invited her to his26residence.She went and they had sexual27intercourse.There was little or no contactOfficial Court Reporters21between the two of them after that.2Apparently rumours circulated around town3that the two were having some type of4relationship because in 2000, a few months after5this incident, both the complainant and the6offender were interviewed by a police officer.7The complainant denied that there was any8relationship.9The third charge relates to a longer-term10series of acts by the offender.In 1999, when11the complainant S. M. was 15 years old, she and12the offender commenced a relationship that lasted13for two years.They had sexual intercourse on14numerous occasions.The complainant would sneak15out of her home late at night to go to the16offender's residence and would usually wait until17the offender left for work at the school in the18morning before she left the residence.The19relationship ended when S. M. got a boyfriend her20own age and no longer wanted to see the offender.21There is no evidence that the offender, at22any time, used violence or threats or any type of23coercive behaviour.I accept what his counsel24said.The offender was lonely; he started to25develop friendships with his students; and he26ignored the professional barriers separating his27role as a teacher and his personal passions.Official Court Reporters31But, no matter how \"consensual\" these affairs2were, he is still responsible for his breach of3trust.That is the essence of what the law means4by exploitation.5These offences did not come to light until6early 2006 when one of the complainants reported7to the police.All three are now in their 20s8and no doubt they have come to realize that the9actions of their teacher was wrong.10The victim impact statements filed by the11three complainants speak to the harm that the12offender caused.They each struggle with13feelings of hurt, depression, and shame.They14each lack faith in any figure of authority.They15each feel violated and abused by someone they16trusted.They have been the subject of gossip17and accusations.And they have all been involved18in counselling.19In this case, I have had the benefit of a20thorough pre-sentence report.21The offender is now 36 years old.He is a22Cree Nation Metis from FortVermilion, Alberta.23He was the youngest of 11 children and grew up on24a farm outside of Fort Vermilion.Apparently the25family was very poor.The parents abused alcohol26and therefore the children bonded together to27support each other.Despite these difficulties,Official Court Reporters41the offender went on to university where he2obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in education.3He worked as a teacher in Alberta and the4Northwest Territories.He has lost his ability5to continue teaching due to these charges and now6works as a heavy equipment operator in Fort7McMurray.8The offender's counsel has provided a number9of reference letters written on behalf of his10client.They all speak to his otherwise good11character and integrity, his commitment to his12family and community, and his hard work and13industry.Everyone who knows the offender said14that these actions were out-of-character for him.15The offender has a criminal record, a conviction16for impaired driving in 1993, that is not17pertinent in my opinion to these proceedings.18I am required, of course, to consider the19circumstances of the offender as an aboriginal20person before the Court.I recognize that there21are widespread systemic factors of a general22nature affecting all aboriginal Canadians that23have placed them at a disadvantage.However, in24this case, I have not been told of any systemic25factors specific to this offender that may have26played a part in bringing him before the Court.27Quite the contrary, despite the disadvantages ofOfficial Court Reporters51his upbringing he achieved his goal of becoming a2teacher.He also has the support of his siblings3and friends.4Since being charged, the offender has sought5counselling through native spirituality in order6to address the causes of his behaviour and other7personal issues.There is, however, no evidence8of any psychopathology.9In this case, I have no doubt that the10offender is genuinely remorseful for his actions.11He apologized to his victims here in open court.12He has entered this guilty plea which has spared13his victims from going through a trial.I14therefore take all this into account as15mitigating factors.16Crown counsel submitted that this case calls17for a term of actual imprisonment.He asked me18to impose a sentence of two years less one day19plus a period of probation.In the Crown's view,20these offences reveal a deliberate pattern of21behaviour over a lengthy period of time.It is22not a situation of a one-time error in judgment.23Therefore a significant denunciatory sentence is24required.25Defence counsel submitted that this would be26an appropriate case for a conditional sentence,27(meaning simply that the offender would serve theOfficial Court Reporters61sentence without going to an actual jail).2Counsel argued that deterrence can be satisfied3through a conditional sentence because of the4public shame of conviction, the imposition of5strict conditions, and the denunciatory effect of6losing the ability to pursue one's profession.7There is, in counsel's submission, no evidence8that the offender is a risk to reoffend.9There is, as everyone knows, a wide10discretion vested in Judges when sentencing for11any criminal offence.For this offence, the12potential maximum penalty is 10 years in jail.13But sentencing is very much an individualized14exercise in every case.The overarching15principle in sentencing in any case, however, is16that the sentence imposed must be proportionate17to the gravity of the offence and the degree of18responsibility of the offender.19In this case, I should make note of the fact20that Section 153 of the Criminal Code was amended21in 2005 to provide for a mandatory minimum22punishment (45 days in jail if prosecuted by23indictment).Therefore, a conditional sentence24is no longer available for a conviction under25this section since a conditional sentence may not26be imposed if the offence is one punishable by a27minimum term of imprisonment.However,Official Court Reporters71Section 11(f) of the Canadian Charter of Rights2and Freedoms provides that \"if the punishment for3the offence has been varied between the time of4commission and the time of sentencing\", the5accused has the right to the benefit of the6lesser punishment.Accordingly, I cannot, and I7do not, exclude the prospect of a conditional8sentence from my consideration.9Both counsel supplied me with numerous cases10to support their arguments.While these11references are helpful, they are of course12specific to the facts of each case.What they13demonstrate is that in some cases actual jail14time was imposed and in others conditional15sentences were imposed.Generally speaking,16however, they also demonstrate that the17sentencing objectives emphasized are deterrence18and denunciation, the promotion of a sense of19responsibility by the offender, and on the20acknowledgment of the harm done to the victims21and the community.Conditional sentences have22been imposed usually when the breach of trust was23not particularly egregious or severe in nature,24where the sexual conduct was either a single25event or of limited duration, and where the26offender acknowledged moral responsibility for27the offence.Official Court Reporters81In my opinion, this is not a case that would2warrant a jail term of two years or more3therefore a conditional sentence is very much a4possibility.The real question is whether such a5sentence would be consistent with the fundamental6purpose and principles of sentencing. I have7concluded, considering the circumstances of this8case, that it would not be so consistent.9This is a case where the offender engaged in10a lengthy and repetitive course of deliberate11conduct not with one but with three of his12students.He knew that what he was doing was13wrong because he actively took steps to hide what14he was doing.He kept doing it even after he was15warned by a police officer.He took advantage of16his position of trust in a small school in a17small community.He may have all sorts of18sterling qualities but he had a complete19disregard for the impact of his conduct on his20young students.21In my opinion, a conditional sentence in22this case would send a wrong message to the23victims, the offender, others who are in similar24situations as the offender, and the community.25Young people in F[…], as much as young26people anywhere in Canada, need to know that they27are protected by the law.People in positions ofOfficial Court Reporters91trust and authority, whether in F[…]2or elsewhere in Canada, need to realize that they3are subject to the control of the law.People in4every community need to know that the law exists5for their protection and the law must be seen to6respond effectively when offences are committed.7I have therefore concluded that the sentence must8include a term of actual imprisonment.9Please stand, Mr. Lizotte.10Mr. Lizotte, I know that you are an11intelligent man and you are fully capable of12following everything that I have said, and I know13that you understand and realize the gravity of14your conduct.15With respect to Count 5 of the Indictment,16the offence related to the complainant S. M., I17sentence you to serve a term of imprisonment of1812 months, to be served in jail.19With respect to Counts 1 and 3 of the20Indictment, I sentence you to one month on each21count, to be served consecutively to each other22and consecutive to the sentence on Count 5.23The total sentence is therefore 14 months24imprisonment.25In addition, upon completion of your26sentence, you will be on probation for a period27of 12 months, subject to the followingOfficial Court Reporters101conditions:21.To keep the peace and be of good3behaviour.42.To report to the Court if and when5required to do so.63.To report to a probation officer and to7report as and when required by the probation8officer.94.To attend any programs as directed by10your probation officer.115.To have no contact, directly or12indirectly, with the complainants or their13families.14You may sit down.15In addition, since this conviction also16brings into play various mandatory terms of the17Criminal Code, and in the absence of any evidence18to suggest that the making of these orders will19be grossly disproportionate to the interests of20the offender and to society, I make the following21further orders:221. There will be an order requiring the23offender to provide a sample for DNA analysis and24submission to the DNA databank, pursuant to25Section 487.051 of the Criminal Code.262. There will also be an order requiring the27offender to comply with the provisions of theOfficial Court Reporters111Sexual Offender Information Registration Act for2the designated period of 20 years, pursuant to3Section 490.012 of the Criminal Code.4Under the circumstances there will be no5Victims of Crime fine surcharge.6Have I neglected anything, counsel?7MR. MacFARLANE:No, Your Honour.8MR. BOYD:No, sir.9THE COURT:Then, thank you, counsel for10your submissions.Mr. Lizotte, I realize it's11always difficult to confront the consequences of12one's actions from several years ago but from13everything that I have heard and read about you,14I am sure that you have the strength of character15to overcome this upcoming period of incarceration16and I am sure that you can restore yourself back17into your community and your family as a decent18law-abiding person.I wish you luck.19We will close court.20------------------------------------21Certified to be a true andaccurate transcript pursuant22to Rules 723 and 724 of theSupreme Court Rules,23242526____________________________27Lois Hewitt, CSR(A), RPR, CRRCourt ReporterOfficial Court Reporters12"}

The Crown proceeded by way of indictment. On December 9, 1992, the appellant was sentenced to two years for this offence consecutive to any other sentence he was presently serving and, at the same time, was sentenced to two months each, to be served consecutively to the first sentence for two additional theft charges. The Crown had proceeded summarily in respect to the latter two offences. All three offences concerned what is commonly called shoplifting. They occurred over a three month period.This appeal concerns the indictable offence only.The appellant has a lengthy criminal record extending from 1976 to 1991, some 12 offences, most of which are property related but are not for shoplifting. There were two weapon offences. He was given light sentences for his early offences. The sentences increased in severity as his criminal activity continued. He has previously served federal time. Not only was he on parole when the offence in issue here occurred, but he has previously violated parole. His is an alarming record for a 33 year old person. As Crown counsel remarked in his factum: \"This record clearly indicates a dedication to a life of crime\".We have considered the submission of appellant's counsel in respect to parity of sentencing with the co‑offender and the principle of totality.

(orally)[1]The Crown appeals a sentence of six months imprisonment and a twelve month driving prohibition imposed upon the respondent Terry Bruce Mantee following his conviction on charges of operating a motor vehicle while his blood alcohol concentration exceeded 80 milligrams percent alcohol and driving while disqualified.[2]Mr. Mantee was operating a motor vehicle at about 10 p.m. on January 28, 2005 when he disobeyed a stop sign at the intersection of a grid road and Highway 13 near Forget, Saskatchewan.The police officer on patrol noticed this infraction and followed Mr. Mantee’s automobile.Prior to stopping Mr. Mantee’s vehicle the investigating officer noticed the vehicle swerve toward the shoulder of the road for no apparent reason.[3]Upon speaking with Mr. Mantee the investigating officer noted strong signs of impairment, a breath demand was made and the respondent provided samples which indicated his blood alcohol concentration at 160 and 140.He was disqualified from driving at the time of the offence.[4]The respondent has a prior criminal record that includes 28 convictions from 1978 to 2002.Seventeen of those convictions were criminal driving offences which include six exceeding .08, nine driving while disqualified, one refusing a breath demand conviction and one failing to remain at the scene of an accident.[5]Given the length and seriousness of the criminal record and in particular the multiple convictions for driving while impaired or disqualified, the Crown prosecutor sought a “considerable sentence” of custody.In her submission the only issue was whether the custodial sentence should exceed two years.[6]A pre-sentence report was ordered which indicates that the respondent is 44 years old, married and has three children.He and his wife also support a grandchild.He and his family reside on the Pheasant Rump First Nation.A review of the transcript indicates that none of the Gladue[1] factors are relevant.The respondent has had fairly good employment history, however, he was unemployed at the time of the offence.[7]The trial judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment of six months and ordered a twelve month driving prohibition.This sentence was imposed in the face of a long series of sentences emanating from this Court which have held that offenders who have been convicted of multiple offences of driving while disqualified or driving while impaired must be removed from society so as to ensure the protection of the public.We have stated on many occasions that when sentencing such an offender the paramount sentencing objective must be public protection.It is clear in circumstances of that kind that specific deterrence has had no impact on the offender.[8]Mr. Mantee falls within this class of individual.His list of convictions for driving offences began in 1979 and has continued up until this day.It is true there was a gap between 1996 and 2002 but except for that period of time he was convicted almost yearly of either driving while disqualified or over .08. His record demonstrates a consistent constant pattern of driving while disqualified or driving while over .08.An examination of his record indicates that this is a classic example of an individual who has been dealt with leniently and who has not responded to those lenient sentences.In dealing with driving offences we must, while seeking to protect the public, impose a fit and just punishment having regard for the gravity of the offence.As I stated in R. v. Bear:[2][9]While in most cases, rehabilitation and reformation would be a strong factor in determining an appropriate sentence, in cases involving repeat offenders with multiple driving offence convictions, who have been given every opportunity to reform, this ceases to be a consideration.The offender has clearly shown himself incapable of rehabilitation, with the result that protection of the public can no longer be achieved, or even hoped for, through his reform.…[11]The length of sentences for driving offences has been steadily increasing for the so-called lesser offence of impaired driving, as well as for driving offences involving bodily harm or death.This court, and other appellate courts, seek by imposing longer sentences, to inhibit others from committing this criminal activity.It is generally conceded that legal sanctions have an overall deterrent effect, above all when it is generally known by the public that certain criminal activity, such as impaired driving or driving while disqualified, will be fairly certain to produce a known result, that is, a long period of incarceration.What is not known is whether longer sentences for a particular offence, taken by themselves have the effect of reducing the crime rate, or deterring a particular class of offenders.[9]It was noted in Bear and in R. v. Duckworth,[3] R. v. Whitehead,[4] and R. v. Hotomanie,[5] the sentences for driving offences has been steadily increasing for the so-called lesser offence of impaired driving as well as for driving while disqualified.Protection of the public is the paramount and override of sentencing in these circumstances.As was stated in Bear:[14]In cases such as this, where it is clear neither general deterrence nor specific deterrence have had any impact on the accused, and where it is clear rehabilitation is a faint possibility, how may protection of the public be achieved?If one accepts the fundamental goal of sentencing is the protection of society, the most direct method of achieving that goal, assuming protection of society cannot be achieved by rehabilitation or reformation, is incarceration. Persons like Mr. Bear are the persons law abiding users of the highways have the right to be protected from.There is but one way to protect the public from such people thereby incapacitating the offender by imposing a custodial sentence.[6][10]It is true that both Mr. Bear and Mr. Hotomanie had longer related records than Mr. Mantee and in those cases penitentiary sentences were imposed.Mr. Mantee’s record is marginally less than both Bear and Hotomanie and given the fact that he has been dealt with leniently in the past and has never received a sentence longer than 90 days, we are all of the opinion that a fit sentence in the circumstances of this case would be two years less a day.The driving prohibition imposed in the Court below remains.[11]It is worth repeating what this Court stated in R. v. Kakakaway:[7][6]This court has dealt with drivers who continuously ignore driving restrictions by the imposition of significant custodial terms in numerous cases including:R. v. Fehr, (unreported Sask. C.A., 10 February 1994); R. v. Frank, (unreported Sask. C.A., 10 July 1997); R. v. McCurdy, (unreported Sask. C.A., 27 April 1994); R. v. Bear(L.E.) (1994), 1994 CanLII 4609 (SK CA), 120 Sask. R. 294 (C.A.); and R. v. Whitehead (unreported Sask. C.A., 13 August 1998).From these cases it is apparent that the sentence imposed by the trial judge is such a marked departure as to be demonstrably unfit.[12]In the circumstances the Crown appeal is allowed.The sentence imposed below is set aside and a sentence of imprisonment of two years less a day substituted therefore.[1] R. v.

R. WarkentinReasons on Sentence[1]On March 8, 2012 Myles Fawcett was convicted by a jury of three counts of robbery contrary to the Criminal Code of Canada.The conviction relates to a series of three bank robberies in the Ottawa area, one each on the 15th, 21st and 26th of January 2010.[2]Mr. Fawcett committed the three robberies in a similar fashion.He entered the bank wearing a large coat, hat and gloves, handed a note to a teller that demanded money and then, when provided with cash, left the bank.There was no evidence to suggest a weapon was used in the commission of these offences.[3]In the third robbery, the teller had inserted a dye pack with the stolen funds which exploded shortly after Mr. Fawcett left the bank.Mr. Fawcett then discarded his hat and coat, both of which were recovered by the police and contained samples of his DNA.The video surveillance in the three banks showed that the same person committed the three robberies.[4]Myles Fawcett was arrested on April 16, 2010.At that time he was serving a conditional sentence for the robbery of a pharmacy that he committed in June 2009 and to which he pled guilty in February 2010 (after the commission of the bank robberies but before his arrest).[5]On May 20, 2010 Mr. Fawcett was granted a conditional release pending trial to an organization called Harvest House.Mr. Fawcett was required to remain in Harvest House unless an absence was authorized and he was escorted during the absence. This condition was amended in September 2011 to permit Mr. Fawcett unescorted absences from Harvest House with written permission. Mr. Fawcett remained in Harvest House until I revoked his conditional release on March 8, 2012.Circumstances of Mr. Fawcett[6]Myles Fawcett is currently 24 years old.When he was arrested on April 16, 2010 he was addicted to crack cocaine and narcotic pain medication such as oxycodone.Mr. Fawcett grew up in an environment where his father, Jeffrey Fawcett physically and emotionally abused him.It was his father who introduced and supplied Myles Fawcett first to narcotics and later to non-prescription drugs, in particular to crack cocaine.[7]On May 31, 2008 Myles Fawcett was arrested but not charged in relation to a series of bank robberies committed by his father, Jeffery Fawcett.Myles Fawcett elected to become a Crown witness against his father in those robberies and detailed the techniques used by his father.Myles Fawcett used some of those same methods in the robberies he later committed in January 2010.Jeffrey Fawcett was later convicted and is serving a penitentiary sentence.Jeffrey Fawcett's abuse of Myles Fawcett; the fact that he was the initiator of Myles Fawcett's drug addiction and the person who taught Myles Fawcett how to rob banks were aggravating factors in Jeffrey Fawcett's sentencing.[8]A pre-sentence report was prepared and described in some detail Myles Fawcett's history of drug abuse and his dysfunctional and abusive relationship with his father.More importantly, the report described the changes in Mr. Fawcett since his conditional release in May 2010 to Harvest House.[9]When Mr. Fawcett first arrived at Harvest House he was described by Mr. Gary Wand, the program director as a person with a troubled past, a convoluted story and a substance abuse dependency.Mr. Fawcett had a grade 10 education with little or no work experience.Mr. Wand then described Mr. Fawcett's determination to change his life, starting with taking charge of his drug addiction.Mr. Wand confirmed that Mr. Fawcett has remained clean and sober since May 2010. This was supported by random, surprise drug testing.[10]Some of Mr. Fawcett's achievements since May 2010 are as follows:a)Mr. Fawcett was described by Mr. Wand as someone who, despite the difficult emotional struggles of dealing with his circumstances, kept picking himself up and never gave up. Within his first year at Harvest House, the staff reported noticeable physical and psychological changes in Mr. Fawcett.He was happier, more open to constructive feedback from his peers and developed better social skills through public speaking and community outreach activities.b)Mr. Fawcett was productive, worked toward his goals and developed trusting relationships with staff and peers. In spite of Mr Fawcett's limited work experience prior to entering Harvest House, he contributed 944 hours of shift work at Harvest House which entailed working in a variety of positions.The staff reported that Mr. Fawcett was always willing to learn, had good work ethic and accepted and responded well to constructive criticism.c)Mr. Fawcett performed 96 hours of community service for which he volunteered, including speaking in different high schools as part of a drug prevention and education initiative, the Army Run, physical labour for seniors and fundraising for the Harvest House program.d)By August 2011 Mr. Fawcett's physical condition had improved and he began participating in the Harvest House running program.e)Mr. Fawcett attended classes and successfully completed all but one of the exams in order to obtain his General Education Diploma (GED).His teacher expects he will pass this the next time he is able to take the exam.His teacher described him as a prompt, punctual, motivated and polite student who was always ready to work.She indicated that he initially had no self-confidence in his ability to learn, but over time that changed and he had begun to realize he could be as good as others.She indicated that Mr. Fawcett never missed classes, even though he was often working night shifts and would have to attend class in the morning prior to going to sleep.She described him as the type of student that teachers want in their classroom.f)Mr. Fawcett has prepared a relapse prevention plan by identifying triggers and negative thoughts and feelings.He has developed positive coping strategies that he has applied during the period he has been incarcerated since the guilty verdicts. These include contacting Harvest House daily to obtain support and remain connected to the community.g)Mr. Fawcett expressed remorse and shame and also realized the seriousness of his offences.He told the writer of the pre- sentence report that he felt horrible for his conduct and the impact it has had on others, particularly the victims of his offences.The author of the pre-sentence report stated that Mr. Fawcett did not try to minimize his conduct.He confirmed that Mr. Fawcett is prepared to accept whatever sentence or conditions are imposed upon him.Evidence of Reverend William Main[11]The founder of Harvest House, Reverend William Main, testified at the sentencing hearing.Reverend Main described himself as a recovering alcoholic and drug addict who has been sober for 40 years.Approximately 32 years ago he founded Harvest House for the purpose of assisting other addicts, including those entering or leaving the prison system.[12]In describing Harvest House, Reverend Main noted that it is a Christian based organization (although they accept individuals from all faiths), supported solely by charitable donations.Harvest House is physically located outside of the City of Ottawa to make it more difficult for recovering addicts to return to areas that are problematic for them.Reverend Main confirmed that their program is well known to police and the courts and that they work closely with both to ensure that those residents on conditions imposed by the court follow those conditions.[13]Reverend Main testified that they contact the police when they encounter persons in their custody who breach their bail or probation conditions.Similarly, they will not permit individuals who do not accept their rules and values to remain in the program.It is as a result of this arrangement that they are able to provide space for those who are on conditional release without the requirement for posting monetary bond and why they are a good place for those on parole or probation who have a desire to change. Additionally, their facilities are secure so that their residents in the secure phase of the program cannot leave without authorization.[14]At Harvest House they provide programs for addiction and actively assist with the educational needs of residents.They also work with their residents to provide them with employment skills and work towards rehabilitation while providing a loving and supportive community for those purposes.They insist that those who wish to remain residents at Harvest House practice honesty and live by that conduct.They hold individuals accountable for their conduct regardless of their past histories, however dysfunctional, and do not permit them to look at past abuses as an excuse for criminal or dishonest conduct.[15]Reverend Main made it clear that they believe that those guilty of criminal conduct should pay for their crimes, but they also believe that this price can be mitigated by change in an individual.He recounted numerous examples of the benefits of change in those who are willing to embrace this philosophy and take ownership of their lives.[16]It was a recurring theme from Reverend Main's evidence that at Harvest House they live by the philosophy that everyone should be held accountable for one's conduct; everyone should be forgiven; and that everyone deserves another chance.[17]Specifically with respect to Myles Fawcett, Reverend Main confirmed that they have a good relationship with him and have confidence in his ability to succeed in his recovery from addiction and his rehabilitation to a productive member of society.[18]Reverend Main had encouraged Mr. Fawcett to plead guilty at an early stage and for reasons on which he could not elaborate; Mr. Fawcett chose not to take that step.Reverend Main was clearly disappointed that Mr. Fawcett put the justice system to the time and expense of a trial when he was guilty of the crimes for which he had been charged.His failure to acknowledge guilt publicly by pleading guilty was something that was of concern to the board at Harvest House; so much so that the board considered whether or not to permit Mr. Fawcett to remain in their program.In the end they determined that the progress Mr. Fawcett was making outweighed his failure to plead guilty.Additionally they did not want to undermine the legal advice he was receiving.[19]Reverend Main acknowledged that notwithstanding the progress Mr. Fawcett has made to date, recovery from addiction is a growth process with many challenges. He confirmed that they will continue to support Mr. Fawcett regardless of the sentence he receives and will start working with him and with the correctional system immediately to assist him with his release planning and will support him while incarcerated. They will keep him in their program for whatever length the Court imposes and then as long as Mr. Fawcett chooses to stay with them.[20]It was Reverend Main's opinion that Mr. Fawcett is still in the early stages of his development as a recovering addict and that the world still presents many risks for him;that for Mr. Fawcett, this particularly includes the world inside the prison system.It was his opinion that time in prison would present a high risk of relapse for Mr. Fawcett because he is the type of person who needs to fit in.He described Mr. Fawcett as someone who seeks approval and so responds to others by becoming like them, good or bad.They have been assisting Mr. Fawcett to be aware of this need, the triggers that cause it and how to resist bad influences.[21]Reverend Main was of the belief that Mr. Fawcett is at a vulnerable stage of his recovery and that incarceration, particularly if on a long sentence, would be a bad place for him and would be detrimental to his future.He was concerned that Harvest House would not get him back soon enough to prevent his relapse and he would return to negative behaviours, particularly drug use and crime.[22]Reverend Main testified that Mr. Fawcett's father Jeffrey Fawcett has asked that if Myles Fawcett is given a penitentiary sentence that he be placed in the same prison.Jeffrey Fawcett has apparently told Myles Fawcett that he would be in a position to protect him from the dangers inside the penitentiary.Reverend Main was particularly concerned about the destructive effect that would have on all of the progress that Myles Fawcett has made.Mitigating Factors[23]Many of the mitigating factors relating to Mr. Fawcett's progress in his recovery from addiction and his remorse for his criminal conduct have already been mentioned so I will not restate them here.In brief Mr. Fawcett:a)Has much support from individuals in his community, particularly those at Harvest House.b)Has demonstrated an ability to leave behind his past criminal conduct, drug addiction and has a desire to give back to the community.c)If he returns to Harvest House after his custodial sentence, he has good prospects for rehabilitation and of becoming a productive member of society.d)He fully complied with and exceeded the terms of the conditional interim release.e)After his conviction, he showed remorse and has now taken responsibility for his crimes.[24]It was agreed by counsel that Mr. Fawcett's youth and the fact that it was his father, Jeffrey Fawcett who introduced him to narcotics and taught him to rob banks should be taken into consideration.As previously noted, these were considered aggravating factors in Jeffrey Fawcett's sentencing.[25]Counsel for the Defence argued that the manner in which the bank robberies were conducted should be considered a mitigating factor in that they were not the result of significant advance planning and did not include the use of a weapon. He submitted that this is relevant when comparing sentences in other bank robbery cases, many of which included significant sophistication, advance planning and the use of weapons.Aggravating Factors[26]Counsel for the Crown agreed that this case presented an unusual and difficult situation for determining a fit sentence.However, he noted that there were numerous aggravating factors to suggest that a longer period of incarceration is warranted.[27]With respect to the planning of the bank robberies, Counsel for the Crown agreed that while these robberies did not entail the highest degree of sophistication, the fact that Mr. Fawcett attempted to conceal his appearance, demanded the return of the robbery note and engaged in other types of counter surveillance methods, such as demanding that there be no \"ink\" or dye packs included with the stolen funds; that he wore baggy clothes and then disposed of those clothes after the robbery and that Mr. Fawcett prepared a separate note before each robbery, demonstrated an element of some planning and deliberation.[28]The other aggravating factors as set out by the Crown included:a)That Mr. Fawcett was bound by both a recognizance and probation order at time of the robberies.b)He was on bail for a similar offence, the robbery of a pharmacy of narcotics with a note that threatened violence at the time he committed these robberies.c)Robbery is a serious crime.The Criminal Code provides for a punishment of a maximum of life imprisonment with no minimum sentence and there is no eligibility for a conditional sentence.Positions of the Defence and Crown[29]The Defence position is that Mr.Fawcett should receive the maximum credit available to him for any pre-sentence custody and then serve a sentence somewhat less than 2 years to be followed by 3 years' probation to be served at Harvest House.[30]Crown and Defence agreed that to July 5, 2012, the date of sentencing submissions, Mr. Fawcett had served 156 days of pre-sentence custody.Adding to that another 27 days to today, July 31, 2012, Mr. Fawcett has served 183 days of pre-sentence custody (or 6 months).[31]Crown and Defence also agreed that the period of time Mr. Fawcett spent while on conditional release at Harvest House between May 21, 2010 and September 2011 should be considered in the same fashion as house arrest, which typically receives credit on the basis of 25% of the time served.Counsel for the Defence argued that the period while at Harvest House between September 2011 and March 8, 2012 when his bail was revoked should also qualify on the same terms as house arrest notwithstanding a change that loosened the conditional release provisions in September 2011.This would equate to another 4 or 5 months of pre-sentence custody.[32]It was the position of counsel for the Defence that Mr. Fawcett is still entitled to receive credit for pre-sentence custody on the basis of 2 days for each day of pre-sentence custody because the robberies were committed prior to the coming into force of the Truth in Sentencing Act.The recent Alberta Court of Appeal Case of R. v. Serdyuk[1] supports this proposition and suggests that failure to do so is a legal error.Providing the maximum calculation to that equation, Mr. Fawcett would receive credit equivalent to 22 months custody.[33]It was the position of the Defence that by sentencing Mr. Fawcett to a shorter period of incarceration followed by a longer period of probation, the maximum of 3 years, would assist Mr. Fawcett in continuing his recovery and with his eventual re-entry into the community.[34]Counsel for the Defence argued that Mr. Fawcett has already demonstrated that he will abide by conditions of his release and so there is minimal risk to the community of imposing such a sentence.In contrast, the risk of a penitentiary sentence is high because there is less likelihood that Mr. Fawcett will have the same opportunity or inclination to return to Harvest House once he is released from a longer sentence.[35]The Crown position is that an appropriate sentence would be 2 years each for the three bank robberies.He submitted that in light of Mr. Fawcett's prior criminal record, particularly the prior robbery in 2009 and when considering the proportionality principle, particularly the fact that the bank robberies were over a short duration, the Crown recommended a penitentiary term of between 4 and 5 years less any credit for which Mr. Fawcett would be entitled in light of his pre-sentence custody.[36]The Crown argued that credit for pre-sentence custody should be only awarded on a one for one basis due to the enactment of the Truth in Sentencing Act prior to the charges being laid.He claimed that credit for the period of time Mr. Fawcett spent in Harvest House should be limited to May 2010 until September 2011 when the bail conditions were amended, with no credit for the time Mr. Fawcett spent at Harvest House from September 2011 to March 2012. Using the Crown's calculations, the total credit for pre-sentence custody would be approximately 11 months.[37]Additionally, the Crown was seeking 2 ancillary orders, that of a weapons prohibition and that Mr. Fawcett provide a DNA sample, neither of which were opposed by the Defence.[38]Crown counsel agreed that the sentence proposed by the Defence would have been a perfect sentence if Mr. Fawcett had pled guilty.He acknowledged that it would not have been difficult for the Crown to have both advocated for and agreed to such a sentence at that time.[39]Counsel for the Crown made it clear that he was not suggesting that because Mr. Fawcett chose to proceed to trial, this was an aggravating factor.He argued that a guilty plea provides some additional opportunity to craft a sentence that is no longer available after a trial and conviction.[40]Counsel for the Crown asked the court to consider the fact that in this case both society and the administration of justice were put to the maximum expense possible, that being a lengthy jury trial.[41]Finally, Crown Counsel argued that the court should not give a lesser sentence than the one he proposed given all the circumstances of this case.He noted that the aggravating factors, particularly Mr. Fawcett's prior criminal record were significant and serious.The fact that Mr. Fawcett has now acknowledged guilt and responsibility, only after guilt was established in a trial should cause the court to be at least partially skeptical of Mr. Fawcett's claim of remorse.General Principles of Sentencing[42]The fundamental purpose of sentencing is set out in s. 718 of the Criminal Code.It is to contribute to respect for the law and to maintain a just, peaceful and safe society. A court is required to impose a just sanction that has one or more of the following six objectives:a)To denounce unlawful conduct;b)To deter the offender and others from committing offences;c)To separate offenders from society where necessary;d)To assist in the rehabilitation of offenders;e)To provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; andf)To promote a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledge the harm done to victims and to the community.[43]In most criminal cases the following factors are taken into consideration in determining what sentence to impose on the offender:a)the degree of premeditation;b)the circumstances surrounding the actual commission of the offence. (For example, the amount of violence used, the use of a weapon, the degree of participation of the offender.);c)the gravity of the crime in regard to which the maximum punishment provided by statute is an indication;d)the attitude of the offender after the commission of the crime;e)any prior criminal record of the offender;f)the age, mode of life, character and personality of the offender;g)any recommendation contained in a pre-sentence report or any other mitigating circumstances brought to the attention of the Court;h)incidence of crime in the Court’s jurisdiction; andi)sentences customarily imposed for the same offence.[44]The principles set out above are collectively referred to as those of denunciation and deterrence.[45]There are also principles at play when there are multiple offences as in this case.Recently the Ontario Court of Appeal in the case of R. v. Courtney[2] discussed the totality and proportionality principles when sentencing an offender for multiple offences. The Court confirmed that it \"is based upon the fundamental notion that the punishment must fit the crime and that the degree of punishment must reflect the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender. Otherwise, society will have no confidence in the law or the fairness and rationality of the legal system…\"[46]At paragraph 18 of Courtney, the court outlined the goals in sentencing when combining sentences for multiple offences:\"In short, a combined sentence must not be unduly long or harsh in the sense that its impact simply exceeds the gravity of the offences in question or the overall culpability of the offender. The overall length of the custodial period imposed must still relate to and reflect the variety of sentencing goals, including denunciation, deterrence (specific and general), rehabilitation, the need to separate offenders from society where necessary, and the general imperative of promoting respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society: Criminal Code, s. 718. In this regard, the authorities recognize that where the ultimate effect of the combined sentences is to deprive the offender of any hope of release or rehabilitation, the functional value of these sentencing principles meets the point of diminishing returns.\"[47]Justice LeBel, in the Supreme Court of Canada's recent decision of R. v. Ipeelee[3] wrote that there are two perspectives to the principle of proportionality; that a sentence should neither be unduly harsh and excessive nor overly lenient or unresponsive to the purposes and principles in the sentencing regime as set out in the Criminal Code.He noted that our system of justice must be seen to be fair and rational both to the offender and to the community and in this manner the integrity of the justice system is preserved.[48]Justice LeBel concluded that \"In the Canadian criminal justice system, a just sanction is one that reflects both perspectives on proportionality and does not elevate one at the expense of the other.\"When deciding on a just sanction, the Court also acknowledged that sentencing is a highly individualized process and that sentencing judges must have sufficient manoeuvrability to tailor sentences to the circumstances of the particular offence and the particular offender.[4]Analysis[49]The principle of denunciation is an expression of society’s attitude towards the offence committed.It focuses on the conduct rather than the personal characteristics of the offender.In the case of R v. M. (C.A.), Justice Lamer of the Supreme Court of Canada wrote that, “In short, a sentence with a denunciatory element represents a symbolic, collective statement that the offender’s conduct should be punished for encroaching on our society’s basic code of values as enshrined within our substantive criminal law.”[5][50]The principle of deterrence seeks to provide a threat or example to the offender (specific deterrence), or to others (general deterrence), in order to discourage crime by making it clear that criminal behaviour of this nature will result in the imposition of severe punishment.[51]In any given case, there may be one or several sentencing principles at play.Sometimes they conflict with each other. The Court must attempt to balance all relevant sentencing principles with the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and personal background and history particular to each accused.[52]Any sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.A sentence must also be similar to those imposed on similar offenders who have committed similar offences.[53]It is the task of the trial judge to assign the relative weight to the particular aspects of the case so that the sentence is shaped in a way that is specific to the accused while following a uniform approach.[54]When I examine these principles in the context of Myles Fawcett, I find I am able to craft a sentence where all of these principles coincide and one in which Mr. Fawcett will be provided the opportunity for rehabilitation and recovery.[55]I accept that the best thing for Myles Fawcett would be to immediately return to Harvest House.Unfortunately, that option is not open to me in light of the denunciation aspect of sentencing.Bank robbery is a serious crime and requires that Mr. Fawcett's conduct be punished for encroaching on our society’s basic code of values.Three bank robberies, notwithstanding they were committed within a short span of each other, coupled with his criminal record for robbery add to the length of sentence I must impose.[56]The principle of deterrence is more easily addressed.Mr. Fawcett has shown by his conduct since May 2010 that deterrence specific to him is well underway.[57]It is apparent that Myles Fawcett today is a changed person; someone who has acknowledged his past criminal conduct and who appears to be turning what was a difficult life marred by parental abuse and serious crime in order to support a drug addiction into a productive life where he appears eager to give back to the community in exchange for the wrongs previously invoked on others.[58]There is little doubt that Myles Fawcett, left without the support network he has gained through Harvest House; the accountability required of him in that environment; and the positive role models of the mature adult men he has encountered would no doubt be at significant risk of returning to his previous lifestyle of substance abuse and crime.There is still work for Mr. Fawcett to do so that he can participate fully as a productive member of our society.[59]When examining the principle of general deterrence, I have considered two aspects that may be relevant in this case.The first would be to impose a sentence that is sufficiently harsh so as to warn others that if you commit crimes such as these, you will be dealt with severely.The concept being that this will thus discourage others from committing crimes such as these.[60]I am mindful however of the fact that Myles Fawcett committed his offences, including those prior offences on his record, while he was addicted to prescription narcotics and to crack cocaine.There was little rational thought behind the offences except that he needed either drugs or money to purchase drugs to support his addiction.I query whether or not the concept of general deterrence means much to someone when they are addicted and require a fix.[61]In cases such as these, it seems that the concept of general deterrence can be accomplished by sending a message that says, \"If you commit a serious crime while addicted to drugs you will face severe consequences.However, you will have a choice.You can serve all of your time inside the prison system or, if you are willing to commit to living in such a fashion where you give up drugs, the negative influences in your life, work on your education and employment skills and still sacrifice your liberty while doing so, then you will be given that opportunity within the bounds of a just sentence for the crimes committed.\"[62]It would be a powerful message to give offenders that choice.Not all offenders will accept the challenge of walking away from a life of drug addiction and crime.For those such as Myles Fawcett, who desire to change, we must be able to offer some hope to them that does not involve a term of incarceration of such length that it will destroy their ability to follow through with that desire for change.[63]Mr. Fawcett made it clear that he intends to return to Harvest House upon his release from custody because he does not feel ready to live on his own, regardless of the sentence I impose.[64]Indeed, at the conclusion of the sentencing submissions, Mr. Fawcett asked to address the court at which time he made an impassioned speech in which he acknowledged his guilt, apologized to the court, to the members of the jury and to the victims of his crimes.He advised the court that he would accept whatever sentence was imposed upon him and would then return to Harvest House and continue to work on his recovery.[65]I am satisfied that Mr. Fawcett has demonstrated a sincere desire to change his life.Not just because of his words but because of his actions.I also find that a long period of incarceration would likely preclude him from ever achieving that objective.I accept that Mr. Fawcett is still in the early stages of his recovery and at risk of relapsing without the appropriate support.Notwithstanding his desire to change, Mr. Fawcett has not yet developed the necessary life skills to succeed on his own, particularly with a long prison sentence.[66]When determining the sentence, I reviewed the case law that was provided by counsel for Mr. Fawcett and for the Crown.I note that the range of sentence that they each recommended does not significantly differ; but rather it is the manner in which the sentence should be imposed where they are at odds.[67]Both proposed sentences would require Mr. Fawcett be kept in some form of custody for a period of 4 to 5 years.They both agreed that Mr. Fawcett should receive credit for his pre-sentence custody.Both agreed that the crimes Mr. Fawcett committed occurred prior to the coming into force of the Truth in Sentencing Act.[68]The difference in the two approaches is that the Crown would see Mr. Fawcett incarcerated for the duration of his sentence subject to parole eligibility whereas the Defence proposes that the court uses its discretion to determine the time Mr. Fawcett remain incarcerated and the time he spend on probation in the custody of Harvest House.[69]Regarding the issue of pre- sentence custody, I agree with the interpretation set out by the Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v. Serdyuk[6] that offences committed prior to the coming into force of the Truth in Sentencing Act are still entitled to credit on a 2 for one basis for pre-sentence custody.[70]I also accept that the entire period that Mr. Fawcett was at Harvest House is eligible for credit as pre-sentence custody.The fact that his conditions were changed to become more lenient does nothing to detract from that.In fact, the conditions imposed upon Mr. Fawcett by the nature of the rules required of residents at Harvest House and the secure setting were substantially more onerous than even the most stringent conditions the court could have imposed on regular house arrest.There may even be grounds to provide credit for pre-sentence custody that is greater than the 25% that was agreed upon by counsel.[71]If I have a criticism of the Crown's submissions on this issue, it is that it appeared that the Crown took the fact that Mr. Fawcett both thrived at Harvest House and was able to abide by all of the conditions imposed upon him as evidence that they were not stringent enough.This is neither accurate, nor the test.Mr. Fawcett is to be commended for what he accomplished in the span of less than two years and should be entitled to whatever credit he is entitled to for that period of time.[72]I find therefore that Mr. Fawcett is entitled to credit of 22 months of pre-sentence custody.[73]Given that both the Crown and Defence agreed that an appropriate sentence is between 4 and 5 years less his entitlement to pre-sentence custody; after applying 22 months of credit, Mr. Fawcett should face an additional sentence of between 2 and 3 years.[74]I find that the proper application of the principles of denunciation, deterrence and proportionality in this situation will be met with a custodial sentence of one year followed by three years of probation to be served at Harvest House with the usual statutory conditions and such other conditions as Mr. Fawcett's probation officer and the directors of Harvest House agree are appropriate.[75]A sentence of this nature, while differing in substance, is somewhat longer than the Crown was seeking; however, I find that Mr. Fawcett is in need of the support and resources that are available at Harvest House.His best opportunity for rehabilitation to become a fully functioning and contributing member of society will only be met by imposing the longest possible probationary period permitted by law, that being three years.[76]Even if I am incorrect regarding the interpretation of the application of the changes to credit for pre-sentence custody, I would still impose the same sentence having regard to the onerous conditions imposed upon Mr. Fawcett during his time at Harvest House and that will again be imposed during his probationary period as well as the success he achieved while there.I do not find that a longer period of incarceration would satisfy the interaction of all of the principles of sentencing on the facts of this particular case.[77]In addition to the sentence I impose an order pursuant to s. 109 of the Criminal Code for a firearms prohibition for a period of 10 years and an order requiring Mr. Fawcett to provide for the purpose of DNA analysis, samples of one or more bodily substances that are reasonably required for that purpose.___________________________Madam Justice B.

Snell, for the Crown;Duane Allan Scheiber in person.[1]Tallis, J.A.: On June 1st, 1981, Duane Allan Scheiber pleaded guilty before Mr. Justice S.J. Walker, at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, to the following counts set forth in an indictment:That he, the said Duane Allan Scheiber, on or about the 14th day of June, A.D. 1980, at the City of Saskatoon, in the Province of Saskatchewan,(1) did unlawfully have in his possession a weapon, to wit, a knife for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, contrary to s. 85 of the Criminal Code;(2) did unlawfully break and enter Suite 4, 1814-22nd Street West, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and did commit therein the indictable offence of indecent assault on R.A.B., contrary to s. 306(1) (b) and (d) of the Criminal Code;(3) did without lawful authority confine R.A.B., and J.F.B., contrary to s. 247(2) of the Criminal Code;(4) did unlawfully attempt to have sexual intercourse with J.F.B., a female person who was not his wife, without her consent, contrary to s. 145 of the Criminal Code.(full names deleted by me)[2]At that time a pre-sentence report was requisitioned and the terms of the order of Mr. Justice C.L.B. Estey dated July 14th, 1981, granting judicial interim release were continued until the adjourned date for sentencing.[3]On August 5th, 1981, Scheiber was sentenced as follows:Count 1 - one year in the Federal Penitentiary;Count 2 - three years in the Federal Penitentiary;Count 3 - one year in the Federal Penitentiary;Count 4 - three years in the Federal Penitentiary;All of the above sentences were ordered to be served concurrently.[4]Scheiber has appealed his sentence contending that the total term of three years is too long particularly when you consider his efforts at rehabilitation while awaiting trial and sentencing.[5]The Crown has also appealed the sentences contending that the total sentence should be substantially increased on the following grounds:1. That the learned trial judge failed to properly consider the seriousness of the offence and the previous record of the accused.2. That the learned trial judge failed to properly consider the deterrent aspect of the sentencing and also the need for protecting the public.[6]It is accordingly convenient to deal with these two appeals in one judgment.[7]The learned trial judge heard extensive submissions on sentence. He had a detailed pre-sentence report before him. He also heard evidence from the two victims and other witnesses including Scheiber. I am satisfied that all aspects of this case were carefully canvassed by the learned trial judge before imposing sentence. It is accordingly unnecessary for me to review the record in detail but I refer to a few background facts because the circumstances surrounding the commission of these offences are somewhat bizarre.[8]On June 14th, 1980, Scheiber had been drinking for some period of time. This had caused matrimonial difficulties with the result that his wife and two small children had left him several days before. The degree of intoxication of Scheiber at the time of this offence was dealt with in evidence given at the sentencing hearing by the two victims and also Sergeant Ferguson of the Saskatoon City Police. While he may have been impaired by alcohol to some extent he was not, in the opinion of these witnesses, what you would call drunk.[9]At about 11:45 P.M. on June 14th, 1980, Scheiber entered another suite in the same block where he and his wife had resided at the time of their separation. This suite was occupied by two sisters, who were in their early twenties. He was carrying a knife and apparently cut the extension cord on their telephone. He committed these offences by threatening the girls with a knife. With a knife in his hand he forced one of the girls to perform an act of fellatio. He also tied up one of the girls with wire around her wrists in order to attempt to rape her. Without going into any further details I am satisfied that the whole incident smacked of serious violence. One of the girls was able to pick up a hot iron which had been readied for pressing garments. She struck Scheiber a number of times with this hot iron and ultimately drove him from the suite. She suffered burns in the process of doing this.[10]The victims suffered severe psychological trauma from this bizarre incident. They quit their night jobs because of the fears that had built up. They moved from residence to residence because of security fears. They still carry severe psychological scars from this terrifying incident.[11]The accused was twenty-five years old at the time of sentencing. He was recently separated from his wife and two small children. Under the influence of liquor he has a propensity for violence. He has a serious criminal record including a conviction for armed robbery dating back to 1972. In recent years he had not been involved in any serious crimes until this episode.[12]The learned trial judge correctly concluded, in my view, that there was a sufficient nexus between the offences committed during this continuing episode to warrant the imposition of concurrent sentences.[13]In my opinion, the learned trial judge in his oral reasons for judgment carefully considered the principles of sentencing as enunciated by this court in R. v. Morrissette (1970), 1970 CanLII 642 (SK CA), 75 W.W.R. 644. He also carefully considered the facts and circumstances of this particular case to determine the emphasis that should be placed on each of the applicable principles: vide R. v. Shaffer (1979), 1979 CanLII 511 (BC CA), 50 C.C.C.(2d) 424.[14]On the hearing of this appeal Scheiber submitted that the sentence was too long and did not take into account his efforts at rehabilitation which were undertaken while he was awaiting trial. He is to be commended for taking steps to come to grips with his alcohol problem by attending the Calder Centre, joining Alcoholics Anonymous and taking counselling. However, the learned trial judge gave Scheiber full credit for these efforts and pointed out that he would have imposed a much longer term had it not been for Scheiber’s efforts in the field of rehabilitation as well as his wife’s attitude and cooperation in this connection.[15]The oral reasons delivered at the time of sentencing also make it abundantly clear that the learned trial judge carefully considered the need for protection of the public and the need for deterrence not only of Scheiber but also of others who might be tempted to commit such offences. In imposing the total sentence of three years imprisonment, he was cognizant of the seriousness of the offence and was fully aware of the previous criminal record of Scheiber. However, he appreciated that when considering a prior record, it must be remembered that a person has already been punished for those offences and is not to be punished a second time. On the other hand a prior record may be considered as part of the general background and character of the accused to determine whether he is responsive to rehabilitation, whether he is persisting in a life of crime and whether he lacks respect for the law and particularly for the rights of his fellow citizens. R. v. Wilson (1944), 82 C.C.C. 65; R. v. Bear et al. (1974), 1973 CanLII 925 (SK CA), 13 C.C.C.(2d) 570.[16]I have concluded that the learned trial judge imposed a fit sentence in this case. The sentence reflects a careful and proper balancing of the factors involved in sentencing.[17]The appeal by Scheiber is accordingly dismissed. The appeal by the Crown is also dismissed.[18]It would appear that the provisions of s. . 98(1) of the Criminal Code were not brought to the attention of the learned trial judge. The prohibition provided for in s. 98(1) is mandatory where the conditions for its application are met, as they were in the present case with respect to count (4) in the indictment. I accordingly direct that a mandatory order will issue in the terms of s. 98(1), commencing today and to be in force for a period of five years from the date of Scheiber’s release from imprisonment.Appeals dismissed."}

JUSTICE J.R. McISAACCOUNSEL:Mr. John Marsland, for the Crown/RespondentMr. David J.M. O’Neill, for the AppellantE N D O R S E M E N T[1]An appeal court can only vary a sentence if it is convinced that a sentence is “not fit” or “clearly unreasonable”.These circumstances arise where the trial judge:(i)erred in principle;(ii)failed to consider a relevant factor; or(iii)over-emphasized the appropriate factors.See R. v. Stone 1999 CanLII 688 (SCC), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 290.Applying that test in the instant case, the appellant has failed to satisfy me that, save for the maximum sentence upon the assault conviction, the trial judge fell into any such error.1.Maximum Sentence for Assault Conviction[2]Whetung, J. imposed the maximum sentence of six months on this count.The appellant suggests that this was an error because he did not constitute the worst offender committing the worst offence: see R. v. Pruner (1979) 9 C.R. (3d) S-8 (Ont. C.A.).I agree.The Crown’s election to proceed by way of summary conviction reflects the relative gravity of the offence alleged and the maximum sentence of six months as provided for in Section 787(1) C.C.C. must inform the sentencing formulation: see R. v. Sanatkar (1982) 64 C.C.C. (2d) 325 (Ont. C.A.).I see nothing in R. v. Jackson (1999) 1999 CanLII 3150 (ON CA), 127 O.A.C. 272 that would dilute this authority.Accordingly, the sentence on this count will be varied to four months consecutive.2.Failure to Consider Authorities “Directly on Point” – Section 718.2(b) C.C.C.[3]I have carefully considered this submission along with the reasons for sentence articulated by the learned trial judge.I am satisfied that he gave a rational explanation for distinguishing each of the cases relied upon by the appellant.It must be remembered that sentencing is an individualized exercise more in the nature of art than science.I am not satisfied that there is any basis for intervention on this ground.3.Failure to Apply the “Gap” Principle[4]According to the criminal record that was filed on sentencing, the appellant was on probation for several offences of violence when he committed the instant offences.In light of this circumstance and the truly horrendous length of that record, I have not been persuaded that Whetung, J. was unjustified in describing this as an “almost continuous involvement with the criminal justice system since 1983”: see page 8 of the Reasons for Sentence.Accordingly, in my opinion, he was perfectly justified in rejecting the appellant’s plea for mitigation on this basis.4.Error in Finding That the Appellant was in a “Position of Trust”[5]At the time the appellant abused these child victims, he was a guest of their mother in their home and he was permitted to sleep there at night.As such, Whetung, J. described this circumstance as a “degree of breach of trust”: see page 6 of the Reasons for Sentence.I am satisfied that these circumstances were sufficient to deserve this description: see R. v. D. (D.) (2002) 2002 CanLII 44915 (ON CA), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 471 (Ont. C.A.) at p.475.As well, I am satisfied that although these offences did not result in any permanent physical injury to the three sibling victims, the offences were inherently violent because of their tender ages: see R. v. M. (G.) (1993) 1992 CanLII 7399 (ON CA), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 310 (Ont. C.A.) at p.314.In the result, I reject this ground of appeal.Conclusion[6]For all of these reasons, the sentence on the assault charge is varied to one of four months.In all other regards, the sentences herein are affirmed resulting in a global sentence of 16 months imprisonment.All other incidental orders including the term of probation are affirmed as well.___________________________McISAAC, J.DATE:November 18, 2005"}

Laycock, counsel for)The Manitoba Securities Commission- and -))Robert WayneBennett)-and-)Celebration of YourFinancial)Judgment delivered:Success Online Inc.)June 29, 2006CORRIN, P.J.[1]This case involves an application by the prosecution to proceed ex parte with a disposition hearing in a proceeding where a custodial sentence is being sought. The accused was present for his September 2005 trial and was convicted of eight counts under The Securities Act, specifically trading securities without being registered pursuant thereto and without benefit of a prospectus.[2]The Crown’s application was made on June 2, 2006, the date set for sentencing in this regard. The accused, unrepresented at trial, had requested an opportunity to consult with and possibly retain counsel after conviction. A date, October 29, 2005, was set for the disposition hearing. The offender failed to appear on such date and a warrant was issued for his arrest.[3]The Crown submits that s. 803(2) of the Criminal Code which has been incorporated in provincial legislation by reference permits one to sentence the offender in absentia notwithstanding that I have previously issued a yet unexecuted warrant for Mr. Bennett’s arrest. The provisions are as follows:“(2) Where a defendant does not appear at the time and place appointed for the trial after having been notified of that time and place, or where a defendant does not appear for the resumption of a trial that has been adjourned in accordance with subsection (1), the summary conviction court(a) may proceed ex parte to hear and determine the proceedings in the absence of the defendant as fully and effectually as if the defendant had appeared; or(b) may, if it thinks fit, issue a warrant in Form 7 for the arrest of the defendant and adjourn the trial to await his appearance pursuant thereto.”[4]Counsel for the Securities Commission has referred me to several cases which are supportive of her application. In this regard she cited R. v. Tarrant (1984), 1984 CanLII 659 (BC CA), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 219, a decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal upholding the right of a trial court to proceed ex parte in circumstances where it had earlier issued a warrant for an accused’s arrest.[5]She has also referred me to the case of R. v. Boyle, a decision of the Alberta Provincial Court (2002), ABPC, 331 A.R. 273. This case involved a nearly identical scenario to the one at issue wherein an accused was convicted of breaches of The Securities Act but absconded prior to sentencing disposition. A warrant had been issued but remained unexecuted. LeFever, J., relying principally on Tarrant (supra) and a Saskatchewan Court of Appeal decision cited as R. v. Bird (1988), 1988 CanLII 5176 (SK CA), 66 Sask. R. 79, held that the Criminal Code permitted sentencing in absentia. A quote from page 80 of Bird found at paragraph 7 of Boyle supports LeFever’s decision:\" . . .We should like therefore to say that the power accorded to a trial judge by s. 738 (3) of the Code (now 803) is not so fettered.Provided the requirements of the subsection are met, a trial judge, in the exercise judicially of his discretion, may decide to proceed with the trial in the absence of the defendant, and, if he does so, he is empowered 'to hear and determine the proceedings . . . as fully and effectively as if the defendant had appeared'.That is, he may determine whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty, and may, if he finds him guilty, impose sentence.He need not, in the event of a finding of guilt, hold in abeyance the passing of sentence until he has heard from the defendant pursuant to s. 595 of the Code.He might, in the light of the circumstances before him, decide to adjourn sentencing, (as did the trial judge in R. v. Tarrant (1984), 1984 CanLII 659 (BC CA), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 219 (BCCA) but he is not required by s. 595 to do so, even where he thinks imprisonment is likely appropriate.\"[6]Concerned about the ramifications of sentencing an offender to a custodial sentence in absentia, this Court expressed a preference to hold the matter in abeyance until the warrant could be executed. The Crown opposed this approach, citing evidence that the Court had received from a Securities Commission investigator, Mr. Jason Roy, indicative of Mr. Bennett’s likely permanent relocation to an unknown address in the Metro Toronto region. Without elaborating, I can indicate that I share the prosecution’s opinion in this respect.[7]The Crown, noting that a warrant for a provincial offence could not be given effect to outside the limits of our province, encouraged this Court to proceed ex parte, primarily in order to give effect to the principle of public deterrence since there appears to be little hope that Mr. Bennett will voluntarily come back to Manitoba of his own free will and volition.[8]The Crown’s submission respecting the unavailability of an out-of-province endorsement of my previously issued warrant appears to be correct. I was unable to find any mechanism whereby a warrant for a provincial offence could be given effect to outside the province of issuance. The jurisprudence as well as common sense indicates that no provincial legislation attempting to authorize such a procedure would withstand constitutional scrutiny. The jurisdiction to give extra-provincial effect by “backing” to a warrant is confined to cases involving crimes as same are recognized and constituted by the Parliament of Canada and does not pertain to provincial statutes (see Ex Parte Eli, (1920) 1 W.W.R. 661, a decision of the Alberta Supreme Court in such regard).[9]In the circumstances, I have decided to exercise my discretion favourable to the Crown and allow the matter to proceed ex parte to disposition.DATED the 29th day of June 2006.“ORIGINAL SIGNED BY:”BRIAN M.

Stewart, for the respondentHeard and released orally: March 13, 2009On appeal from theconvictions entered on June 9, 2008 and the sentences imposed on July 28,2008 by Justice Paul Bentley of the Ontario Court of Justice.ENDORSEMENT[1]The core issue on appeal is whether a miscarriage of justice occurred in this case due to the ineffective representation of the appellant at trial by his counsel.The appellant argues that his trial counsel failed to advise him of the potential consequences of pleading guilty on June 9, 2008 to various charges including, in particular, the charge of breaching the terms of his conditional sentence, imposed on March 28, 2008.Indeed, the appellant goes further and contends that his lawyers actively misled him by indicating that he would not be sentenced to any further term of incarceration if he pled guilty and had all his outstanding charges dealt with together.[2]In our view, the appellant’s contention is simply unsustainable on this record.The appellant was no stranger to the criminal justice system.On the contrary, he had a lengthy criminal record.The transcript amply demonstrates that he understood the proceedings in which he was involved, was an active participant in the proceedings involving his guilty pleas both on March 7, 2008 in respect of his original set of offences, and again on June 9, 2008 in respect of the breach by him of his conditional sentence and associated charges.Given his background and experience, it simply strains credulity to suggest that this offender did not fully appreciate that he risked a custodial sentence on conviction for breach of his conditional sentence.[3]Moreover, on March 7, 2008, the Crown acceded to a conditional sentence although the offences then in question clearly supported a jail term.In so doing, the Crown made it abundantly clear on the record that if the appellant breached the conditional sentence imposed, the Crown would seek a significant jail term.The appellant in fact breached the conditional sentence less than three weeks later.[4]In addition, in response to the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel, the appellant’s junior trial counsel produced a memorandum to file dated May 2, 2008 – that is, dating from well before the date on which the appellant entered his guilty plea to the breach charges on June 9, 2008 – which confirmed that the appellant was clearly told on that date that “jail time was likely going to be involved” and that the Crown was “going to ask [that] he be thrown back in jail” on sentencing for his fresh offences.There is absolutely no evidence to support the appellant’s late-breaking assertion on cross-examination in this proceeding that this memorandum was an after-the-fact fabrication by counsel.[5]We accept that trial counsels’ practice and file management measures in this case may well have been deficient.Indeed, counsel failed to attend a potentially important judicial pre-trial conference.We also agree that trial counsels’ communications with the appellant may have been less frequent and less comprehensive than was prudent in the circumstances.[6]However, we are simply not persuaded that there is any justification for the appellant’s claim that when deciding to enter guilty pleas on June 9, 2008, he did not appreciate that he ran the risk of receiving a custodial sentence.On the contrary, we are satisfied that the appellant appreciated that he bore this risk for the breach of his conditional sentence.The evidence falls far short of supporting the appellant’s bald assertion that he was misled by his lawyers in this regard.[7]Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.[8]The appellant also argues that the facts relied on by the Crown at trial did not support a conviction on the charge of possession of property knowing that it was obtained by the commission of crime.On this record, there is no basis on which to find that the appellant converted the cheques at issue from one use to another.The authority relied on by the Crown does not apply and accordingly, the conviction on this charge cannot stand.[9]We note that during the course of oral argument before this court, the appellant’s counsel wisely abandoned the appellant’s sentence appeal given that the Crown had served a ‘Hill’ notice that it would seek to change the custodial portion of the appellant’s sentence by including in it the community service portion of the conditional sentence.The ‘Hill’ notice became ineffective when the appellant abandoned his sentence appeal.This decision by counsel had the practical effect of saving the appellant an additional five and one-half months in custody as we would have given effect to the Crown’s request.[10]Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in part by setting aside the possession of property obtained by crime conviction, above described.In all other respects, the conviction appeal is dismissed.“Doherty J.A.”“K.

[orally]: On March 15, 1984 the appellant was convicted of assault causing bodily harm and sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months. On November 12, 1983, which was the date of the offence, he was seventeen years of age. He has a previous criminal record that includes a conviction for assault and he was on probation at the time of this offence. The appellant appealed both conviction and sentence. On April 11, 1984, he was released on bail pending the hearing of his appeal. When the appeal came on before this court on August 9, 1984, the appellant withdrew his conviction appeal and focused our attention on the sentence appeal.[2]The learned trial judge found that the assault was vicious and unprovoked. We agree with that conclusion. The injuries inflicted on the victim were serious but fortunately for the appellant, some of his friends intervened to restrain him--otherwise the consequences might have been much more serious.[3]Before hearing full submissions on sentence, the court called for a post-sentence report because the learned trial judge did not have the benefit of a pre-sentence report. We now have received the post-sentence report and after hearing oral submissions and considering the new material placed before us, we are all of the opinion that the sentence should be varied to nine months’ imprisonment. Unfortunately the appellant has not responded to leniency extended to him on his previous “brushes” with the law. We are disappointed that he did not refrain, as he should have, from drinking pending the hearing of this appeal. However, there is a reasonable prospect that the appellant will mend his ways and take additional job training.[4]Accordingly, in our opinion, a sentence of nine months’ imprisonment will adequately balance the principles of public protection and deterrence with the principle of reformation and rehabilitation in the case of a youthful offender. In taking such a calculated risk, we do however emphasize that any repetition of this type of behaviour will be visited with a severe sentence.[5]The sentence appeal is allowed and the sentence is reduced to imprisonment for nine months.Appeal allowed."}

Trent WilsonTHE COURTThe appeal is dismissed.LA COURRejette l’appel.The judgment of the Court was delivered byRICHARD J.A.[1]Shortly after midnight on July 14, 2003, a man awoke to find two masked men invading his Fredericton home. The victim was wrestled to the floor, covered with a sheet, tied and severely beaten. What he thought was a gun was put to his head, while the assailants demanded information regarding the location of a safe. Upon being told that there was no safe in the house, the assailants again beat the victim and fired two shots from what later proved to be a starter pistol. The victim’s home was ransacked and a significant amount of money was stolen.[2]Later, in the early hours of July 14, 2003, fire was deliberately set to a 2001 Ford Escape vehicle that had been stolen a few days earlier. The loss suffered as a result of the total destruction of the vehicle was $20,700.[3]Robert Wayne Waugh and Zachary Anthony Flowers were eventually apprehended and, on June 3, 2004, charged with robbery and arson, offences set out in ss. 344 and 434 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46. On March 3, 2005, both accused re-elected to the jurisdiction of the ProvincialCourt and pled guilty to those charges. On April 26, 2005, the Crown gave notice that it would seek an order pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Criminal Code directing that half of the sentences to be imposed be served before the offenders would become eligible for release on full parole.[4]On May 5, 2005, a judge of the Provincial Court determined that appropriate sentences for Mr. Waugh and his co-accused would be incarceration for eight years for the robbery and one year consecutive for the arson.In the case of Mr. Waugh, he was given credit of 22 months for the time spent in remand and accordingly sentenced to a total of seven years and two months. Applying the provisions of s. 743.6 of the Criminal Code, the judge ordered that Mr. Waugh not be eligible for full parole until he had served at least half of the six years and two months sentence imposed for the robbery offence. In addition, the judge made orders pursuant to ss. 109 and 487.051 of the Criminal Code.[5]Mr. Waugh appeals against the order the Provincial Court judge made pursuant to s. 743.6 of the Criminal Code. Section 675(1)(b) provides that a person who is convicted in proceedings by indictment may appeal to the Court of Appeal against sentence only with leave of the Court or of a judge of the Court. However, s. 675(2.1) provides a right of appeal against an order made pursuant to s. 743.6. Because Mr. Waugh’s appeal is limited to the order made pursuant to s. 743.6, leave to appeal is not required.[6]Mr. Waugh has not specified any grounds for his appeal against the order made pursuant to s. 743.6.At the hearing, he pleaded for a “second chance” so he could resume his relationship with his children. He argued that he is not a danger to the community, in spite of his significant criminal record.[7]The relevant portions of s. 743.6 provide as follows:743.6(1) Notwithstanding subsection 120(1) of the Correctionsand Conditional Release Act, where an offender receives, on or afterNovember 1, 1992, a sentence of imprisonment of two years or more, includinga sentence of imprisonment for life imposed otherwise than as a minimumpunishment, on conviction for an offence set out in Schedule I or II to thatAct that was prosecuted by way of indictment, the court may, if satisfied,having regard to the circumstances of the commission of the offence and thecharacter and circumstances of the offender, that the expression of society'sdenunciation of the offence or the objective of specific or generaldeterrence so requires, order that the portion of the sentence that must beserved before the offender may be released on full parole is one half of thesentence or ten years, whichever is less.[…](2) For greater certainty, the paramount principles which areto guide the court under this section are denunciation and specific orgeneral deterrence, with rehabilitation of the offender, in all cases, beingsubordinate to these paramount principles.743.6 (1) Par dérogation auparagraphe 120(1) de la Loi sur le système correctionnel et la mise enliberté sous condition, le tribunal peut, s’il est convaincu, selon lescirconstances de l’infraction, du caractère et des particularités dudélinquant, que la réprobation de la société à l’égard de l’infractioncommise ou l’effet dissuasif de l’ordonnance l’exige, ordonner que ledélinquant condamné le 1er novembre 1992 ou par la suite, surdéclaration de culpabilité par mise en accusation, à une peine d’emprisonnementd’au moins deux ans — y compris une peine d’emprisonnement à perpétuité àcondition que cette peine n’ait pas constitué un minimum en l’occurrence —pour une infraction mentionnée aux annexes I ou II de cette loi, purge, avantd’être admissible à la libération conditionnelle totale, le moindre de lamoitié de sa peine ou dix ans.[…](2) Il demeure entendu que les principes suprêmes qui doiventguider le tribunal dans l’application du présent article sont la réprobationde la société et l’effet dissuasif, la réadaptation du délinquant étant, danstous les cas, subordonnée à ces principes suprêmes.[8]Section 743.6 was interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Zinck, 2003 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2003] 1 S.C.R. 41, and principles were set out to guide sentencing courts in their application of those provisions of the Criminal Code. At para. 29, LeBel J. explained that the application of s. 743.6 requires “[…] the sentencing judge [to] use a two-step intellectual process when deciding whether to delay parole.” In the first step, the judge is required to “[…] determine what would be the appropriate punishment for the crime.” In the second step, the judge again applies the sentencing factors, gives priority to the factors of general and specific deterrence and of denunciation, and determines whether the prosecution has satisfied its burden to show that the additional punishment provided for in s. 743.6 is required.At para. 33, LeBel J. states:[…] [C]ourts must perform a double weighing exercise. First, they must evaluate the facts of the case, in light of the factors set out in s. 718 of the Code, in order to impose an appropriate sentence. Then, they must review the same facts primarily in the perspective of the requirements of deterrence and denunciation, which are given priority at this stage, under s. 743.6(2). The decision to delay parole remains out of the ordinary, but may and should be taken if, after the proper weighing of all factors, it appears to be required in order to impose a form of punishment which is completely appropriate in the circumstances of the case. This decision may be made, for example, if, after due consideration of all the relevant facts, principles and factors at the first stage, it appears at the second stage that the length of the jail term would not satisfy the imperatives of denunciation and deterrence. This two-stage process, however, does not require a special and distinct hearing. It should be viewed as one sentencing process, where issues of procedural fairness will have to be carefully considered.[9]The record reveals that the sentencing judge proceeded as instructed in Zinck. First, he applied the principles of sentencing and determined that a fit total sentence for the two offences to which Mr. Waugh had pleaded guilty was nine years. Considering the 11 months during which Mr. Waugh had been in custody on remand, he applied the usual 2:1 ratio and reduced the sentence to one of seven years and two months. The judge then considered the provisions of s. 743.6 and applied the guiding principles set out in the legislation to conclude that “[…] justice will be better served, deterrence and denunciation and protection will be better served, […] by ordering that half of the sentence be served before he’s eligible for full parole.” As a result, the order pursuant to s. 743.6 was made for the sentence of six years and two months imposed for the offence of robbery.[10]In Zinck, at para. 41, the Supreme Court makes it clear that “[…] In the absence of an error of principle, a breach of the principles of procedural fairness or a clearly erroneous and material finding of fact, [a Court of Appeal] should not intervene” with an order made pursuant to s. 743.6. Procedural fairness is not an issue in the present case. The Crown made the request for an order pursuant to s. 743.6 in advance of the sentencing hearing and Mr. Waugh was given ample opportunity to respond. The record reveals neither an error of principle nor a clear and material error of fact by the sentencing judge. Thus, there is no basis for interference by our Court.[11]For those reasons, I would dismiss Mr. Waugh’s appeal._______________________________J.C.

Browne of the SuperiorCourt of Justice dated December 17, 2007 and reported at 63 R.P.R. (4th) 267.Rouleau J.A.:[1]These two appeals deal with parking covenants contained in two leases entered into by the landlord, Hazeldean Properties Inc. (Hazeldean).The first lease, with Royal LePage Team Realty Ltd. (Royal LePage), guarantees that at least 30 parking spaces will be available to Royal LePage’s clients and staff, of which six spaces are to be marked as reserved exclusively for Royal LePage.The second lease, with Good Life Corporation (Good Life), provides for unlimited access to parking for Good Life clients and staff, and imposes constraints on Hazeldean’s ability to “reduce the available spaces for Tenant parking available at the commencement of the Lease”.[2]Good Life appeals from the dismissal of its application for an injunction restraining Hazeldean from permitting the reservation of parking spaces for the exclusive use of other tenants and for a declaration that Hazeldean is currently in violation of the parking covenant contained in the Good Life lease because it has given exclusive parking spaces to two tenants, Royal LePage and the Bank of Nova Scotia.Royal LePage appeals from the dismissal of its application for a declaration that it is entitled to 30 spaces reserved exclusively for its clients and staff or, in the alternative, for a declaration that it is entitled to 6 reserved spaces.FACTS[3]Hazeldean is the landlord and owner of a shopping plaza located in Kanata, a part of the City of Ottawa (the Municipality).Good Life, a fitness club operator, and Royal LePage, a real estate agency, are two of Hazeldean’s tenants in the shopping plaza.Both Royal LePage and Good Life require adequate and convenient access to parking for their clients and staff.Given its significance to tenants’ business, access to parking is an important issue in the negotiation of lease agreements.[4]In 2002, Hazeldean was in the midst of planning the development of the shopping plaza.At this time, the original site plan provided for 292 parking spaces.When the final version of the site plan was approved by the Municipality in October 2003, it provided for only 275 parking spaces, a reduction of 17 spaces from the original plan.[5]Commencing in the summer of 2002, Hazeldean negotiated leases with prospective tenants.Some of these leases, including the leases with Good Life, Royal LePage, and the Bank of Nova Scotia, contained parking covenants.[6]The parking covenants in the Bank of Nova Scotia and Royal LePage leases guarantee each tenant a specified number of parking spaces, of which a certain number are to be marked as reserved exclusively for that tenant’s clients and staff.The parking provision at issue in the Royal LePage lease reads as follows:The Landlord shall guarantee to provide the Tenant with a minimum of 30 parking spaces for use by the Tenant’s employees, servants, agents and customers.The Landlord may not impose charges for the use of parking spaces.Said spaces shall be located on the upper level of the Lands and side of the Lands and 6 of the guaranteed 30 spaces shall be located as indicated in the Schedule 1 and marked reserved for Royal LePage customers or staff.The guaranteed minimum of 30 parking spaces shall be available to the Tenant 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.[7]The provision in the Good Life lease, however, does not grant Good Life the right to parking spaces reserved exclusively for Good Life clients and staff.Instead, it provides that Good Life will have unlimited access to parking at the property, and restricts Hazeldean’s ability to reduce the number of parking spaces from the number that was available to Good Life at the commencement of the lease.The parking provision in the Good Life lease reads as follows:The Tenant shall have unlimited access to parking at the property for its members and staff at no cost.The Landlord shall not reduce the available spaces for Tenant parking available at the commencement of the Lease, during the Term of the Lease or any extension thereof.However, the prohibition against reduction of available spaces shall be subject to requirements by municipal authorities or governmental authorities respecting expropriation.[8]While parking in the plaza generally complies with the Municipality’s By-Laws, several tenants have received complaints from both clients and staff regarding the inadequacy of the parking arrangements.These complaints, and the resulting tension, were the impetus for the applications brought by both Good Life and Royal LePage.[9]In the proceedings before the application judge, Good Life took the position that it was entitled to non-exclusive parking rights for the entire parking lot and that by granting Royal LePage and the Bank of Nova Scotia reserved spaces, Hazeldean breached the parking covenant in the Good Life lease.Royal LePage argued that it was entitled to 30 exclusive parking spaces and to the extent that these spaces were not available to Royal LePage at all times, Hazeldean was in breach of the parking covenant in the Royal LePage lease.[10]The application judge dismissed Good Life’s application.He found that the term “access” in the Good Life lease was ambiguous, and interpreted it to mean access to the parking lot generally, as opposed to access specifically to individual parking spaces.The application judge further found that the words “commencement of the lease” referred to in the parking covenant had the same meaning as the expression “Commencement Date”, which is a defined term in the Good Life lease and, on the facts, works out to be November 14, 2004.[11]From November 14, 2004, to the date of the application, the number of parking spaces at the shopping plaza remained constant at 275, the number provided for in the final site plan approved by the Municipality in October 2003.In the application judge’s view, the fact that Hazeldean may choose to grant to some of the tenants the exclusive right to use a specific number of these spaces does not “reduce the available spaces for [Good Life] parking” contrary to the parking covenant in the Good Life lease.There was, therefore, no basis for finding that Hazeldean breached the parking covenant in the Good Life lease, nor was there a basis for enjoining Hazeldean from later granting to a tenant the exclusive use of any or all of the parking spaces.[12]The application judge also dismissed Royal LePage’s application.The reasons do not expressly address the basis for this dismissal.ANALYSISGood Life’s Parking Covenant[13]On appeal, Good Life argues that the application judge erred in his interpretation of the parking covenant.Good Life submits that, properly interpreted, and viewed in the context of the entire lease, the first sentence of that covenant, “[t]he Tenant shall have unlimited access to parking at the property for its members and staff at no cost”, makes it clear that Good Life has unlimited access to the all of the parking spaces at the shopping plaza.Restricting Good Life’s access to some spaces by granting other tenants the exclusive use of a certain number of parking spaces therefore contravenes the terms of the Good Life lease.Good Life further submits that the second sentence, “[t]he Landlord shall not reduce the available spaces for Tenant parking available at the commencement of the Lease, during the Term of the Lease or any extension thereof”, restricts Hazeldean’s ability to reduce the number of spaces in the parking area from the 275 spaces that were originally constructed.[14]I do not agree with Good Life’s interpretation of the parking covenant.In my view, the meaning of the term “access” in the first sentence of the parking covenant is clear and unambiguous, and I agree with the application judge’s interpretation of the term, namely, that it refers to access generally to “parking”.The second sentence, however, refers specifically to the availability of “spaces” for parking.Read in context, therefore, the first sentence addresses the issue of access to the parking area generally, and makes it clear that Hazeldean cannot impose restrictions on Good Life’s access to the parking area, for example, by setting limited hours of operation or charging a fee for parking.The second sentence, on the other hand, deals specifically with the availability of parking spaces and makes it clear that Hazeldean cannot reduce the number of spaces that were available for Good Life’s use at the “commencement of the Lease”.[15]If Good Life wanted to ensure access, specifically, to all of the individual parking spaces in the parking area, as opposed to the parking lot generally, it was incumbent on Good Life to specify accordingly in the lease.Similarly, if Good Life wished to prevent the landlord from granting reserved spaces anywhere in the parking lot to other tenants, it should have negotiated for the inclusion of such a clause in the lease.[16]Good Life also argues that if the first sentence of the parking covenant simply ensures access to the parking lot generally, this sentence becomes redundant and effectively useless.Good Life maintains that access to the parking area is guaranteed by virtue of other provisions in the lease regarding the common elements of the shopping plaza.Accordingly, Good Life submits that since these provisions ensure access to the common elements, and the parking area is a common element, the application judge’s interpretation of the first sentence of the parking covenant cannot be correct.I would not give effect to this submission.The clauses dealing with the common elements do not provide for unlimited access to all of the common elements.Absent the first sentence in the parking covenant, the landlord would not be precluded by the common element provisions in the lease from placing limits on access to the parking area.[17]Good Life submits in the alternative that the application judge erred in his interpretation of the phrase “commencement of the Lease” in the second sentence of the parking covenant.Specifically, the application judge erred in concluding that the date of “commencement of the Lease” in the parking covenant is the same as the “Commencement Date”, as defined in the lease.[18]The second sentence of the parking covenant provides that the landlord “shall not reduce the available spaces for Tenant parking available at the commencement of the Lease, during the Term of the lease or any extension thereof.”Rather than prohibiting absolutely the reduction of available spaces, this sentence operates to prohibit the reduction of available spaces after a certain date, namely, the date of “commencement of the Lease”.The issue, therefore, is the determination of that date.[19]Good Life submits that the date of “commencement of the Lease” should be interpreted as December 24, 2002, the date the conditional offer to lease was accepted and thereby became binding, and not the much later “Commencement Date”.The Good Life lease defines “Commencement Date” as being 90 days after the possession date, which, pursuant to the amendments to the lease, is August 23, 2004, or the date Good Life opens for business, if that date is earlier.Since Good Life only opened for business on January 2, 2005, the “Commencement Date” for the space Good Life was to occupy in the plaza therefore works out to be November 14, 2004, 90 days after the possession date.Good Life argues that because the leases with Royal LePage and the Bank of Nova Scotia were entered into after December 24, 2002, and because these leases granted Royal LePage and the Bank of Nova Scotia the exclusive use of a certain number of parking spaces, Hazeldean contravened the parking covenant “not to reduce the available spaces” for Good Life parking “available at the commencement of the Lease”.[20]In my view, the application judge was correct.It would make little sense for the commencement of the lease for parking purposes to be a date almost two years before the commencement of the lease for purposes other than parking.Further, on December 24, 2002, the date the offer to lease became binding, Hazeldean was still negotiating with the Municipality regarding the total number of parking spaces required for the entire project.As noted earlier, the number of spaces was ultimately reduced in the course of these negotiations from 292 to 275.It therefore could not have been the intention of the parties that the “available spaces for Tenant parking at the commencement of the Lease” would be determined as of the date that the offer to lease became binding, since at that date, the number of parking spaces that would ultimately be constructed was still inconclusive.[21]I disagree, however, with the application judge’s conclusion that Hazeldean is at liberty to grant exclusive parking spaces to other tenants in addition to those already granted to the Bank of Nova Scotia and Royal LePage.In my view, when spaces are reserved for other tenants, these parking spaces are no longer “available spaces” for Good Life.The application judge’s interpretation that the reserved spaces are available simply because Good Life clients and staff can access the parking area generally renders the second sentence of the parking covenant meaningless and, in effect, wrongly equates the phrase “access to parking at the property” with the phrase “available spaces for tenant”.Taken to the extreme, this interpretation would mean that Hazeldean could allow other tenants to reserve all of the parking spaces in the shopping plaza.Good Life customers would have access to the parking area, but would have no spaces in which to park.This defeats the clear intent and stated purpose of the clause, which is not only to ensure that “spaces” are available to Good Life clients and staff, but also that the spaces that were “available” to Good Life at the commencement of the lease remain available during the term of the lease and any extension thereof.[22]Based on the foregoing discussion, I would allow the appeal in part, and declare that the parking covenant in the Good Life lease restricts Hazeldean’s ability to grant reserved parking spaces to tenants of the plaza beyond those already granted on November 14, 2004, the date of commencement of the lease.I would not, however, issue an injunction to the same effect.Hazeldean has indicated before us that it does not intend to grant any additional reserved parking spaces beyond those already in place.I therefore do not consider an injunction to be an appropriate remedy.I would simply issue a declaration.Royal LePage’s Parking Covenant[23]Royal LePage claims that it is entitled to 30 reserved parking spaces.Although the application judge dismissed Royal LePage’s application, his reasons do not specifically address the basis for his rejection of Royal LePage’s claim.Royal LePage submits that the trial judge erred in this regard and, at a minimum, the application judge ought to have granted partial relief by declaring that 6 of the 30 spaces could be reserved exclusively for Royal LePage staff and clients.[24]Although the application judge ought to have given reasons for rejecting Royal LePage’s request for the declaration in respect of the 30 parking spaces, he was, in my opinion, correct in dismissing this portion of Royal LePage’s application.Correctly interpreted, the parking covenant does not grant Royal LePage 30 reserved spaces.The relevant sentence of the parking covenant reads as follows:Said spaces shall be located on the upper level of the Lands and side of the Lands and 6 of the guaranteed 30 spaces shall be located as indicated in the Schedule 1 and marked reserved for Royal LePage customers or staff.[25]A clear distinction is made between the 6 spaces that are to be “marked reserved”, and the remaining 24 spaces.Whatever was intended by referring to the 30 spaces as “guaranteed”, it is clear that this reference could not mean that the spaces are reserved exclusively for Royal LePage.Absent marking the remaining 24 spaces as reserved, the spaces can invariably be used by all of the plaza’s tenants.[26]In the context of the covenant as a whole, the guarantee of the minimum of 30 spaces, therefore, must be providing for unrestricted access to 30 spaces, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, without charge, as well as specifying where these 30 spaces are to be located on the property of the plaza.[27]Although Royal LePage’s application for a declaration that it was entitled to 30 reserved parking spaces was dismissed, it is apparent from his reasons that the application judge recognized that Royal LePage did have the right to 6 reserved parking spaces.On appeal, Hazeldean has all but conceded that a declaration to that effect could be issued and, in my view, the parking covenant clearly provides for this right.[28]As a result, I would allow Royal LePage’s appeal in part, and issue a declaration that Royal LePage is entitled to 6 parking spaces, located as set out in the parking covenant, and that these spaces may be marked as reserved for Royal LePage clients or staff.In light of my disposition of the Good Life appeal, it is clear that the granting of this declaration in the Royal LePage appeal does not affect Good Life’s parking rights.CONCLUSION[29]I would allow both the Royal LePage and Good Life appeals in part, and I would issue declarations as follows:(a)a declaration that, pursuant to the Good Life lease, Hazeldean may not grant reserved parking spaces on the subject property over and above those already provided for by lease as at November 14, 2004; and(b)a declaration that Royal LePage is, pursuant to its lease, entitled to 6 parking spaces, located as provided in the parking covenant, and that these 6 spaces can be marked as reserved for Royal LePage clients or staff.[30]In all other respects, I would dismiss both the Good Life and Royal LePage appeals.[31]In the circumstances, I would not award costs for or against Royal LePage.Royal LePage was justified in bringing and had partial success on this appeal and, although Hazeldean did not strenuously oppose the granting of a declaration as to the 6 parking spaces in its submissions, there was no clear concession to that effect in its materials.I would therefore make no award of costs as between Royal LePage and Hazeldean.[32]With respect to the Good Life appeal, although Good Life has had some success on this appeal, it was nevertheless unsuccessful regarding the two central points raised on appeal, namely, seeking a declaration that Hazeldean was in breach of the parking covenant, and requesting a permanent injunction.Therefore, in the circumstances, I would award Hazeldean costs against Good Life in the reduced amount of $5,000, inclusive of GST and disbursements.“Paul Rouleau J.A.”“I agree K.M.

Burton, 2011 PESC 21.I will provide a brief summary of the facts.Prince Edward Island was chosen to host the 2009 Canada Games.The province sought volunteers to work in all capacities relating to the Games.In 2006, the appellant contacted Ted Lawlor (“Lawlor”), who was the Chef de Mission in charge of the P.E.I. teams to express her interest in volunteering to coach the rowing team.[3]The province never had a rowing team, and as a result, everything necessary for the sport had to be purchased.The organizing committee of the Games provided funding to cover boats, equipment, training, transportation, accommodation, participation in events and other related expenses.[4]Stephen Murray (“Murray”) was a volunteer who worked as general manager with the rowing team during periods from 2005-2006. His job with the rowing team was to oversee the flow of funds for the rowing team and to make sure it was financially accountable.[5]When the Games ended, Murray’s review of the financial records revealed a number of irregularities in the accounting.This led to police involvement and criminal charges being laid against the appellant.[6]The problems with the accounting records of the rowing team included many cheques being written from the Canada Games Rowing Account to the appellant’s personal account, a lack of receipts or other documentation to show claimed expenses were actually incurred, and an expenditure of $8,000. for a boat which was not in inventory.[7]On April 12, 2010, Constable Flynn of the Charlottetown Police interviewed the appellant at the Charlottetown Police Station.The trial judge found the statement to be voluntary and admitted it into evidence at trial.Constable Flynn told the appellant he was investigating a theft of over $5,000. from the rowing team and that he had no doubt she took the money.The appellant interrupted him to agree with him, stating, “I don’t deny that at all.That was part of my original agreement was that I would have money to live off when I took over the team.”The appellant claimed she discussed this with Lawlor, and he agreed she could have an honorarium to cover her expenses, and thereafter she took the money as she needed it with the understanding the money she took would be shown on the books as a proper expense at the end of the day.NOTICE OF APPEAL[8]There are twenty-five grounds of appeal set forth in the appellant’s Notice of Appeal, including two grounds on violations of Charter rights.The latter were withdrawn at the hearing of the appeal.[9]The appeal from conviction can be decided on the following four issues:(1)whether the trial judge delivered a verdict which was unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence;(2)whether the trial judge erred in concluding that the Crown witnesses were credible;(3)whether the trial judge made an error in law in failing to consider certain evidence of the appellant;(4)whether the Crown proved the case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.(5)regarding sentence, the issue is whether the trial judge erred in imposing a sentence of incarceration in provincial jail rather than aconditional sentence.DISPOSITION[10]I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. I would grant leave to appealand dismiss the appeal against sentence.ANALYSISIssue #1Reasonableness of the verdict[11]A court of appeal may allow an appeal against conviction where the court is of the view that the verdict reached by the trial judge was unreasonable in that it cannot be supported by the evidence.[12]Section 686(1)(a)(i) provides:686.(1)On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or against a verdict that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal(a)may allow the appeal where it is of the opinion that(i)the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence; ...[13]The test for appellate review of whether the judgment of a trial judge is unreasonable or cannot be supported by the evidence expressed in R. v. Yebes, 1987 CanLII 17 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168, is to determine whether, on the whole of the evidence, the verdict is one that a properly instructed trier of fact acting judicially could reasonably have reached.It is necessary for this court to go beyond merely finding that there is evidence to support the conviction.While the court of appeal is not to substitute its view for that of the trier of fact, in order to properly apply the test, the court must re-examine and to some extent re-weigh and consider the effect of the evidence.This statement of the law was recently affirmed in R. v. Lee, 2010 SCC 52 (CanLII), [2010] 3 S.C.R. 99.[14]Where the appeal is from a conviction entered by a trial judge sitting without a jury, the court of appeal should identify the defects in the trial judge’s analysis that led to the unreasonable conclusion.It is not sufficient to interfere or find the verdict unreasonable on the basis of a lurking or lingering doubt without providing the basis for the doubt.The court must articulate the basis for finding that the verdict was unreasonable.See: R. v. Biniaris, 2000 SCC 15 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381 (SCC).[15]With these tests in mind, I will now turn to the decision of the trial judge and the evidence he relied on to convict the appellant.[16]The appellant was convicted of theft over $5,000. and fraud.Section 322(1) of the Criminal Code sets out the elements of the offence of theft:322.(1)Every one commits theft who fraudulently and without colour of right converts to his use or to the use of another person, anything, whether animate or inanimate, with intent(a)to deprive, temporarily or absolutely, the owner of it, or a person who has a special property or interest in it, of the thing or of his property or interest in it; ...[17]The appellant was also convicted of fraud contrary to s.380(1) of the Criminal Code:380.(1)Every one who, by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means, whether or not it is a false pretence within the meaning of this Act, defrauds the public or any person, whether ascertained or not, of any property, money or valuable security or any service,(a)is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding fourteen years, where the subject‑matter of the offence is a testamentary instrument or the value of the subject‑matter of the offence exceeds five thousand dollars; or ...[18]The trial judge relied on the following evidence to convict the appellant of the offences as charged:i)Statement of the appellant[19]At trial the Crown had entered in evidence the video of the statement given by the appellant to the police.This court reviewed a transcript prepared by the police from the video.The statement contained admissions the appellant had taken money intended to cover rowing expenses and had used it for her own personal expenses such as rent and phone bills.The statement also contained the appellant’s explanation that Lawlor said it would be okay to take money for her expenses.This was what the appellant referred to as an honorarium.ii)Agreement between the appellant and High Performance Committee[20]The agreement with the High Performance Committee was the same form of agreement that was signed by 50 other managers and coaches for the teams representing P.E.I. at the 2009 Canada Games. It did not provide for the payment of any remuneration to the managers or coaches and only provided reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred.[21]Section 3 of the Agreement states as follows:3.ReimbursementThe Coach will be entitled to receive Reimbursement from the provincial Canada Games program for all reasonable expenses incurred as a result of coaching the 2009 Canada Games Team.Reimbursement will be made through team funds supplied to the team from the Canada Games Program.Request for reimbursement must be accompanied by receipts.iii)Four seat rowing boat[22]An email exchange between the appellant and Murray revealed the following:CindyDid we sell the 4's boats back to HRC or give them back??There was money out of the account for the 4's and there was a debt and then an $8000 credit for the sale of the boats.Please help me understand.Stephen[23]The appellant’s reply stated:From: Cindy Burton [mail to: cindy@heroesforhir.ca]Sent: Wednesday, October 21, 2009 4:01 AMSubject: Re: The 4's boatsthis was a boat that we purchased from the st catherines rowing club and then sold back to them.the boat seemed like a great deal until i realized that shipping it here was going to be a major problem.i spent months trying to figure out how to get the thing here, and when they told me they had another buyer, i flipped it back.the returned money came back to me and at the time, i was months behind on my rent, facing eviction and the struggles of chronic poverty.i let the money sit in my account at first, and then used it to pay the phone bill, then a bit of rent, and so on.that’s what i said about living on the money but acknowledging that it was my debt to the club.had i been earning money or had some sort of revenue stream, i could have been replacing the money but there has never been the chance, and coaching, unlike sports therapists, don’t get to charge $30 per hour for our time.as I’ve mentioned before, if you want to leave it on the books as a debt outstanding, I’m cool with that.no doubt I’ll be able to chip away at this over time and the club can think of it as a revenue stream.peacecindyIt is notable that, in this communication, the appellant did not mention or rely on the honorarium agreement to defend her reason for taking the money. The trial judge correctly pointed out in paragraph 31 of his reasons that the above email was evidence to the contrary – the appellant acknowledged that she had no right to the money and proposed that it be treated as a debt for her to repay over time.(iv)Cheques[24]There were a number of cheques from the Rowing Team made payable to the appellant personally in amounts of $4,000., $3,000., and $2,000. which were not supported by appropriate receipts.(v)Witnesses[25]Four witnesses testified for the Crown: Lawlor, Murray, Cst. Flynn, the investigating officer, and Ms. Silliker from the Credit Union.[26]The trial judge found the evidence of the witnesses who testified for the Crown to be credible.The most pivotal evidence was Lawlor’s statement that there was only one agreement for remuneration with the appellant and it was the High Performance Agreement, and there was no collateral agreement.Issue # 2:Credibility of Witnesses[27]The question whether a verdict is reasonable is one of law, whereas the question of whether a witness is credible is a question of fact.A court of appeal that reviews a trial court’s assessment of credibility in order to determine, for example, whether the verdict is reasonable cannot interfere with those assessments unless it is established that they “cannot be supported on any reasonable review of the evidence” (see: R. v. R.P., 2012 SCC 22 (CanLII), at ¶10).[28]The trial judge chose to accept the evidence of Lawlor, and it was within his purview to do that. Credibility is a matter which must be left to the trial judge.Summary of the evidence[29]On my examination of the evidence based on the directions given in Yebes and Biniaris, supra, the following evidence led the trial judge to convict the appellant:(1)the appellant’s admission to taking the money;(2)the appellant’s admission of converting the boat to cash and using the funds for her own personal use;(3)the testimony of Ms. Silliker of the Credit Union about the accounts of the Rowing Team and the appellant. Her evidence disclosed that the appellant drew cheques from the account of the Rowing Team and deposited those cheques to her own personal account; the appellant cashed cheques made payable to the Rowing Team, some paid in cash to her with remainder put in the Rowing Team account or in her personal account.(4)There is no evidence other than the appellant’s reference in her unsworn statement to the police of the existence of an honorarium agreement either oral or written. The only person who was in a position to make such an agreement was Mr. Lawlor who refuted that it existed.(5)The appellant seemed to put a lot of stock at both the trial and the hearing of the appeal that her work was always supervised; that she never worked alone, but with a group and her work was reviewed all the way along. This factor does not lend any credence to the appellant’s case. Supervision would not give one a license to steal. Additionally, there is no evidence whatsoever that Mr. Lawlor or Mr. Murray were complicit in the actions of the appellant.[30]While the appellant did not testify and did not call any witnesses, she relied on her statement, cross examined the Crown witnesses and did enter documents as exhibits. The appellant’s submission to this panel and to the trial judge was “it is all there before you.”[31]Having considered the evidence in its entirety, I am of the opinion that the verdicts reached by the trial judge are supported by the evidence and are verdicts that a properly instructed trier of fact acting judicially could reasonably have reached.Issue # 3:Did the trial judge make an error in law in failing to consider certain evidence of the appellant?[32]The appellant raised five issues on appeal arguing the trial judge either ignored or discounted the evidence, failed to understand its significance or purpose, failed to consider it, or erred in concluding the reliability of Crown witnesses:(1)Lawlor testified he first met with the appellant in March, 2007.He then acknowledged they had met a full year earlier. Therefore, the appellant was coach of the team without a written contract.(2)Murray’s testimony was incorrect on the timing of the dates that he was away from the team.The purpose of her point was to show that the appellant was always subject to accounting supervision as Murray co-signed the cheques and conducted annual financial reviews.(3)The trial judge considered it problematic that cheques in large sums were made payable to the appellant for even amounts and for large sums. The appellant argued that Murray had countersigned the cheques and that it was part of the system for coaches to pay for some team expenses on a cash basis.(4)The appellant argued that she had given a reasonable explanation for not providing the receipts as they had been lost in a number of moves.The appellant argued that the trial judge did not appreciate this submission.(5)The trial judge found it problematic that the appellant took a substantial amount of money (at least $10,000.) in one year, being 2007.He stated if she had an honorarium, the expenses would be similar from year to year.The appellant’s statement on this point was that 2007 was the year when she had the most need for a contribution toward her living expenses.[33]The appellant submits that the trial judge’s reasoning on the central issue of whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that she did not honestly believe that she had a legal claim to the money she took was influenced by his lack of appreciation of this evidence.[34]It was within the province of the trial judge to reject the evidence offered by the appellant and accept the evidence of the Crown witnesses. The issue of the credibility of the witnesses was central to the trial judge’s reasoning.[35]The trial judge may have ignored this evidence raised by the appellant. However, in my opinion, the evidence was not material or of any assistance to the appellant in providing a defence against the crimes of theft and fraud. The timing issues raised are inconsequential, particularly those of Mr. Murray.Mr. Murray’s evidence could be corroborated by a review of the cheques alone.His testimony was that some of the cheques which were made out personally to the appellant had been pre-signed or signed in advance by Murray.They were not all “countersigned.”He also testified that at least in the case of one cheque, it was not his signature, and his evidence disclosed that most could not be supported by a proper receipt.[36]As for the appellant’s stated argument about the proposed honorarium, the only evidence of an honorarium was that of the appellant.It was never tested on cross-examination. It was within the purview of the trial judge to reject this argument and conclude as he did:The conflicting statements made by the Defendant in her statement to Constable Flynn about her guilt or innocence were not a credible assertion of an honest belief in a colour of right, the other statements made by her, and the evidence as a whole as discussed above satisfied me beyond a reasonable doubt the Defendant both stole the money from and defrauded the Government of money.None of these pieces of collateral evidence are sufficient to impact on the decision of the trial judge. The trial judge gave proper effect to the evidence. The errors alleged by the appellant do not cast any doubt on the ultimate verdict.Issue # 4:Proof beyond a reasonable doubt[37]The burden of proof is upon the Crown at all times to prove the essential elements of the offences beyond a reasonable doubt.As stated in R. v. Lifchus, 1997 CanLII 319 (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320, at ¶36, the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is inextricably intertwined with the principle fundamental to all criminal trials, the presumption of innocence. The trial judge did not make any error regarding this ground of appeal.Issue # 5:Whether the trial judge erred in the imposition of sentence?[38]The trial judge sentenced the appellant to four months incarceration in the Provincial Correctional Centre followed by a period of probation of 18 months and restitution in the amount of $4,000.In her Notice of Appeal, the appellant argued that the “only acceptable sentence is an absolute discharge.” At the hearing of the appeal, she argued for a conditional sentence.[39]In R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227 (SCC); R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500 (SCC); R. v. McDonnell, (1997), 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 436 (SCC); R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), the Supreme Court of Canada directed an appellate court should not interfere with a sentence unless the sentencing judge commits an error in principle.Such an error arises when the sentencing judge fails to take into account a relevant factor; takes into account an irrelevant factor; fails to give sufficient weight to relevant factors; overemphasizes relevant factors, and generally, when the sentencing judge commits an error of law.A court of appeal is also free to intervene where a sentencing judge, although not committing an error in principle, but imposed a sentence which is outside an acceptable range of sentence.In the latter situation, the appellate court might consider whether the sentence imposed is clearly unreasonable, clearly excessive or inadequate, demonstrably unfit, or a substantial and marked departure from other sentences imposed for like offences by like offenders.[40]When the factors are applied in this case, I am unable to conclude the sentencing judge committed an error in principle.He took into account and gave sufficient weight to all relevant factors, and he did not take into account any irrelevant factors.He addressed the circumstances which he considered aggravating and those which were mitigating.[41]In many respects, sentencing is very much an individualized process. The sentencing judge properly considered the criteria which had to be met prior to a conditional sentence being imposed. It is apparent from reading pages 4-8 of the sentencing judge’s decision that he gave close attention, as he was required to do, as to whether a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental principles of sentencing. It was implicit that he viewed incarceration necessary and that a lesser restrictive sanction was not appropriate in the circumstances.He expressed concerns that the fundamental principles of sentencing could not be met as the appellant continued to protest her innocence in the face of being convicted by overwhelming evidence to the contrary.[42]While the sentencing judge stated the appellant was not at risk to re-offend, he was concerned that she did not acknowledge any responsibility for her crimes. He considered that not only was she unrepentant, but more than that, she accused others of criminal behaviour that led to her conviction. The sentencing judge stated, “Based on the evidence I have heard, there is not a scrap of evidence to support her accusations.” (See: para. 30.)[43]The sentencing judge sentenced the appellant as a convicted but unrepentant offender. He concluded that a “short, sharp sentence” was required to bring home to Ms. Burton that her actions were wrong.[44]In the result, because the sentencing judge did not commit an error in principle and appropriately considered all of the relevant factors, this court cannot interfere.Conclusion[45]I would dismiss the appeal against conviction. I would grant leave to appeal and dismiss the appeal against sentence._____________________________________Justice Michele M.

CameronMr. Justice Christopher J. MainellaMadam Justice Jennifer A. PfuetznerBETWEEN:HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN)K. J. Advent)for the AppellantRespondent))-and -)C. R. Savage)for the RespondentKALSEY CAMERON HOULE))Appeal heard and(Accused)Appellant)Decision pronounced:)November 30, 2016MAINELLA JA (for the Court):Introduction[1]This appeal is about an absconding witness.The accused was convicted of attempting to obstruct justice (section 139(2) of the Criminal Code (the Code)) and failing to comply with a condition of a recognizance (section 145(3) of the Code).He was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, concurrent on each offence, less credit for pre-sentence custody.He appeals his convictions and seeks leave to appeal sentence.At the hearing of the appeal, the conviction appeal was dismissed, leave to appeal sentence was granted and the sentence appeal was allowed with reasons to follow.These are those reasons.Conviction Appeal[2]The background to the absconding was that the accused was a Crown witness at his cousin’s trial for break, enter and theft of a business premise in off hours.He was under subpoena and, further, was subject to a recognizance with a condition that he attend court on the day in question and thereafter as directed.At the conclusion of his direct examination, he asked for permission to use the washroom.The presiding judge agreed to the requested break, told the accused not to discuss his evidence and then advised that “we will take a few minutes and resume.”The accused left the courtroom, rushed to the elevators of the Winnipeg Courthouse and never returned despite being paged through the Courthouse’s intercom system.[3]The trial judge, hearing the allegation of absconding, decided that the “inescapable conclusion” from the evidence was that the accused knew he was required to return, breached his recognizance by not doing so and, further, that the intentional decision not to return was for the purpose of attempting to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice.[4]The accused submits that the convictions are unreasonable.He argues that there was insufficient evidence to draw the inference that he knew that he had to return to court after the recess or that he had the specific intent to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice by his actions (see R v Abdullah (G) et al, 2010 MBCA 79 (CanLII) at para 39, 258 ManR (2d) 89).I disagree.In my view, guilt was the only reasonable inference for both offences available on the evidence or its absence (see R v Villaroman, 2016 SCC 33 (CanLII) at paras 36-37; and R v Roulette, 2015 MBCA 102 (CanLII) at para 5).[5]To begin, the accused’s argument that the facts were open to the inference that he believed that he did not have to return is without merit.The accused did not testify at his trial and there is no other evidence to support that speculative assertion.Moreover, the submission is based on a faulty assumption; it is not up to a witness to decide when he or she is done testifying.The accused’s legal obligation to appear and remain to give evidence pursuant to his subpoena did not expire until he was excused from doing so by the presiding judge (which never occurred).Section 700(2) of the Code provides:Witness to appear and remain700(2) A person who is served with a subpoena issued under this Part shall attend and shall remain in attendance throughout the proceedings unless he is excused by the presiding judge, justice or provincial court judge.[6]The act of a witness absconding during his or her testimony is one that tends to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice.Such conduct is contrary to the legal obligations created by a subpoena and also has a detrimental effect to the administration of justice because it creates prejudice to the parties, inconvenience to the Court, jury and other witnesses, and can ultimately delay the completion of a trial.For the purposes of proof of the offence of attempting to obstruct justice, the inference of the specific intent required for the offence may be drawn from conduct, like what occurred here, that is “obviously detrimental to the administration of justice” (see Abdullah at para 51).[7]I see no reason to interfere with the decision of the trial judge as the facts belie the possibility that the accused’s flight from the Courthouse was a “simple error of judgment” (see R v Beaudry, 2007 SCC 5 (CanLII) at para 52, [2007] 1 SCR 190).There is no evidence of an intention of the accused to return voluntarily to court to complete his testimony despite his ability to do so.In my view, when the evidence as a whole is re-examined, to some extent reweighed, and the effects of it are considered, I am satisfied that a properly-instructed trier of fact acting judicially could reasonably have rendered the verdicts reached here.Sentence Appeal[8]The relevant background for the sentence imposed is as follows.The accused is now 28 years old.He was raised and continues to reside in an Ojibway community in rural Manitoba.Attendance at residential schools detrimentally impacted his mother and grandparents and, as a result, his upbringing was negatively affected.He has had substance-abuse problems historically.He has recently participated in and successfully completed a substance-abuse awareness program while in custody.He has a lengthy uninterrupted criminal record, primarily for property and driving offences.That record includes two dozen convictions for failing to comply with court orders.[9]At the sentencing hearing, the parties disagreed as to the seriousness of the attempt to obstruct justice.The Crown argued that the trial judge should take into account as an aggravating factor the finding of the judge presiding at the trial of the accused’s cousin that the accused was “lying through his teeth through the majority of his evidence” prior to absconding.The trial judge disagreed and accepted the position of the accused that the sentence should be limited only to his act of absconding. The trial judge stated:“[H]e is to be sentenced only for leaving the court, essentially, failing to remain as required, and obstruction of justice by leaving the courtroom.I cannot take into account the actual circumstances of his testimony and its impact.”[10]The accused argues that the trial judge overemphasized the principle of deterrence, failed to give appropriate consideration to the analysis required by section 718.2(e) of the Code for sentencing Aboriginal offenders in light of Gladue factors (R v Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 SCR 688) and that ultimately a one-year sentence for absconding part way through giving evidence is demonstrably unfit.[11]The law affords a sentencing judge great latitude in tailoring a sentence to the offence and the offender (R v Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII) at para 38, [2012] 1 SCR 433; and R v Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII) at paras 43‑46, [2010] 1 SCR 206).Accordingly, the threshold for appellate intervention with a sentence is “very high” and limited only to situations of material error or where the sentence is demonstrably unfit (section 687(1) of the Code and R v Lacasse, 2015 SCC 64 (CanLII) at para 52, [2015] 3 SCR 1089).A material error has two qualities beginning with demonstration of an error in principle, such as an error in law, a failure to consider or give sufficient weight to a relevant factor, consideration of an irrelevant factor or an overemphasis of an appropriate factor.The second aspect is that the error must have impacted the sentence in more than just an incidental way (see Lacasse at para 44).Where the error is harmless, as it has “no real effect” on the sentence, appellate intervention is not permitted (Lacasse at para 45).A sentence will be demonstrably unfit where it unreasonably departs from the principle of proportionality taking into account the individual circumstances of the offence and the offender and the acceptable range of sentence for similar offences committed in similar circumstances (see Lacasse at paras 52-55; and R v Ruizfuentes (HS), 2010 MBCA 90 (CanLII) at para 7, 258 ManR (2d) 220).[12]The accused’s Gladue submission is unpersuasive.The circumstances of the offence are far removed from systemic and personal factors that have tended to bring him into contact with the law historically, such as an unstable upbringing and difficulties with substance abuse.His criminal conduct was a deliberate voluntary choice to commit an offence with a significant mental element.Counsel conceded at trial that the accused was familiar with the court process.While a causal link between the offence and the relevant Gladue factors is not required, in my view, the Gladue factors here do not diminish the accused’s moral culpability for absconding part way through giving evidence to necessitate a decrease in the length of what would otherwise be a fit sentence (see Ipeelee at paras 73, 83).The accused knew what his legal obligations were but openly defied fully meeting them.[13]Deterrence and denunciation are the paramount considerations for the offence of attempting to obstruct justice as protection of the integrity of the administration of justice is an important component of the preservation of the rule of law necessary to maintain a civil society.The offence is a serious one and sentences for it must dissuade such conduct and firmly convey society’s disapproval and lack of tolerance for such behaviour (see Roulette at para 9; R v Cashman (P) (1999), 1999 CanLII 12328 (SK CA), 189 SaskR 155 at para 6 (CA); and R v Hall (JE), 2001 BCCA 74 (CanLII) at para 12, 150 BCAC 313).[14]The range of sentence for the offence of attempting to obstruct justice is wide because of the innumerable ways it can be committed.While jail sentences of one year or more, even up to including penitentiary sentences, have been given to offenders convicted of attempting to obstruct justice with little or no criminal records, those cases have involved egregious conduct designed to undermine the administration of justice, such as destruction, tampering with, concealing or the manufacture of evidence; intimidation, bribery or otherwise improperly influencing a witness or juror; refusing to testify; a fraud on the court; a breach of trust or the proceeding that is the subject of the attempt to obstruct is grave in nature (e.g. see Roulette; R v Letta, 2004 MBCA 179 (CanLII), 190 ManR (2d) 165; R v Sinclair (JG), 2010 MBCA 105 (CanLII), 262 ManR (2d) 23; R v Appleyard (D), 2007 MBCA 65 (CanLII), 214 ManR (2d) 245; R v RCH, 2013 MBCA 108 (CanLII), 303 ManR (2d) 39; and R v Brown (C) (1995), 107 ManR (2d) 59 (CA)).None of those aggravating circumstances is present here.[15]The gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the accused, given the unchallenged finding of the trial judge that the accused was being sentenced only for absconding after his direct examination, meant that a proportionate sentence would be one that punished what was in essence an aggravated form of failure to appear in court, but nothing more.I am of the view that a one-year sentence, even for an accused with a lengthy related record, for the conduct he was being sentenced for, is demonstrably unfit.[16]Historically, the accused has typically received sentences of 30-90 days for offences involving breaches of court orders.He was subject to a probation order when he testified at his cousin’s trial for several offences, including breaching more than one court order.His lengthy related record calls for a sentence greater than he has previously received for ignoring legal obligations to properly address the sentencing objectives of specific deterrence and protection of society (subsections 718(b) and (c) of the Code - see R v Wright (CD), 2010 MBCA 80 (CanLII) at paras 13-16, 258 ManR (2d) 118).Given the trial judge imposed concurrent sentences, which was appropriate in the circumstances, the overall sentence must also be of sufficient length to ensure that the accused does not receive a “free ride” on the breach of a condition of a recognizance offence and to properly recognize that multiple offences were committed together (see R v Wozny (CP), 2010 MBCA 115 (CanLII) at para 70, 262 ManR (2d) 75; and R v Cook (N), 2014 MBCA 29 (CanLII) at para 35, 303 ManR (2d) 235).[17]In my view, taking into account the gravity of the offence and the accused’s degree of responsibility (as found by the trial judge), the relevant personal and systemic factors, the applicable sentencing principles and objectives, and the range of sentence for more egregious cases of attempting to obstruct justice, a fit sentence for that offence would be one of six-months’ imprisonment.The relevant circumstances satisfy me that a fit sentence for the offence of breaching a condition of a recognizance would be one of four-months’ imprisonment, to be served concurrently.[18]The accused had served about six and one-half months of pre-sentence custody.His total sentence of six months will be served by crediting four months of that pre-sentence custody at the rate of 1.5:1, plus one day of imprisonment for his court appearance on the date of sentencing.For the purposes of clarity, the remaining two and one-half months of pre-sentence custody and the time served as a sentenced prisoner on these offences is available for credit to the accused but only for a currently- outstanding charge(s) (i.e., the credit cannot be “banked” for future offences if the accused becomes re-involved with the law while in custody or after his release).Disposition[19]In the result, the appeal as to conviction is dismissed.Leave to appeal sentence is granted, the sentence appeal is allowed and the accused’s sentence is varied in accordance with these reasons.JAJAJA"}

Bao, 2018 ONCJ 136COURT FILE No.:St. CatharinesDATE: 2018.03.02ONTARIOCOURTOFJUSTICEBETWEEN:HERMAJESTYTHEQUEEN—AND—AI MING BAOBefore Justice Fergus ODonnellReasons for SentenceReleased March 2, 2018[1]Mr. D. Anger............................................................................................for the CrownMs. M. Macchia.......................................................for the defendant, Ai Ming BaoFergus ODonnell, J.:1)On 31 August, 2017, I found Ai Ming Bao guilty of possession of marihuana for the purpose of trafficking.That finding of guilt came after a trial, at which it came out that Mr. Bao had, whilst driving a van, breached a police roadblock in the Town of Lincoln.That roadblock had been set up as a result of an earlier motorcycle accident that did not involve Mr. Bao, but Mr. Bao came out from the general vicinity of the accident scene and failed to stop when directed to do so by the officer manning the roadblock.After a short pursuit, the officer found the van resting against a hydro pole, but no Mr. Bao.The police also found 169 pounds of marihuana in the van.The principal issue at trial was whether or not the Crown had proved Mr. Bao's identity as the driver of the van beyond a reasonable doubt.I found that the Crown had made out its case.2)The Crown now asks me to impose a sentence of nine to twelve months' imprisonment on Mr. Bao.Ms. Macchia asks for a ninety-day intermittent sentence.3)I am grateful to both counsel for the quality of their submissions.Mr. Anger approached the matter with his characteristic fairness, restraint and conciseness.No lily was gilded, nor was any proposition stretched.Ms. Macchia likewise swept through her submissions in a structured, thorough and easy to follow manner that, despite the relative brevity of her argument, left nothing unsaid for Mr. Bao that could have been said.4)There are some factors about this case that are relevant to the issue of sentence and are easily discernible.Mr. Bao was found guilty after trial, not after a guilty plea.He is not to be punished for exercising his constitutional right to a trial, but he is also not entitled to the mitigation on sentence that people who plead guilty are entitled to.5)Mr. Bao appears before me blessed with a favourable pre-sentence report.It shows that he turned thirty-three years old last month.He is one of four children of what he describes as a very positive marriage.He and his wife speak in similar terms of their own relationship.They have two young children and live with Mr. Bao's parents, in keeping with his cultural sense of obligation as the only son.The pre-sentence report shows that Mr. Bao has no fear of hard work:after leaving school in China after grade nine he found work in a steel foundry to help support his family and he has worked for almost a decade as a chef in Canada, nine years of that with one employer until the restaurant shut down.The pre-sentence report reflects input from Mr. Bao's wife and several of his friends and co-workers, some who have known him for several years, others who have known him for a decade.They speak uniformly of Mr. Bao as a good, kind and generous person and they likewise see this offence as out of character for him.He himself said his greatest flaw is a tendency to trust others too much.Whether that tendency in any way underlies the situation he finds himself in now, I do not know.6)Mr. Bao has a criminal record, which is very dated.In November, 2007 he was sentenced to a twenty-month conditional sentence order and three years' probation for break and enter, possessing burglary tools and possession of marihuana.Three months later he was sentenced to twenty-five days in jail for obstructing a peace officer.Although the dates are not entirely clear on the pre‑sentence report, it appears that Mr. Bao was placed on a non-reporting status around halfway through his probation order.7)There are also some factors about this case that are relevant to the issue of sentence but are less easily discernible.For example, the question of Mr. Bao's role is unresolved.I have found beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the driver of the van.From the evidence at trial, it would appear that he was not alone in the van.It goes without saying that there is typically a variety of actors in any marihuana production and trafficking organization, ranging from those at the top of the ladder down to the gardeners who know the least and profit the least.Suffice to say that there was no evidence before me to define Mr. Bao's role and I must give him the benefit of the doubt.All I can conclude with respect to his role is that he was driving a van that contained a “lot” of marihuana and that he knew it was there and exercised some measure of control over it.8)Which brings me to the other relevant factor that is not particularly well defined in this case, the issue of precisely how much marihuana constituted that \"lot\" of marihuana in the back of the van.The evidence before me was that the marihuana weighed one-hundred-and-sixty-nine pounds.However, that weight must be qualified by two factors.To begin with, the evidence of the first officer on scene suggested that the marihuana was relatively fresh looking.One of the drug officers agreed that some of the marihuana's weight would be lost in drying, but felt unqualified to say what percentage of the weight would be lost that way.Judicial experience would suggest that the drying process can result in harvested marihuana losing about three-quarters of its weight.9)It is also unclear how much usable marihuana there would have been even after the seized marihuana had dried fully.Sergeant Sills described the marihuana as trimmed but not fully processed, one stage away from marketable end product.However, he was not asked what percentage of the total marihuana seized would be lost in moving from the state it was in to its marketable state.10)I note that no detailed or appropriately qualified evidence was called on either issue at trial (Mr. Anger was not the prosecutor at trial), so the Crown is left making sentencing submissions in a drug case in which the Crown cannot refer to a reliable quantity of marihuana.Mr. Anger, to his credit, did not belabour that point; to the contrary, he highlighted it.In the vernacular, it is what it is.As a result, however, I can at best say confidently that the van Mr. Bao was driving contained a \"lot\" of marihuana.That could have translated to forty pounds of marketable marihuana.Perhaps less.Or more.I cannot be satisfied of any precise amount beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the standard required for any aggravating fact on sentencing.\"A lot\" is about as precise as one can get.11)Sentencing is more art than science.Unlike arithmetic, sentencing deliberations do not lead to a single, \"correct\" answer, just (one hopes) to a sentence that is within the appropriate range in light of all of the factors specific to the offender and the offence (although sentence deliberations can lead to an incorrect answer, i.e. one that is outside the range, even taking into account all factors specific to the case).I was referred to various cases by Mr. Anger and Ms. Macchia.For example, Mr. Anger referred to the Court of Appeal's endorsement in R. v. Hoang, 2013 ONCA 430 (CanLII), where the court rejected Mr. Hoang's request that a sentence of nine months in jail be converted to a conditional sentence of equal length for twenty-six pounds of \"raw marihuana\" (which is itself an imprecise term insofar as it does not disclose whether the marihuana was just bud or included other parts of the plant).[2] That decision does not help much because it focuses specifically on the issue of a conditional sentence versus a sentence of real jail, the actual length of the sentence not being in dispute before the Court of Appeal.The Hoang decision is also unhelpful as a barometer because it cites Mr. Hoang's \"antecedents\" as one of the principal drivers of sentence in that case, without defining what those antecedents were.All we know about Mr. Hoang is that he had twenty-six pounds of marihuana in his car; we know nothing about his role.It is inherent in the nature of an appellate endorsement that it will often be somewhat spare on details.12)I do not propose to recite the numerous cases put before me in these reasons because I think that those cases do not establish a determinative range of sentence for the present case in the sense that they would clearly demonstrate that either Mr. Anger or Ms. Macchia was wrong in their submissions.The factual variances of offender and offence that arise in “possession for the purpose” of marihuana cases are such that any \"range\" would necessarily be extremely broad, and that is before the evidentiary problems with respect to quantity that exist in this case.13)I was presented with a letter from an immigration lawyer with respect to Mr. Bao's status in Canada and the enormous jeopardy that status creates for him.Mr. Bao has been a permanent resident of Canada for twelve years.His previous criminal convictions resulted in a removal order being made against him.On appeal, the removal order was stayed for four years and then cancelled in 2013.A conviction for the present offence is likely to result in Mr. Bao being \"written up\" as inadmissible to Canada for serious criminality and is likely to result in a removal order.If he receives a sentence of six months' actual imprisonment or longer, he will have no right to appeal any removal order, despite his long residence in Canada and the presence here of his wife, children, parents and three sisters.14)The law has long been clear that the existence of collateral immigration consequences is a relevant consideration on sentence, but any such consequences cannot justify imposing a sentence that is outside the appropriate range of sentence:R. v. Pham, 2013 SCC 15 (CanLII).A sentencing judge should not distort an appropriate sentence in order to circumvent Parliament's choices with respect to the admissibility and removal of permanent residents or visitors from Canada.Judges must respect the choices Parliament makes even if those choices may seem harsh or may result in harsh outcomes in particular cases.It is only if Parliament's legislative choices violate constitutional standards that judges will be entitled to disregard them.The validity of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act provisions concerning removal of permanent residents and rights of appeal from removal orders were not in issue before me.15)The Criminal Code calls for sentences that deter offenders and others, that denounce criminal behaviour as unacceptable, that seek to rehabilitate offenders and that enable offenders to make amends for the effect of their crimes on their society.These objectives are often difficult to reconcile.Optimizing the achievement of those disparate objectives may call for a combination of different sentencing options.The Code says that jail should be used as a sentencing tool only when necessary and only to the extent necessary.I think it can safely be said that deterrence and denunciation are prominent considerations when sentencing for offences related to trafficking in controlled substances.This is also true of cannabis, even though cannabis has come to be recognized as being at the lower end of seriousness among the various substances controlled by the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.16)There has been much debate over the past several years and beyond about whether cannabis should be decriminalized or even legalized.That debate has taken place in Canada and elsewhere.There is legislation pending before the Senate of Canada, having received third reading in the House of Commons at the end of November, 2017.That legislation would permit adults to purchase limited amounts of cannabis products from regulated entities for recreational use, expanding lawful marihuana availability well beyond the scope of medical marihuana availability.It is expected that the legislation will become law in the summer of 2018, although neither the date nor even the outcome is necessarily written in stone.17)Mr. Anger argued forcefully that in deciding upon the appropriate sentence for Mr. Bao, I should not take into account the possible, or even likely change in the law concerning marihuana in this country.In making that argument, Mr. Anger is in good company.He cites the observations of Woollcombe, J. in R. v. Strong, 2017 ONSC 3163 (CanLII), and of Trotter, J. (as he then was), in R. v. Tran, 2016 ONSC 3225 (CanLII).Those decisions, and the decision of the Court of Appeal in R. v. Song, 2009 ONCA 896 (CanLII), make it clear, in the words of Trotter, J., at paragraph 26 of Tran, supra, that, \"members of the public are not free to select which laws they wish to obey, even with the prospect of reform on the horizon.\"Indeed, Mr. Bao committed his offence under a federal government that took an ever-more-strict approach to street drugs; it was not until some months after his offence that the government that now proposes a dramatically different approach to cannabis was elected and two years have passed since that date.It also bears noting that one of the express rationales for changing the way in which cannabis is regulated in Canada is to deprive criminal organizations of the massive revenue streams they have derived over the years from cannabis sales.However limited his role may have been, Mr. Bao was a participant in that very activity of criminal accumulation of wealth.18)It seems clear, therefore, that Mr. Bao must be sentenced in light of the law as it is, not the law as it might be, which looming law would arguably convert the regulation of cannabis in Canada from a purely criminal law model to a model with many of the characteristics of alcohol and tobacco regulation.At the same time, the sentence imposed on him must, like any sentence, take into account the social mores of the time when he is sentenced.Canadian society has come a tremendous distance from the hysterical and fear-mongering outlook towards cannabis characterized by films such as Reefer Madnessin the 1930s (and criminal law policies that were not much more rational than that film), to a more nuanced view that, while cannabis use presents some very real dangers, especially for some groups such as young people, it also has rather benign uses no worse than alcohol, as well as some medically advantageous uses, including uses that could be much safer than society's over-reliance on prescribed opioids for pain relief, the effects of which this court sees daily.Recognizing those social realities in determining an appropriate sentence, like recognizing any social reality that changes over time in imposing sentence, is qualitatively different than calling in aid a legislative change that has not taken place, even if it may lead some distance down the same path in determining sentence.[3]19)As I have noted, even with the looming advent of fundamental change in the regulation of cannabis, Mr. Bao's offence must be punished with a primary view to denunciation and deterrence.The need for denunciation and deterrence justifies the imposition of a jail sentence, but does not necessarily call for a jail sentence in the range called for by the Crown, even where \"a lot\" of marihuana is involved as is the case here.Wherever possible, a \"just\" sentence as mandated by s. 718 of the Criminal Code, will aim to achieve as many of the objectives of sentencing as are relevant on the facts of a particular case.I am satisfied that Mr. Bao is principally pro-social in his nature and is a good candidate for rehabilitation.It is in his interest, his family's interest and also society's interest, that he continue to be a contributing member of society, following the track record he established in this country for the past decade and in China as a teenager.To that end, ninety days of jail to be served intermittently would satisfy the need for incarceration as a primary expression of denunciation and deterrence. The pre-sentence report makes it clear that Mr. Bao would be a suitable candidate for community service, which would allow him to pay society back as part of his overall sentence.20)An increased victim surcharge would also serve society's interests and would reflect the fact that cannabis trafficking is a profit-driven venture, no matter what role the offender plays or how much he profits from it.Increasing the victim surcharge on this type of offence is also rationally connected to the objectives of the surcharge.As I have noted, whatever beneficial or benign value cannabis may have, it seems well-recognized that it can cause significant and even permanent damage when used by teenagers.[4]An unregulated cannabis market such as the one Mr. Bao played a role in, is not likely to concern itself with the age of its customers.Anyone who presides in a criminal or youth court knows that it is disturbingly common to read in pre-sentence reports that an offender has started consuming marihuana very early on, which can be one of the factors in the offender's path into criminality, leaving a variety of victims in that offender's and the trafficker's wake.“The evil that men do lives after them.”Based on what I have heard during submissions, I am satisfied that Mr. Bao has the capacity to pay an enhanced victim surcharge.I do not doubt that it would sting, but that is part of the point.21)All of those elements put together strike me as constituting a sentence that is within the appropriate range of sentence for this offender and this offence.The removal of any one of them would, in my opinion, render the sentence unfit. Accordingly, the sentence I impose on Mr. Bao is as follows:(1)ninety days' imprisonment to be served intermittently(2)three years of probation, starting today, on the following terms:(a)report to the jail on time, sober and not in possession of or under the influence of controlled substances;(b)report to probation within seven days from today and thereafter as required by probation;(c)Mr. Bao's obligation to report to probation will end when he (i) has completed all of his community service hours to the satisfaction of probation, and (ii) has satisfied probation that he has paid the victim surcharge in full;(d)make reasonable efforts to obtain/maintain suitable employment;(e)perform two hundred and forty hours of community service during the first eighteen months of the probation order, at a placement and on a schedule to be approved by the probation officer;(f)sign releases and provide proof of compliance to allow the probation officer to monitor compliance with the terms of this order;(g)starting in the second quarter of 2018, make payments of not less than $600 towards the victim surcharge every calendar quarter (January to March, April to June, July to September, October to December) and provide proof of payment to the probation officer.22)There shall be an increased victim surcharge of $5,000.23)There shall be a weapons prohibition under s. 109(2)(a) of the Criminal Code for ten years from the completion of Mr. Bao's intermittent sentence and under s. 109(2)(b) for life.24)The offence of possession of cannabis for the purpose of trafficking is an enumerated secondary designated offence for the purpose of the DNA provisions of the Criminal Code.As a result, I am required to balance Mr. Bao's privacy interest in his DNA, which is not trivial, against the public interest in the DNA data bank, which is compelling.Although Mr. Bao's previous offences are quite dated, they are not themselves trivial and the current offence reflects involvement in profit-driven criminality.All things considered I am satisfied that, applying the analysis set out by the Court of Appeal in cases such as R. v. F. (P.R.), 2001 CanLII 21168 (ON CA), 2001 CanLII 21168, Mr. Bao's privacy interest must yield to the public interest and I order that he provide a sample of his DNA for inclusion in the DNA data bank.25)I recommend and request that the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services allow Mr. Bao to serve his intermittent sentence at the Toronto South Detention Centre given that he lives in Scarborough.RELEASED:2 March, 2018[1] These reasons (but not the footnotes) were read in court on 2 March, 2018 and a copy was provided to the parties.The reasons as read in court vary slightly, but not materially from the written reasons.The variances affected only sentence structure and not substance and were made in order to facilitate the interpretation by the use of shorter sentences than some of those that appear in this document.[2] A conditional sentence was an available option at the time of Mr. Hoang's offence; it is not now.[3] A more interesting sentencing debate may come if the current legislation becomes law, which seems likely.Alcohol and tobacco have long inflicted carnage on the health and lives of Canadians.The background materials to the pending legalization bill suggest that alcohol and tobacco have done much more harm to humans than cannabis.If the marketing and regulation model adopted by Parliament and the legislatures treats marihuana similarly to alcohol and tobacco, with sales limited to licensed vendors, limitations on advertising, limitations on sales to minors and so on, and if the relative societal dangers of the three commodities are the same (or if the net societal dangers of cannabis are less than alcohol or tobacco), would a sentencing regime for violating the cannabis regulatory model that differs dramatically from the sentencing regime for violating the alcohol or tobacco regulatory models violate the principle of proportionality, which is a cardinal principle of sentencing and one which enjoys constitutional status?Or would such an argument impinge on Parliament’s right, perhaps obligation, not to repeat the enshrined mistakes of previous generations in relation to insufficient regulation of alcohol and tobacco?That, however, is an issue for another day, perhaps never.[4] Unlike many of the scenarios in Reefer Madness, the potential for marihuana consumption by teenagers to compromise brain development is science rather than science fiction.See, for example:A Framework for the Legalization and Regulation of Cannabis in Canada, The Final Report of the Task Force on Cannabis Legalization and Regulation, 30 November, 2016."}

L. M.K. HumphriesFor the CrownK. HealyFor the Young PersonMay 26, 2005S. P. Whelan, PCJSENTENCING REASONSIntroduction[1]In R. v. J.L.M. 2004 SKPC 117 (CanLII), I found this young person guilty of robbery, contrary to section 344(b) of the Code (Information #32777581). The robbery was based upon a threat rather than an overt act of violence. The Crown asked that I find this to be a violent offence within the meaning of s.39(1)(a) of theYouth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) or that her history of findings of guilt disclosed a pattern as contemplated in s.39(1)(c) of the YCJA and that I impose a custodial sentence. Initially the Crown sought a sentence of 6 months open custody and supervision followed by probation. It later softened its position, requesting deferred custody and supervision.[2]Before I was able to proceed with the sentencing of this and other matters, J.L.M. entered guilty pleas and I heard submissions with respect to further offences, including an assault charge. This had implications for my reasoning with respect to the earlier submissions, however I was persuaded that sentence should not be postponed, especially given that the Crown was favourably impressed with reports of her current circumstances and suggested a sentence that would allow her to remain in the community. I agreed to provide my reasons at a later date.[3]A custodial sentence was permissible having regard to 39(1)(c). While I wassatisfied that there was history that indicated a pattern of findings of guilt, I was not satisfied that the robbery and assault charges were violent offences as contemplated by 39(1)(a) of the YCJA. I carefully considered the precedents to date as to the grounds for custody, noting that two key decisions concerning the meaning of a “violent offence”, R. v. C.D. and R. v. C.D.K., have been reserved for decision by the Supreme Court of Canada. My decision as to the grounds and the appropriate sentence was determined in part by the insufficiency of the background information presented at the sentencing hearing.[4]I chose to impose a sentence of 18 months probation, concurrent on all offences,on conditions outlined below. I exercised my discretion and ordered that samples be provided for DNA analysis. A mandatory 2 yr firearms prohibition was imposed pursuant to s.51(2) of the YCJA.[5]J.L.M. plead guilty to:Inf #40485351, June 6 - July 15/03- failure to comply with probation; alcohol/drug assessment - 137 YCJA- failure to comply with probation; reporting - 137 YCJA- failure to comply with probation; attend school programming - 137 YCJAInf #37203671, Aug 7/03- breach of undertaking; fail to attend court - 145(2)(a) CCCInf #32777581, Sept 6/03- robbery - 344(b) CCC- obstruct peace officer; a false name - 129(a) CCC- failure to comply with probation; keep the peace - 137 YCJAInf #43391794, April 3/04- breach of undertaking; curfew - 145(3) CCCInf #39662184, May 20/04- assault- 266 CCC- mischief - 430(4) CCCInf #39690660, June 15 - 24/04- breach of undertaking; reporting - 145(3) CCCInf #43722197, July 31/04- breach of undertaking; abstention - 145(3) CCCIssues[6]These issues are addressed:a) When the Crown seeks a custodial sentence is it required to;i) give notice that it will rely upon a provision of s.39(1) and seek a custodial sentence?ii) establish beyond a reasonable doubt that one of the criteria in s.39(1) has been met?b) May I impose a custodial sentence having regard to the criteria in s. 39(1) and in particular:i) has J.L.M. committed a violent offence within the meaning of s.39(1)(a) of the YCJA?ii) has J.L.M. committed an indictable offence for which an adult would be liable to imprisonment for a term of more than two years and does she have a history that indicates a pattern of findings of guilt within the meaning of s.39(1)(c) of the YCJA?c) How should J.L.M.’s experience as an Aboriginal person be addressed for sentencing purposes?d) How was sentence determined?Facts pertaining to the principal chargesThe robbery - Sept 6/03 (Inf #32777581)[7]In my decision on the trial of this matter I made these findings of fact, at paragraph 24:“[24] .. .These are the circumstances that I found existed:- N.S., likely age 13 and C.S., likely age 12 and a third friend, K.L., age unknown, were walking on a residential street.- It was late at night and dark.- There was seemingly no one else around.- J.L.M. was with a group of 5 to 7 other girls.- The group of girls were strangers to N.S. and her two companions.- The group called after N.S. and her companions from the steps of a house and asked them to come over to see them.- N.S. and her friends kept on walking. The group followed them and they kept walking. Even after her friends stopped, N.S. kept on walking until she wasapproached by J.L.M. ashort distance away.- J.L.M. asked for a necklace on the person of N.S., while stating words to the effect: “Why are you running? . . . I’m not going to beat you up.”- N.S. handed over the necklace and said she did so because she was scared and feared being beaten up.[25]I found that the Crown proved beyond a reasonable doubt, that J.L.M. participated in and was aware of the intimidating nature of these circumstances and took advantage of these circumstances so as to obtain property that would not have been given freely. Her actions were evident in the circumstances enumerated above. Her knowledge and intent were evident from her statements to the Complainant. She asked her why she was running. Hence she knew that the Complainant was fearful. She said that she wouldn’t beat up the Complainant. A reasonable personcould infer from all of the circumstances, just as N.S. did, the unspoken condition to this statement: “if you give me your necklace”. A reasonable person would have found these circumstances to contain a threat of violence.[26]No evidence was offered for the Court to consider that the Accused young person might have had any other perception of these circumstances. The words spoken to the Complainant, coupled with the pursuit of the three young girls, by strangers, including the Accused among a larger group of girls, at 11:00 at night, was intimidating and carried with it a threat of violence. I found that J.L.M. took advantage of those circumstances in order to effect a robbery upon N.S. She knew the circumstances would create fear in the mind of N.S. and intended that this would induce her to part with her property.”The assault and mischief- May 20/04 (Inf #39662184)[8]This incident was described by the complainant as an attempted robbery. J.L.M. jumped into the complainant’s truck and tried to take it and demanded money. She punched the complainant and made statements to obtain his cooperation, including that a gang was watching and that she had something in her pocket for him. The complainant pushed her and she hit him a second time before he threw her out of his truck. She displayed symptoms of extreme intoxication. When the police arrested her she was uncooperative and incoherent.Background information pertaining to J.L.M.[9]This is the record provided to the Court:2002-04-11(1) robbery - 344(b) x 2(1-5) 12 mos secure \u0026 3 mos open(2) assault - 266\u0026 1 yr probation,concurrent \u0026 s.109(3) procuring - 212(1)(d)prohibition(4) uttering threats -264.1(1)(b)(5) procuring - 212(1)(a)(6) assault - 266 x 2(6-8) time served(7) breach of recognizance145(3) x 4(8) fail to attend court - 145(2)(a)2003-01-22On review the remainder of custody and probation varied to 12 mos probation2003-05-29fail to comply - 137 YCJAtime servedIn light of the record and there having been only one prior non-custodial sentence, it was agreed that s.39(1)(b) of the YCJA would not permit imposition of a custodial sentence.[10]The Court has had the benefit of these reports and assessments:- November 26, 2001 psychological assessment - Mr. C. Schwartz, M.Ed., Mr. G. Perry, M.A.- December 10, 2001 psychological assessment - Mr. C. Schwartz, M.Ed., Mr. G. Perry, M.A.- January 18, 2002 PFAS diagnosis - Dr. M. Blakley- March 9, 2002 neuropsychological assessment - Dr. Jo Nanson- May 30, 2003 psychological assessment - Dr. M. Zaharia and Mr. G. Perry, M.A.- March 12, 2005 neuropsychological assessment - Dr. Jo Nanson[11]As a result of a Court ordered assessment, J.L.M. was diagnosed with Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (PFAS) in 2002, at age 15. She is now17 years of age (DOB Nov 16/87). In the report, provided to the Court and the Provincial Director, Dr. Patricia Blakley stated:“. . . It is important to recognize that the degree of disability can be as significant for youths with Partial FAS as those with full FAS.”More particularly with respect to J.L.M. she concluded:“Ms. M is a youth at risk for continued involvement with the Criminal Justice System. She lacks insight into her difficulties. She would benefit from the development of an educational program, which would take into account her weak verbal skills relative to her non-verbal skills. Efforts should be made to reintegrate into an educational setting with whatever supports are required to assist her with attendance. She would also benefit from drug and alcohol counselling, as she failed to recognize the difficulties associated with drug use. She would also benefit from anger management counselling as she certainly has a history of exposure to violence and she has already engaged in violence oriented criminal activity.”[12]J.L.M. was assessed by Mr. G.P. Perry, a psychologist, prior to her PFAS diagnosis in a report dated December 10, 2001 and subsequently in a report dated May 30, 2003. As well we have the Court ordered March 2002 and March 2005 reports ofDr. Jo Nanson, a neuropsychologist with recognized expertise in assessing persons suffering from FASD.[13]Dr. Nanson wrote of J.L.M in the March 9, 2002 report.:“ABILITY. . .There was a significant difference between her verbal scores, which were in the mildly mentally handicapped range, and her non-verbal scores, which were low average. . .. . . her vocabulary and general knowledge are exceptionally weak.ACHIEVEMENT. . .J.’s scores for reading and spelling were within normal limits for her age and slightly above the level predicted by her IQ. In contrast her arithmetic scores were significantly weaker, falling at a grade four level. . .ATTENTION. . . J.’s scores were well outside normal limits, indicating very significant difficulties with attention. . .. . . her reading comprehension fell at a grade 4.4 level, which is well below the level predicted by her age. . .MEMORY. . . Thus she appears to have a significant, independent deficit in verbal learning, over and above her borderline IQ.EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING. . . She showed a good deal of inflexibility and was unable to modify her behaviour in response to feedback.SUMMARY. . . She presently functions in the borderline range with deficits in attention, verbal memory and executive functioning. She was very cooperative and meticulous during this assessment, unlike her previous test performance.”[14]It is worthy to note that the psychological assessment dated December 10, 2001, undertaken before the PFAS diagnosis, attributed her poor verbal skills to poor school attendance:“Intellectual testing shows that J. has well developed intellectual capabilities that are in the average range and perhaps even high average on the tasks that are non-verbal in nature. However, her intellectual abilities fall well below average on tasks that require verbal skills. This profile of scores is consistent with youth who have intellectual abilities in the average range but lack vocabulary and linguistic skills that are retained through regular school attendance. Her lack of meaningful schooling in the past two years is likely responsible for her poor verbal intellectual scores.”[15]Dr. Blakley reported in January2002 that, according to J.L.M., she had repeated Grade 1 and received no extra support in school.[16]In Mr. Perry’s May 30, 2003 report, he documented the testing performed by him and Mr. Schwartz for the December 10, 2001 report:“. . . J. had much stronger nonverbal (73rd percentile; high end of average range) versus verbal skills (7th percentile; borderline range). . .”Mr. Perry reported further the results of tests performed in May 2003:“Cognitive:. . . Overall, J’s performance on the WASI was within the Low Average range, or at approximately the 16th percentile. She exhibited a significant discrepancy between her verbal and non-verbal skills, which fell within the Borderline and Average ranges, or at approximately the 5th and 45th percentile respectively.”Personality and Emotional Functioning.. . Of note is that J. obtained elevated scores within the severe and the moderate clinical symptom ranges in areas of psychosocial difficulties related to substance use and substance abuse, respectively. . . . J. obtained elevated scores within the moderate clinical symptom range in the areas of conduct (e.g., lying frequently, truancy, being in trouble with the police, etc.), externalizing (e.g., acting-out behaviors) and aggressive behavior (e.g., wanting to hurt others, bullying, and not empathising with those hurt). Finally, J. endorsed symptoms within the mild clinical range in the areas of attention, difficulties coping with stress anger and controlling her behaviour.”[17]The 2003 Perry report made 4 recommendations concerning academic issues, one of which pertained to her need to feel successful:“3. As J. becomes anxious when she perceives failure and benefits from positive feedback from others, she may benefit from teachers who exhibit understanding about her comprehension difficulties and who consistently reward her (e.g. provide praise and encouragement) when she perseveres and is successful.[18]Mr. Perry discussed Risk of Future Violent Behaviour:“Based on information gained from available documentation, clinical interviews, consultations with Ms. Felske, and current psychometric data, J.’s risk for future violent behaviour is considered to be moderate, and possibly high when involved in substance abuse. . . It is suggested that J.’s active involvement in substance abuse and violence-specific programming could reduce her risk of engaging in future violent behaviour.”[19]The pre-sentence report, dated December 6, 2004, recommended a probationary sentence. It advised that J.L.M. was intoxicated at the time of the robbery and that some of the events were “a blur”. It focussed on the risk assessment tool, making very little use of the previous reports of Blakley, Nanson and Perry, and made no recommendations having regard to the diagnosis of PFAS. Rather the report suggested that there be additional assessments pertaining to academic ability and addictions.[20]It is difficult to understand how a risk assessment could be conducted at the instance of the provincial director as part of the pre-sentence report process without greater attention being given to the diagnosis of Partial Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (PFAS), given the implications for behaviour and supervision.In R. v. W.A.L.D.(1)[2004] S.J. No. 120, 2004 SKPC 40 (CanLII) at paragraph 40, I discussed the research of Dr. Ann Streissguth and the significance to the individual of a diagnosis in the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Spectrum:“¶ 40Dr. Ann Streissguth and her colleagues conducted research on Secondary Disabilities, experienced by persons diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effect (FAE). It is important to share some of the conclusions from that research obtained from: Streissguth, A.P., Barr, H.M., Kogan, J. \u0026 Bookstein, F. L., \"Understanding the Occurrence of Secondary Disabilities in Clients with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE),\" Final Report to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), August, 1996, Seattle: University of Washington, Fetal Alcohol \u0026 Drug Unit, Tech. Rep. No. 96‑06, (1996). FAS Community Resource Center, (http://come‑over.to/FASCRC/).¶ 41Primary Disabilities refer to the brain damage caused by ingestion of alcohol during pregnancy that results in the permanent impaired mental function of persons with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). The following information concerning Secondary Disabilities is taken from the Report, above:\"Secondary Disabilities are those not present at birth but occur as a result of the primary disabilities. Secondary disabilities can presumably be prevented or lessened by better understanding and appropriate interventions. Six main categories of disabilities were defined:* Mental Health Problems, the most prevalent secondary disability, experienced by 94% of the full sample. During childhood, 60% of children with FASD have ADHD. During adulthood, most adults with FASD have clinical depression. The study revealed that 23% of the adults had attempted suicide, and 43% had threatened to commit suicide.* Disrupted School Experience (suspension or expulsion or drop out), was experienced by 43% of children of school age. By the time students with FAE reach adulthood, the rate of disrupted school experience peaks at 70%. Common school problems include: not paying attention; incomplete homework; can't get along with peers; disruptive in class; disobeying school rules; talking back to the teacher; fighting; and truancy.* Trouble with the Law (involvement with police, charged or convicted of crime), was experienced by 42% of those in the study, and by about 60% of those age 12 and over. The most common first criminal behavior reported was shoplifting. The most common crimes committed (by almost half of individuals with FASD age 12‑20) were crimes against persons (theft, burglary, assault, murder, domestic violence, child molestation, running away), followed by property damage; possession/selling; sexual assault; and vehicular crimes.* Confinement (inpatient treatment for mental health, alcohol/drug problems, or incarceration for crime), experienced by 60% of those age 12 and over. Over 40% of adults with FASD had been incarcerated; about 30% of adults with FASD were confined to a mental institution; and about 20% had been confined for substance abuse treatment.* Inappropriate Sexual Behavior was reported in 45% of the those age 12 and over, and 65% of adult males with FAE. This includes only sexual behaviors that had been repeatedly problematic or for which the individual had been incarcerated or treated. It is thought that the actual incidence of inappropriate sexual behavior is much higher, and not always reported by the individual or the family due to embarrassment or fear of being reported to authorities. Problem sexual behaviors most common with FASD include: sexual advances; sexual touching; promiscuity; exposure; compulsions; voyeurism; masturbation in public; incest; sex with animals; and obscene phone calls.* Alcohol/Drug Problems were experienced by 30% of individuals age 12 and over. Of the adults with FAE, 53% of males and 70% of females experienced substance abuse problems. This is more than 5 times that of the general population.To determine levels of independence in adulthood, two additional categories were identified for individuals 21 years of age and older (median age 26):* Dependent Living was the situation for about 80% of adults with FASD.* Problems with Employment were indicated in 80% of adults with FASD.Only 8% of the individuals in the study had no problem with independent living or employment.Problems With Parenting: Of the 100 females of childbearing age, 30 had given birth; 40% drank during pregnancy, more than half no longer had the child in their care. Of their children, 30% have been diagnosed with or suspected of having FASD.Risk Factors:The greatest risk factors associated with secondary disabilities in FAS/FAE are shown by the studies to be:* IQ over 70 (those with lower IQ's are likely to get more services and intervention) This means that individuals with FAE are at greater risk than those with FAS.* Exposure to violence (sexual and/or physical abuse), which occurs at rate of 72% of individuals with FASD. Those exposed to violence are four times as likely to exhibit inappropriate sexual behavior.Protective Factors:* Early diagnosis is a universal protective indicator for all secondary disabilities. Only 11% of individuals with FASD were diagnosed by age 6. Every effort must be made to attain early diagnoses for children with FAS and FAE.* Eligibility for services from DD division of state is another strong protective factor. These services are needed by most individuals with FASD, yet most do not qualify.* Living in stable home with nurturing parents and minimum of changes in household.* Protection from violence, from witnessing or being victimized by violence.”[21]J.L.M. was diagnosed with PFAS at a time when it would seem that she had already acquired many of the secondary disabilities enumerated above including: disrupted school experience, trouble with the law, confinement, and alcohol and drug problems.[22]The pre-sentence report expressed concern for J.L.M. under Emotional Stability:“J. estimates she becomes depressed approximately 2 or 3 times a month. . .J. disclosed she has participated in self-harm behaviour. When J. was incarcerated, she did cut her forearms “to get rid of the anger and depression”. . .. . . J. indicated she “kind of” has an anger problem. . .”[23]While the pre-sentence report remarked that she was disciplined on 6 occasions while incarcerated, her previous 15 month custodial sentence was reviewed after 9 ½ months, and changed to probation. The author of the report remarked under Summary of Results:“J. was a very challenging youth to interview. She presented herself as a shy individual and often responded to questions with “I don’t know”. J. required coaxing to expand on her responses. At times, J. seemed unable to find the words to describe what she was attempting to say. Despite this, J. was co-operative throughout the interview process and answered questions to the best of her ability.”[24]The pre-sentence report documented the positive comments of J.L.M.’s high school principal, Cole Kirby:“Despite all of these issues, Cole Kirby, principal at City Park Collegiate, spoke positively about J. Mr. Kirby explained that he had known J. for approximately 3 years and she has “completely changed”. He believes J. has really grown and matured in the time he has known her. He indicated J. is now a very polite, respectful and courteous individual. He added, “this is the best she’s been in a while.” Mr. Kirby was optimistic that J. could prove to be successful in school if she had the support and encouragement to guide her.. . “[25]On page 11, the youth worker made 5 recommendations, including:“5. Encouragement, guidance and support from her Youth Worker to maintaininvolvement in the above resources will result in J.’s antisocial behaviour indicators reducing.”This approach is consistent with the recommendations of Mr. Perry in his May 30, 2003 report at page 8 under ACADEMIC ISSUES: SUMMARY \u0026 RECOMMENDATIONS:“. . . Present observations and psychometric data indicate that she benefits from establishing rapport with adults she works with, is provided with positive encouragement when confronted with academic material she finds difficult. She also requires a school placement that monitors and provides consistent consequences for lack of attendance and any aggressive behaviour toward peers.”[26]The pre-sentence report discussed J.L.M.’s Family Circumstances and Parenting. The author questioned “if the rules and expectations in the home are enforced in a manner to actually teach and guide the children”. She remarked that in the past, “J.’s mother has had difficulty maintaining consistent structure and supervision within the home and applying appropriate consequences.”Elsewhere in the report under Strength Areas, reference was made to J.L.M.’s boyfriend being released from the Saskatoon Correctional Centre.The majority of J.L.M.’s friends are pro-social and her mother considers her boyfriend to be a good influence.[27]Dr. Nanson’s March 12, 2005 report provided more current insight into J.L.M.’s functioning. I noted the following:“OBSERVATIONS OF BEHAVIOUR. . .J. has a very long processing time. She seemed to take an extraordinarily long time to process information and to formulate her replies. When she did reply, she gave very short answers.. . .J. reports that she is very upset with her parents. She reports that her mother has a new boyfriend . . . J. appears quite upset by her mother’s interest in the new boyfriend and subsequent lack of attention being given to J. and her brothers.J. is also upset that her father has his own family and does not appear to be interested in her.. . . J. acknowledges that drinking is a significant problem in her life and she would like to get help for her alcohol use. She acknowledges that her relationship with her boyfriend is quite violent and that, yesterday, he gave her a bloody nose when he punched her. She reports that she also punches him. He is three years older than she is.ABILITY/COGNITIONOn the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale: Third Edition J. received a full-scale score which places her functioning within the borderline or slow learner range. Fewer than 2 in 100 individuals would have similar or lower scores. . .ATTENTION. . . J. did well with the simpler measures of attention. However; her performance fell within the significantly impaired range on the more complex measures of sustained attention and the capacity to shift attention across stimuli. . .MEMORYVerbal memory. . .On the verbal portions of the Wechsler Memory Scale: Third Edition J. had a great deal of difficulty with the auditory verbal tasks. This measure requires her to learn more complex verbal material such as stories and pairs of unrelated words. Her performance on these verbal memory tasks fell in the severely impaired range. Thus as the task complexity increases, J.’s capacity to remember verbal material fails. . .Visual memoryOn the visual portions of the Wechsler Memory Scale her short-term visual memory fell within normal limits whereas her long-term visual memory fell in the moderately impaired range.EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING. . .On the verbal executive functioning measures J. had considerably more difficulty. Herperformance on the controlled one word association task and the animal naming test both fell in the moderately impaired range. . .RECEPTIVE AND EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE. . . Her scores on measures of both receptive and expressive language both for oral communication fell well below the level for her age and suggest that her functioning in these areas falls between 2 and 3 standard deviations below the mean for her age.”[28]On April 14th defence counsel spoke to the Gladue factors. The author of the pre-sentence report relied upon the information provided by J.L.M., who did not believe that the Gladue factors were pertinent to her. Counsel took the view that the young person was not the best source in assessing the impact upon her life. I agree with counsel, that there was not sufficient exploration of this question in the report. J.L.M.’s experience as an Aboriginal young person is important to sentencing under the YCJA and as such should have been more fully canvassed in the report. Her counsel advised that she is Métis and her family comes from the Meadow Lake area. He maintained that she has been disadvantaged in ways that are attributable to her Aboriginal heritage. She has suffered disconnection from her immediate and extended family, inconsistent parenting, alternative residential care, depression and self harm behaviours, and she has been diagnosed with PFAS; as already discussed she has acquired a host of secondary disabilities associated with this diagnosis at a late age.[29]On April 14th the Court was advised that J.L.M. was doing extremely well under the supervision of her youth worker. She was engaged in a number of programs and was being closely monitored. The Crown acknowledged that there was some value in keeping her in the community.[30]It was evident from the circumstances of the substantive and system charges as well as the reports and assessments provided to the Court that substance abuse is a very significant factor in her offending behaviour. While her insight into the extent of her problem is poor, she was amenable to participating in addictions programming. Oddly, an assessment completed in January 2003 indicated that she did not have an addiction problem. Mr. Perry commented on the severity of her use and abuse of substances in his May 2003 report.Reasoning[31]There are a number of provisions in the YCJA which are pertinent to the several issues to be discussed. Section 3 establishes the principles governing all decisions made under the YCJA.3. (1) The following principles apply in this Act:(a) the youth criminal justice system is intended to(i) prevent crime by addressing the circumstances underlying a young person's offending behaviour,(ii) rehabilitate young persons who commit offences and reintegrate them into society, and(iii) ensure that a young person is subject to meaningful consequences for his or her offencein order to promote the long‑term protection of the public;(b) the criminal justice system for young persons must be separate from that of adults and emphasize the following:(i) rehabilitation and reintegration,(ii) fair and proportionate accountability that is consistent with the greater dependency of young persons and their reduced level of maturity,(iii) enhanced procedural protection to ensure that young persons are treated fairly and that their rights, including their right to privacy, are protected,(iv) timely intervention that reinforces the link between the offending behaviour and its consequences, and(v) the promptness and speed with which persons responsible for enforcing this Act must act, given young persons' perception of time;(c) within the limits of fair and proportionate accountability, the measures taken against young persons who commit offences should(i) reinforce respect for societal values,(ii) encourage the repair of harm done to victims and the community,(iii) be meaningful for the individual young person given his or her needs and level of development and, where appropriate, involve the parents, the extended family, the community and social or other agencies in the young person's rehabilitation and reintegration, and(iv) respect gender, ethnic, cultural and linguistic differences and respond to the needs of aboriginal young persons and of young persons with special requirements; and(d) special considerations apply in respect of proceedings against young persons and, in particular,(i) young persons have rights and freedoms in their own right, such as a right to be heard in the course of and to participate in the processes, other than the decision to prosecute, that lead to decisions that affect them, and young persons have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms,(ii) victims should be treated with courtesy, compassion and respect for their dignity and privacy and should suffer the minimum degree of inconvenience as a result of their involvement with the youth criminal justice system,(iii) victims should be provided with information about the proceedings and given an opportunity to participate and be heard, and(iv) parents should be informed of measures or proceedings involving their children and encouraged to support them in addressing their offending behaviour.Section 38. (2) provides the principles according to which sentence is to be imposed, including the principles applicable to the entire Act, found in s.3.38. (1) The purpose of sentencing under section 42 (youth sentences) is to hold a young person accountable for an offence through the imposition of just sanctions that have meaningful consequences for the young person and that promote his or her rehabilitation and reintegration into society, thereby contributing to the long‑term protection of the public.38(2) A youth justice court that imposes a youth sentence on a young person shall determine the sentence in accordance with the principles set out in section 3 and the following principles:(a) the sentence must not result in a punishment that is greater than the punishment that would be appropriate for an adult who has been convicted of the same offence committed in similar circumstances;(b) the sentence must be similar to the sentences imposed in the region on similar young persons found guilty of the same offence committed in similar circumstances;(c) the sentence must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the young person for that offence;(d) all available sanctions other than custody that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all young persons, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal young persons; and(e) subject to paragraph (c), the sentence must(i) be the least restrictive sentence that is capable of achieving the purpose set out in subsection (1),(ii) be the one that is most likely to rehabilitate the young person and reintegrate him or her into society, and(iii) promote a sense of responsibility in the young person, and an acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and the community.Section 38. (3) provides for the factors to be considered in determining sentence.38. (3) In determining a youth sentence, the youth justice court shall take into account(a) the degree of participation by the young person in the commission of the offence;(b) the harm done to victims and whether it was intentional or reasonably foreseeable;(c) any reparation made by the young person to the victim or the community;(d) the time spent in detention by the young person as a result of the offence;(e) the previous findings of guilt of the young person; and(f) any other aggravating and mitigating circumstances related to the young person or the offence that are relevant to the purpose and principles set out in this section.39. (1) contains a prohibition against the imposition of custody unless certain criteria are met.39. (1) A youth justice court shall not commit a young person to custody under section 42 (youth sentences) unless(a) the young person has committed a violent offence;(b) the young person has failed to comply with non‑custodial sentences;(c) the young person has committed an indictable offence for which an adult would be liable to imprisonment for a term of more than two years and has a history that indicates a pattern of findings of guilt under this Act or the Young Offenders Act, chapter Y‑1 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985; or(d) in exceptional cases where the young person has committed an indictable offence, the aggravating circumstances of the offence are such that the imposition of a non‑custodial sentence would be inconsistent with the purpose and principles set out in section 38.39. (2) and (3) call for consideration of alternatives to custody before imposing a custodial sentence.39. (2) If any of paragraphs (1)(a) to (c) apply, a youth justice court shall not impose a custodial sentence under section 42 (youth sentences) unless the court has considered all alternatives to custody raised at the sentencing hearing that are reasonable in the circumstances, and determined that there is not a reasonable alternative, or combination of alternatives, that is in accordance with the purpose and principles set out in section 38.39. (3) In determining whether there is a reasonable alternative to custody, a youth justice court shall consider submissions relating to(a) the alternatives to custody that are available;(b) the likelihood that the young person will comply with a non‑custodial sentence, taking into account his or her compliance with previous non‑custodial sentences; and(c) the alternatives to custody that have been used in respect of young persons for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.Pursuant to 39. (6), unless waived, a pre-sentence report is required before imposing a custodial sentence.39. (6) Before imposing a custodial sentence under section 42 (youth sentences), a youth justice court shall consider a pre‑sentence report and any sentencing proposal made by the young person or his or her counsel.A Court must state its reasons when imposing a custodial sentence according to 39. (9).39. (9) If a youth justice court imposes a youth sentence that includes a custodial portion, the court shall state the reasons why it has determined that a non‑custodial sentence is not adequate to achieve the purpose set out in subsection 38(1), including, if applicable, the reasons why the case is an exceptional case under paragraph (1)(d).[32]Section 50 of the YCJA provides, with exceptions, for application of the Criminal Code to matters under the YCJA. Section 606.(1.1) of the Criminal Code, contained in Part XX, sets out the responsibility of a court when accepting a plea:50. (1) Subject to section 74 (application of Criminal Code to adult sentences), Part XXIII (sentencing) of the Criminal Code does not apply in respect of proceedings under this Act except for paragraph 718.2(e) (sentencing principle for aboriginal offenders), sections 722 (victim impact statements), 722.1 (copy of statement) and 722.2 (inquiry by court), subsection 730(2) (court process continues in force) and sections 748 (pardons and remissions), 748.1 (remission by the Governor in Council) and 749 (royal prerogative) of that Act, which provisions apply with any modifications that the circumstances require.606(1.1) A court may accept a plea of guilty only if it is satisfied that the accused(a) is making the plea voluntarily; and(b) understands(i) that the plea is an admission of the essential elements of the offence,(ii) the nature and consequences of the plea, and(iii) that the court is not bound by any agreement made between the accused and the prosecutor.[33]At this stage of the discussion it is useful to set out the provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) and Criminal Code that arepertinent to the issue of whether the robbery and assault incidents are violent offences within the meaning of 39. (1) of the YCJA. Sections 343 and 344 under the Criminal Code pertain to the charge of robbery.343. Every one commits robbery who(a) steals, and for the purpose of extorting whatever is stolen or to prevent or overcome resistance to the stealing, uses violence or threats of violence to a person or property;(b) steals from any person and, at the time he steals or immediately before or immediately thereafter, wounds, beats, strikes or uses any personal violence to that person;(c) assaults any person with intent to steal from him; or(d) steals from any person while armed with an offensive weapon or imitation thereof.344. Every person who commits robbery is guilty of an indictable offence and liable(a) where a firearm is used in the commission of the offence, to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of four years; and(b) in any other case, to imprisonment for life.[34]Sections 265 and 266 in the Criminal Code pertain to the charge of assault.265. (1) A person commits an assault when(a) without the consent of another person, he applies force intentionally to that other person, directly or indirectly;(b) he attempts or threatens, by an act or a gesture, to apply force to another person, if he has, or causes that other person to believe on reasonable grounds that he has, present ability to effect his purpose; or(c) while openly wearing or carrying a weapon or an imitation thereof, he accosts or impedes another person or begs.(2) This section applies to all forms of assault, including sexual assault, sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm and aggravated sexual assault.266. Every one who commits an assault is guilty of(a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years; or(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.[35]Section 2. (1) of the YCJA defines “serious violent offence”.2. (1) The definitions in this subsection apply in this Act.\"serious violent offence\" means an offence in the commission of which a young person causes or attempts to cause serious bodily harm.[36]I’ve considered the following decisions:R. v.

C.A.).Consideration of the issuesa) When the Crown seeks a custodial sentence;i) is it required to give notice that it will rely upon a provision of s.39(1) and seek a custodial sentence?[37]This is the first of two procedural issues, raised by defence counsel, which should be discussed for their impact on submissions. While I have written previously aboutnotice prior to plea when the Crown is seeking a serious violent offence designation (see paragraphs 23 to 64 in R. v. M.W.G.2005 SKPC 5 (CanLII), 2005 SKPC 05), I have not been asked to, nor have I previously considered the question of notice under s.39. (1) of the YCJA.[38]From my examination of the YCJA, it would seem that the Crown is not required to give notice with respect to a submission for a custodial sentence, except as may be pertinent to the ordering of a pre-sentence report (s.39.(6)). As a practical matter, this issue is canvassed by the court after the plea is taken and there is an assumption that counsel will have considered this issue before entering the plea and deciding whether to proceed directly to sentencing submissions, as opposed to requesting the preparation of a pre-sentence report. It is also desirable that the Crown be prepared to specify for the court the ground(s) under s.39.(1) by which a custodial sentence may be imposed and the facts to support the request. Further, before a court may accept a plea it must be satisfied pursuant to s.606.(1.1) of the Code that the young person appreciates the consequences of the plea. A failure to appreciate that a custodial sentence may be imposed may be grounds to expunge a guilty plea.[39]Certainly 3(1)(b)(iii) and (d)(i) reinforce the importance of procedural fairness and the right to be heard and participate in the processes that lead to decisions affecting the young person. However, the provisions dealing with sentencing are noticeably lacking in any suggestion that notice be given, notwithstanding other very specific requirements and prohibitions affecting the imposition of a custodial sentence. Section 39(1) prohibits the imposition of a custodial sentence unless certain criteria are met. 39(2) requires consideration of alternatives to custody raised at the sentencing hearing and 39(3) specifies what is to be considered having regard to whether there is a reasonable alternative to custody. 39(6) requires preparation of a pre-sentence report before a custodial sentence may be imposed. Finally, 39(9) requires that the court give reasons why a non-custodial sentence is not adequate. Given the very precise directions in section 39, it is surprising that the Act would not specify that notice be given if it was intended to be a requirement before custody may be imposed.a) When the Crown seeks a custodial sentence;ii) is it required to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that one of the criteria in s.39(1) has been met?[40]Section 724. (3) of the Code provides:724. (3) Where there is a dispute with respect to any fact that is relevant to the determination of a sentence,(a) the court shall request that evidence be adduced as to the existence of the fact unless the court is satisfied that sufficient evidence was adduced at the trial;(b) the party wishing to rely on a relevant fact, including a fact contained in a presentence report, has the burden of proving it;(c) either party may cross‑examine any witness called by the other party;(d) subject to paragraph (e), the court must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities of the existence of the disputed fact before relying on it in determining the sentence; and(e) the prosecutor must establish, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of any aggravating fact or any previous conviction by the offender.While 724.(3) does not apply to sentencing under the YCJA, the annotated decisions of R. v. Gardiner,R. v. Holt, R. v. Boulet,and R. v. Poorman, supra, decided prior to the enactment of 724 and found at page 1337 of the 2005 Martins Criminal Code, are consistent with it and in a summary way, state:R. v. Gardiner - where there is conflicting evidence with respect to the factors going to the gravity of the offence, the onus is on the Crown to prove the aggravating facts beyond a reasonable doubt,R. v. Holt - the court may not assume all mitigating factors in favour of the accused merely because of the absence of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to the contrary,R. v. Boulet - per Bayda, C.J.S. in dissent - where material facts are in dispute, evidence may be called. A court may reject the accused’s version of the facts where it is not within the bounds of reasonable possibility or is incapable of belief and in that event the facts will not be in dispute.R. v. Poorman - where there is dispute as to the facts that are not crucial to determination of guilt or innocence in an informal hearing, the judge should as far as possible accept the version of the accused.It would seem that the sentencing court is encouraged to resolve the facts informally. Where the Crown seeks to rely upon facts going to aggravating factors or material facts that are disputed, it must prove the existence of those facts beyond a reasonable doubt. On the other hand, the accused’s version of the facts is to be accepted if reasonably capable of belief.[41]If this is the approach to be taken with respect to the factual basis for sentencing in matters under the YCJA, the question then becomes; are the facts, material to a finding that the criteria in s.39(1), permitting the imposition of a custodial sentence, to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt? In my view, where disputed, the factual basis supporting the Crown’s request for a custodial sentence must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. While this has implications for the evidentiary burden upon the Crown in a sentencing hearing under the YCJA, it does not address the argument of the defence that the Crown must establish beyond a reasonable doubt that a custodial sentence is to be imposed.[42]It seems that, the facts having been proven, Parliament has provided the steps for decision making before a custodial sentence may be imposed. Indeed the YCJA has imposed upon the sentencing court a rather thorough and intensive consideration of principles and factors before arriving at a sentencing decision. In his article entitled,“Sentencing under the YCJA: An Overview”,prepared for the National Judicial Institute Youth Criminal Justice Act Seminar, September 2002, and publishedwith a checklist, in the NJI Electronic Bench Book Youth Criminal Justice Act, Professor Tony Doob of the University of Toronto, Centre of Criminology, discussed the sentence decision making process. Ihave summarized the steps below as it serves to illustrate the expectations for a reasoned and ordered consideration of the principles and cautions. After considering the purpose and principles of sentencing, addressing procedural issues such as ordering a pre-sentence report, conferencing, or a medical or psychological report, a court might proceed with the sentence decision making in the following stages of reasoning:i) first address proportionality 38(2)(c)ii) consider the severity of the offence having regard to the factors outlined in 38(3)iii) evaluate possible sanctions within the limits of proportionality. This requires specific consideration of 38(2)(a), (b) and (e)iv) consider non-custodial sanctions having regard to 39(2),(3) and (4) and 38(2)(d)v) impose a non-custodial sentence having regard to 39(2), 38(2)(d) and (e)(i) and in fashioning the sentence consider 38(1), 38(2)(e)(ii) and (iii), orvi) determine if custody is permissible having regard to 39(1)(a) to (c) or (d) and 39(5)vii) impose a custodial sentence, with particular reference to 39(8), 39(9)[43]Of particular import is the direction that having determined the severity of the offence andevaluated all possible sanctions within the limits of proportionality, including a non-custodial sentence; if it then determines that custody is permissible and should be considered, it must once again consider alternatives to custody before imposing sentence. 39(1) and (2) bear repeating at this juncture:39. (1) A youth justice court shall not commit a young person to custody under section 42 (youth sentences) unless(a) the young person has committed a violent offence;(b) the young person has failed to comply with non‑custodial sentences;(c) the young person has committed an indictable offence for which an adult would be liable to imprisonment for a term of more than two years and has a history that indicates a pattern of findings of guilt under this Act or the Young Offenders Act, chapter Y‑1 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985; or(d) in exceptional cases where the young person has committed an indictable offence, the aggravating circumstances of the offence are such that the imposition of a non‑custodial sentence would be inconsistent with the purpose and principles set out in section 38.(2) If any of paragraphs (1)(a) to (c) apply, a youth justice court shall not impose a custodial sentence under section 42 (youth sentences) unless the court has considered all alternatives to custody raised at the sentencing hearing that are reasonable in the circumstances, and determined that there is not a reasonable alternative, or combination of alternatives, that is in accordance with the purpose and principles set out in section 38.It is my view that the prohibitions in 39(1) and (2) are sufficient direction to a sentencing court without further imposition of a requirement that the court be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that a custodial sentence is required. What is more, given this very strong direction, I must conclude that had Parliament intended that the onus be such, it would have stated so.b) May I impose a custodial sentence having regard to the criteria in s. 39(1) and in particular:i) has J.L.M. committed a violent offence within the meaning of s.39(1)(a) of the YCJA?[44]In R. v. B.G.B., supra, Galati, J. discussed the function of 39(1)(a) and determined whether a robbery was a “violent offence”, based on the surrounding circumstances rather than by simple reference to the charge. B.S.D. became a party to the robbery when he briefly held a knife while B.G.B. filled his bag. While Galati J. found that this constituted a robbery within the meaning of the charging section, 343(d), it did not meet the criteria for a violent offence having regard to s. 39(1)(a):“[17] In my opinion, the function of s.39(1)(a) is, as stated in the preamble of the Act, to reduce the over-reliance on incarceration for non-violent young persons. This function can only be achieved if the term “violent offence” is defined by the surrounding circumstances rather than by the type of charge. Looking at what the young person did rather than the definition of the offence he or she is charged with will provide a gate-keeping threshold to prevent a custodial sentence where the young person’s degree of participation does not warrant it because there was no violence that he or she committed or was party to.”[45]In R. v. T.M.D. the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal discussed the meaning of “violent offence” in the context of the YCJA as a whole and adopted a definition with regard to the definition of “serious violent offence” found in s. 2 of the Act. The Court deduced that a violent offence is one in which a young person attempts or causes bodily harm.“¶ 21 Although the YCJA does not define \"violent offence\", s. 2(1) defines \"serious violent offence\" as \"an offence in the commission of which a young person causes or attempts to cause serious bodily harm\". One may deduce that a \"violent offence\" is an offence in the commission of which a young person causes or attempts to cause bodily harm.¶ 22 Contextual integrity requires that \"violent offence\" and \"serious violent offence\" have connected meanings. Assume that a young person has committed an offence which caused very serious property damage, without causing or attempting to cause bodily harm. This would not be a \"serious violent offence\" as defined in the YCJA. If the meaning of \"violent offence\" cleaves from the definition of \"serious violent offence\" and includes pure property damage, this would be a serious \"violent offence\". The contextual approach to statutory interpretation shuns such an incongruity.¶ 23 In R. v. J.J.C., 2003 PESCAD 26 (CanLII), [2003] P.E.I.J. 99, (P.E.I. A.D.) Madam Justice Webber, at para 21 stated:While \"violent offence\" is not defined in the Youth Criminal Justice Act, \"serious violent offence\" is defined as \"an offence in the commission of which a young person causes or attempts to cause serious bodily harm.\" A reasonable analogy can therefore be made that \"violent offence\" refers to one in which bodily harm has been caused to the victim albeit not serious bodily harm.I agree with Justice Webber's deductive approach, subject to the following. The YCJA defines \"serious violent offence\" to include an attempt to cause serious bodily harm. It follows that a \"violent offence\" should include an attempt to cause bodily harm, even if bodily harm has not resulted.”As may be seen from this reasoning, it is not essential that bodily harm result, if bodily harm was attempted.[46]As provided for in s.2(2) of the YCJA, the Court in T.M.D. looked to the Criminal Code for the definition of “bodily harm” and continued at paragraph 25:¶25So a \"violent offence\" under s. 39(1)(a) would be an offence in the commission of which a young person causes or attempts to cause bodily harm, meaning a hurt or injury to a person that interferes with the person's health or comfort and that is more than merely transient or trifling.”[47]The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal then considered whether the definition should be broader to include a definition based upon Criminal Code case law respecting robbery and intimidation, to include threats and injury to property, stating at paragraph 27:“¶ 27 Robbery in s. 343(a) of the Code expressly includes violence to \"property\" and \"threats of violence\". Intimidation in s. 423(a) expressly includes \"threats of violence\" and injury to \"property.\" The YCJA does not expressly associate \"violent offence\" with threats or property damage.”(emphasis added)”[48]The Appeal Court then concluded with aninterpretation, which excludes threats and damage to property, is consistent with the context, and purposes of the YCJA and adopted a threshold approach to a finding that there exists a “violent offence” within the meaning of s.39(1)(a) stating:“¶ 31These principles and sentencing directions signal that the YCJA priorizes prevention, rehabilitation and accountable reparation over custodial deterrence. This differs from the approach of the Criminal Code. The principles of \"denunciation\" and \"deterrence\" in paragraphs 718(a) and (b) of the Criminal Code are not expressed with any priority in the YCJA. No doubt Parliament intended that the YCJA denounce and deter offences. But custodial deterrence clearly has a lower priority than in the Criminal Code. It is understandable that the violence which triggers custodial options is narrower in the YCJA than with the Criminal Code offences of robbery and intimidation.”With this last statement the Court put its finger on the underlying question that I must consider. Can a set of circumstances be deemed to be violent for the purpose of determining that an offence has been made out, such as for a robbery based on a threat of violence, yet be found not to be a violent offence for the purpose of imposing a custodial sentence under the YCJA?[49]The Court in T.M.D. also wrote that offences may not simply be labelled “violent”. Rather, whether or not an offence is violent will depend upon the facts of each case:“¶35Are \"Violent Offences\" labelled? The Crown submits that offences may be labelled as \"violent offences\"‑ eg. any assault would automatically qualify, whatever the circumstances. After conviction, the Youth Justice Court could impose a custodial sentence without considering whether the evidence establishes \"violence\".¶36I disagree. If Parliament wished to label certain offences as triggering the custodial option, Parliament easily could have listed these offences in s. 39(1)(a), just as s. 2(1) lists \"presumptive offences\". The YCJA's definition of \"serious violent offence\" which I have used to interpret \"violent offence\", refers to an offence \"in the commission of which\" a young person causes or attempts to cause bodily harm. The focus is on the facts respecting the \"commission\" of the offence. The offence is not labelled in advance.¶37This means that the sentencing judge must consider whether the circumstances of the commission of the offence are \"violent\" under s. 39(1)(a). There must be evidence or admitted facts of \"violence\" before a sentencing judge may consider custody under s. 39(1)(a). . .”In this context see also R. v. J.J.C., supra, in which the Prince Edward Island Court of Appeal found that there are few inherently violent offences.[50]In R. v. C.D., supra, (together with R. v. C.D.K. for which an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was argued and reserved, April 14, 2005), the Court discussed the meaning of “a violent offence” under s.39(1)(a) of the YCJA, beginning at paragraph 56.“¶56I now turn to the issue of what violence does mean in the context of the Act. In this respect, the Act and several sections within it are informative. As I have already stated, the definition should strive to promote the goals of the Act. If violence to property by itself opensthis gate, the sentencing goals under the Act would not be sufficiently balanced.¶57I conclude that if an action causes bodily harm, is intended to cause bodily harm, or if it is reasonably foreseeable that the action may cause bodily harm, then it is violent. Section 38(3)(b) of the Act supports this definition as it requires sentencing courts to take into account \"the harm done to victims and whether it was intentional or reasonably foreseeable\" while \"harm\" may extend to economic harm, other sentencing goals mitigate against giving effect to this feature of s. 38(3)(b) in terms of defining \"violence\" for gate keeping purposes. More importantly, this provision makes it clear that foreseeability of harm is to be considered when a sentence is imposed.¶58The effect of this test is to eliminate pure property crimes from being capable of opening this gate to custodial sentences. However, if what might normally be regarded as a property offence includes an element of risk of such a degree that a reasonable person would foresee harm, then the offence is violent, whether or not harm actually ensues. Most property offences can go wrong such that bodily harm results to a victim, but in many instances that risk will not meet the reasonable foreseeability standard. Where such foreseeability does not exist, the offence is not violent. Where harm is reasonably foreseeable, the offence is violent. . .”[51]In R. v. M.W.G. 2005 SKPC 5 (CanLII), 2005 SKPC 05, I was concerned with the meaning of a serious violent offence and considered: R. v. C.G. supra,R. v. T.B.W. [2003] B.C.J. No. 1731, 2003 BCPC 256 (CanLII),R. v. T.M.D., supra,R. v. J. J. C.,supra, and R. v. C.D, supra. I understood R. v. C.D. to have held that “an act is violent if it causes bodily harm, is intended to cause bodily harm or if it is reasonably foreseeable that it may cause bodily harm.” I concluded with respect to. M.W.G. that a serious violent offence had been committed, at paragraph 77:“[77]I find beyond a reasonable doubt that this offence is a serious violent offence. . . The actual injury caused was not significant enough for such a finding, nor was the psychological or emotional impact upon the victims. Rather I find that this was a serious violent offence because the circumstances presented with a very dangerous situation with the potential for great injury. Referring to the reasoning in R. v. C.D., supra, it was reasonably foreseeable that the young person’s actions may cause bodily harm. Having regard to the reasoning in R. v. J.J.C., supra, I am satisfied that the facts presented to the Court are sufficient to satisfy me beyond a reasonable doubt that this was a serious violent offence. These are my specific reasons for making this finding:- The young person carried a knife into a home which he knew to be occupied, with intention of confronting someone that he believed to be in that home.- While in the home he held the knife in close proximity to one of the victims and while doing so said to his companion, “Should I shank her up?” To this, his companion replied, “No. I will.”- His companion physically assaulted two of the occupants in the home and while M.W.G. didn’t participate in this aspect of the offence and gave some verbal opposition to it, he was not prepared to otherwise interfere with his companion’s assaultive behaviour, who by her words and actions indicated her intention to stab one of the complainants and cause injury.- By his behaviour, M.W.G. was a party to the actions of his companion.- He expressed his intention to cause bodily harm. While he later denied intending to harm the complainants, personally, he nonetheless exhibited the intention in highly volatile circumstances in which he permitted his companion to beat the complainants.- I took his words, “Should I shank her up?” to mean “Should I stab her?”[78]In reaching my conclusion, I would not have found that the evidence of the assaultive behaviour by “M.S.” upon the two 14 year old complainants, nor their trauma as a result of the incident to be sufficient alone to justify finding this to be a serious violent offence. However these facts contributed to my finding that the actions of M.W.G. when he held the knife and uttered the threat to “shank up” D.G., were seriously violent, having regard to his intention and the potential harm in the circumstances.”[52]In R. v. M.D.D.,supra, I found the robbery to be a “violent offence” for the purpose of imposing a custodial sentence under the YCJA. Paragraphs 6 and 20 of my decision provide:“[6]The most significant or unusual circumstances of the 8 charges, which were provided by the Crown, are set out below. Clearly the basis for the imposition of a custodial sentence lay with the robbery incident.Robbery - Nov 23/03:Three youth, M.D.D., R.J.E. and B.P., rushed a Gas Bar at 8:40 p.m., stealing money and cigarettes.The attendant, age 17, was alone. He was preparing money from the till for deposit. R.J.E. came in first and held a pocket knife to the attendant’s throat. He was pushed into a back room. B.P. came in next, followed by M.D.D. All had their faces covered. R.J.E. behaved in a threatening fashion. R.J.E. took the cash ($350). B.P. and M.D.D. loaded up the cigarettes. They fled and were not apprehended until weeks later as a result of a Crime Stoppers tip. The victim described having a knife held to his throat, “It was just 30 seconds with a knife to my throat but it felt a lot longer.” I think about it all the time and my parents think about it all the time.” He returned to work after the incident.. . .[20]Having regard to s.39(1)(a) of the YCJA, a custodial sentence is available, given that a robbery generally and in these circumstances may be regarded as a violent offence. That however is not the starting point for my reasoning. The starting point is with s.3, The Declaration of Principle, and s.38, the Purpose and Principles of Sentencing.”While M.D.D. did not hold the knife, I nonetheless found in those circumstances that it was a violent offence. In this finding I took a different approach than the sentencing Judge in R. v. B.G.B.,supra. My finding was based on the circumstances of the offence, as they were known to the offender when he participated in the offence and was not limited to the role or specific actions of the offender and whether or not he held the knife. M.D.D. may be distinguished from the robbery in which J.L.M. participated as I specifically found that she disassociated herself from the physical violence that followed.[53]I followed the reasoning in R. v. C.D., supra, in arriving at my decision in R. v. M.W.G., although I made a finding of a serious violent offence. Before turning to that test it is important to discuss further the meaning of “bodily harm” and R. v. C.G., R. v. T.B.W., and R. v. C.D., referred to R. v. McCraw, all supra. In R. v. C.G. Elliot, J. stated at paragraph 6 of her decision:“¶ 6. . . I accept that \"bodily harm\" includes \"psychological harm\". The Supreme Court in R. v. McCraw, 1991 CanLII 29 (SCC), [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72 held that \"serious bodily harm\" in the offence of utter threat to cause serious bodily harm included psychological harm. In doing so the Court relied on the definition of \"bodily harm\" in the Criminal Code. According to that definition, \"bodily harm\" was \"any hurt or injury to the complainant that interferes with the health or comfort of the complainant and that is more than merely transient or trifling in nature. . .\"¶ 7 In terms of the meaning of \"bodily harm\", although McCraw depended on the definition contained in the Code, the Youth Criminal Justice Act would appear to incorporate that definition through section 2(2) of the Act, which reads, \"Unless otherwise provided, words and expressions used in this Act have the same meaning as in the Criminal Code.\" This is the conclusion reached by the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in R. v. T.M.D., 2003 NSCA 151 (CanLII), [2003] N.S.J. No. 488; 2003 NSCA 151 at para. 28. . .”[54]In that context, with respect to the facts of the robbery and the assault enumerated above, I pose 3 questions which arise from the definition of a violent offence in R. v. C.D., supra:i)Did the actions of the young person cause bodily harm, including psychological harm?ii)Did the young person intend to cause bodily harm, including psychological harm?iii) Was it is reasonably foreseeable that the young person’s actions may cause bodily harm, including psychological harm?[55]In answering these questions, as in the case of the robbery where several persons were involved, I assessed the evidence having regard to the circumstances participated in and known to J.L.M., coupled with an objective assessment of the complainant’s reaction, (see R. v. J.L.M., supra, at paragraph 24). In addition to evidence at trial, subsequent information produced at the sentencing hearing, including agreed upon submissions, information in the pre-sentence report and victim impact statements were pertinent.With respect to the robbery there was no information, beyond that which was conveyed at trial, about the impact of the actions by J.L.M. upon the victim, N.S. I limited my survey to the actions of J.L.M. and disregarded the actions of her companions that occurred subsequently. With respect to the assault, I relied upon the undisputed submissions of the Crown at the sentencing hearing.[56]In J.J.C., supra, the Court discussed the nature of the evidence required to determine that an offence resulted in psychological harm:“¶ 27There seems little doubt that victim impact statements can be used to provide the court with the information it requires for such an assessment.While those statements are not sworn and so not proven as would be other evidence, Parliament has given those statements special status essentially equivalent to evidence at a sentencing hearing:. . .”[57]The Court considered section 722 of the Code and the conditions for use ofvictim impact statements in the sentencing process. It then assessed the evidence available to it, stating:“¶ 28Two victim impact statements were filed in this case.One victim noted it was \"scary\" to get a telephone call from the R.C.M.P. early in the morning and that person \"dreaded\" going to see the damage done to the car.This person no longer feels comfortable leaving her children where the appellant might be present within the community and the children are more watchful after the incident.The other victim impact statement referred to \"anger,\" \"hurt\" and \"inconvenience,\" while expressing the hope that the appellant received help to prevent this from happening again.¶ 29While these statements indicate that the actions of the appellant had an impact upon the comfort level of the victims, I cannot conclude from what is said in those statements that these people were harmed to the extent required for these crimes to be considered violent offences. The overall thrust of the Youth Criminal Justice Act suggests that the exceptions to the non‑custodial rule in sentencing relate to situations of a nature that stand out for more extreme punishment. An assessment must be made.Without in any way diminishing the impact of any crime upon a victim, it is necessary for the court to interpret all provisions in a manner that reflects Parliament's intent as far as possible. In my view, the evidence regarding these crimes in the instant case does not meet the test required to prove they were violent offences within the meaning of paragraph 39(1)(a).”i) Did the actions of the young person cause bodily harm, including psychological harm?[58]With respect to both charges, no physical bodily harm resulted and having regard to the definition of bodily harm in s.2 of the Code: “any hurt or injury to the complainant that interferes with the health or comfort of the complainant and that is more than merely transient or trifling in nature”,the evidence was insufficient to find that there was bodily harm of a psychological nature. With respect to both the robbery and the assault, there was no evidence to suggest that the impact extended beyond the occasion of the incident, physically or psychologically.ii) Did the young person intend to cause bodily harm, including psychological harm?[59]J.L.M. relied upon threats and intimidation to effect the robbery. With respect to the assault, she punched the complainant and attempted to intimidate him by threats. On the occasions of the robbery and the assault, I am not satisfied that J.L.M. intended the psychological or physical impact to be anything but transient, i.e. long enough to cause the victims to give up her necklace or the money.iii) Was it is reasonably foreseeable that the young person’s actions may cause bodily harm, including psychological harm?[60]I believe this question is designed to address those situations, contemplated in R. v. C.D., supra, and occurring in R. v. C.D.K, supra, which do not typically involve violence toward a person but where it was foreseeable that such violence may occur, as may be the case for offences, such as arson, or flight from the police in a motor vehicle.I found a home invasion in R. v. M.W.G. to be a serious violent offence on this basis. In any event, in answering this question with respect to the robbery, I am careful again to limit my assessment to the actions and knowledge of J.L.M., not that of her companions as there was no evidence that she was a party to their actions. The robbery was carried out with the help of an atmosphere of threats and intimidation; there was no overt show of violence or aggression by J.L.M. There were no weapons in evidence. J.L.M. specifically said, albeit in a context where I have found it to be conditional upon cooperation, that she was not going to beat up the victim. In this context, while acknowledging the fearinstilled in the victim and the subsequent conduct of her companions, I find that it was not foreseeable that J.L.M.’s words or actions would cause bodily harm of a psychological nature. With respect to the assault, there was no evidence of gang involvement or indeed that she carried a weapon of any kind. The complainant was more than a match for the behaviour of J.L.M. and there was nothing about the evidence to support a finding that bodily harm of any kind was foreseeable. Accordingly a custodial sentence was not available under 39(1)(a).a) May I impose a custodial sentence having regard to the criteria in s. 39(1) and in particular:ii) has J.L.M. committed an indictable offence for which an adult would be liable to imprisonment for a term of more than two years and does she have a history that indicates a pattern of findings of guilt within the meaning of s.39(1)(c) of the YCJA?[61]Robbery in these circumstances carried a maximum sentence under the Criminal Code of life imprisonment.The Crown proceeded by indictment on the assault charge and so it carried a maximum sentence of 5 years. The focus of this discussion pertains to whether J.L.M. has a history that indicates a pattern of findings of guilt.[62]In R. v. D.R.U. [2004] B.C.J. No. 1639,2004 BCPC 271 (CanLII), Galati, J. reviewed a number of decisions in which s.39(1)(c) and the meaning of “pattern of findings of guilt” had been interpreted, including R. v. D.A.I., supra, at paragraph 16:“¶ 16 In R. v. D.A.I. the young person had a record in that he was convicted on May 23, 2002 of possession of break‑in instruments and possession of a stolen motor vehicle. He received a disposition of one day and nine months probation. He was subsequently convicted on February 6, 2003 of breaching that probation order and sentenced to a second probation order. The young person was before Judge Auxier on new charges of breaching the second probation order.¶ 17 Judge Auxier held that to find a pattern of findings of guilt required evidence of some regularity, some repetition. In the circumstances before her, where there was a short record over a period of several months, she was unable to find such a pattern.”At paragraph 21, Judge Galati considered R. v. D.N. [2003] O.J. No.3736, in which Judge Johnston wrote:“¶ 21. . . a pattern of findings of guilt cannot be determined on the basis of one prior conviction. Indeed, in my view it cannot be founded even on two prior convictions. A pattern does not evolve after two things. At the very least, in my view, it requires three because if you have red square, green square there is no way that you can predict what the next item will be with any certainty. If it is red square, green square, green square, then you might have a pattern going. But there is not a pattern with two things.”[63]Judge Galati’s analysis began at paragraph 23 with a discussion of the meaning of a “findings of guilt” and “history”:“¶ 23 I agree with Judge Auxier in R. v. D.A.I. that evidence of repetition is required to establish a pattern of findings of guilt. That, to me, seems elementary because the subsection requires \"findings\" (plural) of guilt, which can only mean that there be at least two.¶ 24 I do not, with respect, agree with Judge Harvie in R. v. M.J.E. that s. 39(1)(c) requires a criminal record of multiple convictions. If that was what the drafters intended they would have used the same clear language they used in s. 40(2)(d)(iii) to prescribe that previous convictions be included in a Pre‑Sentence Report, i.e. \"a history of previous findings of guilt.\"¶ 25 S. 39(1)(c) does not require a Youth Criminal Justice Act equivalent of a criminal record of multiple convictions. It requires a history that indicates a pattern of findings of guilt. In this regard I agree with Judge Preston in R. v. S.B. that history refers to previous charges.¶ 26 The word \"history\" is not defined in the Youth Criminal Justice Act but to me it connotes preserved knowledge of past events. If that knowledge of past events tends to show a pattern of findings of guilt then the precondition to a custodial sentence is met. Use of the word \"history\" implies that there must be a temporal separation between the charges the young person has pleaded guilty to or been previously convicted of.¶ 27 There is no requirement that the young person have a record in the sense of having previously been sentenced. The subsection requires only that there be a history which indicates a pattern. Provided that the elements of that history are separated in time then they would constitute knowledge of past events that the Court can consider.”[64]At paragraph 31 he began his discussion of the meaning of “pattern”, and in so doing he considered R.v. D.A.I. supra, and went on to consider a number of cases related to dangerous and long-term offender proceedings where the issue was a “pattern of repetitive behaviour”, including: R. v. Langevin (1984), 1984 CanLII 1914 (ON CA), 11 C.C.C. (3d) 336 (Ont. C.A.),R. v. Neve (1999), 1999 ABCA 206 (CanLII), 137 C.C.C. (3d) 97 the Alta. C.A.,R. v. Dow (1999), 1999 BCCA 177 (CanLII), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 323 (B.C.C.A.). At paragraphs 38 to 41 he reasoned that:1) As few as two offences can constitute a pattern if there are significant similarities in the circumstances of the offences and the offender’s behaviour, and2) There can be significant differences between offences that nonetheless constitute a pattern of criminal activity. This would entail consideration of a number of findings of guilt over a period of time.Judge Galati conceded that in most cases a pattern will require more than two findings of guilt and determined that it must be decided on a case by case basis. He then summarized at paragraph 42:“¶ 42 In summary, a custodial youth sentence pursuant to s. 39(1)(c) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act is not available unless:1)There is a history of at least two findings of guilt resulting from:a) previous sentences; orb) previous guilty pleas or convictions where sentence is pending; orc) guilty pleas or convictions relating to different offence dates that are presently before the court; ord) any combination of the above2) The history tends to show:a) a pattern of similar offences; orb) a pattern of crime”[65]In R. v. S.B. [2003] M.J. No. 491, Preston, J discussed the meaning of “a pattern of findings of guilt” and determined that a pattern may be found, based on the occurrence date of the offences, not the sentencing date.“¶ 15 . . .The history that indicates a pattern of findings of guilt does not mean the history of appearances in court, it refers to previous charges. A history of findings of guilt for a number of prior charges can establish a pattern.¶ 16 In this young man's history he has been found guilty of theft over, which included car thefts, ultimately resulting in seven findings of guilt for charges dating from July 15th, 2001 to December 15th, 2002. The fact that all charges were dealt with at one court appearance is a function of court process, not relevant to the plain reading of this subsection. Often numerous charges are dealt with at one court appearance for a variety of reasons which can include expediency, plea negotiation, courtroom availability, request of counsel, request of accused, et cetera.”I have also considered R. v. M.J.E.[2003] M.J.No.362 (Prov. Court)[66]In assessing the evidence before me, I relied upon the approach taken by Judge Galati, in R. v. D.N., summarized at paragraph 42, above. I found that with reference to her record reproduced above and the findings of guilt for which she was yet to be sentenced that J.L.M. had a “history”.While she has only just entered guilty pleas to some of her charges recently, the offence dates indicate that these offences occurred on a number of separate prior occasions over a one year time frame that ended in July of 2004.[67]It remained for me to determine,having regard to the record and the current offences for which there have been findings of guilt, whether there was a pattern of similar offences or a pattern of crime. The difficulty that immediately arose was that while the record of offences for which J.L.M. has previously been sentenced disclosed charges which on their face may be indicative of a pattern, being: 4 assaults, 2 robberies, 1 threats charge, 2 procuring charges, 4 breaches of recognizance and 1 failure to comply with a sentence, contrary to s. 137 of the YCJA; I had no particulars upon which to find a pattern of crime or a pattern of similar offences. All but one of her prior findings of guilt are entered on one date on her record and I was unable to make any assumptions about the dates of these offences. For instance, one doesn’t know whether the 2 procuring offences took place at separate times or at the same time, alone or in conjunction with the assault or robbery offences. It is possible that all of these offences occurred in one evening and if that was the case, I was not sure that these entries on her record would meet the criteria for a pattern. It seemed highly unlikely, perhaps even absurd that J.L.M. committed all of these offences in one day or even over one week, but I was loathe to proceed uponassumptions derived from the limited information available.As I had no particulars for these previous offences, not even offence dates, I was unable to remark upon whether there was a pattern of crime. As well, as I had no specifics with respect to the circumstances of these previous findings of guilt I was unable to assess whether there were similarities among them such that one might ascertain a pattern of similar offences. I was not prepared to make assumptions simply based only upon the bare information in the record.[68]With the particulars available for the offences for which J.L.M. was to be sentenced, and the bare particulars in the record, the question became whether a pattern of crime or a pattern of similar offences was established.It would seem that there were at least three separate occasions over many months when J.L.M. participated in offences which on the face of it involved violence. As the analysis under the question of whether an offence is a “violent offence” within the meaning of s.39(1)(a) demonstrated, it is not sufficient to determine the nature of the offence simply by the charge. Very few offences are inherently violent. Further, the circumstances of the robbery and the assault/mischief were very different and Ifound that neither constituted a “violent offence” within the meaning of s.39(1)(a).[69]J.L.M. was awaiting sentence for 4 failures to comply with a probation order and 3 breaches of undertaking and these offences spanned many months. Her record also showed that she was sentenced on one occasion for 5 breaches of recognizance, one of which was a failure to attend court. On a separate occasion she was sentenced for a failure to comply with a probation order. From this Iconcluded that J.L.M. demonstrated a pattern of failing to comply with court orders. In the result, I found that, having regard to s.39(1)(c) of the YCJA, a custodial sentence may be imposed.b) How should the young person’s experience as an Aboriginal person be addressed for the purposeof sentencing?[70]In R. v. John 2004 SKCA 13 (CanLII), Justice Vancise discussed the importance of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. Gladue 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, stating at paragraph 26:“[26]Thus, from an examination of those paragraphs in Gladue and others to which I will specifically identify, the sentencing judge should be provided with the following information on a sentencing hearing:1)Whether the offender is an aboriginal, that is, someone who comes within the scope of s. 25 of the Charter and s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982;2)What band or community the offender comes from and whether the offender resides in a rural area, on a reserve or in an urban center.The information should also include what alternatives exist to incarceration, the particulars of alternative measures in the community, the particulars of treatment facilities and the existence of a justice committee.3)What combination of systemic or background factors contributed to this offender coming before the court?Has the offender been affected by substance and alcohol abuse in the community, or poverty, or overt racism or family or community breakdown?4)Would imprisonment effectively deter or denounce the crime in the community?5)What sentencing options exist in the community at large and in the offender’s community?[27]In sentencing an aboriginal offender, as for all offenders, the sentencing judge must take into account all of the circumstances of the offence, the offender and the victim, including the unique circumstances of the offender as an aboriginal.The sentencing judge must also receive general information about the aboriginal community at large concerning systemic poverty, alcohol and substance abuse, and cultural and racial bias.”[71]Justice Vancise went on to address the remedy to be adopted when the sentencing judge has insufficient information so as to comply with the direction to consider Gladue factors and alternatives. He stated at paragraph 28 that the judge has no ability in the absence of a waiver from the accused, to waive this informational requirement:“[28]The sentencing judge did not consider these factors or conduct any inquiry to determine whether this aboriginal offender should have been incarcerated or whether a community based sentence would have been an appropriate or fit sentence.In fairness to the sentencing judge, she did not have all the information which we now have as a result of a direction by this Court that defence counsel provide us with further information pertaining to the unique circumstances of the offender, his environment, and the circumstances of the English River First Nation, including the resources of that community and its ability to provide realistic alternative sentencing.Notwithstanding this lack of information, the sentencing judge had no discretion, in the absence of a waiver by Mr. John, to attempt to obtain the information described in Gladue to determine whether the offender should have received a custodial sentence.If she lacked sufficient information, then she should have, as we did here, and as Klebuc J. did in R. v. Carratt (L.D.), direct the parties to provide her with the information necessary to determine a fit and appropriate sentence and whether the appellant should have been incarcerated.”[72]R. v. John involved the sentencing of an adult offender under the Criminal Code. Sentencing of J.L.M. was governed by the YCJA. Section 50(1) of the YCJA specifically provides that with some exceptions the sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code do not apply. One of those exceptions is s.718(2)(e) which provides:718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:. . .(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.[73]The principles governing application of the YCJA generally and with respect to sentencing found in sections 3 and 38 specifically address the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders:3. (1) The following principles apply in this Act:. . .(c) within the limits of fair and proportionate accountability, the measures taken against young persons who commit offences should. . .(iv) respect gender, ethnic, cultural and linguistic differences and respond to the needs of aboriginal young persons and of young persons with special requirements;38(2) A youth justice court that imposes a youth sentence on a young person shall determine the sentence in accordance with the principles set out in section 3 and the following principles:. . .(d) all available sanctions other than custody that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all young persons, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal young persons;[74]Section 40(2) of the YCJA, which addresses the content of the pre-sentence report, imposes an obligation to address the aboriginal circumstances of a young person, based upon a number of sources and the considered assessment of the author of the report. It provides:40(2) A pre‑sentence report made in respect of a young person shall, subject to subsection (3), be in writing and shall include the following, to the extent that it is relevant to the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in section 38 and to the restrictions on custody set out in section 39:(a) the results of an interview with the young person and, if reasonably possible, the parents of the young person and, if appropriate and reasonably possible, members of the young person's extended family;(b) the results of an interview with the victim in the case, if applicable and reasonably possible;(c) the recommendations resulting from any conference referred to in section 41;(d) any information that is applicable to the case, including(i) the age, maturity, character, behaviour and attitude of the young person and his or herwillingness to make amends,(ii) any plans put forward by the young person to change his or her conduct or to participate in activities or undertake measures to improve himself or herself,(iii) subject to subsection 119(2) (period of access to records), the history of previous findings of delinquency under the Juvenile Delinquents Act, chapter J‑3 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970, or previous findings of guilt for offences under the Young Offenders Act, chapter Y‑1 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, or under this or any other Act of Parliament or any regulation made under it, the history of community or other services rendered to the young person with respect to those findings and the response of the young person to previous sentences or dispositions and to services rendered to him or her,(iv) subject to subsection 119(2) (period of access to records), the history of alternative measures under the Young Offenders Act, chapter Y‑1 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, or extrajudicial sanctions used to deal with the young person and the response of the young person to those measures or sanctions,(v) the availability and appropriateness of community services and facilities for young persons and the willingness of the young person to avail himself or herself of those services or facilities,(vi) the relationship between the young person and the young person's parents and the degree of control and influence of the parents over the young person and, if appropriate and reasonably possible, the relationship between the young person and the young person's extended family and the degree of control and influence of the young person's extended family over the young person, and(vii) the school attendance and performance record and the employment record of the young person;(e) any information that may assist the court in determining under subsection 39(2) whether there is an alternative to custody; and(f) any information that the provincial director considers relevant, including any recommendation that the provincial director considers appropriate.[75]The responsibility to provide information in the pre-sentence report is directive, not permissive. Thereport “shall include the following . . .” The importance of providing such pertinent information is reinforced by s.3(1)(d) which provides for the right to be heard and to participate in the processes and young persons have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms. It states:3. (1) The following principles apply in this Act. . .(d) special considerations apply in respect of proceedings against young persons and, in particular,(i) young persons have rights and freedoms in their own right, such as a right to be heard in the course of and to participate in the processes, other than the decision to prosecute, that lead to decisions that affect them, and young persons have special guarantees of their rights and freedoms,[76]Carefully compiled information regarding Gladue factors and alternatives should be provided in order to allow for a fair hearing at which the young person either in person or through the pre-sentence report may be heard and participate in the process. Many young persons are inarticulate, fearful and as in the case of J.L.M. possess very weak verbal skills. It is essential in these circumstances that the pre-sentence report convey information to the court that addresses the requirements of the YCJA in light of these limitations and their reduced maturity and increased vulnerability.d) How was sentence determined?[77]I found that a probationary sentence was appropriate. I determined that a custodial sentence was available, but nonetheless imposed probation for several reasons, having regard to the purpose and principles affecting sentencing, discussed above. More specifically with respect to the circumstances of these offences and this young person I was persuaded ultimately by the following:- J.L.M. has been profoundly affected by FASD and has acquired many of the secondary disabilities associated with someone who is diagnosed late on and does not receive supervision and support appropriate to her disability. She has demonstrated an ability to respond to structure in custody; hence the review from her previous sentence which was custodial. She requires a measure of stability in the community and her current circumstances were looking quite favourable for supervision in the community. For this I favoured a lengthy probation order.-I had confidence in the level of supervision offered, which is determined in Saskatchewan administratively, not by the sentence imposed but by the deemed level of risk. I understand thathaving regard to the results of the risk assessment conducted that J.L.M. will be supervised at a level consistent with the assessment, once every 48 hours for the first 4 weeks and for the remainder, one face to face contact per week.- Based upon her recent progress, the Crown had softened its position such that it was open to a deferred custody and supervision sentence.- Despite what might be described as a disturbing trend or pattern in J.L.M.’s history with the youth justice system, there were also positive reports of her progress and she has demonstrated a willingness to engage in programs and a positive response to steps taken to support and supervise her. The most serious contributing factor, outside of the vulnerability associated with a diagnosis of PFAS, was J.L.M.’s addiction. She has demonstrated a recent maturation and insight into her problems and demonstrated willingness to address addictions and the other factors affecting her offending behaviour.- Concerned primarily with the long term protection of the community, a plan which promotes her pro-social response in the community is ideal having regard to her lifetime disability.- While proportionality, parity and acknowledgment of the harm done are very important having regard to the circumstances and while the record for failing to comply with court orders might be suggestive of the unsuitability of a non-custodial sentence, I was satisfied, especially having regard to her disability and the importance of working with her in the community, that the progress that was being achieved should be built upon.- While I had decided that a custodial sentence was available, I was not satisfied with the deficiencies in the information provided to the court, noted in my discussions regarding the grounds for custody.Sentence[78]For each of the offences, after receiving advice from counsel and the youth worker, I ordered a concurrent sentence of 18 months probation, upon the following conditions:Statutory conditions(a) Keep the peace and be of good behaviour; and(b) Report to the Youth Justice Court when required by the Court to do so.Discretionary conditions(c) Report immediately and thereafter as required and be under the supervision of a youth worker and obey all lawful instructions of that youth worker or designate,(d) Reside at a residence approved by the youth worker and not change that address without prior permission of the youth worker,(e) Have no contact directly or indirectly with Courtney Sellar, Nicole Stewart and Ryan McKinley,(f) At the direction of the youth worker, attend for an addictions assessment and follow through with any education, counselling or treatment, including in-patient treatment, as may be recommended by the assessment,(g) At the direction of the youth worker, attend an educational or day program, and(h) Refrain from the use, possession or consumption of alcohol and non-prescription illicit drugs.[79]Pursuant to s.51 of the YCJA, I imposed a mandatory firearms prohibition, prohibiting J.L.M. from possessing any firearm, cross‑bow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition or explosive substance for a period of 2 years.[80]Pursuant to s. 487.051(1)(b) of the Criminal Code I made an order authorizing the taking for the purpose of DNA forensic analysis such samples as may reasonably be required. Robbery is a secondary designated offence.I was satisfied having regard to the criteria in s.487.051(1), (2) and (3) that it was in the interests of the administration of justice to make the order. I considered the criminal record, the nature of the current offences and the circumstances surrounding their commission, as well as the impact such an order would have on privacy and security of the person. I was most affected in this decisionby the number of offences for which J.L.M. has been convicted which on the face of it appeared to involve a degree of violence.___________________________S. P.

Dean Sinclair for the appellantMs. Valerie Harvey for the respondentDISPOSITION:On Appeal From:The Provincial CourtAppeal Heard:May 17, 2001Appeal Dismissed:May 17, 2001 (oral)Appeal Filed:June 1, 2001Reasons By:The Honourable Madam Justice JacksonIn Concurrence:The Honourable Mr. Justice VanciseIn Dissent:The Honourable Mr. Justice CameronJACKSON J.A. (oral)[1]On February 14, 2001 Candace D. Ahenakew pled guilty to four Criminal Code offences, notably, two theft charges and two breaches of probation.She committed the two thefts by stealing clothing from two stores in the Gateway Mall in Prince Albert.She stole while under the influence of a drug.When she committed these offences, she was bound by the terms of a probation order not to enter the Gateway Mall and not to consume alcohol or drugs.Store authorities apprehended her immediately and recovered the stolen items, butstealing from a place, barred to her and when she was intoxicated, resulted in four offences.[2]Unfortunately, new charges were not the only consequence for Ms. Ahenakew.In addition to being bound by the terms of a probation order when she committed these offences, she was under the supervision of the Provincial Court for Saskatchewan as she was serving a conditional sentence of imprisonment in the community.[3]Weisgerber P.C.J. had previously imposed an eight-month conditional sentence on Ms. Ahenakew for assault, theft and breach of probation on November 7, 2000.As is the policy of the Provincial Court in Prince Albert, a judge having imposed a conditional sentence administers the sentence and addresses any subsequent breaches of that sentence.Thus when Ms. Ahenakew came before Weisgerber P.C.J. on February 14, 2001, the sentencing judge had to respond not only to four new offences, but to the breach of the conditional sentence which she had previously given Ms. Ahenakew.[4]With respect to the breach of the conditional sentence, Weisgerber P.C.J.ordered Ms. Ahenakew to serve the balance of her conditional sentence, being four and a half months in custody, and among other conditions, to continue drug treatment on the methadone program.[5]After addressing the breach of the previous conditional sentence in this manner, the sentencing judge had to determine what additional penalty should be given for the new offences.She reasoned that a second conditional sentence was the appropriate disposition for Ms. Ahenakew:So I’m going to do something rather unusual and on the new offences I’m going to give you yet another conditional sentence.So you’re going to have to serve off the old one, so that the message gets through, you know, that you’ve had all your chances, but I want to get you back on track again.Rather than give you more custody on the new ones, I’m going to put you back on a conditional sentence.So it will extend the time that all this happens and I hope that the next time – you’ll get stabilized now while you do off your time and the next time then I won’t be seeing you back on your conditional sentence.[Transcript p. 13]And then later in the transcript, she said:THE COURT:In Prince Albert, Saskatchewan because you’re just a whole lot of grief for those people.You are to take – I’m going to put in a clause about – you shall take such educational or vocational programming as recommended by the supervisor of the Conditional Sentencing Program.So as well as talking to them, Ms. Ahenakew, about your drug addiction, you’ll be talking to them about finding a way to make a living and do something with your life too, so that you can support your children ultimately.I agree that that’s got to be a goal for you, is try and get them back, but until you’re clean and sober and not setting the same kind of example to them as was set to you, you know, that’s not healthy for them either, okay.And the probation, I take it, then – I think how it will work is, it will kick in after that – her other Probation Order which is in place already, so I don’t need to repeat that now.You know, my heart goes out to you, Ms. Ahenakew, but on the other hand, you know, I have some responsibility to the community that you and I live in.And so I’m trying to fashion a sentence that will, you know, give you some hope of rehabilitation and yet, you know, get the message through that conditional sentences cannot be treated lightly.So I’ll take another chance on you on that one and I wish you the best of luck.[Transcript pp. 16-17][6]The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of ten months to be served in the community.The sentencing judge selected, in addition to the usual terms, the following conditions:7.Reside at a residence approved by the supervisor.8.Abide by a curfew of 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. daily and present herself to any peace officer checking his [sic] curfew.9.Abstain completely from the use and possession of alcohol and non-prescribed drugs.10.Take such assessment, counselling and treatment for alcohol and drug abuse as arranged and directed by the supervisor, which may include enrolment in the methadone program and such other counselling and treatment as recommended by the supervisor.11.Not be in the premises known as the Gateway North Mall, Prince Albert, Sask.12.Take such educational/vocational programs as recommended by the supervisor.The Crown applied for leave to appeal from the sentence imposed.My colleague Vancise J.A. and I are both of the view that leave should be granted, but that the appeal from sentence should be dismissed for these reasons.[7]The standard of appellate review in these matters has often been stated.The relevant Supreme Court authorities have been reviewed extensively by this Court in such decisions as R. v. Horvath, 1997 CanLII 9759 (SK CA), [1997] 8 W.W.R. 357 at para. 20-23; R. v. Laliberte, 2000 SKCA 27 (CanLII), [2000] 4 W.W.R. 491; R. v. Keepness (2000), 2000 SKCA 28 (CanLII), 189 Sask. R. 173; and R. v. Banda, 2000 SKCA 92 (CanLII), [2001] 1 W.W.R. 299 at para. 4.All would agree that this Court would not intervene, even if an error in principle were to be found, if the sentence, having regard for all of the circumstances, is not demonstrably unfit.[8]This appeal comes to us in a particular context.It is an appeal from the decision of a judge from a Court that is responsible for handling 80% of the criminal matters which come before the courts in this province.The judge from whom the appeal is taken is also the judge who imposed the first conditional sentence and dealt with an intervening breach of that sentence, and who heard detailed submissions from the Crown and defence on all three occasions.She lives in this community, knows it and, from her previous experience, knows this accused.In light of this experience and this familiarity, we must take particular note of the Supreme Court of Canada's direction to defer to the sentencing judge.In particular, one may have regard for the words of Chief Justice Lamer in R. v. C.A.M., 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500 at para. 91 where the following appears:[91]This deferential standard of review has profound functional justifications. As Iacobucci J. explained in Shropshire, at para. 46, where the sentencing judge has had the benefit of presiding over the trial of the offender, he or she will have had the comparative advantage of having seen and heard the witnesses to the crime. But in the absence of a full trial, where the offender has pleaded guilty to an offence and the sentencing judge has only enjoyed the benefit of oral and written sentencing submissions (as was the case in both Shropshire and this instance), the argument in favour of deference remains compelling. A sentencing judge still enjoys a position of advantage over an appellate judge in being able to directly assess the sentencing submissions of both the Crown and the offender. A sentencing judge also possesses the unique qualifications of experience and judgment from having served on the front lines of our criminal justice system. Perhaps most importantly, the sentencing judge will normally preside near or within the community which has suffered the consequences of the offender's crime. As such, the sentencing judge will have a strong sense of the particular blend of sentencing goals that will be \"just and appropriate\" for the protection of that community. The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which attempts to balance carefully the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence, while at all times taking into account the needs and current conditions of and in the community. The discretion of a sentencing judge should thus not be interfered with lightly. [Emphasis added.]We emphasize the words of Chief Justice Lamer that the sentencing judge “will normally preside near or within the community which has suffered the consequences of the offender’s crime.\"[9]In the community of Prince Albert, where these incidents took place and where Ms. Ahenakew was sentenced, the crime rate is significant.For a population considerably smaller than that of Regina, the crime rates of the two cities are almost equal.It will take a concerted effort on behalf of all involved in the criminal justice system to address the human suffering which these statistics represent—both for the victims and the accused.This particular judge has concluded, as many others have done, that incarceration without addressing the underlying addictions of a person such as Ms. Ahenakew will, in all likelihood, simply lead to more crimes.[10]So is there error in principle or is the sentence demonstrably unfit?The Crown has pointed to the lack of analysis in the sentencing judge's oral judgment regarding the steps one must consider in imposing a conditional sentence.It was argued that she had not addressed such matters as the danger to the public or the risk of re-offence.In light of such Supreme Court authorities as R. v. Burns, 1994 CanLII 127 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656, a busy sentencing judge need not slavishly state the lawwhich any judge in the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan must be taken to know.[11]In Burns, McLachlin J. makes these comments:¶ 17Failure to indicate expressly that all relevant considerations have been taken into account in arriving at a verdict is not a basis for allowing an appeal under s. 686(1)(a).This accords with the general rule that a trial judge does not err merely because he or she does not give reasons for deciding one way or the other on problematic points: see R. v. Smith, 1990 CanLII 99 (SCC), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 991, affirming (1989), 1989 ABCA 187 (CanLII), 95 A.R. 304, and Macdonald v. The Queen, 1976 CanLII 140 (SCC), [1977] 2 S.C.R.665.The judge is not required to demonstrate that he or she knows the law and has considered all aspects of the evidence.Nor is the judge required to explain why he or she does not entertain a reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt.Failure to do any of these things does not, in itself, permit a court of appeal to set aside the verdict.¶ 18This rule makes good sense.To require trial judges charged with heavy caseloads of criminal cases to deal in their reasons with every aspect of every case would slow the system of justice immeasurably.Trial judges are presumed to know the law with which they work day in and day out.If they state their conclusions in brief compass, and these conclusions are supported by the evidence, the verdict should not be overturned merely because they fail to discuss collateral aspects of the case.¶ 19The Court of Appeal relied on the following passage from Harper v. The Queen, 1982 CanLII 11 (SCC), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 2, where this Court stated (at p. 14):Where the record, including the reasons for judgment, discloses a lack of appreciation of relevant evidence and more particularly the complete disregard of such evidence, then it falls upon the reviewing tribunal to intercede.¶ 20This statement should not be read as placing on trial judges a positive duty to demonstrate in their reasons that they have completely appreciated each aspect of relevant evidence.The statement does not refer to the case where the trial judge has failed to allude to difficulties in the evidence, but rather to the case where the trial judge's reasons demonstrate that he or she has failed to grasp an important point or has chosen to disregard it, leading to the conclusion that the verdict was not one which the trier of fact could reasonably have reached.This can be said with even greater force in relation to sentencing which occupies a large part of the Provincial Court docket.Moreover, as the facts on this appeal show, the sentencing which took place on February 14 continued a sentencing process which had begun some months before.This was at least the third time that this sentencing judge had considered the suitability of a conditional sentence in relation to this accused.[12]But even if we were satisfied that the sentencing judge had not considered the question of risk to the public, we can independently make that assessment.Ms. Ahenakew has a record, but it is not as significant as many records which this Court sees on a regular basis.She has committed a number of thefts, but as Crown counsel acknowledged on the hearing before the sentencing judge, all are related to shoplifting.Like the two additional offences to which she pled guilty on this occasion, many of the remaining offences have been generated by her failure to comply with a probation order.While not minimizing shoplifting as an offence or the need to comply with probation orders, it must go without saying that such offences are much less serious than many other offences which the courts of this Province see on a regular basis.[13]Most of the penalties imposed on Ms. Ahenakew have been minor ones.The longest sentence she has served is six months which involved not only an assault, but two theft counts, a bail breach, and a probation breach.And for the assault which formed part of the charges to which she pled guilty in November and for which she received a conditional sentence, the Crown did not appeal.We may take from the sentences meted out on these two occasions, involving as they did other offences, that the assaults were not as serious as some.[14]At bottom, as Crown counsel freely acknowledges, Ms. Ahenakew suffers from an addiction to alcohol and drugs.She shoplifts to support this habit.In these circumstances, the imposition of a prison sentence does little to protect the public from future criminal acts of such an individual without finding a means to address her addictions.One need only have regard for Ms. Ahenakew's record to prove this statement.By addressing her addictions, as the sentencing judge has attempted to do, the public stands to gain substantially by reducing the likelihood of reoffence.[15]Prior to the commission of the new offences and as part of her first conditional sentence, Ms. Ahenakew had commenced drug treatment on the methadone program in Prince Albert, but there was, apparently, a problem in establishing the proper dosage.She committed the four new offences during this period when the methadone problem had not been resolved.[16]On the question of addictions, it is useful to refer to the reasoning of Mr. Justice Wood of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Preston (1990), 1990 CanLII 576 (BC CA), 79 C.R. (3d) 61, where the following appears:The object of the entire criminal justice system, of course, is the protection of society, and I say at once that if incarceration is the only way of protecting society from a particular offender, then transitory and expensive though it may be, that form of protection must be invoked. But where, as in this case, the danger to society results from the potential of the addict to commit offences to support her habit, and it appears to the court that there is a reasonable chance that she may succeed in an attempt to control her addiction, then it becomes necessary to consider the ultimate benefit to society if that chance becomes a reality.With respect, that benefit seems obvious. If the chance for rehabilitation becomes a reality, society will be permanently protected from the danger which she otherwise presents in the fashion described above. As well, the cost associated with her frequent incarceration will be avoided.And continuing at p. 72:What then is the proper approach for the court to take when sentencing in a case such as this? When the benefit to be derived to society as a whole, as a result of the successful rehabilitation of a heroin addict, is balanced against the ultimate futility of the short-term protection which the community enjoys from a sentence of incarceration, I believe it is right to conclude that the principle of deterrence should yield to any reasonable chance of rehabilitation which may show itself to the court imposing sentence. To give the offender a chance to successfully overcome his or her addiction, in such circumstances, is to risk little more than the possibility of failure, with the result that the cycle of addiction leading to crime leading to incarceration will resume, something that is inevitable, in any event, if the chance is not taken. On the other hand, as has already been pointed out, if the effort succeeds the result is fundamentally worthwhile to society as a whole.One can only echo his words that prison is such short-term protection with respect to someone like Ms. Ahenakew whose underlying problems require a different approach than what has been tried with her before.[17]This sentencing judge was trying to find a means to effect a change in Ms. Ahenakew's lifestyle by using probation services coupled with appropriate drug treatment instead of the correctional system.The first conditional sentence was not an unqualified success, but Weisgerber P.C.J. used that sentence as a means of setting up Ms. Ahenakew for potential success on the second conditional sentence.[18]For the breach of the conditional sentence, Weisgerber P.C.J. required Ms. Ahenakew to serve all of the remaining time in prison.Ms. Ahenakew was ordered into the methadone program which she is successfully following.And, if we examine what has happened since she was incarcerated on the balance of her breached sentence, it would appear that she has made progress.She was admitted to the Pine Grove Correctional Centre on February 12, 2001 and began with methadone 90 milligrams per 100 millilitres.As of April 24, 2001, she is now receiving 120 milligrams of methadone.She will be released on May 15, 2001 and will be under the care of a physician.She will continue with the terms of her community sentence disposition.If she breaches yet again, there will be, as the sentencing judge was well aware, an opportunity to reassess the likelihood of rehabilitation with Ms. Ahenakew.[19]The fact that a conditional sentence has been tried and failed does not preclude its subsequent use for future offences.A parallel may be drawn between this type of sentence and a custodial sentence.No one would ever suggest that an additional custodial sentence would not be a fit sentence for an accused who commits a further offence having been released from custody. The subsequent use of a conditional sentence must, of course, meet all the same requirements as the first conditional sentence.Depending on many factors, including the nature of the new offence and the terms and length of the conditional sentence to be imposed, a conditional sentence may still be the fit sentence.[20]There are other bases upon which this sentence could be upheld.Ms. Ahenakew, a person of aboriginal descent, has had an extremely difficult life.She was brought up from an early age by adults who instructed her how to shoplift, which she has been doing since a child.Many of Ms. Ahenakew's peers, including family on and off the reserve, suffer from addictions.She has sought help in the past, but bad associations have made recovery difficult and, prior to this, she had never been on the methadone program.Ms. Ahenakew’s remarks to the sentencing judge tell the story:MS. AHENAKEW:Your Honour, I know I’ve been in front of you twice since you put me on my conditional sentence.And I’ve been given several chances and this last time I (INAUDIBLE) all my 15 days, I was trying to get into Calder, like even before I got out of Pine Grove.And I was trying the whole time I was out, like, and the NADAC workers on the Reserve, they were on holidays the one week and then the next week they – I kept trying to get ahold of them, they wouldn’t return my calls.Like, I – I found out my dad had prostate cancer and like, I don’t have any coping skills right – as to how to deal with that.And like – and I – when I went shop lifting I didn’t get my rebate cheque yet, like the rebate cheque that everybody else had received.And my – my children – well, both my kids are still on Pampers and like – like, my son is still – he’s five years old and he’s still on Pampers and he’s still on the bottle.And like, this shows that, like, he needs me there and – and like, I’m – I just got on the Methadone program and I haven’t had any counselling.Like, when you go on the Methadone program you’re supposed to have some kind of counselling and I haven’t had any because like, this last time I got out of jail I moved to the Reserve because Prince Albert I just found like – well, I – I didn’t want to live in the city because there is like too much – I made too many – well, junkies.And this time when I slipped though I didn’t – I didn’t use I.V. drugs and I’m trying my hardest, like, to like start living a straight life and I – my plans are to move to Saskatoon and apply to S.I.F.C.And I talked to the education director on my Reserve already and he said that that’s really quite possible, like, this coming September, but I just have to, like, go there and find a home and like, get stabilized, but it just seems like, I don’t know, everything just keeps going wrong.Like, the only way I know how to make money is like stealing, that’s all I’ve known, like that’s – when I was growing up that’s all I seen is my – my aunts stealing for money and everything, right.And it’s really hard to – like, when you need money it’s hard not to because like I – I’m not – like, I’m not one to work on the street or anything, like.And I just – I don’t know.[Transcript pp. 10-11]The sentencing judge recognized that this accused needed, not only a drug treatment program, but educational programming which would permit her to develop the coping skills to say \"no\" to a lifestyle that had been ingrained in her.[21]With this by way of background, we must also take into account Parliament’s direction contained in s. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code, which reads:718.2A Court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:. . .(e)all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.This section has recently been given considerable force by the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688.[22]Ms. Ahenakew is like many other aboriginal offenders who appear before our courts for whom we must make a concerted effort to find ways in which criminal behaviours can be addressed other than through a custodial disposition.Consider the sentencing list from Ms. Ahenakew's date of appearance before us as an example.Of the thirteen offenders appearing before us on this date, at least nine are of aboriginal descent. This elementary statistic accords with the broader problem of over incarceration of aboriginal people in Saskatchewan jails as reflected in such judgments of this Court as Laliberte [2000] 4 W.W.R. 299 at para.30.While having the protection of the public always in mind, we must take every opportunity to emphasize rehabilitation over any other principle of sentencing in an attempt to address this crisis in our system.[23]For the other eight aboriginal offenders who appeared before us at the same time as Ms. Ahenakew, because of the nature of the offences committed, or because of the risk to the public that their records engender, the opportunity did not arise to use any sentencing tool other than incarceration.This Court was required to set aside the only other conditional sentence imposed on an aboriginal offender, because of the danger to the public (see Hotomanie 2001 SKCA 65 (CanLII), 2001SKCA65).In the case of Ms. Ahenakew, the sentencing judge must be taken to have concluded that the risk to the public is acceptable. We are not moved to interfere with that assessment.[24]While the Crown has convinced us that leave to appeal should be granted, we are not persuaded that the sentencing judge erred in principle or that the sentence is demonstrably unfit.Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 1stday of June, A.D. 2001.JACKSON J.A.I concurVANCISE J.A.CAMERON J. A.[25]The basic question on this appeal is whether in the circumstances of the case it was open to the sentencing judge, having sentenced the accused to a term of imprisonment of ten months, to then invoke the powers of section 742.1 of the Criminal Code and order that the accused serve the sentence in the community, subject to the conditions of a conditional sentencing order.[26]Section 742.1provides as follows:742.1 Imposing of conditional sentence—Where a person is convicted of an offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, and the court(a) imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years, and(b) is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2,the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender's behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions of a conditional sentence ordermade under section 742.3[27]The Attorney General, who brought the appeal with our leave, submits the sentencing judge all but disregarded the provisions of clause (b), which in the circumstances were not met, and therefore erred in invoking the powers of the section. The Attorney General also contends that the sentence was not only imposed in error but is demonstrably unfit.[28]I must say I agree with the Attorney General. In light of the circumstances, the approach taken by the sentencing judge, and the treatment of section 742.1 by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, I am convinced the sentencing judge did not pay sufficient attention to the requirements of the section and erred in law in invoking its powers.[29]Mindful of the standard of review enunciated in R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, which applies to the second limb of the Attorney General's submission, I am also convinced the sentence of ten months is demonstrably unfit. Indeed, I am of the respectful opinion the sentence as a whole is long on sentiment, hope, and concern for the accused, but short on reality, principle, and concern for the community.The Circumstances[30]On the morning of February 10, 2001, Candace Ahenakew, a 29-year-old resident of Shell Lake, went from store to store in the Gateway North Mall in Prince Albert, stealing things whileapparently under the influence of Valium. She was caught attempting to steal some clothing in Zellers, was arrested, and was found to have a bag of items stolen from other stores in the Mall, including Warehouse One and Sears. In the result, she was convicted of:(i) two counts of theft, contrary to section 334(b) of the Criminal Code, and(ii) two counts of failing to comply with the terms of a probation order, contrary to section 733.1 of the Criminal Code.The probation order, imposed approximately a year earlier—on January 11, 2000—prohibited her from entering the Gateway North Mall and from using non-prescription drugs for a period of two years..[31]In addition to being convicted of these offences, she was found to be in breach of the conditions of a conditional sentencing order made only three months beforehand—on November 7, 2000. On that occasion she had been convicted of assault, theft, and breach of probation, for which she had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eight months, to be served in the community pursuant to orders made under sections 742.1 and 742.3 of the Code. The conditional sentencing order appears to have been made on condition, among others, that the accused undergo counselling and treatment for drug and alcohol abuse and that she refrain from using alcohol and non-prescription drugs. A month or so later,however, she breached the conditions and, in consequence,was ordered to serve fifteen days in custody. She had completed serving these fifteen days shortly before being arrested in the Mall.[32]Her activity in the Mall constituted the third violation of the terms of the probation order made on January 11, 2000 and the second breach of the conditions of the conditional sentencing order made on November 7, 2000.[33]Indeed, the thefts in the Mall amounted to the latest in a string of theft related and other offences. And the breaches of probation represented the latest in a series of violations of court orders and court processes. The full extent of this is evident from the accused's criminal record, amassed over the previous ten years:1990-07-10(1)Theft under $1000(1)$100.

In doing so, she said she had given the accused \"quite a break the last time\" and had no choice but to terminate the order. In consequence of its termination, the accused was required to serve the remainder of the term, just over four months, in custody.[35]The judge then turned to sentencing the accused for the thefts at the Mall and the associated breaches of probation, turning first to the personal circumstances of the accused.[36]The accused, an aboriginal woman who was unemployed and living on Social Assistance, was apparently addicted to drugs and alcohol. She had made some efforts, though few and forced, to overcome her addiction. As required by the conditions of the conditional sentencing order made three months earlier, she had enrolled in a methadone treatment program but had not followed through because, as she explained, the authorities had let her down. She said they would not return her telephone calls. She said, too, that she had gone to Prince Albert, came by some Valium, and made her way to the Mall to steal enough to get her to Saskatoon, where she wanted to find and an apartment, be near her ailing family, and start afresh, adding that her aunts had taught her to steal as a child and that she lacked \"coping skills.\"[37]Informed of this, the sentencing judge turned to her and said, \"I want to say this to you, if at first you don't succeed try again okay.\" She then said she accepted the explanation that the accused had not committed the thefts for the purpose of maintaining her drug habit and that she was in need of continued treatment. \"So I'm going to do something rather unusual,\" the sentencing judge said, \"and on the new offences I'm going to give you yet another conditional sentence.\"[38]She went on to say she wanted the accused to \"get back on track again,\" expressing the hope the accused would \"get stabilized\" and that \"next time\" she appeared before the court it would not be on this matter. With that, the judge said she was sentencing the accused \"to a period of incarceration of ten months. However, that is to be served by way of conditional sentence consecutive to the present conditional sentence which is now being terminated....\"[39]In addition to the conditions prescribed by the Criminal Code, the sentencing judge directed that the accused reside at a residence approved by her supervisor; abstain completely from alcohol and drugs; undergo treatment and counselling assessment; and enroll in such educational or vocational programming as her supervisor may recommend. So far as the conditions were aimed at treatment, theyappear little different from those imposed earlier. In conclusion, the judge said this:You know, my heart goes out to you, Ms. Ahenakew, but on the other hand, you know, I have some responsibility to the community that you and I live inAnd so I’m trying to fashion a sentence that will, you know, give you some hope of rehabilitation and yet, you know, get the message through that conditional sentences cannot be treated lightly. So I'll take another chance on you on that one and I wish you the best of luck.[Transcript pp. 16-17]The Application of 742.1[40]In R. v. Proulx, cited earlier, Chief Justice Lamer observed on behalf of theCourt that section 742.1 falls to be applied according to the nature and structure of its terms:This provision lists four criteria that a court must consider before deciding to impose a conditional sentence:(1) the offender must be convicted of an offence that is not punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment;(2) the court must impose a term of imprisonment of less than two years;(3) the safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender serving the sentence in the community; and(4) a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.In my view, the first three criteria are prerequisites to any conditional sentence. These prerequisites answer the question of whether or not a conditional sentence is possible in the circumstances. Once they are met, the next question is whether a conditional sentence is appropriate. This decision turns upon consideration of the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2. [p.93 ].[41]He went on to observe that the requirement of the section concerning the safety of the community is to be seen \"as a condition precedent to the assessment ofwhether a conditional sentence would be a fit and proper sanction in the circumstances\",[1] adding that the assessment \"should clearly be on the risk posed by the individual offender while serving the sentence in the community.\" [2][42]He then addressed the manner of evaluating danger to the community:In my opinion,to assess the danger to the community posed by the offender while serving his or her sentence in the community, two factors must be taken into account: (1) the risk of the offender re-offending; and (2) the gravity of the damagethat could ensue in the event of re-offence. If the judge finds that there is a real risk of re-offence, incarceration should be imposed. Of course, there is always some risk that an offender may re-offend. If the judge thinks this risk is minimal, the gravity of the damage that could follow were the offender to re-offend should be taken into consideration. In certain cases, the minimal risk of re-offending will be offset by the possibility of a great prejudice, thereby precluding a conditional sentence. [pp.101-102][43]In considering the risk of re-offence, he suggested a variety of instructive factors are relevant, such as the record of the offender, including compliance with previous court orders; the circumstances of the offence, including prior and subsequent incidents; the profile of the offender in terms of his or her occupation, lifestyle, criminal record, family situation, and mental state; and so on. He went on to add that each case falls to be assessed on its own facts and that the risk is to be considered in light not only of the facts but of such conditions, attached to the sentence, as might reduce the risk of re-offence to a minimal one.[44]The Supreme Court's treatment of the provisions of section 742.1demonstrates the care required of judges in the application of these provisions.[45]In this instance, they were not applied with the requisite care. Indeed, the sentencing judge did not so much as mention them, though that is not the critical point. The critical point is that she failed to make the assessments called for by the provisions. In the circumstances, the terms of section 742.1(b) called, first, for an assessment of whether allowing the accused to serve her term of imprisonment in the community, subject to conditions such as those imposed by the judge, would endanger the safety of the community. If not, they then called for an assessment of whether an order allowing the accused to serve her sentence in the community would be appropriate having regard for fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing.[46]Had the judge made these assessments—and made them realistically based on the body of fact before the court—I fail to see how, as a matter of law, she could have made an order under section 742.1.(i) the risk of re-offence[47]Clearly, the accused posed a high risk to re-offend, no matter the conditions imposed by the judge, and therefore posed a danger to the community. How could it possibly have been otherwise, given the nature and extent of the record, not to mention her lifestyle?She had been convictedtime and time again of theft, obstruction of justice, failure to appear, breach of probation, assault, and so on. In all, she had amassed nearly fifty convictions in the previous ten years, twenty five of which convictions were theft related. And all manner of sentencing alternatives had been employed—short of a significant period incarceration—ranging through fines, conditional discharges, suspended sentences, probation, and conditional sentences. Still she had repeatedly re-offended.[48]Indeed, she had repeatedly violated the terms of the probation order madeonly a year earlier, just as she had repeatedly breached the conditions of the conditional sentencing order made only three months earlier. And this was the third conditional sentencing order to be made in her favour, notwithstanding such breaches.[49]To think the accused posed no danger to the safety of the community, should she again be allowed to serve a term of imprisonment in the community, is simply unrealistic. And lest it be thought the risk was of mere theft, and therefore beyond the scope of the harm contemplated by the provisions of section 742.1(b), reference might be made to what was said of this by Lamer C.J. in R. v. Proulx:The meaning of the phrase \"would not endanger the safety of the community\" should not be restricted to a consideration of the danger to physical or psychological safety of persons. In my view, this part of s. 742.1(b) cannot be given this narrow meaning.As Finch J.A. stated in Ursel, [(1997), 96 B.C.C.A. 241] at p. 264 ...I would not give to this phrase the restricted meaning for which the defence contends. Members of our community have a reasonable expectation of safety not only in respect of their persons, but in respect as well of their property and financial resources. When homes are broken into, motor vehicles are stolen, employers are defrauded of monies, or financial papers are forged,the safety of the community is, in my view endangered. We go to considerable lengths to protect and secure ourselves against the losses that may result from these sorts of crimes, and I think most ordinary citizens would regard themselves as threatened or endangered where their property or financial resources are exposed to risk of loss.I agree with this reasoning. The phrase \"would not endanger the safety of the community\" should be construed broadly, and include the risk of any criminal activity. Such a broad interpretation encompasses the risk of economic harm. [pp.104-05][50]That the sentencing judge erred in relation to this branch of 742.1(b) seems patently obvious to me. And the error does not lie alone in her failure to have sufficient—if indeed any—regard for this condition precedent to invoking the powers of the section. It also lies in the fact that allowing the accused to serve a term of imprisonment in the community, even subject to the conditions imposed by the judge, carried with it a very real risk of re-offence—a concrete, demonstrated risk that fell to be acted upon.[51]And it was not as though the risk could be reduced to a minimal one by the conditions imposed by the judge. This is not a case where, in the words of Lamer C.J. in R. v. Proulx:a judge may wish to impose a conditional sentence with a treatment order on an offender with a drug addiction, notwithstanding the fact that the offender has a lengthy criminal record linked to this addiction, provided the judge is confident that there is a good chance of rehabilitation and that the level of supervision will be sufficient to ensure that the offender complies with the sentence. [p.103]Given the accused's repeated failures to by abide the terms of previous probation orders and her repeated failures to meet the supervised conditions of previous conditional sentencing orders, one could hardly be confident she would abide by the conditions and not re-offend.Indeed the sentencing judge, in alluding to \"the next time\" the accused should come before her, displayed her own lack of confidence.[52]On this basis, alone, which is to say on the basis of the risk to the community of re-offence, the order made under section 742.1 falls to be set aside.As a matter of principle a conditional sentence must never be imposed unless the safety of the community, in the sense I have been at pains to identify, can be preserved.(ii) the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing[53]Even if the judge had considered the safety of the community and concluded that the risk offence was minimal, she was bound to have gone on from there to assess the propriety of a conditional sentence in light ofthe purpose and principles of sentencing. However, she did not do so.Had she done so, and done so properly, it is highly doubtful she would have allowed the accused to serve the sentence in the community. I say this because in the circumstances it is difficult, if not impossible, to view a conditional sentence as being consistent with the fundamental purpose of sentencing.[54]Section 718 identifies this purpose in these terms:718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide reparation for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.[55]Of these objectives, deterrence, separation from society, rehabilitation, and promoting a sense of responsibility in this offender, were surely paramount in this instance. So it was incumbent upon the judge—assuming she were able to reach this stage of the matter—to consider this combination of objectives with a view to assessing whether they be might be met by means of a conditional sentence. This would have called for a realistic, balanced, and principled assessment, having regard for the circumstances and the principles of sentencing appearing in section 718.1 and 718.2.[56]Deterrence, in the specific sense, had most certainly not been achieved in the past through use of sanctions other than a significant period of incarceration, and to suppose that \"yet another conditional sentence,\" as the judge put it, was apt to do so was hardly consistent with the circumstances. And since there existed a concrete risk of re-offence and a demonstrated need for a tightly supervised program of rehabilitation, a period of separation from society was necessary. Indeed, a lengthy period of separation from society, geared in the main to rehabilitation, was necessary to any realistic attempt to meet this combination of objectives, including instilling in this offender some sense of responsibility, which she sorely lacked.[57]Judging from her record and the explanation she offered the sentencing judge, the accused has a history of avoiding personal responsibility. She continuously blames her conduct on others, on the stresses of life, on the culture of her community, on the ineffectiveness of program administrators, and so on. Her attitude and habits are going to have to change, and change appreciably, before she is fit to live among others who have every right to expect persons in their midst to have some respect for the law, some appreciation of what it means to live in peaceful and safe society, and some idea of the harm associated with the commission of crime, especially its unrelenting commission.[58]In sum, then, I believe the Attorney General is quite right in saying the sentencing judge erred in invoking the powers of section 742.1 of the Code. In the circumstances, it was not open to her to do so, especially in light of the prerequisite concerning the safety of the community. That being so, the order falls to be set aside. Having regard for the deferential standard of review articulated in R. v. Shropshire, cited earlier,I might add that it is not within the discretionary sentencing powers of a judge to do anything but heed the requirements of section 742.1(b).The requirements must be applied, and applied carefully, as Parliament intended.Otherwise public confidence in the conditional sentencingregime is bound to suffer, and the regime will inevitably fall into disrepute and be replaced by another, one of less flexibility to be sure.The Fitness of the Term Imposed.[59]Were the section 742.1 order to be set aside, the effect would not be to incarcerate the accused as though she were otherwise free from incarceration, but to incarcerate her for a longer period of time. She is already serving the four and half months remaining on her earlier conditional sentence. The ten month term under appeal was ordered to be served consecutively. Hence, the effect of setting aside the order would be to keep her in custody for a nominal term of fourteen months.[60]Even this impressed me as inadequate—inadequate to achieving the combination of objectives I mentioned earlier—and as constituting a departure from the norm. In the circumstances, the norm is something in the order of two years. But it is the inadequacy of the term, viewed in light of the paramount objectives, that most troubles me. Indeed, I would extend the term to eighteen months. This is nearer the norm, but more importantly it is better geared toward achieving these objectives and bringing about meaningful change in this offender's attitude and habits, especially her drug habit.[61]As I conceive of this limb of the case, achieving this combination of objectives is of central importance, both as a matter of law and of sound judgment. Given the accused's pattern of behaviour over the last ten years, I believe that what is needed here, in the interests of all concerned in achieving these objectives, is a significant period of incarceration in Pine Grove Correctional Centre for Women, coupled with a systematic program of rehabilitation administered in this structured and disciplined environment. She cannot be left free, with the limited supervision entailed in serving her term of imprisonment in the community, to act upon her impulses. She needsa tightlysupervised program directed at overcoming her drug and alcohol dependency and breaking her related cycle of crime. She is currently in custody in Pine Grove, serving out the remainder of her previous term, is taking methadone treatment, and ought to remain there for another fourteen months, subject to assessment by the parole authorities based on her performance.[62]Moreover, I think something of this nature is called for in the interests not only of public protection and rehabilitation, but of upholding public confidence in the administration of the criminal law. After all, every other form of sanction has been tried to no avail. None of the objectives of sentencing laid down by Parliament has yet been achieved.Conclusion[63]In leaving the case, I should say that counsel for the accused suggested the sentence under appeal was defensible on the basis of R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688. I fail to see how.The foundation for Gladue is section 718.2(e) of the Code. The foundation for the conditional sentencing order in issue, which is pivotal to the sentence under appeal, is section 742.1. The provisions of the former cannot be seen to override those provisions of the latter that foreclose a conditional sentence if serving the sentence in the community would endanger the safety of the community. As noted in R. v. Proulx, this is a prerequisite, amounting to a condition precedent, to invoking the powers of section 742.1. While there is room for applying section 718.2(e) in the context of those provisions of section 742.1 concerning the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing, this is not so of those provisions concerning the safety of the community, at least not as I read Gladue.[64]Morever, as Cory and Iacobucci JJ. observed in Gladue:In describing the effect of 718.2(e) in this way, we do not mean to suggest that, as a general practice, aboriginal offenders must always be sentenced in a manner which gives greatest weight to the principles of restorative justice, and less weight to goals such as deterrence, denunciation, and separation. It is unreasonable to assume that aboriginal peoples themselves do not believe in the importance of these latter goals, and even if they do not, that such goals must not predominate in appropriate cases. Clearly there are some serious offences and some offenders for which and for whom separation, denunciation, and deterrence are fundamentallyrelevant. [p. 729][65]For these reasons, then, I would have given effect to the position taken bythe Attorney General by allowing the appeal, setting side the order made under section 742.1, and extending the term of imprisonment to eighteen months in total.Dated this 1st day of June, 2001._________________CAMERON J.A.[1] At p.100[2] At p. 101"}

He was also placed on probation, and prohibited from driving, for a period of two years.The convictions arose out of a dispute between the appellant and his girlfriend. Feeling betrayed by her, he forced her car, along with that of a male friend of hers, off the road and into the ditch. He acted out of jealousy and anger.On the face of it, it is difficult to say the sentence was unfit. Indeed Judge Orr, who imposed it, carefully considered the matter and strove to achieve a fair balance among the various factors that fell to be taken into account. And judging by the appellant's submission, which in its insight, maturity, and sincerity, greatly impressed each of us, the sentence certainly served the purposes of rehabilitation and specific deterrence. He has now been imprisoned for several months, and the effect upon him has been remarkable.Aside from the need for the sentence to serve other ends, including those of general deterrence and upholding public confidence in the administration of justice, it has already served its purpose. Of that we are sure, in light of what the appellant had to say and the manner in which he said it. He is an intelligent, able, and industrious person, 26 years old, free of alcohol or drug related problems. And given the insight he has now gained into the things of life, he is highly unlikely to re-offend in this or other ways.In all of the circumstances, including those surrounding the commission of these offences, and especially those going to his rehabilitation, we are of the view the appellant's sentence could now be reduced without undermining the need to deter others and uphold public confidence in the administration of justice. Hence we can see no further purpose to be gained in maintaining the term of imprisonment imposed upon him.Accordingly, we are going to allow the appeal in part, not because the sentence was unfit at the time it was imposed, but because the imprisonment component of it is no longer fit, especially in light of the rehabilitative effects imprisonment has had upon the appellant. He has convinced us of this, and in the circumstances we think the ends of the criminal law are best served by now reducing his term of imprisonment to time served. Otherwise the sentence will stand.There will be an order accordingly."}

and(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.718.01 When a court imposes a sentence for an offence that involved the abuse of a person under the age of eighteen years, it shall give primary consideration to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence of such conduct.718.1A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.718.2A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,…(ii.1) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a person under the age of eighteen years,…(iii.1) evidence that the offence had a significant impact on the victim, considering their age and other personal circumstances, including their health and financial situation,…shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;…(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, ….THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES[6]The Crown Attorney asserted that the facts of this case were unique and she could not locate similar sentencing precedents.[7]The Crown position was that the following mitigating factors were present:-guilty plea-remorse-payment of restitution-letter of apology[8]The Crown position was that the following aggravating factors were present:-the theft was from a child therefore s. 718.01 and s. 718.02(ii.1) applied;-the theft had a significant impact on the young victim, as evidenced by the Victim Impact Statement therefore s. 718.02(ii.2) applied;-the theft, while not pre-planned, was contemplated by the accused for some time at the business, as evidenced by his looking around prior to acting;-the accused didn’t need the money;-the accused destroyed the cards; and-the accused had a related prior criminal record[9]The Crown position was that, considering the foregoing, the primary sentence consideration should be denunciation and deterrence.Therefore, the Crown submitted that the appropriate sentence would be thirty (30) days incarceration and probation for one (1) year.[10]The Defence had called Bethany Crocker and Mr. Crocker at the sentence hearing.Bethany Crocker described her husband’s struggles with depression that arose after a workplace injury in 2005.She described his spinal injury as affecting his life significantly and leaving him in pain and unable to work.In relation to the days leading up to the theft, she stated that his treatment had a setback and that he had, apparently inadvertently, not been taking his antidepressant medication.Since the allegations arose, she stated that she and her children have been subjected to public scorn.However, she still supports her husband in any way she can.Mr. Crocker read a letter of apology that he had written to the victim.He also stated that he was sorry for the shame that he has brought on his own family.He could not explain why he did what he did, even though he knew it was wrong.I accept that Mr. Crocker was sincere in his desire to do what he could to make things right.[11]The Defence acknowledged the distasteful nature of crimes involving children and the impact on the victim in this case.[12]The Defence highlighted a number of areas for this Court’s consideration.Mr. Crocker had accepted responsibility immediately upon being confronted with the allegations.He entered a guilty plea at an early stage in the proceeding, after having sought the advice of counsel.[13]The Defence referenced Mr. Crocker’s mental health history since his workplace injury.This was not offered to reduce Mr. Crocker’s culpability below the level of criminal responsibility.Rather, this was meant to frame his actions in light of the fact that he suffers from major depression.[14]The Defence submitted that Mr. Crocker’s single dated prior conviction should not be attributed much weight.[15] The Defence referenced a number of cases that were filed on behalf of Mr. Crocker.These cases were R. v. Stevenson (2012), 325 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R 144 (N.L.T.D), R. v. Edmonds (2012), 322 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R (N.L.C.A), R. v. Roberts (2013), 338 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 116 (N.L.T.D.), R. v. Ismail (1996), 1996 CanLII 6618 (NL SCTD), 139 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 193 (N.L.T.D.), R. v. Fleming (2014), 356 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 236 (N.L.T.D.).[16]The Defence highlighted Mr. Crocker’s actions since the offence and his family support as providing a positive prospect for rehabilitation.[17]The Defence position was that this matter should be dealt with by way of a period of probation attached to a suspended sentence or a conditional; discharge.CASE LAW[18]The parties noted that there was little precedent in the case law for the specific actions of Mr. Crocker.However, theft involving the taking of relatively modest amounts of money are, sadly, not uncommon.The range of sentence that typically applies to matters such as these was recently stated by Judge Gorman in R. v. Roberts, supra, at paragraph 22:22The range of sentence for minor thefts, forgeries and frauds ranges from the imposition of a discharge to relatively short periods of imprisonment when the offender has a related criminal record (see R. v. Prowse (1998), 1998 CanLII 18024 (NL CA), 168 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 289 (Nfld. C.A.), R. v. Hoyles, [2011] N.J. No. 316 (N.L. Prov. Ct.), R. v. Saunders, [2011] N.J. No. 364 (N.L. Prov. Ct.), R. v. C. (C.), [2012] N.J. No. 121 (N.L. Prov. Ct.), R. v. Reid, [2012] N.J. No. 164 (N.L. Prov. Ct.) and R. v. Davis, [2013] N.J. No. 161 (N.L. Prov. Ct.)). A prescriptive range has not been established.[19]In terms of treatment of s. 718.01 of the Criminal Code, our Court of Appeal has recently addressed this in R. v. Branton, 2013 CarswellNfld 378 (N.L.C.A.), beginning at paragraph 25:25This focus on denunciation and deterrence requires an appreciation of these objectives in the context of the facts of the case being decided, which involves an appreciation of the seriousness of the particular offence and the offender's degree of responsibility. It also involves an appreciation of how and why denunciation and specific and general deterrence are important in the context of the particular case. For example, if the abuse is of a minor nature in circumstances which are unlikely to repeat themselves, the degree of emphasis given to deterrence and denunciation would be less. On the other hand, if the abuse is more serious and the offender has a history of committing such offences, deterrence and denunciation would require greater emphasis. In summary, giving \"primary consideration\" to the objectives of denunciation and deterrence requires a meaningful assessment of how the facts of the offence and the circumstances of the offender relate to denunciation and deterrence and an acknowledgement that substantial weight must be given to these objectives so that they are properly vindicated in the sentencing process.[20]In R .v. Branton, our Court of Appeal also provided direction on how to factor in an offender’s mental health, in terms of crafting an appropriate sentence, beginning at paragraph 34:34The general principle articulated in Peters, Edmunds and Lundrigan is that an offender's mental health issues are a relevant factor in his or her sentencing when there is an established connection between an offender's mental health issues and the commission of his or her crimes.35Mental illness covers a broad spectrum of behaviours, and it does not, by itself, absolve an offender of responsibility for an offence (outside of the provisions of section 16 of the Criminal Code) or automatically justify a lighter sentence than would otherwise be appropriate. When an offender has mental health issues, treatment can sometimes be provided to him or her while incarcerated and if probation is ordered, through the imposition of conditions directing that the offender seek medical assistance, participate in treatment programs, and so forth. Such conditions are designed to assist in the offender's rehabilitation and supervise him or her with the objective of preventing him or her from reoffending. These probationary conditions are \"blunt tools\", as Crown counsel put it in argument, and they do not guarantee results.LAW[21]The punishment for theft is provided in s. 334 of the Criminal Code:334.Except where otherwise provided by law, every one who commits theft(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, where the property stolen is a testamentary instrument or the value of what is stolen exceeds five thousand dollars; or(b) is guilty(i) of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or(ii) of an offence punishable on summary conviction,where the value of what is stolen does not exceed five thousand dollars.[22]Absolute and conditional discharges are dealt with in s. 730 of the Criminal Code:730(1) Where an accused, other than an organization, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence, other than an offence for which a minimum punishment is prescribed by law or an offence punishable by imprisonment for fourteen years or for life, the court before which the accused appears may, if it considers it to be in the best interests of the accused and not contrary to the public interest, instead of convicting the accused, by order direct that the accused be discharged absolutely or on the conditions prescribed in a probation order made under subsection 731(2).ANALYSIS[23]Criminal cases involving children are particularly distasteful and often provoke a strong emotional response in the public.This case is no different.As I have been advised, the public has taken an interest in this case and, as a result, Mr. Crocker and, most unfortunately, his wife and children have been subjected to what might be called public shaming.Offenders can expect that their actions have consequences, but his wife and children are blameless.[24]The Crown has submitted that s. 718.01 of the Criminal Code applies as this case involves the abuse of a child under the age of 18.I have not been provided with any precedent in which a Court has included the theft of a child’s birthday cards as a case involving child abuse.The section has primarily been referenced in the sentencing of persons engaged in the sexual or physical abuse of children.In this case, the victim was clearly a child and the impact on him was not insignificant.I, too, accept that abuse can include such things as financial abuse.However, on a meaningful assessment of the relative degree of seriousness of the facts of this case and Mr. Crocker’s degree of responsibility, I have determined that less emphasis needs to be given to deterrence and denunciation.[25]In this case, I have identified a number of mitigating factors, as they relate to the incident of April 25, 2015.Mr. Crocker took responsibility and entered a guilty at a very early stage in the proceedings.He has provided a sincere apology to the victim and his family, as well as paying back the money.Mr. Crocker has suffered from a major depression that originated in a workplace injury, the effects of which he still deals with to this day.His mental illness does not remove the responsibility he must take for his decisions.However, such persons often make decisions that confound logic even with full knowledge of the wrongfulness of their actions.The theft was clearly not planned as few thieves sign up when they attend a location to steal.Mr. Crocker decided to take those cards and this was clearly an exercise in very poor judgement.Even with all of this, his family remains a significant source of support.Given the foregoing, I accept that Mr. Crocker’s prospects for rehabilitation are very good.[26]I have identified several aggravating factors, as they relate to the incident on April 25, 2015.The theft involved a child’s birthday cards.This has resulted in what has been described in the Victim Impact Statement as a loss of innocence for the young victim.Mr. Crocker did not need the money and just destroyed the cards after taking them.Mr. Crocker has a prior, though very dated, record for theft for which he received a suspended sentence and probation.[27]Mr. Crocker’s actions require an appropriate and proportional response from the Court.His actions, while distasteful, must not be dealt with differently from other similar offenders.Without diminishing the significance of his actions, I find that his actions are best described as being in the lower range for such offences.[28]As such, I have determined that Mr. Crocker’s actions do not require a period of custody and other sanctions, short of imprisonment, can appropriately address the fundamental principles of sentence.[29]In terms of the appropriate disposition, I have considered whether a conditional or absolute discharge would be appropriate.Clearly, such sentences are often in an offender’s best interest and this would be true for Mr. Crocker as well.However, such a sentence, given the facts of this case and considering all factors mentioned above, would be contrary to the public interest.[30]Therefore, I am entering a conviction and suspending the passing of sentence.I am imposing a one (1) year period of probation, with the following conditions:-Keep the peace and be of good behaviour, appear before the court when required to do so by the court, notify the court or the probation officer in advance of any change of name or address, and promptly notify the court or the probation officer of any change of employment or occupation.-Report to a probation officer within two working days of your release and thereafter when required and in the manner directed by the probation officer.-Remain within the jurisdiction of the court unless written permission to go outside that jurisdiction is obtained from the court or the probation officer.-Do not contact or communicate in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, with Parker Crowe or his family and remain away from any place where such persons reside.-Attend and participate actively in such awareness or educational or assessment programs or counselling sessions to which you might be referred by your supervisor[31]Finally, a Victim Fine Surcharge of $100.00 is imposed._______________________MARK T.

[2]][2]The respondent, Monica Laliberte, plead guilty to two counts of trafficking in a controlled substance and two counts of possession of the proceeds of the crime of trafficking. She was sentenced to a conditional sentence of imprisonment of 12 months which included four months of electronically monitored house arrest, two years probation and restitution of $120.This was the money she obtained from an undercover agent.[3]The Crown’s application for leave to appeal the conditional sentence raises a number of issues, which although not stated in precisely these terms can be summarized as follows: (1) the standard of appellate review; (2) the fundamental nature of conditional sentences of imprisonment; (3) whether a conditional sentence of imprisonment is an appropriate sentence for trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking; (4) disparity in sentences; and, (5) the principles to be applied in the sentencing of aboriginal offenders pursuant to s. 718.2(e) of the Code.Although from time to time addressed in the past by this Court, these issues need to be re-addressed in light of the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Gladue[3] and R.v. Proulx. [4] I would grant leave for application to appeal.Facts[4]In the summer of 1998 the Prince Albert drug squad carried out an undercover drug operation.An undercover agent contacted the respondent, Monica Laliberte, to buy Dilaudid, a hydromorphone.She sold the undercover agent a total of 13 tablets of Dilaudid on September 17 for a total of $120.[5]Dilaudid is a hydrogenated keytone of morphine, a narcotic analgesic and a controlled drug.It is usually ingested intravenously, is approximately eight times more potent than morphine and the analgesic effect can last three to four hours.Continuous use of the drug can lead to a drug dependency.[6]The respondent is a user of marijuana but does not use Dilaudid. She admitted she sold the pills to make money but claims she was acting as an intermediary for a third party.She was charged and plead guilty to two counts of trafficking in a controlled substance contrary to s. 5(1) of the Act and two counts of possessing the proceeds of the crime of trafficking contrary to s. 8(1) of the Act.The Decision of the Trial Judge[7]Judge H.W. Goliath of the Provincial Court ordered a presentence report and the sentencing was based largely on its recommendations.He sentenced the respondent to a 12 month conditional sentence of imprisonment, which included four months electronically monitored house arrest, followed by two years probation.He also ordered her to pay $120 in restitution.The presentence report detailed that the respondent was an aboriginal offender who abused alcohol and drugs, was a high risk to reoffend (although she was not criminally oriented) and was a good candidate for a conditional sentence.Prior to sentencing, the respondent had presented the probation officer with a good recovery plan that included returning to live in a structured environment with her longtime foster parents and participatingin a native treatment program known as the Self-Discovery Program.She admitted she abused alcohol and marijuana but not Dilaudid.At the time of sentencing the respondent had put in place and was following through on the recovery plan previously presented to her probation officer. She had begun to deal with her alcohol and chemical dependency and was undergoing detoxification and treatment at the time of sentencing. The trial judge took all this into account in imposing the conditional sentence of imprisonment.He stated:So I’m going to follow that recommendation, and – but the sentence is going to be significant.And I’m having in mind also, that if she were sentenced to straight time, in a number of months which I would consider appropriate, she’d likely be out on the street again in a very few months.As it is with this sentence, conditional sentence of twelve months to be followed by two years probation, there’s a three-year period here, during which her movements are going to be quite strictly proscribed [sic].And it’s probably in her interest, and the interests of society, rather than have her do the short time in jail, and then be out.So on the — on all charges, the sentence of twelve months to be served concurrently, and conditionally, in accordance with the terms of a conditional sentence order, the conditions of which will be in addition to the usual.You will have the four months – four-month period of electronic monitoring.The condition, keep the peace, appear before the Court when required, notify the supervisor of change of name or address, et cetera, notify supervisor of any change of employment or occupation, remain within the jurisdiction unless she has written permission to leave, report to the supervisor within two working days, or such other time as the Court orders.Well, I’m ordering that you report forthwith, and thereafter, as required.The conditions of the intensive monitoring portion of the sentence will be as outlined on the attached conditions, dated September – or dated February 15th, reporting to the Intensive Supervision Co-ordinator. [5][8]In addition to the foregoing, the respondent was ordered to refrain from the use or possession of alcohol or non-prescription drugs; to submit to search of her person and residence; and take a drug or treatment program if ordered by the chief probation officer or his designate.The respondent has successfully completed her period of electronically monitored house arrest.Relevant Provisions of the Code:687.(1)Where an appeal is taken against sentence, the court of appeal shall, unless the sentence is one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against, and may on such evidence, if any, as it thinks fit to require or to receive,(a) vary the sentence within the limits prescribed by law for the offence of which the accused was convicted; or(b) dismiss the appeal.718. The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to prove reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.718.2A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:(a)a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,(i)evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on race, national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation, or any other similar factor,(ii)evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s spouse or child,(iii)evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, or(iv)evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal organizationshall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;(b)a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;(c)where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;(d)an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and(e)all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.742.1Where a person is convicted of an offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, and the court(a)imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years, and(b)is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community, and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2.the court may, for the purposes of supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions of a conditional sentence order made under section 742.3.General PrinciplesAppellate Review[9]Section 687(1) of the Criminal Code authorizes an appellate court to consider the fitness of the sentence and to vary the sentence imposed by a trial judge within the limits prescribed by law or to dismiss the appeal.In this province, the standard of appellate review in sentencing matters was established by cases like R. v. Morrissette[6] and R. v. Wenarchuk,[7] among others.The Supreme Court of Canada (hereinafter the Supreme Court) examined the standard of appellate review in sentencing matters in the late 1990s in three decisions:R. v. Shropshire,[8] R. v. M.(C.A.)[9] and R. v. McDonnell. [10][10]In Shropshire, Iacobucci J., speaking for the Court, made it clear that: (1) the sentencing process was a “profoundly subjective process;” (2) trial judges enjoy significant advantages over courts of appeal in sentencing matters; (3) courts of appeal should not be given free reign to modify sentences imposed by trial judges; and, (4) sentences should only be disturbed if the court of appeal is convinced that the sentence imposed is not fit.He defined “not fit”as “clearly unreasonable”.[11]Chief Justice Lamer, in M.(C.A.), specifically adopted and expanded the deferential approach of appellate review developed by the Supreme Court in Shropshire.The Chief Justice noted that s. 717 of the Code vests trial judges with discretion to determine the appropriate degree and kind of punishment or sentence and that the deferential standard of review has “profound functional justifications.” [11]One of those functional justifications is that a sentencing judge enjoys a position of advantage over an appellate judge in being able to assess the submissions of the Crown and the offender.This is because sentencing judges possess unique qualifications of judgment and experience gained by serving in the front lines of the criminal justice system.The Chief Justice pointed out that a sentencing judge will normally reside in or near the community which has suffered the consequences of the offenders actions and will have a sense of the particular sentencing goals that will be “just and appropriate” for the protection of that community. The Chief Justice stated:The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which attemptsto balance carefullythe societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence, while at all times taking into account the needs and current conditions of and in the community. [12]He concluded the discretion of the sentencing judge should not be interfered with lightly and then only for very limited reasons. He summed up by stating that absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor or an over emphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene if the sentence is demonstrably unfit.[12]The Supreme Court returned to the subject in R. v. McDonnell where the deferential approach enunciated in Shropshire and M.(C.A.) was confirmed. Mr. Justice Sopinka, writing for the majority, succinctly summarized the principles of appellate review of sentences as: error of principle by the trial judge; failure to consider a relevant factor; overemphasis of the appropriate factors; and, demonstrable unfitness of the sentence.[13][13]The effect of these three Supreme Court judgments has a profound effect on how we as a court of appeal deal with sentence appeals.Suffice it to say that prior to these decisions, this Court had not followed a “strong deferential approach” to sentence appeals.The result is, as Bayda C.J.S. noted in R. v. Horvath,[14] that the approach to reviewing sentences as set out by this Court in Morrissette and Wenarchuk must now be replaced by the “strong deferential” standard of appellate review as set out by the Supreme Court in Shropshire, M.(C.A.) and McDonnell.Unless the sentencing judge has erred in principle, failed to consider a relevant factor or over emphasized an appropriate factor or imposed a sentence that is demonstrably unfit this court must not intervene.[14]This deferential approach to sentence appeals is apt to produce more individualized sentences and consequently apt to produce a wider disparity of sentences when viewed from the perspective of the “offence” as distinct from the “offender”.Part XXIII - Codification of Sentencing Principles or a New Sentencing Regime[15]On September 3, 1996, Part XXIII of the Criminal Code was amended by the adoption of Bill C-41.[15]In R. v. McDonald[16] I described the long journey which culminated with Parliament’s adoption of Bill C-41. [17]It is not necessary to repeat that chronology here.[16]In R. v. Gladue,[18] a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court described Part XXIII as a “watershed, marking the first codification and significant reform of sentencing principles in the history of Canadian criminal law.Each of the provisions of Part XXIII, ... must be interpreted in its total context taking into account its surrounding provisions”. [19]]Part XXIII of the Code went beyond the mere codification and reformulation of traditional principles of sentencing in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code.It established an entirely new system of sentencing and a new form of sentence – a conditional sentence of imprisonment, which permits an offender to serve a sentence of imprisonment in the community rather than in prison.In the opinion of Justices Cory and Iacobucci:The availability of the conditional sentence of imprisonment, in particular, alters the sentencing landscape in a manner which gives an entirely new meaning to the principle that imprisonment should be resorted to only where no other sentencing option is reasonable in the circumstances.The creation of the conditional sentence suggests, on its face, a desire to lessen the use of incarceration.The general principle expressed in s. 718.2(e) must be construed and applied in this light. [20][17]Subsections 718.2(d) and (e) and 742.1 leave no doubt that the amendments to the Code represent a fundamental shift in sentencing – a shift away from incarceration to both a wider range of punitive responses and to a restorative model involving more community-based sentencing.Those subsections provide that imprisonment is to be used as a last resort.While it has been the stated policy of the Government of Canada since 1984[21] that imprisonment should be used as a last resort, the reality is otherwise.[18]A core issue in Gladue was whether Part XXIII and in particular ss. 718.2 (d) and (e) of Part XXIII are remedial in nature.The Supreme Court found not only that the purpose of Part XXIII was remedial but that all the provisions of Part XXIII are to be given a fair, large, and liberal interpretation in order to attain that remedial objective.The remedial component of the sentencing provisions is an endeavour to achieve a fit and proper sentence in the particular case, not only for aboriginal offenders, but for all offenders.[19]The Supreme Court also strongly rejected the argument that s. 718.2 is merely a restatement or codification of the existing sentencing law either with respect to the general principles of restraint on the use of imprisonment or on the specific direction regarding aboriginal offenders.The Court stated:In our view, s. 718.2(e) is more than simply a re-affirmation of existing sentencing principles.The remedial component of the provision consists not only in the fact that it codifies a principle of sentencing, but far more importantly, in its direction to sentencing judges to undertake the process of sentencing aboriginal offenders differently, in order to endeavour to achieve a truly fit and proper sentence in the particular case.It should be said that the words of s. 718.2(e) do not alter the fundamental duty of the sentencing judge to impose a sentence that is fit for the offence and the offender.For example, as we will discuss below, it will generally be the case as a practical matter that particularly violent and serious offences will result in imprisonment for aboriginal offenders as often as for non-aboriginal offenders.What s. 718.2(e) does alter is the method of analysis which each sentencing judge must use in determining the nature of a fit sentence for an aboriginal offender.In our view, the scheme of Part XXIII of the Criminal Code, the context underlying the enactment of s. 718.2(e), and the legislative history of the provision all support an interpretation of s. 718.2(e) as having this important remedial purpose. [22]This interpretation is important to keep in mind when considering the issue of disparity of sentences.Conditional Sentence of Imprisonment[20]Section 742.1 is a self contained sentencing regime that, for the first time, introduces a provision in the Code permitting an offender in certain circumstances to serve his [23] sentence of imprisonment in the community rather than in prison. This provision is contained within the broad remedial purpose and context of Part XXIII and was designed by Parliament to achieve the objectives of reducing the use of prisons and expanding the use of restorative justice.A conditional sentence of imprisonment incorporates some elements of a non-custodial sentence and some of a custodial sentence.It will generally be more effective in achieving restorative goals of sentencing than a carceral sentence because it is served in the community.It is however a punitive sanction and therefore capable of satisfying the objectives of denunciation and deterrence.It is this punitive aspect that distinguishes the conditional sentence from probation. [24][21]The imposition of a conditional sentence must be approached in a principled way to ensure the sanction is used as a clear alternative to incarceration and not merely as a substitute for community-based sanctions such as fines, probation, community service and absolute and conditional discharges.To do otherwise will result in net widening which occurs when an offender who would otherwise have received a community-based sanction is sentenced to a conditional sentence of imprisonment.[22]InMcDonald (for the majority on this branch of the appeal), I described the operation of s. 742.1 in some detail.That analysis was adopted and expanded upon by Bayda C.J.S. speaking for a unanimous Court in Horvath.That analysis has since the hearing of this appeal been overtaken and modified by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Proulx[25] to the extent that the two stage approach that we utilized to determine whether a conditional sentence should be imposed has been modified by the use of a more flexible two stage approach.It is useful however to compare the two approaches because in the final analysis they do not differ greatly.Both approaches require that the trial judge determine whether the statutory prerequisites set out in s. 742.1 are satisfied before deciding whether a conditional sentence of imprisonment would be consistent with the principles of sentencing contained in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Code.The fundamental difference is that in Proulx the trial judge determines the length of the term of imprisonment and thevenue, that is, whether to impose a conditional sentence, in the second stage of the inquiry.[23]Chief Justice Bayda approached the interpretation of s. 742.1 in Horvath slightly differently than the Supreme Court in Proulx.Bayda C.J.S. found the sentencing judge must first decide a “foundation” question before deciding whether a conditional sentence of imprisonment may be imposed.That question is whether the judge should impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years as opposed to a non-carceral punishment such as a fine,probation, or community service.The foundational or threshold decision is not made pursuant to s. 742.1 but in accordance with the sentencing principles is now found in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Code.It is one that sentencing judges have always been required to make.The sentencing judge is required by ss. 718.2(d) and (e) to consider all alternatives to imprisonment prior to imposing a sentence of imprisonment.As will be seen , the Supreme Court of Canada found that at this first stage all the trial judge need decide is whether the sentence falls within the range of two years less a day as opposed to a non-carceral punishment such as a fine, probation or community service.That basic or fundamental decision must be made before a sentencing judge can consider whether to impose a conditional sentence of imprisonment.If the sentencing judge decides that imprisonment of less than two years is the appropriate sanction and that the alternatives to imprisonment are not appropriate then, and only then, is s. 742.1 engaged and the trial judge required to decide the other prerequisites.[24]Chief Justice Lamer, speaking for the court in Proulx, stated that a rigid two step approach:“does not correspond to the reality of sentencing. . .A judge does not impose a fixed sentence of ‘x months’ in the abstract without having in mind where the sentence will be served”. [26]In his opinion, a rigid two step approach could not have been intended by Parliament.He said:Rather, it was included to identify the type of offenders who could be entitled to a conditional sentence. At one end of the range, Parliament denied the possibility of a conditional sentence for offenders who should receive a penitentiary term. At the other end, Parliament intended to ensure that offenders who were entitled to a more lenient community measure ‑‑ such as a suspended sentence with probation ‑‑did not receive a conditional sentence, a harsher sanction in this legislative scheme. [27][25]In the opinion of the Chief Justice, there was a paradox in the rigid two step approach in which the trial judge fixed the appropriate custodial sentence and then decided that serving the sentence in the community was still consistent with the fundamental principles of sentencing as outlined in the Code.In his opinion, the resolution of that paradox could be resolved in this way:58. . . Hence, a purposive interpretation of s. 742.1(a) does not dictate a rigid two‑step approach in which the judge would first have to impose a term of imprisonment of a fixed duration and then decide if that fixed term of imprisonment can be served in the community. In my view, the requirement that the court must impose a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years can be fulfilled by a preliminary determination of the appropriate range of available sentences. Thus, the approach I suggest still requires the judge to proceed in two stages. However, the judge need not impose a term of imprisonment of a fixed duration at the first stage of the analysis. Rather, at this stage, the judge simply has to exclude two possibilities: (a) probationary measures; and (b) a penitentiary term. If either of these sentences is appropriate, then a conditional sentence should not be imposed.59In making this preliminary determination, the judge need only consider the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2 to the extent necessary to narrow the range of sentence for the offender. The submissions of the parties, although not binding, may prove helpful in this regard. For example, both parties may agree that the appropriate range of sentence is a term of imprisonment of less than two years. [28][26]In other words, at this stage the sentencing judge determines the appropriate range of sentence, not the precise term of the sentence.If the sentence falls within the appropriate range the first prerequisite is established and the sentencing judge then moves to the next step and determines the remaining prerequisite.[27]For convenience I will repeat the provision.Section 742.1 reads as follows:742.1Imposing of conditional sentence — Were a person is convicted of an offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, and the court(a)imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years, and(b)is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2,the court may, for the purposes of supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions of a conditional sentence order made under section 742.3.The section makes it clear that there are three prerequisites which must be satisfied (after the sentencing judge has decided that a sentence of imprisonment is the appropriate sentence) before a sentencing judge can order a conditional sentence of imprisonment.Those conditions are:1. the offence must not be punishable by a minimum sentence of imprisonment under the Code;2.the sentence of imprisonment imposed must be for less than two years; and,3.the safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender serving the sentence in the community.The second prerequisite (or the third if one counts the requirement that the offencenot be one punishable by a minimum sentence) the sentencing judge must decide whether the offender by serving the sentence of imprisonment in the community, would endanger the safety of the community.If the sentencing judge concludes that the offender would endanger the safety of the community, he or she must not impose a conditional sentence ofimprisonment.The sentencing judge must be satisfied that the safety of the community will not be in danger.The issue is whether the individual offender poses a risk to society while serving his sentence in the community.The Chief Justice held there are two considerations which mustbe taken into account in determining that issue: (1) the risk of the offender of re-offending; and, (2) the gravity of the damage that could issue in the event of a re-offence. [29]The factors that trial courts should consider when assessing the risk were described in R. v. Maheu. [30]They include:whether the offender is likely to abide by the order; the nature of the offence; the circumstances of the offence; the degree of participation by the accused; the relationship of the accused with the victim; the profile of the accused including lifestyle, occupation and criminal record; conduct following the offence and the danger the offender represents to the community affected by the offence. These factors are a useful indica but are not exhaustive.The determination of the risk that the offender poses to the community must be decided in each case on its own facts.[28]The Chief Justice stated in Proulx that the risk of re-offending should also be assessed in light of the conditions that are to be attached to the conditional sentence.The tougher the conditions in the order, the less likely the offender is to re-offend.The risk assessment should not be restricted to a consideration of a physical or psychological danger but should be construed broadly andcouldinclude economic interests.[29]Once the sentencing judge determines that all the prerequisites have been satisfied, the first stage of the inquiry is complete.The sentencing judge then proceeds to the second stage of the inquiry.Here, he or she must determine whether the imposition of a conditional sentence of imprisonment would be consistent with the principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.It is at this stage of the inquiry that: (1) theprinciples of sentencing are considered comprehensively; (2) the duration and venue of the sentence are to be determined; and, (3) if a conditional sentence of imprisonment is to be imposed, what conditions are to be contained in the order. [31][30]This approach gives effect to the legislative scheme chosen by Parliament in s. 742.1 and is consistent with and gives effect to the purposes and objectives contained in ss. 718 to 718.2.A complete consideration of the principles contained in ss.718 to 718.2 will therefore determine whether the accused should serve his sentence in jail or in the community subject to the mandatory anddiscretionary conditions contained in s.742.1(3) of the Code.[31]A number of additional comments are necessary to understand this concept more fully.1.Are conditional sentences prohibited for any offences?[32]The Supreme Court dealt withthis matter extensively in Proulx and pointed out that section 742.1 does not restrict the use of a conditional sentence of imprisonment to a particular class of offences. [32]The only restrictions on the use of a conditional sentence are that there must be no minimum sentence of imprisonment mandated for the particular offence for which the offender has been convicted and the sentence must be less than two years.Thus, a conditional sentence is available for all offences in which the statutory prerequisites are satisfied.[33]In my opinion, a conditional sentence of imprisonment should not be restricted to minor offences or property offences.The sentence should be used in appropriate circumstances for all offences including drug offences and offences against the person.This is always subject to the qualification that the statutory prerequisites have been satisfied and that ordering the offender to serve the sentence in the community will not put the collectivity at risk and in danger.The type of offence or the gravity of the offence should not determine whether a conditional sentence of imprisonment is available.Rather, the sentence should be tailored to the offender, having regard to the principles and purposes of sentencing, the moral blameworthiness of the offender, the circumstances of the offence, the current needs of the community and the interests of public security in the same way a sentencing judge would decide any sentence of imprisonment.A conditional sentence of imprisonment is appropriate for any prison sentence of less than two years (subject to the above qualifications) and the goals of deterrence and denunciation can be met by serving the sentence in the community.Chief Justice Lamer put it this way in Proulx:81In my view, while the gravity of such offences is clearly relevant to determining whether a conditional sentence is appropriate in the circumstances, it would be both unwise and unnecessary to establish judicially created presumptions that conditional sentences are inappropriate for specific offences. Offence‑specific presumptions introduce unwarranted rigidity in the determination of whether a conditional sentence is a just and appropriate sanction. Such presumptions do not accord with the principle of proportionality set out in s. 718.1 and the value of individualization in sentencing, nor are they necessary to achieve the important objectives of uniformity and consistency in the use of conditional sentences. [33]2.Factors to Consider in Imposing a Conditional Sentence[34]The Code contains no guidance as to what factors or principles are to be applied to determine whether the sentence should be served in the community.Section 742.1 provides that the court “may, for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community,” subject to certain conditions.Just as there are no statutory provisions on which to rely to determine whether an accused would be a danger to the community if the sentence is served in the community, s. 742.1 does not set out what factors are to be used to decide whether a conditional sentence should be imposed. [34] Section 742.1(b) was amended to provide that the sentencing judge, in deciding this issue, must be satisfied the decision is also be consistent with the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.In Proulx, the Chief Justice in describing the principles to be applied for imposing a conditional sentence of imprisonment, stated that “serious consideration should be given to imposing a conditional sentence of imprisonment in all cases where the three statutory prerequisites are satisfied.” [35]He pointed out that “a failure to advert to the possibilityof a conditional sentence where there are reasonable grounds for finding that the three statutory prerequisites have been met “may well constitute reversible error.” [36]The Chief Justice concluded that s.718(2)(e) clearly exerts aninfluence on a trial judge when deciding whether to impose a conditional sentence as opposed to a custodial sentence.The Chief Justice stated:96Both ss. 718.2(d) and 718.2(e) seek to vindicate the important objective of restraint in the use of incarceration. However, neither seeks to do so at all costs. Section 718.2(d) provides that \"an offender should not be deprived of liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances\" (emphasis added). Section 718.2(e) provides that \"all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered\" (emphasis added). In my view, a determination of when less restrictive sanctions are \"appropriate\" and alternatives to incarceration \"reasonable\" in the circumstances requires a consideration of the other principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.297In determining which principles favour of a conditional sentence and which favour incarceration, it is necessary to consider again the nature and purpose of the conditional sentence. Through an appreciation of Parliament's intention in enacting this new sanction and the mischief it seeks to redress, trial judges will be better able to make appropriate use of this innovative tool.98The conditional sentence, as I have already noted, was introduced in the amendments to Part XXIII of the Code. Two of the main objectives underlying the reform of Part XXIII were the reduce the use of incarceration as a sanction and to give greater prominence to the principles of restorative justice in sentencing ‑‑ the objectives of rehabilitation, reparation to the victim and the community, and the promotion of a sense of responsibility in the offender.99The conditional sentence facilitates the achievement of both of Parliament's objectives. It affords the sentencing judge the opportunity to craft a sentence with appropriate conditions that can lead to the rehabilitation of the offender, reparations to the community, and the promotion of a sense of responsibility in ways that jail cannot. However, it is also a punitive sanction. Indeed, it is the punitive aspect of a conditional sentence that distinguishes it from probation. As discussed above, it was not Parliament's intention that offenders who would otherwise have gone to jail for up to two years less a day now be given probation or some equivalent thereof.100Thus, a conditional sentence can achieve both punitive and restorative objectives. To the extent that both punitive and restorative objectives can be achieved in a given case, a conditional sentence is likely a better sanction than incarceration. Where the need for punishment is particularly pressing, and there is little opportunity to achieve any restorative objectives, incarceration will likely be the more attractive sanction. However, even where restorative objectives cannot be readily satisfied, a conditional sentence will be preferable to incarceration in cases where a conditional sentence can achieve the objectives of denunciation and deterrence as effectively as incarceration. This follows from the principle of restraint in s. 718.2(d) and (e), which militates in favour of alternatives to incarceration where appropriate in the circumstances. [37]Can a conditional sentence of imprisonment satisfy the objectives and principles of sentencing?A. Denunciation[35]At this stage of the inquiry the sentence must be consistent with the principles of sentencing in ss. 718 to 718.2.In making the decision to impose a conditional sentence of imprisonment, the sentencing judge should take into account that forms of constraint or deprivation of liberty other than imprisonment can satisfy the purposes and objects of sentencing contained in ss. 718 to 718.2.The principle of denunciation, which is the communication of society’s condemnation of the offender’s conduct, can be achieved without a custodial sentence.Incarceration will provide more denunciation than a conditional sentence of imprisonment but a conditional sentence which deprives or restricts an offender’s liberty such as electronically monitored house arrest or a curfew can effectively satisfy those principles.The Chief Justice made it clear that this is particularly true when the conditions restricting an offender’s liberty are punitive and his liberty is severely restricted.Severe restrictions on the offenders liberty are to be the norm and not the exception.[36]Professor Manson puts it this way in Finding a Place for Conditional Sentences: [38]The need to denounce is at the heart of the decision to use the conditional sentence or to incarcerate.To philosophers, denunciation may be part of the retributive arsenal as in the Hegelian view of annulment and assertion of the violated right.Others have described the “moral education” aspect of denunciation as being a utilitarian forward-looking goal.Our Supreme Court, recently distinguished between retribution and denunciation:The objective of denunciation mandates that a sentence should also communicate society’s condemnation of that particular offender’s conduct...in addition to attaching negative consequences to undesirable behaviour, judicial sentences should also be imposed in a manner which positively instills the basic set of communal values shared by all Canadians as expressed by the Criminal Code.. . .Regardless of how one explains denunciation, it is an expressive goal.Denunciation signifies a communal message about the gravity of the offence in general or the gravity of a particular offence as shaped by a characteristic of the offender.The goal of the expressive message is to promote fundamental values.It may only remind us of how we condemn certain conduct. [39][37]The Supreme Court makes it clear that the principle of denunciation can be satisfied by the imposition of punitive conditions in the conditional sentencing order.The Supreme Court states that these punitive orders should be the norm, not the exception (how this comports with the stated objective of encouraging the use of the principles of restorative justice is left to our imaginations.)Second, a term of imprisonment which would be longer that a custodial sentence would also satisfy that requirement.Finally, the Supreme Court notes that the stigma of house arrest cannot be underestimated.B.Deterrence[38]I have long questioned the effectiveness of custodial sentences as a deterrent to reducing and controlling the rate of crime.I first expressed doubts on its effect in 1989 in R. v. McGinn[40] and later in R. v. McLeod.[41]The Supreme Court has now stated in Proulx that “[J]udges should be wary, however, of placing too much weight on deterrence”.[42]C. Restorative Justice Objectives[39]The Supreme Court makes it clear in Proulx that a conditional sentence is “generally better suited to achieving the restorative objectives of rehabilitation, reparations and promotion of a sense of responsibility in the offender”. [43]Prison does not normally correlate with restorative justice.4.Where Will the Sentence be Served – in Prison or in the Community?[40]In my opinion, and as the Supreme Court makes clear in Proulx, Parliament did not intend the offender to be liberated on a conditional sentence without the imposition of any controls or constraints.Even if his sentence is being served in the community, the offender remains under the control of the correctional system.This is made clear by ss. 742.6(9)(d) which gives the court the power to terminate the conditional sentence and order the offender “be committed to custody until the expiration of the sentence.”The offender’s liberty is restricted for the full term of the sentence.The offender has a greater degree of freedom and liberty only because the conditions of his imprisonment have been changed from the physical confinement of a prison to the restraints imposed on the offender’s movements in the community.[41]This changed milieu in which the offender serves the sentence is similar to conditional release. Just as in conditional release, a conditional sentence of imprisonment does not change the term of imprisonment, it represents a change in the conditions under which the sentence is served.Chief Justice Lamer described the effect of such a community-based sentence in M.(C.A.) when dealing with conditional release:But even though the conditions of incarceration are subject to change through a grant of parole to the offender’s benefit, the offender’s sentence continues in full effect.The offender remains under the strict control of the parole system, and the offender’s liberty remains significantly curtailed for the full duration of the offender’s numerical or life sentence.[44]Thus, the conditional sentence of imprisonment directs how, where, and under what conditions the sentence will be served.5.Conclusion[42]A sentence under s. 742.1 is not just a choice between imprisonment or not.It is a community-based sentence that permits a great deal of creativity for fulfilling the objectives outlined in ss. 718 to 718.2as well as establishing consequences for a breach of the sentence.That creativity is fostered by the element of control the offender is subjected to during his sentence under s. 742.3(1).That section of the Code specifically provides that the court shall prescribe certain mandatory conditions as a condition of the imposition of a conditional sentence.Section 742.3(2) contains optional conditions that a sentencing judge may prescribe to enhance the control.Those optional conditions are or can be punitive in nature and are a further measure of control such as: ordering the accused to abstain from the use of alcohol or drugs; to attend a treatment program; community service; or, intensive probation supervision, which could include electronically monitored house arrest to further the rehabilitation of the offender and to prevent the commission of similar offences.Parliament, in a typically Canadian way, has tried to blend traditional retributive goals of sentencing with concepts of restorative justice.[43]If one approaches the imposition of a conditional sentence in this logical manner, one is less tempted to use a sanction designed to replace imprisonment as an alternative to appropriate existing community-based sanctions or alternative measures, and net widening should be reduced if not eliminated.Sentencing of Aboriginal Offenders[44]In R. v. Gladue,[45] the Supreme Court considered the sentencing provisions applicable to aboriginal offenders contained in ss. 718 to 718.2 and in particular, s. 718.2(e). The Court considered the proper interpretation of those sections which dealwith the purpose and principles of sentencing within the legislative scheme and context of Part XXIII. This decision is a “watershed.”The Supreme Court decided that the broad purpose of s. 718.2(e) is clear — it applies to all offenders — and imprisonment is to be the sanction of last resort.Imprisonment is to be used only where no other sanctions or combination of sanctions are appropriate.The purpose of s. 718.2(e) is to respond to the problem of over incarceration in Canada.[45]In construing s. 718.2(e) it is particularly instructive to note what the Supreme Court did not decide.First, it did not accept the argument advanced by some that the section would create a two-tiered sentencing system.Second, it did not decide that Parliament intended to prefer certain categories of offenders over others.Third, the Court rejected the argument that aboriginal offenders must be treated the same as non-aboriginal offenders.It said:It would be unreasonable to assume that Parliament intended sentencing judges to prefer certain categories of offenders over others.Neither can the phrase [with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders] be merely an instruction to a sentencing judge to consider the circumstances of aboriginal offenders just as she or he would consider the circumstances of any other offender.There would be no point in adding a special reference to aboriginal offenders if this was the case.Rather, the logical meaning to be derived from the special reference to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders, juxtaposed as it is against a general direction to consider “the circumstances” for all offenders, is that sentencing judges should pay particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders because those circumstances are unique, and different from those of non-aboriginal offenders.The fact that the reference to aboriginal offenders is contained in s. 718.2(e), in particular, dealing with restraint in the use of imprisonment, suggests that there is something different about aboriginal offenders which may specifically make imprisonment a less appropriate or less useful sanction. [46][46]Gladue makes it clear that the modifications to Part XXIII, and in particular, conditional sentences of imprisonment have altered the sentencing landscape and have given new meaning to the principle that imprisonment should only be used as a last resort.The creation of the conditional sentence of imprisonment, suggests a desire on the part of Parliament to lessen the use of incarceration, a concept the Supreme Court clearly approves, and one which I endorse.Indeed, I have no choice but to endorse it.[47]Those provisions found in s. 742.1 et seq. concerning a conditional sentence of imprisonment coupled with ss. 718.2(d), (e) and (f) focus upon restorative goals of sentencing: repairing harm suffered by individual victims and the community as a whole; promoting a sense of accountability; and, attempting to rehabilitate or heal the offender.Restorative sentencing goals generally do not include imprisonment as a preferred sanction.The Supreme Court stated:In our view, Parliament’s choice to include (e) and (f) alongside the traditional sentencing goals must be understood as evidencing an intention to expand the parameters of the sentencing analysis for all offenders.The principle of restraint expressed in s. 718.2(e) will necessarily be informed by this re-orientation. [47][48]Before proceeding further with this analysis let me address what I mean by restorative justice.Restorative justice has been defined as the creation of a positive environment for change, healing and reconciliation for offenders, victims and communities.It is a condemnation of criminal actions rather than perpetrators and an integration of offenders into the community rather than a stigmatization or marginalization of them.Within this framework the offender is encouraged to accept responsibility and to make reparations to the community.The restorative approach defines crime as a violation of one person by another and focuses on problem solving and the repair of social injury.It is a system in which the community is facilitator, where restoration is used as a means of reconciling the parties, and where the liability to the victim is recognized and redressed. [48][49]This restorative paradigm is contrasted with the retributive paradigm which focuses on crime as a violation of the state, establishes blame, imposes penalties to deter future crime and marginalizes the perpetrator. Professor Healy of the Faculty of Law at the University of McGill has described the two paradigms in this way:“rehabilitation is taking something bent and making it straight, restoration is taking someone who is sick and making him well.”In Gladue, the Supreme Court expressly approved the restorative approach, one which I have advocated for some time in such cases as R. v. McLeod[49] and R. v. McDonald. [50][50]Thus, the proper interpretation of s. 718.2(e) within the context of Part XXIII is that it has a remedial purpose for all offenders and a particular remedial role for aboriginal offenders.Section 718.2(e) creates a judicial duty to “give its remedial purposes real force.” [51]The Minister of Justice clearly indicated in his statement before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs that Parliament had singled out aboriginal offenders because of their over representation in the prison population.He said:[T]he reason we referred specifically there to aboriginal persons is that they are sadly overrepresented in the prison populations of Canada.I think it was the Manitoba justice inquiry that found that although aboriginal persons make up only 12% of the population of Manitoba, they comprise over 50% of the prison inmates.Nationally aboriginal persons represent about 2% of Canada’s population, but they represent 10.6% of persons in prison.Obviously there’s a problem here.What we’re trying to do, particularly having regard to the initiatives in the aboriginal communities to achieve community justice, is to encourage courts to look at alternatives where it’s consistent with the protection of the public – alternatives to jail – and not simply resort to that easy answer in every case. [52][51]Gladue examines, in some considerable detail, the issue of over representation of aboriginal peoples in our jails[53] and concludes that the situation cries out for recognition and for “responses to alleviate it”. [54]The Supreme Court points out that the high levels of incarceration in Canada are no doubt due in part to the view held by many sentencing judges that a restorative approach to sentencing is a lenient sentencing option.This is due, in my opinion, to a presumption perceived by many judges that incarceration is the norm in sentencing and that non-carceral sentences are exceptions to that norm.The custodial presumption has been expressed in a number of ways but is usually expressed under the guise of a public interest requirement that imprisonment is necessary for certain offences. [55][52]The assumption made by many sentencing judges that the restorative approach to sentencing is more lenient is false, particularly for sentences of less than two years.The rejection of the restorative approach is usually presented by the sentencing judge as a need to enhance confidence in the administration of justice by the imposition of punitive custodial sentences.But in reality a restorative sentence may be more severe than a retributive sentence.This is especially true when one takes into account such factors as the inapplicability of earned statutory release and the mandatory and discretionary terms contained in probation orders or orders imposed for a conditional sentence of imprisonment.[53]In Gladue, Justices Cory and Iacobucci discussed the role of the sentencing judge and the unique circumstances of aboriginal offenders.They said:The role of the judge who sentences an aboriginal offender is, as for every offender, to determine a fit sentence taking into account all the circumstances of the offence, the offender, the victims, and the community.Nothing in Part XXIII of the Criminal Code alters this fundamental duty as a general matter.However, the effect of s. 718.2(e), viewed in the context of Part XXIII as a whole, is to alter the method of analysis which sentencing judges must use in determining a fit sentence for aboriginal offenders.Section 718.2(e) requires that sentencing determinations take into account the unique circumstances of aboriginal peoples.. . .[T]he circumstances of aboriginal offenders are markedly different from those of other offenders, being characterized by unique systemic and background factors.Further, an aboriginal offender’s community will frequently understand the nature of a just sanction in a manner significantly different from that of many non-aboriginal communities.In appropriate cases, some of the traditional sentencing objectives will be correspondingly less relevant in determining a sentence that is reasonable in the circumstances, and the goals of restorative justice will quite properly be given greater weight.Through its reform of the purpose of sentencing in s. 718, and through its specific directive to judges who sentence aboriginal offenders, Parliament has, more than ever before, empowered sentencing judges to craft sentences in a manner which is meaningful to aboriginal peoples. [56][54]The sentencing judge must, as he or she would do with a non-aboriginal offender, consider the background and systemic factors which are important for sentencing the aboriginal offender.The Supreme Court made it clear that systemic and background factors are important elements in the incidence of crime and recidivism for non-aboriginal offenders and are equally important in the determination of appropriate sentences for aboriginal offenders.In the case of aboriginal offenders, those factors will include the “unique background and systemic factors” which played a part in the offender’s criminal behaviour.If those factors played a significant role in the commission of the offence the sentencing judge must consider them in determining whether a sentence of imprisonment would actually deter or denounce the crime in a meaningful way.[55]How then does the sentencing judge determine a fit sentence under s. 718.2(e)? The role of a sentencing judge does not change when sentencing an aboriginal offender or a non-aboriginal offender.The sentencing judge must determine a fit sentence by taking into account all relevant circumstances of the offence, the offender, the victim or victims and the community.Although s. 718.2(e) requires that imprisonment be used as a last resort for all offenders in determining the appropriate penalty for an aboriginal offender, the section requires that the sentencing judge also take into account the unique systemic and background factors of the offender.[56]To begin with, two comments must be made.First, it is not intended as a general rule that sentences for aboriginal and non-aboriginals must necessarily be different.The Supreme Court makes it clear that it is unreasonable to assume that aboriginal peoples do not believe in the traditional sentencing goals of deterrence, denunciation and separation where necessary.A restorative approach will, therefore, not always result in a non-carceral penalty.Secondly, for serious offences where imprisonment must be considered the appropriate sentence, it is more likely that the terms of imprisonment for aboriginals and non-aboriginals will be similar if not the same, even taking into account the different concepts of sentencing.The similarities are likely to increase proportionally with the seriousness and level of violence of the offence.[57]It is also worth noting that the Supreme Court specifically commented that neither aboriginal offenders nor their communities have been well served by the over incarceration of aboriginal offenders.The Court also noted that the principles of restorative justice or community-based sanctions coincide with the aboriginal concept of sentencing.Indeed, as I noted above when dealing with conditional sentences of imprisonment, serving the sentence in the community can often fulfill the denunciatory and deterrent goals of sentencing more effectively than a sentence of imprisonment.The goals of restorative justice should in appropriate cases be given at least as much and arguably more weight when sentencing an aboriginal offender than the purposes of sentencing in ss. 718 to 718.2.[58]What then are the procedural implications which arise as a result of Gladue?In my opinion, the decision has created a duty on all sentencing judges to consider the unique systemic circumstances and background of aboriginal offenders when determining the appropriate sentence.This can only happen if the Crown, the defence bar and all other agencies in the criminal justice system, such as probation officers and youth court workers, provide sentencing judges with the information necessary to enable them to make the decisions required under s. 718.2(e).In any event, the Supreme Court made it clear that there is no discretion about whether to consider the unique situation of aboriginal offenders. [57]Those factors must be considered when deciding the appropriate sentence of an aboriginal offender.[59]Section 718.2(e) requires a sentencing judge to conduct a three step inquiry to determine whether an aboriginal offender should be incarcerated.The sentencing judge must: (1) examine the unique systemic or background circumstances common to aboriginal offenders as a group; (2) consider the particular circumstances of the offender which resulted in him committing the crime for which he is before the court; and, (3) then decide, having regard for the information obtained in steps (1) and (2),whether incarceration is required for the particular aboriginal offender before the court.The Supreme Court described the procedure to be followed in these terms:As with all sentencing decisions, the sentencing of aboriginal offenders must proceed on an individual (or a case-by-case) basis:For this offence, committed by this offender, harming this victim, in this community, what is the appropriate sanction under the Criminal Code?What understanding of criminal sanctions is held by the community?What is the nature of the relationship between the offender and his or her community?What combination of systemic or background factors contributed to this particular offender coming before the courts for this particular offence?How has the offender who is being sentenced been affected by, for example, substance abuse in the community, or poverty, or overt racism, or family or community breakdown?Would imprisonment effectively serve to deter or denounce crime in a sense that would be significant to the offender and community, or are crime prevention and other goals better achieved through healing?What sentencing options present themselves in these circumstances?The analysis for sentencing aboriginal offenders, as for all offenders, must be holistic and designed to achieve a fit sentence in the circumstances.There is no single test that a judge can apply in order to determine the sentence.The sentencing judge is required to take into account all of the surrounding circumstances regarding the offence, the offender, the victims, and the community, including the unique circumstances of the offender as an aboriginal person.Sentencing must proceed with sensitivity to and understanding of the difficulties aboriginal people have faced with both the criminal justice system and society at large.When evaluating these circumstances in light of the aims and principles of sentencing as set out in Part XXIII of the Criminal Code and in the jurisprudence, the judge must strive to arrive at a sentence which is just and appropriate in the circumstances.By means of s. 718.2(e), sentencing judges have been provided with a degree of flexibility and discretion to consider in appropriate circumstances alternative sentences to incarceration which are appropriate for the aboriginal offender and community and yet comply with the mandated principles and purpose of sentencing.In this way, effect may be given to the aboriginal emphasis upon healing and restoration of both the victim and the offender. [58]Within that framework the sentencing judge therefore must be provided with the following information on a sentencing hearing:1) Whether the offender is aboriginal, that is, someone who comes within the scope of s. 25 of the Charter and s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982;2) What band or community or reserve the offender comes from and whether the offender lives on or off the reserve or in an urban or rural setting.This information should also include particulars of the treatment facilities, the existence of a justice committee, and any alternative measures or community- based programs.3) Whether the offender has been affected by:a) substance abuse in the community;b) alcohol abuse in the community;c) poverty;d) overt racism;e) family or community breakdown.4) Whether imprisonment would effectively deter or denounce crime in the subject community.Within this heading it would be useful for the Court to determine whether or not crime prevention can be better served by principles of restorative justice or by imprisonment.5) What sentencing options exist in the community at large and in the offender’s community.For example, does an alternative measures program exist in the offender’s community if he lives on a reserve?[60]The sentencing judge must also be provided with general information concerning systemic poverty, alcohol and substance abuse, cultural and racial bias in the community at large.As well, the sentencing judge must receive information concerning the particular circumstances surrounding the offence. [59][61]The Supreme Court suggested that to accomplish the sentencing task, it would be necessary for the sentencing judge to “take judicial notice of the systemic or background factors and the approach to sentencing which is relevant to aboriginal offenders.” [60]This raises an evidentiary issue which is problematic.Surely in the context of this judgment Justices Cory and Iacobucci are not suggesting that the systemic or background factors are so “notorious” in general as to be capable of proof without evidence or that they can be verified by resort to reports of indisputable accuracy [61] and applied the particular facts.[62]The systemic cultural and background factors to which Justices Cory and Iacobucci refer are set out in great detail in Gladue.All the factors described are conclusions of fact taken from texts, articles, studies, or commissions of inquiry on aboriginal problems, including, the Report of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba, and The Justice System and Aboriginal People. [62]Those factors were described as:Years of dislocation and economic development have translated, for many aboriginal peoples, into low incomes, high unemployment, lack of opportunities and options, lack or irrelevance of education, substance abuse, loneliness, and community fragmentation.These and other factors contribute to a higher incidence of crime and incarceration. [63]It will be necessary forthe sentencing judge to take into account those factors which have been demonstrated as having caused or contributed to the aboriginal offender being before the court.[63]The issue of how to deal with discrimination of aboriginal peoples was examined by the Supreme Court in R. v. Williams[64] in the context of a challenge for cause, where the issue was widespread bias or prejudice in the community which had the potential to impact on the impartiality of a jury.McLachlin J. concluded on the evidence of that case that there was widespread bias against aboriginal peoples in Canada and there is evidence that this widespread racism has translated into systemic discrimination in the criminal justice system. [65]McLachlin J. did not take judicial notice of that fact.[64]In Williams, the accused called witnesses and tendered evidence to establish widespread prejudice and bias in the community against aboriginal people.This evidence demonstrated there was a reasonable possibility of bias or a realistic potential of racial bias or prejudice on the part of jurors in the context of challenge for cause in the selection of a jury.McLachlin J. stated it might not be necessary to duplicate that effort in future cases to establish racial prejudice in the community because the potential for racial prejudice could be demonstrated either by evidence or by judicial notice or by proving facts capable of immediate and accurate verification.[65]In R. v. Fleury,[66] Barclay J. considered whether widespread bias or prejudice existed in Saskatchewan which might impact on the impartiality of a jury in the context of a challenge for cause.Again, after hearing evidence from an expert in the field and examining reports of commissions of inquiries, he concluded on the evidence that there was systemic racism sufficient to permit the accused to challenge jurors for cause.[66]Klebuc J. in R. v. Carratt[67] refused to take judicial notice of racial bias in the context of a sentencing hearing held to determine whether to impose a conditional sentence on an aboriginal offender.He was unwilling to accept the finding made by Barclay J., in Fleury that systemic racism exists in Saskatchewan.He found he could not make such a finding in the absence of evidence on that issue in the particular community where the offence occurred. He was unable to determine on the evidence before him whether anti-aboriginal racism existed and had materially affected the particular offender’s ability to obtain employment for example, and was the cause of the offender being before the Court.[67]Klebuc J. was satisfied on the evidence of Professor Quigley of the Faculty of Law of the University of Saskatchewan, that aboriginal peoples suffered from poverty, substance abuse and racism and were overrepresented in the prison population.At the end of the day, however, he was unable to find that those factors were the cause of the particular aboriginal offender’s criminal conduct and he refused to impose a community-based sentence.I agree generally with the approach he used in attempting to comply with the directives in Gladue.[68]The evidentiary question is thus reduced to: are the systemic or background matters so “notorious” that a sentencing judge can take judicial notice of them without further evidence when deciding whether to apply a restorative approach to sentencing so as to make the system more relevant to aboriginal peoples?[69]Justices Cory and Iacobucci seem to have provided at least a partial answer to that evidentiary question by stating, immediately after their comments on judicial notice,[68] that it will probably be necessary for some evidence to be adduced to assist the sentencing judge to decide these issues. In my opinion, evidence will be required on the “Gladue sentencing hearing” to establish the systemic factors referred to by the Supreme Court as well as to demonstrate how those factors have contributed to the offender being before the court and how those factors should influence the type of sentence to be imposed on the particular aboriginal offender.No operation of the principle of judicial notice will provide enough specific relevant evidence about the particular systemic or background factors which exist in the offender’s community.Nor will it provide specific evidence as to how those factors have affected the particular aboriginal offender and whether they resulted in him being before the Court.It will be necessary for the accused to call some evidence to assist the sentencing judge in determining whether, in the particular community where the offender resides, there are systemic or other background factors which have had an influence on how this particular offender came before the court with the result that there will be a different approach to sentencing and the kind of sentence to be imposed.[70]As a cautionary note, I would repeat that s. 718.2(e) is not to be interpreted as requiring an automatic reduction of the sentence simply because the offender is aboriginal.The Supreme Court makes it clear that the section is but one factor to be taken into account when determining an appropriate sentence.It is essentialthe section be read in the context of Part XXIII and the sentence depend upon all of the principles and goals of sentencing being considered.Disparity of Sentences[71]Section 718.2(b) of the Code provides: a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.This implies there must not be an unjustifiable disparity in sentences between sentences imposed for similar offences and similar offenders.The operative word is “similar”.In the absence of a minimum mandatory sentence there is no such thing as a uniform sentence for a particular crime. The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a highly individualized matter.It is a delicate task which involves balancing the goals of society against the moral blameworthiness of the offender in the circumstances of the offence.In M.(C.A.),Chief Justice Lamer stated that the appropriate mix of accepted sentencing goals depends on the needs and current conditions in the community where the crime occurred.[72]The standard of appellate review coupled with the individualized nature of sentencing provides considerable latitude for disparity of sentences and for the application of the appropriate sentencing factors.Indeed, as Chief Justice Lamer emphasized in M.(C.A.), sentencing is such an inherently individualized process that the search for a “single appropriate sentence for a similar offender and a similar crime will frequently be a fruitless exercise of academic abstraction.”[69]This is an explicit recognition by the Supreme Court that sentences will vary across various communities and regions because the accepted sentencing goals depend upon the needs and current conditions in the community where the crimes occur.The corollary of this proposition is that less disparity should be tolerated within a particular community.Indeed, it can be argued that disparity is not in and of itself a bad thing.It reflects the individualized nature of sentencing.[73]In M.(C.A.) Chief Justice Lamer, while acknowledging the important function appellate courts serve in reviewing and minimizing the disparity of sentences, cautioned courts of appeal to exercise a margin of deference before intervening in the “specialized discretion that Parliament has explicitly vested in sentencing judges.” [70]Appellate courts should only interfere where there has been a substantial and marked departure from sentences customarily imposed for similar offences.Courts of appeal should not be quick to use a so called disparity to interfere with sentences imposed by trial judges.To do so runs contrary to the role of appellate courts.[74]As previously noted in dealing with conditional sentences, Part XXIII, and in particular ss. 718 to 718.2, changed the purposes and principles of sentencing.The purposes and principles of sentencing included in s. 718(e):“to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community”; and (f): “to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community” did not exist prior to the changes to Part XXIII.In addition to those primary principles and purposes of sentencing, Parliament included ss. 718.2(d) and (e) which require sentencing judges to consider all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances. Those new statutory provisions coupled with the new conditional sentence of imprisonment created by s. 742.1, which the Supreme Court recognized in Gladue as creating a new sentencing regime, expand the principles and parameters of sentencing. They require appellate courts to re-examine the appropriateness of sentences imposed prior to September 3, 1996, including where the sentences are served, and the ranges created for such offences.This is necessary for the purpose of determining whether there is disparity in sentences imposed subsequent to September 3, 1996, pursuant to Part XXIII.[75]The principle of disparity in sentences should be applied only after the reviewing Court has applied all the other principles of sentencing. It is only aftergiving full effect to the principles of sentencing within the current constraints governing appellate review that if a reviewing court is unable to rationalize the sentence with sentences for similar offences committed in similar circumstances, it must either increase or decrease the sentence.The court intervenes at this stage to achieve a rational relationship with other sentences imposed in similar circumstances for similarly situated offenders.[76]This Court has set aside or varied sentences on the basis that Part XXIII and in particular ss. 718 to 718.2 were merely a codification of existing principles.It was stated that the amendments had changed nothing with respect to the sentencing regime that would cause this Court to change its approach to sentencing.The Court continued to intervene and set aside or vary sentences on the basis that the principle of parity had been violated.In my opinion, following Gladue, those decisions can no longer be relied on as a basis for deciding that the principle of parity had been violated.[77]One of the first cases to examine this issue was R. v. McDonald[71] where the majority stated that “the purposes and objectives of sentencing as set out in s. 718 remain essentially unchanged from those stated by Saskatchewan courts prior to the enactment of the amendments...”.The reasoning in McDonald for refusing to re-examine decisions decided prior to the enactment of the amendments was followed in R. v. Van de Wiele. [72] The court stated:We see little in the newly-proclaimed sentencing provisions to suggest a departure from the sentencing approach adopted by this court....A careful reading of the reasons for decision in these cases discloses that the decisions were founded in purposes, objectives, and principles very much like those embodied in ss. 718, 718.1, and 718.2.And so we do not intend to depart from these previous sentencing decisions. [73]That finding in McDonald was specifically rejected in Gladue. Justices Cory and Iacobucci stated:The enactment of the new Part XXIII was a watershed, marking the first codification and significant reform of sentencing principles in the history of Canadian criminal law.Each of the provisions of Part XXIII, including s. 718.2(e), must be interpreted in its total context, taking into account its surrounding provisions.It is true that there is ample jurisprudence supporting the principle that prison should be used as a sanction of last resort.It is equally true, though, that the sentencing amendments which came into force in 1996 as the new Part XXIII have changed the range of available penal sanctions in a significant way.The availability of the conditional sentence of imprisonment, in particular, alters the sentencing landscape in a manner which gives an entirely new meaning to the principle that imprisonment should be resorted to only where no other sentencing option is reasonable in the circumstances. The creation of the conditional sentence suggests, on its face, a desire to lessen the use of incarceration.The general principle expressed in s. 718.2(e) must be construed and applied in this light .[74][78]Thus, the comments in McDonald and Van de Wiele must be revisited and the sentences imposed re-examined in light of the new sentencing regime and the interpretation given to Part XXIII by the Supreme Court in Gladue.[79]As already noted, the Supreme Court made it clear in Gladue that Part XXIII is much more than a codification of pre-existing sentencing principles.It is necessary for courts of appeal in examining sentences to determine whether or not a particular mix of sentencing goals meet the needs of a particular community in light of the new sentencing regime.In this respect, I refer to the comments of Chief Justice Bayda (speaking for the majority) in R. v. Taylor. [75]In making particular reference to s. 718.2(e), he statedthat “for a trial judge to ‘vary’ the sentence [from the norm] in order to accommodate that ‘mix of accepted sentencing goals’ fashioned by a particular community is not a breach of the principle of parity as it has been refined and enunciated in M.(C.A.).”This is particularly true with respect to how the sentence is to be executed or served, that is, in the community or in prison.If the sentence is served in the community, as noted above it remains in full force and effect but is executed differently by reason of a change in the condition of where it is served.The offender remains under the control of the correctional system and his liberty is significantly curtailed for the full length of the prison sentence.[80]In deciding whether there is disparity in the sentence because of a variation in how the sentence is served, the reviewing court must determine whether serving the sentence in the community rather than in prison fulfills the principles and goals of sentencing as now enunciated under Part XXIII.In so deciding the decisions of this Court decided prior to the coming into force of Part XXIII are not solely determinative.The court must not lose sight of the fact that the goals of deterrence and denunciation can be achieved without the necessity of a custodial or carceral sentence and that different sentencing considerations must be taken into account, principles which did not exist prior to Part XXIII being enacted.[81]Chief Justice Bayda (speaking for the Court) noted in R. v. Horvath[76] that there is a certain degree of fluidity in the principle of parity.He stated:[I]nherent in the principle of parity is a degree of fluidity.Were this not so this Court, for example, should today be imposing similar sentences for similar offenders committing similar offences in similar circumstances, as it did 25 or 30 years ago.We know that is not taking place.Similarly if that degree of fluidity were not inherent in the principle of parity then this Court should ignore the provisions of ss. 742.1 to 742.3 on the ground that in many cases in the past (prior to 1 September 1996) this Court imposed sentences of imprisonment to be served in a prison “on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances” and to now order that the sentence be served in the community would be to impose a sentence not “similar”, a result the principle of parity precludes.In my respectful view to so ignore ss. 742.1 to 742.3 would fly in the face of Parliament’s intention.I find that a sentence which requires a term of imprisonment to be served in the community does not necessarily contravene the principle of parity if prior to the passing of s. 742.1 the sentence would have to have been served in a prison. To find otherwise would be to render s. 742.1 meaningless. [77][82]Thus, in both Taylor and Horvath, this Court accepted the principle that disparity is a fluid notion, and that the changes and modifications to the law in Part XXIII have fundamentally altered how courts of appeal should view sentences imposed prior to its coming into force.Those sentences decided before the amendments to Part XXIII can no longer be regarded as establishing immutable sentencing principles or ranges against which sentences decided after the changes came into effect must be measured.They must be examined having regard to the “new sentencing regime,” and the restorative paradigm adopted by Parliament as interpreted by the Supreme Court.Courts of appeal must examine the sentences imposed since September 3, 1996 through “changing lenses”.Application of Principles[83]I turn now to a determination of the issues raised by the Crown’s notice to appeal the conditional sentence of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing judge having regard to the principles enunciated in the foregoing analysis and the standard of appellate review.The Crown contends that the sentencing judge erred in principle in imposing a conditional sentence of imprisonment by failing to consider relevant factors or over emphasising appropriate factors of sentencing with the result that this Court has the jurisdiction to review, set aside and substitute an appropriate and fit sentence. In the Crown’s contention the imposition of a non-carceral sentence is on its face an unfit sentence.[84]The Crown contends the sentencing judge erred in law: (1) by imposing a sentence that is manifestly unfit as being outside the previously established range of sentences for similar offences committed in similar circumstances; (2) by imposing a conditional sentence of imprisonment; (3) in the application of the principles of sentencing enunciated in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Code by over-emphasizing the factor of rehabilitation and under emphasizing the factors of retribution and denunciation; and, (4) by rendering a decision which violates the principles of parity in sentencing.[85]In my opinion, the most appropriate and convenient way to deal with those issues is to group them under three headings.First, the court must consider whether a conditional sentence of imprisonment was an appropriate and fit sentence.This includes: (a) determining whether the sentencing judge properly applied the principles and goals of sentencing in arriving at the conclusion that a sentence of imprisonment was a fit sentence; (b) determining whether the length of sentence was appropriate; and (c) determining whether the sentencing judge properly applied s. 742.1.Second, whether the sentencing judge over emphasised the factor of rehabilitation and under emphasised the factors of denunciation and deterrence.Third, whether the sentence violates the principle of parity of sentencing.Conditional Sentence of Imprisonment[86]The Crown argued strenuously that a non-carceral sentence is an unfit sentence.The Crown contends this Court has consistently held that offences of trafficking and of possession for the purposes of trafficking mandate the imposition of institutional incarceration and that a conditional sentence of imprisonment is an inappropriate penalty. The Crown concedes that a conditional sentence of imprisonment is not prohibited by the Code for these offences, but submits that it should be rarely used.[87]To follow the Crown’s argument would inevitably lead to the creation of a category of offences such as trafficking in “hard drugs” or trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking in “Dilaudid or Ritalin or like substances” which would not be eligible for a conditional sentence of imprisonment (except in those rare cases).The courts would, in effect, be creating a category of offence for which a particular penalty or sentence under s. 742.1 would not be available and for which a custodial sentence of imprisonment is the appropriate sentence.That would be akin to the creation by the Alberta Court of Appeal of the offence of serious sexual assault which carried a minimum sentence of three years, something the Supreme Court said, in R. v. McDonnell, [78] a court of appeal could not do.A conditional sentence of imprisonment is not prohibited in cases of trafficking or possession for the purpose of trafficking.It can be an appropriate penalty in appropriate circumstances and it can satisfy the principles of sentencing in ss. 718 to 718.2.[88]Thus one must first determine, consistent with the two step procedure established in Proulx whether a term of imprisonment short of a penitentiary term is appropriate having regard to the principles of sentencing outlined in ss. 718 to 7l8.2 of the Code.That decision is made without reference to s. 742.1.[89]Section 718.2(e) imposes an obligation on sentencing judges to consider all sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances prior to imposing a prison sentence.In so doing, the judge must pay particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.No specific submissions were made to the sentencing judge with respect to the proper application of s. 718.2(e).[90]The respondent, an aboriginal person, accepted that a term of imprisonment short of a penitentiary termwas an appropriate sentence in these circumstances for the offence of trafficking in Dilaudid.She submitted, however, that a conditional sentence of imprisonment as distinct from a custodial sentence, was appropriate having regard to the principles of restorative justice and the proper application of s. 718.2(e).[91]The respondent made submissions to this Court on the proper application of Gladue and s. 718.2(e) but conceded that a term of imprisonment was the appropriate sentence in these circumstances.The effect of the respondent’s submissions is that no sanctions other than imprisonment are appropriate in the circumstances and that a term of imprisonment of less than two years was the appropriate range of sanction for this aboriginal offender.Itis not necessary to make further reference to s. 718.2(e).[92]The initial prerequisite has thus been satisfied without reference to s. 742.1 – imprisonment of less that two years is the appropriate penalty.A sentence of imprisonment would have been the appropriate penalty for a nonaboriginal or aboriginal offender.[93]It is now necessary to determine whether the second prerequisite for a conditional sentence of imprisonment was satisfied.[94]The second prerequisite is whether society would be endangered if the offender served the sentence in the community. The sentencing judge, after imposing a sentence of 12 months considered, in effect, the second prerequisite.The trial judge did not have the benefit of Proulx, but by proceeding in this way he committed no error in determining the appropriate term of imprisonment.While he did not conduct a detailed analysis of whether the respondent would be a danger to the community if she served the sentence in the community, it is clear he relied on the pre-sentence report which indicated that the respondent was not criminally oriented, that she had put in place a good recovery plan and had no criminal record.In other words, it was unlikely that she would reoffend.In my opinion, he considered the elements necessary to determine the second prerequisite had been satisfied and I am unable to conclude that the sentencing judge erred.It is apparent that the community would not be at risk or in danger by her serving the sentence in the community.I note in passing, although this is irrelevant for the purpose of determining whether the trial judge erred in imposing a conditional sentence, that she has successfully completed the four months of electronically monitored house arrest, has completed the treatment ordered by the sentencing judge in the conditional sentencing order and has not re-offended.[95]The second stage of the inquiry is to determine whether to impose a conditional sentence of imprisonment and the appropriate length of the term of imprisonment.In this case the respondent engaged in two comparatively minor transactions of trafficking.She admitted to having sold the drugs to an undercover agent for profit but the transactions hardly qualify as a commercial enterprise of trafficking.There were two sales involving a total value of $120, by any measure a comparatively minor bit of trafficking.There is no evidence she was engaged in a continuous or ongoing commercial drug operation, was employed by a dealer as a vendor or was delivering drugs as part of a larger drug operation.This was, on the evidence, trafficking at the very low end of the scale and the trial judge imposed a sentence of 12 months imprisonment concurrent on all counts, followed by two years probation. I am unable to conclude that the sentencing judge erred in imposing a prison sentence of 12 months followed by two years probation in the circumstances of this case. It is at the low end of the scale but consistent with sentences for similar offences in this jurisdiction.Thus, the first part of the second stage of the inquiry to decide whether to impose a conditional sentence of imprisonment has been established.[96]That leaves, as part of the second stage of the inquiry, the question of whether the sentencing judge, in the circumstance of this case, notwithstanding that he concluded that the community would not be at risk or in danger if she served the sentence in the community, should have ordered a conditional sentence of imprisonment.In Proulx, the Supreme Court of Canada made it clear “[t]hat once the prerequisites of s. 742.1 are satisfied, the sentencing judge should give serious consideration to the possibility of a conditional sentence in all cases by examining whether a conditional sentence is consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing as set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.” [79]In considering whether to so order, the sentencing judge, again without specifically stating, by imposing the stringent punitive conditions in the conditional sentencing order, implicitly considered whether the principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2 would be satisfied if the sentence was served in the community.He imposed as additional conditions for serving the sentence in the community four months electronically monitored house arrest, followed by eight months during which time she was directed to continue treatment for her alcoholism and substance dependency.That conditional sentence is followed by two years probation.In effect, this offender is to be under the supervision of the correctional authorities for three years, which is about two and one half times longer than she would have been supervised had she simply been sentenced to prison.[97]The Crown contends the sentencing judge erred in placing too much emphasis on rehabilitation and not enough emphasis on denunciation and deterrence and contravened the provisions of s. 742.1(b) as amended with the result that the conditional sentence of imprisonment ought not to have been imposed. The Crown argues that the “scourge of drug trafficking” merits a severe sentence to deter others and to reduce the harmful consequences of drug use in society.It is submitted that the sentencing judge erred in principle by imposing a conditional sentence of imprisonment and failing to impose a custodial sentence.In support of that position the Crown cites R. v. McGinn; [80] R. v. Krett; [81] R. v. Ruda; [82] R. v. Debrowney, [83] all decisions of this Court.Although all of those cases were decided prior to September 3, 1996 when Part XXIII of the Criminal Code came into effect, the Crown points out that this Court has continued to approve the imposition of custodial sentences for trafficking and for possession for the purposes of trafficking after September 3, 1996.It cites a number of examples, of which I will mention only a few, that I intend to deal with in greater detail later when dealing with the issue of disparity of sentences:R. v. Faubert; [84] R. v. Neufield; [85] R. v. Englesman. [86][98]No one quarrels with the proposition that commercial traffickers, and by that I mean those who traffic in significant quantities of drugs in a commercial venture for personal gain at the expense of weaker elements of society, should be incarcerated and incarcerated for significant periods of time.In those circumstances the most effective sanction is to remove the offender from society.The same approach does not necessarily and in fact should not apply to “small fry” or bit players.In most cases they traffic to feed their own habit or addiction.Therefore whether treatment or incarceration, a restorative approach or a retributive approach, should be applied to them depends on the facts of each case.[99]The Crown contends the two most important factors in sentencing persons who traffic in drugs are denunciation and deterrence.It submits that the trial judge erred in under emphasizing those factors or goals of sentencing and in overemphasizing the factor of rehabilitation.In my opinion, s. 718 does not establish a hierarchy of sentencing factors or principles.All the factors must be considered in arriving at a fit and appropriate sentence.In the absence of a directive in the statute itself there is no reason why deterrence and denunciation should be over emphasized in a particular class or classes of cases.This is particularly so when one considers the doubtful effectiveness of deterrence in reducing and controlling crime. [87][100]Deterrence is antithetical to the fundamental principles of proportionality of sentencing.The use of denunciation and deterrence as primary factors in sentencing will result in imprisonment because it is assumed in such an analysis that deterrence and denunciation can only be achieved by the use of a custodial sentence.That is a fallacy and a misapprehension of reality as was made clear in Proulx.[101]Sanctions other than imprisonment may be as least as onerous as a prison sentence.That reality was recognized by Marshall J.A. in R. v. Brown [88] and Rosenberg J.A. in Wismayer. [89]Chief Justice Lamer in M.(C.A.) [90] also pointed out that a person who serves a sentence in the community (albeit in the circumstances of conditional release) still carries the societal stigma of being a convicted offender serving a criminal sentence.A well crafted community‑based sentence can provide an effective demonstration of society’s disapproval of crime by the restriction on the offender’s liberty – a restriction that can be seen daily by other members of the community.In any event, the Supreme Court of Canada in Proulx recognized that the principle of deterrence could be satisfied by the use of punitive conditions in a conditional sentencing order.Punitive conditions, house arrest and treatment, were ordered in this case. In the circumstances of this case I am unable to conclude that the sentencing judge failed to properly consider the appropriate factors or give appropriate weight to the factors of denunciation and deterrence.[102]The sentencing judge considered the appropriate factors of sentencing as set out in ss. 718 to 718.2 to determine a sentence which balanced the factor of rehabilitation against the need to denounce and deter by the imposition of severe conditions in the conditional sentencing order, including electronically monitored house arrest followed by probation.[103]In my opinion, the conditional sentence of imprisonment, imposed together with the order for probation, is consistent with the principles of sentencing enunciated in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Code and in particular the principles of denunciation and deterrence.[104]The result of all of this is that the sentencing judge properly concluded that society would not be endangered if the respondent served her sentence in the community and that a conditional sentence of imprisonment was consistent with theprinciples of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 781.2 of the Code.Given her personal circumstances, her lack of a related criminal record and the recovery plan she had put in place prior to the sentencing, I am unable to find that the trial judge erred in principle in ordering a conditional sentence of imprisonment on the terms that he did.Parity of Sentencing[105]Having reviewed the sentence, taking into account all relevant principles of sentencing, it remains only to determine whether the sentence imposed is such a marked departure from similar sentences rendered in similar circumstances so as to require this Court to vary it.It is the Crown’s submission that a failure to impose a custodial sentence of imprisonment so offends the principle of parity of sentencing that the sentence must be set aside and a custodial sentence substituted.With respect, the submission of the Crown misses the mark.To argue that a trial judge is obliged to impose a carceral sentence is to misapply the principle of parity of sentencing in general and to ignore the principles of restorative justice and the new sentencing regime created by Part XXIII of the Code and described in Gladue and in Proulx.[106]As evidence of the marked departure from sentences for this type of offence, the Crown relies on a number of decisions of this Court based on the ratio of the majority in R. v. McDonald [91] and R. v. Boreen. [92]Insofar as those cases and cases like Van de Wiele can be taken as stating that Part XXIII was merely a codification of existing principles of sentencing and as a result did not require a departure from the sentencing approach adopted by this Court prior to Part XXIII coming into effect, they have been overtaken by Gladue.The new sentencing regime was not considered to have any relevance on the result in those cases when the Court decided that the principle of parity was violated and set aside conditional sentences for trafficking and possession for the purposes of trafficking and sexual assault.That reasoning, that is, that nothing has changed and that a new approach is not required, was specifically rejected by Gladue and confirmed in Proulx.[107]The premise on which a conditional sentence of imprisonment was set aside for violating the principle of parity in sentencing in Faubert, and Englesman and Neufield was based on the reasoning in McDonald and Van de Wiele.Those cases were decided before and must be read in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Gladue.In Engelsman and Neufield the length of the sentence of imprisonment was not in issue.What was in issue was the mode of execution of the sentence.Thatis whether the sentence should be served in prison or in the community.[108]Since the adoption by Parliament of Part XXIII, sentencing judges and courts of appeal have a judicial duty to approach sentencing differently than they did previously.When determining whether imprisonment is an appropriate sentence the court must consider imprisonment the sanction of last resort and not the sanction of choice. A restorative paradigm has been added to the sentencing options and Parliament has expressly directed judges to take this into account when determining a fit sentence.[109]Thus, those cases which were decided prior to Gladue, such as Faubert and those which were decided without taking into account the subsequent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Gladue must be read in light of this Court’s decision in R. v. Taylor and the comments of Chief Justice Bayda that:One must not overlook that the “mix of accepted sentencing goals” now includes a sentencing objective that was not there when many of the cases cited by [the] Crown in support of [the] principle of parity were decided.I refer to the objective in s. 718(f): “to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims into the community”.Nor in considering the “mix of accepted goals” should one overlook the fact that Mr. Taylor is an aboriginal offender within the meaning of s. 718.2(e).Because of his ancestry, Parliament has directed that “particular attention” be given to the principle of restraint.In my respectful view, for a trial judge to “vary” the sentence [from the norm] in order to accommodate that “mix of accepted sentencing goals” fashioned by the “particular community” is not a breach of the principle of parity.... [93][110]It is useful to remember D.A. Thomas’s observation that “individualized” sentences should not be expected to conform to the application of “tariff principles.”In my opinion, one must examine with care cases decided by this Court before September 3, 1996 as well as those decided subsequent thereto which did not take into account the Supreme Court’s decision in Gladue.It is necessary to apply to those cases the principles of sentencing subsequently adopted in Part XXIII of the Code.In other words, it is not “business as usual”.There is a new sentencing regime, one which must be taken into account in determining the appropriateness and fitness of sentences.[111]In each of Faubert, Engelsman and Neufield, the Court decided that a community-based sentence was not appropriate.The principal reason was that there was a disparity with sentences for similar offences which had been decided before Part XXIII had come into effect or had been decided subsequently but were compared to cases decided prior to Part XXIII coming into force. It is not possible to find, subsequent to Gladue, that the same approach and principles followed pre-Gladue should be followed post-Gladue to determine whether there is disparity in sentence.In Proulx, Chief Justice Lamer made it clear that the deferential standard of appellate review has profound functional justifications.The sentencing judge will have a strong sense of the particular blend of sentencing goals that will be appropriate for the protection of the community.This is particularly so in the case of conditional sentences where crafting appropriate conditions requires knowledge of both the needs and resources of the community.[112]In my opinion, these sentences must be approached on a principled basis recognizing that the law of sentencing has changed and that there is a new sentencing regime.That does not mean to say that a conditional sentence or a restorative approach to sentencing must be adopted in all cases.The sentence must be viewed having regard to the appropriate and just mix of sentencing goals to determine whether a custodial sentence is appropriate.Each case must be approached individually to determine whether the principles of restorative justice as opposed to the traditional retributive model will apply.Not every trafficking case that warrants a sentence of two years less a day will attract a conditional sentence of imprisonment.Indeed, cases where the Crown has proved a strong commercial element to the offence are unlikely to attract a community-based sentence and the appropriate sentence is likely to be a custodial sentence.It will depend in each caseon the particular circumstances of the accused and of the offence.[113]In the circumstances of this case, I am unable to conclude, based on the principles of parity, particularly in light of the standard of appellate review, that the trial judge erred in imposing a conditional sentence of imprisonment when one overlays the principles of sentencing now contained in Part XXIII and the reasoning set out in Gladue and Proulx.It is, therefore, apparent that in the circumstances of this case, a conditional sentence of imprisonment was the appropriate sentence.It is not an unfit sentence and we should not interfere.[114]Since writing these reasons I have read the reasons of Jackson J.A. and I agree with her reasons concerning the granting of leave to appeal and her additional comments on the standard of appellate review.[115]For all the above reasons the appeal is dismissed.DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 28th day of FEBRUARY, A.D. 2000.VANCISE J.A.JACKSON J.A. (concurring in part):[116]Little is written in Canada about the considerations that lead a Court of Appeal to grant or refuse leave to appeal a sentence under ss. 675(1)(b) or 676(1)(a)of the Criminal Code.Nonetheless, to say that this Court only grants leave if it intends to intervene restricts too narrowly our role in these matters.Take the within appeal as an example.[117]The Crown has appealed the sentence on the basis that the sentencing judge made certain errors resulting in demonstrably unfit sentences.Relying on other decisions of this Court, eg., R. v. Faubert (1997), 1997 CanLII 9727 (SK CA), 152 Sask. R. 228 and R. v. Englesman, [1999] S.J. No. 455 [QL] (unreported Sask. C.A.) and extrapolating certain principles from them, Crown counsel argued that this Court had already spoken on the fitness of conditional sentences for trafficking in \"hard\" drugs and should, therefore, grant leave and set aside the conditional sentence imposed.Defence counsel took issue with this.He said recent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada require this Court to reconsider its role in reviewing sentences and to provide guidance with respect to the use of conditional sentences.These opposing positions raise squarely the proper approach to be taken in imposing a conditional sentence and this Court's role when reviewing such a sentence to determine its fitness under s.687 of the Criminal Code.Moreover, this appeal was argued with two others (Keepness and Cappo) in the hope, if not the expectation, that the Court would speak on what has become an issue of some controversy.All of this has been rendered more acute since the Supreme Court of Canada has provided its opinion in R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII); R. v. L.F.W., 2000 SCC 6 (CanLII); R. v. R.N.S., 2000 SCC 7 (CanLII); R. v. R.A.R., 2000 SCC 8 (CanLII); and R. v. Bunn, 2000 SCC 9 (CanLII).[118]As a matter of practice, when this Court refuses leave to appeal a sentence, the decision to do so is not reported in the Sentencing Digest, and the refusal of leave is recorded only on the court file. Since in-depth reasons are not given, the public does not know the basis upon which the Court decided to refuse leave. This means that the fact of refusing leavehas no precedential value.In the instant appeal, it appears that we are all of one mind that the sentence imposed on Ms. Laliberte was fit when imposed, but if we were simply to deny leave, an important part of the continuum of fit sentences would be missed.That is to say, conditional sentencing for a hard drug at the lower end of the spectrum would not form part of the cases cited to the Court on a regular basis.To be more precise, if we were to deny leave in this appeal, Crown and defence counsel and the public would not know that this Court is of the view that a conditional sentence imposed on an accused with these personal circumstances for trafficking in thirteen tablets of Dilaudid is not demonstrably unfit.[119]In my respectful opinion, a Court of Appeal has the authority to grant leave not only when there is an arguable case for intervention but also to settle an issue of significance either in practice or law.The onus on counsel seeking leave is to demonstrate a case of sufficient merit and importance to warrant intervention or review.R. v. Horvath (1997), 1997 CanLII 9759 (SK CA), 152 Sask. R. 277 is a case in point.Horvath was a Crown appeal where this Court dismissed the appeal from the imposition of a conditional sentence.Other examples exist.[120]Crown counsel has met the onus of persuading me that leave should be granted.Accordingly, I would grant leave.[121]My colleagues have taken different approaches to arrive at what is the same result.My colleague Vancise has provided a detailed analysis of the case law and statutory provisions and developed a framework for when and how courts should determine the applicability of a conditional sentence.I agree with his analysis and framework.It accords with that which was recently pronounced by the Supreme Court of Canada.He has also provided an analysis of the application of s. 718.2(e) dealing with aboriginal offenders.As he makes clear, he is able to find Ms. Laliberte's sentence to be fit without resorting to her aboriginal status.On that basis, I prefer to with hold comment on his analysis of this latter issue until it is directly engaged.[122]As to disparity, I will add my own thoughts.My colleague Vancise states that the principle of parity does not preclude a finding by this Court that the conditional sentence in this case is a fit sentence for two principalreasons.First, he writes that our earlier decisions relied on pre-May 1, 1997 decisions or did not refer to the pronouncements contained in R. v. Gladue, 1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688.Secondly, the standard of appellate review as articulated in recent Supreme Court cases includingGladue and now Proulx requires this Court to give greater deference to sentencing judges such that where we might once have intervened, we are now precluded from doing so.I subscribe to that part of his reasoning which focuses on the standard of appellate review which I will now amplify.[123]Vancise J.A. traces the recent cases stating and interpreting the standard of appellate review beginning with R. v. Morrisette (1971), 1970 CanLII 642 (SK CA), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 307 through R. v. Wenarchuk (1982), 1982 CanLII 2600 (SK CA), 15 Sask. R. 240, R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, R. v. McDonnell, 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, Horvath, Gladue and concludingwith Proulx., R. v. L.F.W., R. v. R.N.S., R. v. R.A.R. and R. v. BunnIn my mind this review demonstrates a narrowing of the aperture of intervention for an appellate court particularly as it relates to conditional sentences.[124]In Proulx beginning with paragraph 123, Lamer C.J. writes:E.Deference Owed to Sentencing Judges123In recent years, this Court has repeatedly stated that the sentence imposed by a trial court is entitled to considerable deference from appellate courts: see Shropshire, supra, at paras. 46‑50; M. (C.A.), supra, at paras. 89‑94; McDonnell, supra, at paras. 15‑17 (majority); R. v. W. (G.), S.C.C., No 26705, October 15, 1999, at paras. 18‑19. In M. (C.A.), at para. 90, I wrote:Put simply, absent an error in principle, failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit. Parliament explicitly vested sentencing judges with a discretion to determine the appropriate degree and kind of punishment under the Criminal Code. [Emphasis in M. (C.A.).]124Several provisions of Part XXIII confirm that Parliament intended to confer a wide discretion upon the sentencing judge. As a general rule, ss. 718.3(1) and 718.3 (2) provide that the degree and kind of punishment to be imposed is left to the discretion of the sentencing judge. Moreover, the opening words of s. 718 specify that the sentencing judge must seek to achieve the fundamental purpose of sentencing \"by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives\" (Emphasis in Proulx.) In the context of the conditional sentence, s. 742.1 provides that the judge \"may\" impose a conditional sentence and enjoys a wide discretion in the drafting of the appropriate conditions, pursuant to s. 742.3(2).125Although an appellate court might entertain a different opinion as to what objectives should be pursued and the best way to do so, that difference will generally not constitute an error of law justifying interference. Further, minor errors in the sequence of application of s. 742.1 may not warrant intervention by appellate courts. Again, I stress that appellate courts should not second‑guess sentencing judges unless the sentence imposed is demonstrably unfit.126As explained in M. (C.A.), supra, at para. 91:This deferential standard of review has profound functional justifications. As Iacobucci J. explained in Shropshire, at para. 46, where the sentencing judge has had the benefit of presiding over the trial of the offender, he or she will have had the comparative advantage of having seen and heard the witnesses to the crime. But in the absence of a full trial, where the offender has pleaded guilty to an offence and the sentencing judge has only enjoyed the benefit of oral and written sentencing submissions (as was the case in both Shropshire and this instance), the argument in favour of deference remains compelling. A sentencing judge still enjoys a position of advantage over an appellate judge in being able to directly assess the sentencing submissions of both the Crown and the offender. A sentencing judge also possesses the unique qualifications of experience and judgment from having served on the front lines of our criminal justice system. Perhaps most importantly, the sentencing judge will normally preside near or within the community which has suffered the consequences of the offender's crime. As such, the sentencing judge will have a strong sense of the particular blend of sentencing goals that will be \"just and appropriate\" for the protection of that community. The determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which attempts to balance carefully the societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence, while at all times taking into account the needs and current conditions of and in the community. The discretion of a sentencing judge should thus not be interfered with lightly. [Emphasis in Proulx.]This last justification is particularly relevant in the case of conditional sentences. Crafting appropriate conditions requires knowledge of both the needs and resources of the community.These strong statements regarding the standard of appellate review speak for themselves.[125]It is significant that the Court in Proulx did not indicate what will constitute an error in principle or when a sentence imposed by a trial or sentencing judge is demonstrably unfit.The realm of conditional sentencing is full of many rules–some more important than others.If the Supreme Court of Canada had said that this or that rule or factor is more or less important, appellate courts could, in an effort to fulfill its reviewing function, maintain reliance on incarceration by setting aside conditional sentences.But the Supreme Court did not.Instead, theCourt speaking with one voice in Proulx gave extensive guidelines to trial judgesto assist them in determining when to impose a conditional sentencewhile at the same time advising appellate courts to be chary about intervening.[126]As a further message to appellate courts, we can look at exactly what the Supreme Courtdid in Proulx, L.F.W., R.N.S., R.A.R. and Bunn.In all but one of these cases, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the decision of the trial judge.In the one case where the Supreme Court did not uphold the decision of the trial judge (Bunn), the Supreme Court of Canada must be taken as expanding the use of conditional sentences. What the Court actually did is a powerful statement of the application of the standard of appellate review and the use of conditional sentences.[127]It should also be pointed out that in those cases where the Supreme Court set aside an appeal court's conditional sentence, it usually gave guidance to a future sentencing judge.The nature of this advicemakes it clear that the Supreme Court's decision is not intended to preclude the use of a conditional sentence for a future offence of the same nature.(This also speaks to the diminishing role of parity of sentencing.)For example, in Proulx the Court set aside the conditional sentence imposed by the Manitoba Court of Appeal for dangerous driving causing death andrestored the decision of the trial judge sentencing the accused to custody.But in doing so the Court said this:130I hasten to add that these comments should not be taken as a directive that conditional sentences can never be imposed for offences such as dangerous driving or impaired driving.In fact, were I a trial judge, I might have found that a conditional sentence would have been appropriate in this case. The respondent is still very young, he had no prior record and no convictions since the accident, he seems completely rehabilitated, he wants to go back to school, he has already suffered a lot by causing the death of a friend and was himself in a coma for some time. To make sure that the objectives of denunciation and general deterrence would have been sufficiently addressed, I might have imposed conditions such as house arrest and a community service order requiring the offender to speak to designated groups about the consequences of dangerous driving, as was the case in Parker, supra, at p. 239, and R. v. Hollinsky, (1995) 1995 CanLII 8929 (ON CA), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 472 (Ont. C.A.).(Emphasis added.)131However, trial judges are closer to their community and know better what would be acceptable to their community. Absent evidence that the sentence imposed by the trial judge was demonstrably unfit, the Court of Appeal should not have interfered to substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge. The trial judge did not commit a reversible error in principle and she appropriately considered all the relevant factors. Although the Court of Appeal's decision is entitled to some deference (see the companion appeal R. v. R.A.R., 2000 SCC 8 (CanLII), at paras. 20‑21), in my opinion it erred in holding that the sentencing judge had given undue weight to the objective of denunciation. I see no ground for the Court of Appeal's intervention.These comments provide further guidance to an appellate court regarding the standard of appellate review.No aspect of the weighing process which led the trial judge in Proulx to select custody overa conditional sentence constituted reversible error.Instead, the Court assessed whether the ultimate result was demonstrably unfit.As soon as the Court reached this stage of its analysis, the standard of appellate review precluded intervention.The decision to impose or not to impose a custodial as opposed to a conditional sentence did not result, on the facts of that case, in a reversible error.[128]This does not mean that the Court of Appeal has no role in sentencing.Parliament has given appellate courts the obligation to review appealed sentences to determine their fitness, but this role must be fulfilled while giving great deference to sentencing judges.[129]That brings us specifically to the role of parity.A necessary corollary of a narrow standard of appellate review is that the emphasis on that principle of sentencing known as parity contained in s. 718.2(b) is diminished.(Clause 718.2(b) states \"a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances\".)As support for this view, I turn again to how the Supreme Court applied the principles of sentencing in each of R. v. Proulx, R. v. L.F.W., R. v. R.N.S., R. v. R.A.R. and R. v. Bunn.None of the five cases refer to sentence parity in either upholding or overturning a conditional sentence.[130]At paragraphs [79] to [89] of the Supreme Court's decision in Proulx, Lamer C.J., discusses in sequence the issues raised by \"proportionality\" and \"the need for starting point sentences\".At paragraph [81] he rejects the notion that there is a presumption against conditional sentences for certain offences.He writes:81.... Such presumptions do not accord with the principle of proportionality set out in s. 718.1 and the value of individualization in sentencing, nor are they necessary to achieve the important objectives of uniformity and consistency in the use of conditional sentences.82This Court has held on a number of occasions that sentencing is an individualized process, in which the trial judge has considerable discretion in fashioning a fit sentence. The rationale behind this approach stems from the principle of proportionality, the fundamental principle of sentencing, which provides that a sentence must be proportional to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender. Proportionality requires an examination of the specific circumstances of both the offender and the offence so that the \"punishment fits the crime\". As a by‑product of such an individualized approach, there will be inevitable variation in sentences imposed for particular crimes.(Emphasis added.)Then at paragraph [86], Lamer C.J. begins to determine whether there is a need for starting points with respect to the imposition of conditional sentences.While recognizing the utility for starting point sentences as a means of providing guides to lower courts to achieve greater uniformity and consistency, he rejects their use in respect of specific offences as a means of providing guidance as to the proper use of conditional sentences.In paragraph [87], he writes:87That said, I do not find it necessary to resort to starting points in respect of specific offences to provide guidance as to the proper use of conditional sentences. In my view, the risks posed by starting points, in the form of offence‑specific presumptions in favour of incarceration, outweigh their benefits. Starting points are most useful in circumstances where there is the potential for a large disparity between sentences imposed for a particular crime because the range of sentence set out in the Code is particularly broad. In the case of conditional sentences, however, the statutory prerequisites of s. 742.1 considerably narrow the range of cases in which a conditional sentence may be imposed. A conditional sentence may only be imposed on non‑dangerous offenders who would otherwise have received a jail sentence of less than two years. Accordingly, the potential disparity of sentence between those offenders who were candidates for a conditional sentence and received a jail term, and those who received a conditional sentence, is relatively small.88The minimal benefits of uniformity in these circumstances are exceeded by the costs of the associated loss of individualization in sentencing. By creating offence‑specific starting points, there is a risk that these starting points will evolve into de facto minimum sentences of imprisonment. This would thwart Parliament's intention of not excluding particular categories of offence from the conditional sentencing regime. It could also result in the imposition of disproportionate sentences in some cases.(Emphasis is added.)I take this as confirmation that an appellate court should interfere with great reluctance when a sentencing judge has imposed a conditional sentence on the basis alone that it does not conform with similar sentences given to similar offenders.[131]For these reasons, then I would also dismiss the within appeal.DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 28th day of FEBRUARY, A.D. 2000.JACKSON J.A.CAMERON J.A.The Attorney General of Canada applied for leave to appeal in this case and, if granted, asked the Court to set aside a conditional sentence order that allowed the respondent, Monica Rose Laliberte, to serve a term of imprisonment in the community.Ms. Laliberte, an 18-year-old resident of Prince Albert, pleaded guilty to trafficking in Hydromorphone (Dilaudid), contrary to section 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. As a result, the trial judge sentenced her to a term of imprisonment of 12 months, but ordered that the term be served in the community under section 742.1 of the Criminal Code. He also placed her on probation for the next two years. Section 742.1 reads thus:742.1Where a person is convicted of an offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, and the court(a)imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years, and(b)is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community, and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2the court may, for the purposes of supervising the offender’s behavior in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions of a conditional sentence order made under section 742.3.The trial judge ordered that Ms. Laliberte serve her sentence in the community on several conditions. He intended the conditions to allow for thesupervision of her behaviour in the community, to reflect the seriousness of the matter, to reduce the risk of re-offence, and to foster her reform. Besides imposing the standard conditions prescribed by section 742.3, he directed herto submit to electronic monitoring for four months and to continue an educational program in which she had enrolled. He also directed her to forgo drugs and alcohol, submit to random testing, and to undertake such counselling and treatment as might be recommended. In addition, he directed her to cooperate with her supervisors in finding employment.The Attorney General applied for leave to appeal (and founded the prospective appeal) on the ground the trial judge had misapplied the provisions of section 742.1 and imposed an unfit sentence. According to the Attorney General, the sentence was short on deterrence and protection of the public interest.Leave to appeal against sentence is seldom granted to the Attorney General in the absence of an arguable case for intervention. In light of the circumstances of this case, coupled with the standard of review and the passage of time, counsel for the Attorney General failed to persuade me that he had an arguable case for setting aside the conditional sentence order. So I would have denied leave.I turn first to the circumstances. They suggested to me an offence of comparatively low gravity and culpability when viewed in the light of the variable nature of drug trafficking. The matter arose on September 17, 1998, when Ms. Laliberte sold ten Dilaudid tablets for $80 to a male acquaintance. He had called on her at an apartment in Saskatoon, where she was then staying. The following morning, she sold him another three tablets for $40. Unknown to her, the man was acting for the police. They arrested her and charged her with two counts of trafficking, and two counts of having possession of proceeds of crime. At the time, she was living with a man named Mark Herman, with whom she had taken-up shortly before, on leaving home at age 17.Two months later, having left Herman and returned to her home in Prince Albert, she appeared in Provincial Court there and pleaded guilty to the charges. Following the preparation of a pre-sentence report, which took three months to complete, she appeared before Judge Goliath for sentencing. That was on March 8, 1999.Having regard for sections 718 and 718.1 of the Criminal Code, he thought the case called for a term of imprisonment of 12 months. Sections718 and 718.1 set out the purpose and principles of sentencing, including the fundamental principle that sentences be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of culpability of the offender. In light of the pre-sentence report, however,and the conduct of Ms. Laliberte in the meantime, he decided to make an order under section 742.1 allowing her to serve the term of imprisonment in the community, subject to the conditions mentioned earlier.In deciding to make the order, he remarked on Ms. Laliberte's guilty plea, her youth, and her lack of \"criminal orientation.\" He also remarked on her remorse, her resolve to change her lifestyle, and her progress toward reform, noting that she had ended her association with Mr. Herman, returned home, enrolled in a Self-Discovery Programme, and undertaken counselling. According to the pre-sentence report, these amounted to \"positive signs that she is earnest in her desire to become a productive member of society.”Despite this, he remained concerned about the safety of the community should he allow her to serve the term of imprisonment in the community—concerned that she might re-offend. His concerns stemmed froma suggestion in the pre-sentence report that she might well do so. However, given her concrete efforts at reform—impressive efforts that he thought were likely tolessen the risk—coupled with other suggestions in the report, he thought the risk of re-offence was negligible. The probation officer who prepared the report had said that, while Ms. Laliberte would have to find ways to resist the appeal of easy money, she had a “good recovery plan” in place. He also said that she was “a very good candidate” for electronic monitoring and that a conditional sentence, subject to a period of electronic monitoring, was apt to work well.With this in mind Judge Goliath said he was prepared to act on the pre-sentence report. At the same time, though, he said he wanted the sentence to have a significant impact and be accompanied by meaningful follow-up. He thought that her rehabilitation was the paramount objective and that it could best be achieved by the means recommended in the report. He went on to say that he intended, while generally following those recommendations, to impose a \"significant sentence,\" one designed to achieve other objectives as well, including deterrence.In conclusion, he noted that the order, coupled with the term of probation, would limit the accused's freedom for three years, during which time she would have to continue to answer for her offences and continue to work at the self-improvement she had undertaken. This, he said, was not only in her interests but in the best interests of society as well.Turning from the circumstances to the standard of review, I note that in seeking leave to appeal it was up to counsel for the Attorney General to convince us he had an arguable case for intervention even though the sentence warranted a large measure of deference. The trial judge imposed the sentence in exercise of the discretionary powers conferred on him, first by section 717(1) and then by section 742.1 of the Code. That being so, we do not enjoy free reign to vary the sentence simply because we might have imposed a different one: R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227; R. v. M.(C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500. As Lamer C.J. said, in R. v. M.(C.A.), \"absent an error in principle, a failure to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit.\"Morever, it was up to counsel for the Attorney General to persuade us there was an arguable case for intervention despite the passage of time. When the application for leave reached us Ms. Laliberte had served a significant portion of the sentence. She had completed her period of electronic monitoring and had served more than five months of the term of imprisonment. In addition, she had seemingly made significant progress in turning her life around.Because of all of this I was hard pressed to see on what basis, we might grant leave to appeal. In my view neither the trial judge's application of the terms of section 742.1, nor the fitness of the sentence as a whole, appeared on the face of them to warrant intervention.Neither struck me as facially wrong, either in fact or law.As for the first, the trial judge was satisfied that allowing the term of imprisonment to be served in the community, especially on the conditions he had in mind, would not endanger the safety of the community. This was essentially a matter of fact and good judgment, and I found it difficult in light of the evidence to see any error in his findings. He was also satisfied that allowing the sentence to be so served would not be inconsistent with the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing appearing in sections 718 and 718.1. This was essentially a matter of law and good judgment, with the judge being alive to the principles at play. Even if he had erred in this regard, and I do not suggest he did, I found it difficult to appreciate how such error might have warranted the relief sought by the Attorney General.As for the second, namely the fitness of the sentence as a whole, I thoughtthat even if it were taken as borderline—having regard for the range of sentences for offences of this nature, committed in circumstances such as these—borderline sentences, by definition, will seldom be taken as \"demonstrably unfit.\"All told, then, I thought the Attorney General did not have an arguable case for intervention. Nor could I see any other sound basis for the grant of leave.I might add that even if I had been persuaded to grant leave, I would not have allowed the appeal in light of all the circumstances and the deferential standard of review. I could see no material error in the trial judge's application of the terms of section 742.1, and in these particular circumstances I could not see how the sentence could be regarded as demonstrably unfit.Besides, interference with the sentence at this stage is out of the question.Ms. Laliberte committed these offences almost a year and half ago, and she has now served almost all the term of imprisonment in the community.It follows, that I would have denied leave to appeal and would now dismiss the appeal in any event. I might add that I have since read the reasons for judgment in R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), and found nothing there to change my mind. Indeed, the Supreme Court of Canada's treatment of section 742.1 in that case served to reinforce my views of this case.DATED at the City of Regina, in the Province of Saskatchewan, this 28th day of February 2000.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. .. . . . .CAMERON J.A.[1]R.S.C. 1985, c.C-46.[2]S.C. 1996, c.19.[3]1999 CanLII 679 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688.[4]2000 SCC 5 (CanLII).[5]Sentencing Transcript, pp. 16-17.[6](1971), 1970 CanLII 642 (SK CA), 1 C.C.C.

PREVIOUS CONVICTION – (1) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), where an offender is convicted of an offence for which a greater punishment may be imposed by reason of previous convictions, no greater punishment shall be imposed on the offender by reason thereof unless the prosecutor satisfies the court that the offender, before making a plea, was notified that a greater punishment would be sought by reason thereof.(2) PROCEDURE – Where an offender is convicted of an offence for which a greater punishment may be imposed by reason of previous convictions, the court shall, on application by the prosecutor and on being satisfied that the offender was notified in accordance with subsection (1), ask whether the offender was previously convicted and, if the offender does not admit to any previous convictions, evidence of previous convictions may be adduced.[4]Both defendants pled not guilty and were tried in the Ontario Court of Justice.Following conviction, the prosecution proved pre-plea service of the s. 727(1) notice upon each driver thereby triggering the operation of ss. 255(1)(a)(ii) and 259(1)(b) of the Code as they then read:255.(1) Every one who commits an offence under section 253 or 254 is guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable;(a) whether the offence is prosecuted by indictment or punishable on summary conviction, to the following minimum punishment, namely,(i) for a first offence, to a fine of not less than six hundred dollars,(ii) for a second offence, to imprisonment for not less than fourteen days, and(iii) for each subsequent offence, to imprisonment for not less than ninety days....259.(1) When an offender is convicted of an offence committed under section 253 or 254...the court that sentences the offender shall, in addition to any other punishment that may be imposed for that offence, make an order prohibiting the offender from operating a motor vehicle on any street, road, highway or other public place, or from operating a vessel or an aircraft or railway equipment, as the case may be,(a) for a first offence, during a period of not more than three years plus any period for which the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, and not less than one year;(b) for a second offence, during a period of not more than five years plus any period to which the offender is sentenced to imprisonment, and not less than two years; and(c) for each subsequent offence, during a period of not less than three years plus any period to which the offender is sentenced to imprisonment.[5]In Ontario, in written Ministry of the Attorney General policy, Crown prosecutors are directed, absent “exceptional circumstances”, to file the s. 727(1) notice in every case where a convicted defendant has a prior drinking/driving conviction within 5 years of the date of the offence underlying the current drinking/driving conviction.In respect of prior convictions beyond the 5-year period, Crown counsel are directed “to consider” seeking an increased penalty through proof of the notice having regard to enumerated aggravating factors as well as “any substantial period during which the offender was free of criminal involvement, the age and health of the accused, and any undue hardship or suffering that would result from a jail sentence”.[6]Prior to sentencing, the convicted offenders, relying in part on a number of provincial court decisions in Ontario not appealed by the Crown, submitted that (1) the court had jurisdiction to review the reasonableness of the filing of the s. 727(1) notice, and that (2) the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion was, on the facts of the respective cases, unreasonable, permitting the sentencing court to ignore the notice and to consider the fitness of sentence unrestricted by the statutory mandatory minimum of 14 days set out in s. 255(1)(a)(ii) or the minimum 2-year driving prohibition.Over the objection of the Crown, which argued that introduction of proof that the s. 727(1) notice had been served prior to plea was within the core of prosecutorial discretion and therefore judicially reviewable only on abuse of process being established, Duncan and Gage JJ. agreed with the approach of the defence.[7]Gage J. sentenced Anit Mohla to 4 days’ imprisonment to be served intermittently and a 1-year driving prohibition.[8]Duncan J. sentenced Kamaljit Singh to 7 days’ imprisonment and an 18-month driving prohibition.[9]Apart from Mr. Singh’s conviction appeal on a single ground, the Crown appeals the sentences imposed on each driver alleging error of law on the part of the sentencing courts in purporting to review prosecutorial exercise of discretion in proving timely service of a s. 727(1) notice.[10]On behalf of the Crown, Mr. Doyle submitted that, apart from non-compliance with the s. 727(1)/s. 255(1) sentencing regime, the sentences imposed at the respective trials were not otherwise unfit. Having regard to the issue on appeal transcending the circumstances of the defendants in this case, if successful in its appeals against sentence, the Crown is not seeking to have the court re-incarcerate Mr. Mohla and Mr. Singh.THE MOHLA TRIALThe Result[11]At Mr. Mohla’s trial on charges of operating a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol and operating a motor vehicle with an “over .80” blood alcohol level, the prosecution proceeded summarily.The respondent was found guilty of the over .80 crime after a trial.He was acquitted of the second charge.A s.10(b) Charter application was dismissed.The Evidence[12]On April 14, 2007, at about 2:00 a.m., O.P.P. Constable Myers was conducting laser speed enforcement on Highway #403 westbound in Mississauga in a 100k/hr. zone.Visibility was clear.Road conditions were dry.The officer observed a silver 2002 four-door Nissan pass him in the high occupancy vehicle lane reserved for vehicles with at least one passenger beyond the driver.Visually, the vehicle appeared to be travelling at a very high rate of speed.The laser radar clocked the respondent’s vehicle at 178 k/hr.Constable Myers noted the car moving “like a race car”.Although traffic was light, the car was travelling so quickly that “it was essentially bombing in and out of slower moving traffic”.The driving conduct appeared “dangerous”.The officer himself travelled for three and a half to four kilometres at speeds exceeding 180k/hr. to catch up to the respondent.[13]After Constable Myers activated his cruiser’s emergency lights, the respondent moved his car to the shoulder of the road.On the constable’s evidence, once the respondent rolled his driver’s window down, he “immediately…detected a strong odour of an alcoholic beverage”.Asked for his driver documentation, Mr. Mohla fumbled for an extended period of time although his driver’s licence was near the top of the papers in his wallet.[14]When Constable Myers asked the 33-year old driver how many drinks he had had that night, there was a slurred response of “A few”.Mr. Mohla’s eyes were red and bloodshot.His movements seemed slow or delayed.Concluding that the driver had driven with alcohol in his body, Myers directed the respondent out of his car.On the walk to the cruiser, the respondent was unsteady on his feet.The constable asked exactly how many drinks Mr. Mohla had consumed.The answer was, “Not that much”.[15]The constable arrested Mr. Mohla for impaired operation of a motor vehicle.After communicating rights to counsel, caution, and a breathalyzer demand, and arranging for a tow of the respondent’s vehicle, the respondent was taken to the O.P.P. Port Credit Detachment.Mr. Mohla was polite and cooperative.[16]After Mr. Mohla had a telephone consultation with duty counsel, Constable Myers administered the intoxilyzer testing.Test results of suitable breath samples were respectively 110 and 100 mg. alcohol/100 ml. blood.Prior Record and M.A.G. Policy[17]Mr. Mohla was previously convicted on July 6, 1998 of operating a motor vehicle with an over .80 BAC level.He was sentenced to a $600 fine and a one-year driving prohibition.[18]The Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General Criminal Law Division Practice Memorandum PM [2005] No. 36, dated March 31, 2006, entitled “Impaired Driving and Road Safety Offences: Practice and Procedural Issues” (the M.A.G. Policy) stated in part:Synopsis:Every year, drinking and driving offences cause death, injury, heartbreak and destruction.These offences are matters of grave concern to the community and should be prosecuted as vigorously as any other criminal offence.Criminal sanctions and administrative measures to reduce drinking and driving offences and driving offences generally are found both in the Criminal Code and the Highway Traffic Act.This memorandum provides guidance to Crown counsel in the prosecution of drinking and driving and related offences.It addresses practice and procedural issues including charge screening, resolution discussions, licence suspensions and driving prohibitions, ignition interlock and police pursuits.…A. Charge Screening…It is important that all accused persons are treated fairly and uniformly throughout the province.2. Review of the Crown Briefa. Information and Evidence:…iii.Proof of service of appropriate Notices:In all cases of drinking/driving offences where the offender possesses a prior related record, the Crown brief should contain a Notice of Intention to Seek an Increased Penalty, pursuant to s. 727 of the Criminal Code, and proof that it has been served by the police on the accused, regardless of age of the prior record.If the accused has a prior related record and information about the Notice is not in the Crown brief, Crown counsel should advise the police to take appropriate steps to serve the accused with the Notice of Increased Penalty and ensure that Notice and proof of service is in the Crown brief.…2. Second and Subsequent Convictionsa. Prior Convictions Within Five-Year PeriodIn order to deter drinking and driving, Crown counsel must, absent exceptional circumstances, file the Notice of Intention to seek the mandatory minimum jail sentence as proscribed by the Criminal Code, in all cases where the accused has a previous conviction for a drinking and driving offence within a five year period.Crown counsel shall calculate this five-year period from the date of previous conviction to the subject offence date, not to the date of the accused’s plea or trial.It is not possible to precisely define the factors that may constitute exceptional circumstances, for the purposes of deciding whether to depart from the requirement of seeking the mandatory penalty.However, the following are examples that do not constitute exceptional circumstances:* Crown counsel should not agree to forgo seeking the higher penalty for reasons of expediency, such as ensuring an early disposition of the case;* Crown counsel should not agree to forgo seeking the higher penalty for reasons relating to the accused’s employment, or position in the community;* Crown counsel should not agree to forgo seeking the higher penalty because the accused has enrolled in a treatment or rehabilitation program, although that circumstance may affect the length of sentence imposed.A decision not to file the Notice on the basis of exceptional circumstances will be justified only where Crown counsel is satisfied that the accused poses no future threat to the safety of the public.Where Crown counsel exercises discretion not to seek a greater penalty, the reasons for proceeding in this manner should be noted in the file and, where appropriate, stated on the record.Under no circumstances should Crown counsel misrepresent to the Court the existence or extent of the criminal record of the accused.If Notice is not filed or proved in Court, the minimum term of imprisonment does not apply and the accused may be eligible for a conditional sentence.If prior to plea, Crown counsel can find no evidence of service of the Notice of Intention to Seek an Increased penalty, he/she must make best efforts to ensure that notice is given to the accused personally, before the plea is entered.b. Prior Convictions beyond Five-Year PeriodBecause recidivist drinking drivers pose a danger to public safety, Crown counsel should consider seeking an increased penalty in cases where the offender’s previous conviction is beyond the five year period.In this regard, Crown counsel should be aware that the Ministry of Transportation, for the purposes of administrative measures under the HTA, has extended the period of time for which driving records are kept to 10 years.In exercising his or her discretion to seek a higher penalty when the offender has one or more prior convictions outside the five-year period, Crown counsel should consider the following factors:* Circumstances of the subject offender including blood alcohol concentration, children in the vehicle, the driving evidence, level of impairment;* Seriousness of criminal record, including the number and proximity of prior related offences;* Details of the Ministry of Transportation driving record.* Circumstances of outstanding and past offences, including, whether death or bodily injury occurred, endangerment of the public, extent of property damage, extent of impairment;* Any substantial period during which the offender was free of criminal involvement, i.e. the “gap” principle of sentencing;* Past sentences and their effect upon the accused, including completion of treatment programs for alcoholism and/or drug addiction;* The age and health of the accused, and any undue hardship or suffering that may result from a jail sentence.…1. Mandatory Minimum Jail Sentences:In order to deter drinking and driving, Crown counsel must, absent exceptional circumstances, file the Notice of Intention to seek the mandatory minimum jail sentence as proscribed by the Criminal Code, in all cases where the accused has a previous conviction for a drinking and driving offence within a five year period.Crown counsel shall calculate this five year period from the date of previous conviction to the subject offence date, not to the date of the accused’s plea or trial.Because recidivist drinking drivers pose a danger to public safety, Crown counsel should also consider seeking an increased penalty in cases where the offender’s previous conviction is outside the five year period.See detailed discussion above under Resolution Discussions on Second and Subsequent Convictions, regarding factors to be considered.…MANDATORY LANGUAGE:Crown counsel must, absent exceptional circumstances, file the Notice of Intention to seek the mandatory minimum jail sentence as proscribed by the Criminal Code, in all cases where the accused has a previous conviction for a drinking and driving offence within a five year period.Crown counsel shall calculate this five year period from the date of previous conviction to the subject offence date, not to the date of the accused’s plea or trial.A decision not to file the Notice on the basis of exceptional circumstances will be justified only where Crown counsel is satisfied that the accused poses no future threat to the safety of the public.(emphasis of original)(footnotes omitted)[19]A successor Ministry of Attorney General Policy Practice Memorandum dated July 2, 2008, PM [2008] No. 4, “Impaired Driving and Road Safety Offences”, replaced the pre-existing policy in effect when Mohla and Singh were charged.In argument, it appears to have been assumed that the new policy governed the prosecutors’ exercise of discretion.That policy reads in part:Opinion/Advice:...3. Aggravating Factors in Impaired Driving and other Road Safety OffencesIn cases involving impaired driving and other road safety offences, there are certain factual matters that can constitute aggravating factors.Before making significant decisions in these cases, Crown counsel should consider the following factors:* Death, serious injuries and/or substantial property damage;* A motor vehicle collision;* Driving conduct that poses a high risk to other motorists, pedestrians and/or police, such as excessive speed, racing or flight from police;* Whether the offence involves breach of a court order and frustrates the administration of justice, such as driving while prohibited;* Whether the offence interferes with the enforcement of drinking and driving laws, such as failing to remain at the scene of the accident, flight from police or refusing to provide breath samples;* The presence of vulnerable people, such as children (either in a motor vehicle or on foot);* Any prior record for similar offences and/or fail to comply offences;* Whether the accused’s provincial driving record indicates a history of unsafe driving and/or driving while suspended;* High levels of blood alcohol concentration (s. 255.1 of the Criminal Code deems a reading over 160 milligrams to be an aggravating factor on sentence);* Effect of past convictions and sentences upon the accused, including whether or not he or she has participated in treatment programs for alcoholism and/or drug addiction;* Whether there is other evidence of chronic alcoholism...7. Repeat Offendersa. Proof of Service of Notice of Intention to Seek an Increased PenaltyCrown counsel should make best efforts to ensure that notice is given to the accused personally, before the plea is entered, if the Notice of Intention has not already been served.If the only practicable way that notice can be given is by way of verbal notice, then a police or court officer, who can later testify in Court, should be instructed to do so.b. Prior Convictions Within Five-Year Period:In order to deter drinking and driving, Crown counsel must file the Notice of Intention to seek the mandatory minimum jail sentence, as required by the Criminal Code, in all cases where the accused has a previous conviction for a drinking and driving offence which a five year period, absent exceptional circumstances.Crown counsel shall calculate this five-year period from the date of previous conviction to the subject offence date, not to the date of the accused’s plea or trial.In cases where exceptional circumstances exist, Crown counsel must be satisfied that the accused poses no future threat to the safety of the public before deciding not to file the Notice of Intention.Crown counsel must still advise the Court of the existence and extent of any criminal record of the accused.The following are examples that do not constitute exceptional circumstances:* Crown counsel should not agree to forgo seeking the higher penalty for reasons of expediency, such as ensuring an early disposition of the case;* Crown counsel should not agree to forgo seeking the higher penalty for reasons relating to the accused’s employment, or position in the community;* Crown counsel should not agree to forgo seeking the higher penalty because the accused has enrolled in a treatment or rehabilitation program, although that circumstance may affect the length of sentence imposed.c. Prior Convictions beyond Five-Year PeriodBecause repeat drunk drivers pose a danger to public safety, Crown counsel should consider seeking an increased penalty in cases where the offender’s previous conviction is beyond the five-year period.Crown counsel should be aware that the Ministry of Transportation includes convictions occurring within the previous 10 years as prior offences for the purposes of administrative measures under the HTA (s. 41(3)).Crown counsel should be mindful of the aggravating factors listed in section 3 above when exercising his or her discretion to seek a higher penalty for the offender who has one or more prior convictions outside the five-year period.Crown counsel may also consider any substantial period during which the offender was free of criminal involvement, the age and health of the accused, and any undue hardship or suffering that may result from a jail sentence....Practice Memoranda are not considered to be confidential and may be given to defence counsel or other interested persons, upon request.MANDATORY LANGUAGE:Crown counsel must ensure that the Crown brief is complete before making significant decisions in cases involving impaired driving and road safety related offences....In order to deter drinking and driving, Crown counsel must file the Notice of Intention to seek the mandatory minimum jail sentence, as required by the Criminal Code, in all cases where the accused has a previous conviction for a drinking and driving offence within a five year period, absent exceptional circumstances.Crown counsel shall calculate this five-year period from the date of previous conviction to the subject offence date, not to the date of the accused’s plea or trial.In cases where exceptional circumstances exist, Crown counsel must be satisfied that the accused poses no future threat to the safety of the public before deciding not to file the Notice of Intention.Crown counsel must still advise the Court of the existence and extent of any criminal record of the accused.The Plea Bargaining[20]As an ordinary part of the disclosure process and to assist in any application to Legal Aid, the respondent’s counsel was provided a Crown Charge Screening Form dated June 1, 2007 which indicated that while the prosecution would not seek a custodial sentence if the appellant pleaded guilty, it would “file notice after trial” pursuant to s. 727(1) of the Code for a custodial disposition.The Form further stated:A summary of the position of the Crown Attorney with respect to this case after an initial review has been noted below.THIS POSITION IS SUBJECT TO REVIEW FOR FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY LATER COME TO LIGHT.…Notice to Accused: The sentencing position of the Crown Attorney with respect to this case, after an initial review, has been noted in the Crown brief.If you want to know what this position is, you, through your lawyer or duty counsel may ask the Crown on any appearance date.The Crown Attorney’s Office will take a position on disposition on this case prior to a trial date or preliminary inquiry date being set based on the substantial mitigation (lowering) of the sentence to be given for an early plea.A guilty plea on a trial or preliminary inquiry date shall be subject to little, if any, mitigation in the position of the Crown Attorney.Sentencing is always a matter for the sentencing judge.[21]It is agreed between the parties that the Crown position was effective up to the morning of trial – prior to the trial beginning, if there was a guilty plea to one of the charges there would be a joint submission for a fine and a 1-year driving prohibition on a plea of guilt.The s. 727(1) Notice is Filed[22]On September 3, 2008, immediately after the trial and delivery of reasons respecting the s. 10(b) Charter application which the court concluded was not “ill founded or frivolous”, and the reasons for judgment as to guilt, Crown counsel referred the court to Mr. Mohla’s driving record:CROWN COUNSEL:Your Honour, the Crown is alleging a record, and showing my friend notice with respect to that.DEFENCE COUNSEL:Your Honour, my friend’s already – or, pardon me, my client’s already admitted the record, you’re aware of that.I’m not too keen on the notice, but I have no ability to legally say that it shouldn’t go in.CROWN COUNSEL:Your Honour, the Crown’s position is that on a – on an early plea, certainly, perhaps no notice would have been required, but at this…THE COURT:Proved, you mean.CROWN COUNSEL:I’m sorry?THE COURT:No notice would have been proved.CROWN COUNSEL:Certainly.THE COURT:One you prove it…CROWN COUNSEL:Right.And perhaps the mandate – it…THE COURT: …kind of…CROWN COUNSEL:…wouldn’t have been…THE COURT:…ties my hands, doesn’t it?CROWN COUNSEL:Sorry.Well, not with respect to the driving prohibition.THE COURT:It’s all right.It’s your job.Don’t worry about it.Don’t be embarrassed.CROWN COUNSEL:Yes.DEFENCE COUNSEL:Well, I have some alternative view on that, Your Honour. … I mean, there are judges in this – Southern Ontario who recognize that there’s a – there’s a discretion, and there’s a – there’s actually a directive from the Attorney General, after five years there’s a discretion, and I believe that it was Judge Feldman, I could be wrong, in the North York court who, there’s a couple of cases that say that when some Crowns are introducing it and some aren’t, and particularly when some Crowns are using it to say that, if you plead not guilty, then I’m not going to introduce it and if you plead guilty and, even though you may have some legal arguments, and even though you might win half the cases in this situation, I’m still going to introduce the record and – notice, I should say, and tie the judge’s hands.My submission, it’s not appropriate.It’s an improper use of Crown discretion.THE COURT:Well, I’m sympathetic to the argument, but I’m not convinced of the legal basis for ignoring the notice.If I have such a discretion, I’m happy to use it in this case, and I’m willing to, now that I’m sitting here permanently, adjourn to allow you to make that argument, or bring such case law as you may wish to do, but absent that, insofar as the – the prescribed penalty is concerned, we can be creative about intermittent time and – and perhaps delaying implementation, but I think that’s as far as I can go.…THE COURT:…to deal with that question.So far as whether or not I have any kind of discretion to ignore the notice, the only – I’m – I have already indicated I’ll allow counsel to adjourn the matter to argue this more fully with access to Justice Feldman’s decision.It does seem to me on the surface though, that if there’s a guideline as to when it will be used and will not – or sorry, if there’s a guideline as to the timeframe, and then in my day, as defence counsel, it was five years.Now that may have been increased, I don’t know, maybe it’s eight years, maybe it’s ten years.But if there’s a guideline to that effect and this one falls outside that guideline, that it would seem to me to – to be an inappropriate use of discretion to say, well, we won’t prove it if you lay down, but we will prove it if you insist on having a trial.I – I find that objectionable.CROWN COUNSEL:Okay.Well, I can help Your Honour with respect to the – the policy.My friend’s quite right.The Crown manual – but I think it’s taken a bit out of context and it’s flipped on its head.It’s not – we don’t have any discretion when we’re within five – it is five years.So if we’re inside the five years, we have no discretion…THE COURT:Right.CROWN COUNSEL:..but to file it.So yes, the converse is…THE COURT:I mean…CROWN COUNSEL:…out of the five years we have.THE COURT:Okay.Let me give you my opinion.CROWN COUNSEL:Sure.THE COURT:Outside the five years…CROWN COUNSEL:Um hmm.THE COURT:…if there’s an accident, if there’s some injuries, if there’s some aggravating circumstances, and you might very well say, well, it’s the rate of speed here, then that’s fine.But to say, well, we might not have filed it on an early plea, but now that he’s been found guilty after a trial, we’re going to use it, is not fair ball…CROWN COUNSEL:Well – well, Your Honour…THE COURT:…at least in my view.CROWN COUNSEL:…I do say that the – that the—the driving is the aggravating factor.I can indicate I didn’t screen the brief myself.Had I done it, I would have indicated we would have tendered the notice beforehand as well, but there is a screening position my friend has and what it says is, if there was a plea we would not ask for jail, and we would file the notice after trial.[23]The Notice of Intention to Seek Increased Penalty (the notice) pursuant to s. 727(1) of the Code, dated April 14, 2007 and signed by a Crown counsel, stated:TAKE NOTICE pursuant to Section 727 of the Criminal Code that in the event you are convicted of the offence(s) under Section(s) 253 or 254(5) of the Criminal Code with which you are now charged (or any one of them where there are more than one) a greater punishment will be sought by reason of your previous conviction(s) (i.e., a sentence of imprisonment as required by the Criminal Code).Procedural Regularity[24]During a brief appearance on September 9, 2008, certain procedural matters were addressed.Respondent’s counsel, not Mr. Snell, was prepared to make submissions as to why the court was not bound by the s. 721 Code notice.Crown counsel submitted that because the defence position dealt with a challenge to a statutory recognition of prosecutorial discretion, based on ss. 7 and 12 of the Charter, that formal notice was necessary in her words, “so that people other than myself can come and indicate why the legislation is not unconstitutional”.The court agreed with the Crown’s position that the usual application materials ought to be filed in advance of argument.[25]The defence filed a Notice of Application and Constitutional Issue dated September 18, 2008 seeking an order staying proceedings or alternatively an exclusion of evidence for abuse of process and alleged breaches of ss. 7 and 12 of the Charter all on account of the prosecution proving pre-plea service of the s. 727 notice.The notice was served on the Peel Crown Attorney’s Office only.Arguments Respecting the s. 727(1) Notice[26]In submissions before the Ontario Court of Justice, respondent’s counsel submitted that:(1)the prosecution’s reliance on the s. 721 notice seeking an increased penalty on account of a relevant prior criminal record, and in turn curtailing the court’s discretion in sentencing, amounted to “an inappropriate, arbitrary and capricious exercise of Crown discretion in the circumstances of this case”(2)in the context of “very low” blood alcohol concentration (BAC) readings, and no circumstances such as racing or flight from the police, the prosecution’s exercise of discretion unreasonably departed from the “5-year rule” in the Ministry of Attorney General Policy governing the Crown’s discretionary use of the s. 721 notice for a mandatory and increased penalty(3)a sentencing court has an oversight function to ensure the conduct of fair criminal proceedings including during the sentencing phase – the employ of a Crown Charge Screening Form to improperly pressure a defendant and to induce guilty pleas, in effect leverage by an adversarial opponent limiting the court’s sentencing discretion not to impose custody should a defendant choose to exercise his right to trial, constitutes an abusive exercise of discretion rendering the process unfair – the respondent’s culpability was the same before the trial began as it was four hours later when the trial was completed – indeed, “his culpability decreased because after the trial [the] court found that [the respondent] was not guilty of impaired driving”(4)to treat the respondent’s current conviction as a second offence within the Code’s mandatory minimum sentencing regime given the gap in the criminal record “would be unfair, disproportionately harsh and would condone an arbitrary, capricious and improper exercise of Crown discretion”, would amount to a “grossly disproportionate sentence”, and constitute a breach of the respondent’s s. 7 and s. 12 Charter rights.[27]Before Gage J., Crown counsel, not Mr. Doyle, defended the prosecution position submitting that:(1)the respondent failed to challenge, pursuant to s. 52 of the Charter, the constitutionality of the “existence of Crown discretion as provided for by the joint operation of ss. 25[5](1)(a)(ii) and 727(1)” (emphasis of original)(2)the existence of prosecutorial discretion is not offensive to common law or constitutional principles of adjudicative fairness – judicial intervention in an instance of Crown discretion is rare and properly limited to an established abuse of process which requires proof of “mala fides” in the sense of improper motive, bad faith, arbitrariness or capriciousness on the part of the prosecution(3)the respondent failed to discharge his onus of establishing that the Crown’s exercise of discretion to file the s. 727 notice in this case constituted an abuse of process and, to the extent that the respondent sought a s. 24(1) Charter remedy, as a matter of law no constitutional exemption is available “to mandatory minimum sentences where…the sentencing provision itself meets Charter scrutiny”(4)the Ministry of Attorney General Policy 5-year guideline is not an absolute prohibition against service of the notice – the filing of the notice, after the Crown’s consideration of the “gap” in the record, did not result in a grossly disproportionate sentence in the particular circumstances of this case considering the following factors:(a)while acknowledging that the BAC readings were “relatively low”, having a BAC reading exceeding the proscribed legal limit, the respondent drove at the dangerously high speed of 178k/hr. on a public highway creating “a substantial risk to the public”(b)“From the Crown’s perspective an individual with a prior drink driving record, who approaches the problem, by accepting responsibility and perhaps engaging in counselling is differently situated than the same individual who will not accept responsibility and rather attempts to run a technical defence.It is important to consider that in an over 80, where there is no “Carter defence”, factual innocence is not the issue” – at trial, the respondent did not dispute guilt – no “actual innocence defence” was advanced, simply “a technical defence” of an alleged s. 10(b) Charter violation(c)the respondent was convicted after a trial – “in the absence of an important mitigating factor…a lack of remorse, and a lack of apparent rehabilitation” by a person undeterred by prior similar criminal proceedings including a driving prohibition – the position taken in the Crown Charge Screening Form in this case is not “an uncommon practice”(d)as to the acquittal of the respondent on the impaired operation charge, because of the Kienapple principle, had he pled guilty to the over .80 charge he would not, in any event, have been convicted of the impaired operation charge(e)the prosecution considered that the imposition of a 14-day jail sentence would not cause any “undue hardship or suffering on the part of this particular” defendant nor constitute a grossly disproportionate penalty - the Crown was not “…presented with the knowledge that, for example, this – this gentleman did take alcohol counselling, was on the right path, fell off the wagon and this was an isolated incident.I have – I have none of that information which may or may not have factored into filing the notice”.Further Submissions[28]After hearing the submissions of counsel, the trial judge adjourned the case to November 28, 2008 for judgment regarding the s. 727(1) issue.[29]On the return date, the trial judge stated that his research revealed a relevant authority, R. v. Gill (2008), 2008 ONCJ 502 (CanLII), 238 C.C.C. (3d) 465 (Ont.Ct.J.), and that he was “most impressed by the reasoning contained in it” and in particular its holding that the exercise of a discretionary power in the context of the s. 727(1) notice did not amount to a core prosecutorial function immunized from judicial review except in circumstances of abuse of process.[30]After providing Crown counsel an opportunity to review the Gill case, further submissions were heard.Crown counsel argued that:(1)it is “a core function of the Crown to make sentencing submissions, particularly where they are mandated by the Code, and also to make sentencing submissions that are responsive to the protection of the public” – the defendant was fully aware of the Crown’s position respecting the s. 727(1) notice in advance of his decision to go to trial(2)the mandatory minimum sentencing regime for drinking/driving crimes is not unconstitutional and was not itself challenged(3)as to the fitness or harshness of the sentence, service of the notice does not entirely fetter the court’s sentencing discretion – for example, the court may decide to order custody to be served intermittently or waive the victim fine surcharge(4)the Crown’s exercise of discretion to file a s. 727(1) notice is not reviewable on the “[r]easonableness standard” applied in Gill – in the alternative, unlike Gill where no reasons were provided by the prosecution for service of the notice, in the respondent’s matter reasons have been given for the Crown’s reasonable exercise of discretion:(a)the respondent drove at 178k/hr with a proscribed level of alcohol in his system(b)the absence of a mitigating plea of guilt which, if present, would have demonstrated remorse, indicated a rehabilitation step, and saved court and other resources necessary for a trial:If you don’t sort of try the whole way kicking and screaming, I haven’t done anything wrong and I am going to put you to the highest proof of this, including a Charter application, does that scream remorse?Not to me. Does that scream rehabilitation?Not to me.…We have an individual who, despite being offered a non-custodial sentence, indicated, no, I would like to run a Charter, which perfectly entitled to do, but it doesn’t bode well in – in my view, for remorse.…I guess, I do have to get into discussions, and I think it’s come out already that my friend and I had when you say, if his – if his position was, I can’t plead guilty to this because I simply, I wasn’t impaired, I may have been over 80, but I wasn’t impaired, I can advise you that it was acceptable to the Crown that he plead to the over 80 and we withdrew the impaired…(c)the lack of evidence of acceptance of responsibility or of voluntary steps toward rehabilitation:If an accused party comes before me as a resolution Crown or – I mean, we have to do these screening forms in the absence of any input from counsel, but – and says, listen, yes, I admit there is a – there is a problem here, I – I did it, I got caught, and I am willing to accept responsibility and I, you know, what, maybe I’ll even show you, I have enrolled in some alcohol counselling as a result of being caught this second time; that’s something not uncommon to be seen in the resolution stage.Could that persuade me that even though you were doing a hundred and seventy-eight kilometres per hour perhaps society can be protected because you acknowledge there is a problem and you are doing something about it?That’s not the case we have.[31]Following Crown counsel’s submissions, the trial judge stated that because he intended to follow the “non-core” approach in Gill, he only needed to hear from respondent’s counsel on the issue of reasonableness.Counsel responded with these submissions as to why the Crown’s discretion to file the notice was unreasonably exercised in Mr. Mohla’s case:(1)service of the notice did not, on the facts, comply with Ministry of Attorney General Policy(2)the prior conviction was over 10 years earlier(3)the BAC readings were “extremely low”(4)up to the very commencement of the trial, the Crown was prepared to forego filing of the notice – a point at which courtroom time had been scheduled and witnesses were already present(5)apart from excessive speed, the real distinction in the respondent’s case is that he elected to stand on his right to have a trial – he is improperly being punished for that decision and lack of remorse – while plea bargaining is integral to the administration of criminal justice, to “tie the court’s hands” for these reasons was unreasonable.Filing of the Notice Held Unreasonable[32]On December 15, 2008, Gage J. ruled that the respondent’s sentencing hearing would proceed “without regard to the Notice and the minimum sentence” ((2008), 2008 ONCJ 675 (CanLII), 79 M.V.R. (5th) 291 (Ont.Ct.J.), at para. 45).The court held that:(1)sections 255(1)(a) and 727(1) “neither expressly nor indirectly invest the Crown with a discretionary power over the filing of a Notice of Increased Penalty”(2)the “practice” or “custom” formalized in the Ministry of Attorney General Policy of a “discretionary power over the filing of a Notice where the prior conviction is more than five years old is therefore a power the Crown has appropriated to itself without statutory justification”(3)while the 5-year custom has been implicitly endorsed in the prevailing jurisprudence “as a responsible and acceptable method of interpreting the statutory provisions in a manner that makes them constitutionally tolerable”, the practice “cannot be reasonably characterized as a “core” Crown function”(4)the prosecutorial exercise of discretion is therefore reviewable on a standard of reasonableness – a broader scope of review than abuse of process(5)the Crown’s exercise of discretion to file the s. 727(1) notice in Mr. Mohla’s case was not reasonable considering that:(a)the gap between the drinking/driving convictions was slightly less than 9 years and “well beyond the five year guideline cited” in the Ministry of Attorney General Policy(b)there is no evidence of aggravating factors attached to the 1998 conviction(c)the BAC readings in the current case “are relatively low”(d)the offender has no other criminal record and was, at the time of the current offence, not subject to any court order or form of driving prohibition or administrative driving suspension; no prior provincial driving record was introduced(e)the sole aggravating factor is the respondent’s excessive speed – there “was no motor vehicle collision, no property damage and no personal injury”, the respondent did not attempt to evade or flee from the police, he was alone in the vehicle, and he was cooperative in the taking of the breath samples – and as to issue of speed, at the time of driving, traffic conditions were light and road conditions were good, and the respondent was not charged with dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, careless driving or speeding, and:In any event the factor of excessive speed can be taken into account on sentence without at the same time binding the sentencing power of the trial judge and the focus, for purposes of the filing of a Notice of Increased Penalty, should be on the prior conviction.(f)there is no evidence of chronic alcoholism(g)the appellant had “a triable and successful defence” to the impaired operation charge and, as to the s. 10(b) Charter application, “there were valid issues raised and it was by no means a frivolous exercise”.[33]The trial court concluded that:In these circumstances is my judgment it is not a reasonable exercise of Crown discretion to bind the Court to a custodial disposition on the basis of a single prior conviction having a vintage of roughly 9 years – or arguably more if you go from offence date to offence date – that has no aggravating features coupled with it, where the offender has no other driving record and where the single aggravating feature of the present occurrence is excessive speed.It seems to me that if a non-custodial disposition was reasonable on the morning that the trial started then it must still be reasonable after a trial has determined that the charge of impaired driving is not made out and the defence of the Over 80 charge fails on the basis of an unsuccessful Charter challenge.The present circumstance has the appearance of penalizing an accused for a vigorous assertion of his Charter rights and that cannot be a reasonable position.While it may not be unreasonable or objectionable per se to offer an inducement to early resolution by way of plea, it becomes objectionable where position advanced has the effect of binding the sentencing discretion of the Court.Sentence is Imposed[34]After the submissions of counsel, in addition to a 1-year driving prohibition, the trial judge imposed a short, sharp custodial sentence:Mr. Mohla it is often the case, almost invariably the case, that the primary penalty that is suffered by citizens in this circumstance is the loss of driving privileges.In modern society, it is a very rigorous and inconvenient penalty.I am satisfied that, given the amount of time that has passed between the last conviction and the present one, and notwithstanding that the Code does make provision for a two-year prohibition for you, given the low readings, a one-year prohibition will be sufficient.That said, I am concerned by two things.One is that you did not apparently get the message on the last occasion.This, although nine years away, should have been marked in your memory and the fine that was imposed at that time apparently did not prevent you from taking the wheel of the car again with the blood alcohol concentration in excess of 80 milligrams.The second feature is of even more concern, and that is a combination of the presence of alcohol in your blood and speeds of 180 kilometres per hour on the 403 highway.Entirely apart from whether or not you were moving in and out of traffic, the speed of 80 kilometres above the posted legal limit is extremely dangerous and put you and other members of the public in peril.Having regard to that circumstance, it seems to me that in order to express appropriate denunciation and deterrence, a jail term is appropriate, although not in the mandatory minimum amount.What I have in mind is something that will give you a taste of jail and a taste that you will encounter in the future if you get yourself behind the wheel of a car again with a blood alcohol concentration in excess of 80 milligrams.Taking into account of all those circumstances, including your personal circumstances, I find that the appropriate sentence is four days incarceration.I am content that that can be served intermittently, and what that effectively means is that you will serve one weekend.That, I hope, will be a sufficient taste to allow you to resolve that you will not ever again become involved in this type of offence.THE SINGH TRIALThe Result[35]At Mr. Singh’s trial on charges of impaired operation of a motor vehicle and refusal to comply with a breath demand, the prosecution proceeded summarily.After a trial, the appellant was found guilty of impaired operation of a motor vehicle while the second charge was dismissed.The Decision to Commence the Trial[36]The appellant’s trial was scheduled for May 30, 2008.At the outset of trial, Mr. Singh was not present in court.Defence counsel, not Mr. Snell, informed the presiding trial judge that:Mr. Singh’s not here.Mr. Singh and I just got off the phone about ten minutes ago.Apparently about an hour ago he was discharged from Etobicoke General.He indicates that – difficulties with a slipped disk and was administered a series of narcotic pain medications and the discharge summary is being faxed to my office by his wife now.So, that’s where we stand.It’s the second trial but it didn’t get reached on the last occasion.He was here.So that’s where we are with Mr. Singh’s matter.I’m ready – I’m ready to go.[37]Crown counsel, not Mr. Doyle, submitted that it being the second trial date, and all of the Crown witnesses being present including a civilian witness, the prosecution should proceed.Duncan J. stated:THE COURT:In any event you know, I’m concerned about this, it sounds awfully you know, convenient or coincidental for him to all of a sudden come up with this problem on the eve of the trial.DEFENCE COUNSEL:Right.THE COURT:And I’d like to see this medical evidence to back it.It’s going – it’s been faxed to your office?DEFENCE COUNSEL:Yes.It’s being faxed – I asked him immediately that that has to be done.THE COURT:Okay, and from there can it be faxed to the Crown’s office or duty counsel’s office so we can see it?DEFENCE COUNSEL:Yes.[38]After a recess, appellant’s counsel informed the trial judge that he had spoken directly to Mr. Singh’s treating physician at the William Osler Health Centre about the circumstances of his hospital attendance.As well, counsel produced a faxed medical chart from the Centre.The appellant had a herniated disk surgically repaired in 1994.A 2007 MRI revealed another herniated disk.On the May 30, 2008 trial date, Mr. Singh complained of lower back pain.He was administered by injection, and prescribed, narcotic pain medication.[39]The trial judge raised the option of commencing the trial ex parte pursuant to s. 803 of the Code in order to hear the testimony of the civilian witness who Crown counsel described as “very anxious to proceed”.Defence counsel responded:THE COURT:Well, my inclination Mr. Posner, subject to what you say is to...DEFENCE COUNSEL:Yes.THE COURT:...begin this trial ex parte.At least hear the civilian witness and then adjourn for a continuation.I’m not going to ask this witness to come back on another occasion for this.DEFENCE COUNSEL:I know.I understand the concerns.I certainly don’t want her to have to come back either.THE COURT:Okay.DEFENCE COUNSEL:And I’m certainly quite ready to cross-examine her.[40]Counsel noted that he had not researched the ex parte trial issue and had no instructions from his client:DEFENCE COUNSEL:Right.I’m not – I certainly have, you know, [not] been a part of an ex parte trial although there’s a first time for everything – first time for everything.THE COURT:Almost by definition you’re not here.Yeah.DEFENCE COUNSEL:I haven’t researched the issue, Your Honour.I certainly don’t have, you know, any instructions from him in that regard and quite frankly, without an interpreter as well, I wouldn’t feel very comfortable getting those instructions from him on the phone.So I don’t know what the jurisprudence says.[41]The trial judge pressed the problem of the civilian witness’ second attendance to give evidence:THE COURT:Well, this matter, all right.I understand it’s the second time up, no matter what the reasons for the last adjournment, we have a civilian witness present.DEFENCE COUNSEL:Yeah.THE COURT:The defendant’s represented by counsel who will no doubt defend him as ably as he would if the defendant was here.My suggestion is the balance of the best way to convenience, if that is the right word, probably not the right word, but the best way to accommodate all the parties, and no solution is perfect, but it’s my suggestion that we begin this trial, hear the civilian witness and I’ll adjourn it for continuation at that time.The defendant hopefully will attend.The Trial Evidence with Singh Appearing by Counsel[42]Sandra Jackson testified in-chief that on May 3, 2007, at about 10:00 p.m., as she was driving at about 100 k/hr. south on Highway #410 in Brampton, another southbound vehicle in the lane to her left veered into her lane about two thirds of a vehicle length ahead of her.Her vehicle was almost struck forcing her to move to the left to avoid a collision although she had few options as concrete berms were to her left.She honked her horn.At that point, the driver, subsequently identified as Mr. Singh, jerked his vehicle aggressively back into his own lane and out of it to the right side.Ms. Jackson felt panicked but not angry.[43]Ms. Jackson informed the trial court that she then drew her vehicle parallel to the appellant’s van in order to observe whether he was intoxicated or perhaps in need of medical assistance if he was having a heart attack.Weather conditions were clear and dry.On seeing the appellant, she concluded that the driver was “fairly intoxicated” – he appeared slack-jawed, he was nodding and leaning over the steering wheel as though to support himself.At that point, she slowed to avoid the potential for her vehicle to be hit. She phoned 9-1-1 at about 10:08 p.m. and followed Mr. Singh’s van.Traffic conditions on the highway were medium to medium-light.As she did so, on her evidence, she saw the appellant driving erratically “weaving all over the road”.A couple of other motorists honked their car horns at Mr. Singh.The appellant’s car exited the highway at Steeles Ave.At a green traffic light, the appellant hesitated quite a while before proceeding through the intersection.On Steeles Ave., where traffic conditions were heavy, the vehicle veered into other vehicles’ lanes.The appellant was seen to “overcorrect” as he sought to keep the van in his own lane. The witness feared an accident would occur.[44]Ms. Jackson followed the appellant for about 13.1 k. over a time period of between eight and nine minutes.At Steeles and Airport Rd., two police cruisers arrived and stopped traffic.From a distance of about ten feet away, Ms. Jackson observed that when one officer opened the driver’s door of the appellant’s vehicle, Mr. Singh fell out in the sense that he leaned to his left out of the door and was grabbed by the officers to prevent him falling to the ground.[45]When the trial court asked defence counsel whether he had questions for the witness in cross-examination, counsel responded:DEFENCE COUNSEL:Yes.I’ll do the best I can in the circumstances.THE COURT:I’m sure you’ll do just fine.DEFENCE COUNSEL:More helpful if my client was here.[46]In cross-examination, Ms. Jackson rejected the suggestion that she had given the appellant “the finger” – “I don’t give people the finger.You might get shot for that”.The witness was further questioned regarding aspects of her trial evidence not included in her roadside statement to the police on May 3, 2007.Ms. Jackson testified that she provided the police a brief statement only not a full summary.[47]The witness maintained that she followed the appellant’s vehicle not because she was mad but in order to give the 9-1-1 dispatcher an ongoing account of Mr. Singh’s location and because she was determined “to have a drunk driver taken off the road before there was an accident”.[48]Once Ms. Jackson’s testimony was completed, the trial judge stated:Now, I think in fairness to the defendant we’ll adjourn the case at this point to ... set a date for continuation.The court also ordered three copies of a transcript of Jackson’s evidence.The trial was adjourned over four months to October 9, 2008.The Trial Continuation[49]On the October 9, 2008 return date, counsel advised Duncan J. that in respect of the filed application materials relating to alleged breaches of ss. 8, 9 and 10 of the Charter, that it was agreed between the parties to adopt a “blended” procedure – a trial on the merits parallel to Charter-related questioning.[50]On May 3, 2007 at about 10:19 p.m., Peel Regional Police Service (P.R.P.S.) Constable Daines received a radio dispatch of a citizen complaint of a possible impaired driver eastbound on Steeles near Tomken Rd.At 10:23 p.m., the officer approached the target vehicle with its lone occupant and opened the driver’s door.As Mr. Singh went to step out, he stumbled.[51]The constable acknowledged in cross-examination that it is possible that he grabbed the appellant to remove him from the vehicle.Constable Daines observed the driver’s bloodshot and watery eyes and he smelled a strong odour of alcohol.The driver’s speech was slurred.The officer handcuffed the appellant and arrested him for “impaired” operation based on his care or control of the vehicle while exhibiting the symptoms he had observed.Mr. Singh was unsteady on his feet as he was being handcuffed.The constable was satisfied that he and the arrestee understood one another.[52]At P.R.P.S. 21 Division, after the 39-year-old motorist had the opportunity to speak with duty counsel, the arrestee was turned over to P.R.P.S. Constable Kozuska, a qualified breath technician.Constable Kozuska testified that he observed common indicia of alcohol consumption in Mr. Singh.The appellant had slurred speech, was crying and staggered as he went to use the washroom.The officer demonstrated how to produce a suitable breath sample into the intoxilyzer.He and the arrestee had no trouble understanding one another.Although the technician at one point during the testing observed a reading of 290 mg. alcohol/100ml. blood, the breath samples provided by the appellant were insufficient for a valid test as the blowing was not sustained for an adequate duration.Constable Kozuska described Mr. Singh as not making a tight seal on the mouthpiece with his lips.He was blowing hard only for a second before stopping.The officer was familiar with these techniques of a motorist attempting to appear to comply with a breath demand.After several opportunities to comply with the demand, the appellant was charged with the refusal offence.[53]Mr. Singh was the sole defence witness at trial.The witness testified that on May 3, 2007, he left work early and went to his brother’s house at about 3:00 p.m. to visit with an uncle who had come from India.In his in-chief evidence, the appellant stated that he ate dinner there at 5:00 or 6:00.He had “one or two shots” of whiskey before dinner.In cross-examination, the witness stated that he had “two small shots”.After dinner, they talked for a long time. When he left his brother’s residence at about 10:00 p.m. he was not intoxicated.He believed there would be no difficulty driving his vehicle.[54]The appellant informed the court that his vehicle did not nearly hit the Jackson vehicle.In Mr. Singh’s words, “I had a fight with her.It was a fight on the road”.On the appellant’s evidence when he “took away [his] car turned toward that side” and the other driver “said wrong things” to him through the open window of her vehicle and “showed [him] fingers” as she became angry.His vehicle window was already open.[55]Mr. Singh testified that when the police opened the driver’s door of his stopped vehicle and he undid his seatbelt, the police forcefully pulled him from the driver’s seat.Mr. Singh has resided in Canada since 1988.Claiming that he can only speak English at a level 3 on a scale of 1 to 10 and understood a “little bit” of English only as his first language is Punjabi, the witness testified that he did not understand what was happening.The handcuffs were tight.[56]At the police facility, on the appellant’s evidence, he felt very upset and emotional.He was informed that he was being charged “for driving and drinking”.[57]He felt tense when speaking to duty counsel and did not understand what was being said.The appellant testified that although he understood what the intoxilyzer was for, he could not understand the directions he was being given.He cried because he was upset.On the breath-room video, when an officer stated, “You’re drunk”, Mr. Singh replied, “I know”.The appellant testified that he tried to blow into the machine on at least five or six occasions.He did not hear that he would be charged if he did not provide a suitable breath sample.In his evidence, Mr. Singh denied that he refused to provide an adequate breath sample because he knew he was impaired by alcohol.Prior Record and Filing of the s. 727(1) Notice[58]On October 10, 2008, Duncan J. provided reasons for judgment finding Mr. Singh guilty only of the impaired operation of a motor vehicle charge.The prosecutor produced a prior criminal record which was admitted.Mr. Singh was convicted of impaired operation of a motor vehicle on April 11, 1994 and was sentenced to a $350 fine and a 1-year driving prohibition.Also on October 20, the Crown filed a Statutory Warning form served on the appellant on May 4, 2007 by Constable Daines which reads in part:Pursuant to Section 727(1) of the Criminal Code, this is to inform you that the Crown will be proceeding against you as a second or subsequent offender on the Charge(s) presently before the Court......IN THE EVENT OF YOUR BEING CONVICTED, AN INCREASED PENALTY WILL BE SOUGHT BY REASON OF PREVIOUS CONVICTION OR CONVICTIONS RECORDED AGAINST YOU[59]With the filing of the notice, the trial judge addressed the prosecutor:THE COURT:What’s the Crown’s position here?CROWN COUNSEL:The Crown’s filed notice, Your Honour.THE COURT:Oh really?All right.I see that.A little unusual, isn’t it, to file notice...CROWN COUNSEL:I was not the trial Crown and [she has] indicated that that is the decision that she has made.I’m not in a position to second guess that.THE COURT:But aren’t you guys governed by the directives about this so there’s standardized practice?CROWN COUNSEL:And that is within the directive put forth by the Crown Policy Manual to file the notice.Mandatory within five years.Discretionary outside five.THE COURT:Well, isn’t there some criteria as to when the discretion’s exercised?I mean, I always thought that it was for, you know, cases where a person has a number of old ones, for example.Anyway, you know, you can talk about that.[60]The case was adjourned to October 27, 2008 for sentencing.On the return date, when the trial judge asked the different Crown counsel who was present (who had not been the trial prosecutor) whether the Crown was persisting with its s. 727 position, he was advised that that was the case.The sentencing hearing did not commence but was adjourned to November 10.Arguments Respecting the s. 727(1) Notice/Procedural Discussion[61]On November 10, 2008, Mr. Singh’s trial counsel, without filing any notice of application, made the following submissions said to justify setting aside the s. 727(1) notice:(1)no Charter challenge was being invoked regarding any sections of the Criminal Code(2)based on the Gill decision, the decision to file a s. 727(1) notice was not a core prosecutorial function(3)it is a violation of s. 7 of the Charter “to give the Crown carte blanche to decide when and when not to impose a minimum penalty” as it is a principle of fundamental justice “that the court determine a fit sentence” – while Parliament may bind the court’s exercise of discretion through the enactment of a mandatory minimum sentencing scheme, an individual prosecutor cannot, in effect, be assigned equivalent authority(4)the defence was not asserting an abuse of process(5)the trial court has jurisdiction, on a standard of reasonableness, to review the Crown’s exercise of discretion to file a s. 727(1) notice including whether the Crown took into account only appropriate considerations in making its decision(6)the Crown’s exercise of discretion to file the notice in Mr. Singh’s case was unreasonable considering that:(a)the significant gap in the criminal record - the prior drinking/driving conviction was over 14 years ago(b)there were no serious aggravating circumstances such as injury or property damage(c)the appellant had no other criminal record(d)the collateral consequence of a driving prohibition was particularly punitive because Mr. Singh was employed as a truck driver.[62]When the trial judge raised the issue of whether, in light of the nature of the Crown’s submissions, notice was necessary under the Courts of Justice Act, counsel replied, “My understanding is you don’t.My – I mean, my friend was – was well aware”.While Crown counsel expressed her view that the trial judge was correct, the matter was pressed no further.No notice was given pursuant to s. 109 of the Courts of Justice Act.[63]In response to a question from the court as to whether Mr. Singh was offered a plea agreement, the prosecutor confirmed that while he was offered a negotiated deal for a plea that would have avoided a jail term, he determined to have a trial which was “obviously his right”.[64]Crown counsel replied to the appellant’s arguments respecting the s. 727(1) notice in this way:(1)s. 727(1) is “not an enabling provision for the Crown” as “[t]he purpose of 727 is to provide fairness for the accused person, to let them know when an increased penalty is going to be sought” – the provision “is a benefit to the accused”(2)defence challenge to filing of the s. 727(1) notice is in effect an attempt “to avoid getting the mandatory minimum sentence that Parliament has enacted”(3)the conferral of discretion upon the Crown recognizes that it would not always be appropriate to file notice:...it suggests that Parliament is giving the Crown that discretion for the reason that Your Honour pointed out earlier, which is that sometimes it wouldn’t be appropriate [to] file the notice.Let’s say if there’s a conviction that’s 30 years old or there is serious mitigating factors on the part of the accused person that the Crown is aware of.(4)filing of the s. 727(1) notice is within the scope of prosecutorial discretion reviewable only for abuse of process(5)alternatively, if the standard of review is reasonableness, the exercise of discretion to file a s. 727(1) notice in Mr. Singh’s case was reasonable having regard to these factors:(a)“it’s aggravating in and of itself that there is a previous conviction”(b)the appellant was driving “so badly on the highway that he spark[ed] the interest of a civilian witness who call[ed] police”(c)driving at high speed with alcohol in his system, the appellant almost caused a collision(d)there was an extreme level of intoxication according to the witnesses’ observations(e)in addition:Also there’s no mitigation of a plea which would have showed that he was remorseful for what happened that would have saved some court resources.And instead he went to trial.And so, as Your Honour pointed out he doesn’t get points for that.So, in my...THE COURT:Well, was he – was he offered a plea to one count or the other?Because he – he was acquitted of one count here.CROWN COUNSEL:He was offered a plea.I’m not – I can’t tell Your Honour if it was to one or both because I don’t recall.But he was offered a plea where he would have avoided a jail sentence.I can certainly say that.And then instead he wanted to press ahead and have a trial which is obviously his right.[65]The trial judge raised the issue as to who makes the decision to file a s. 727(1) notice:THE COURT:Tell me this.Is the decision to proceed with notice, is that the individual prosecutor, in this case, yours.It doesn’t have to be vetted by anyone more senior in your office or anything like that?CROWN COUNSEL:It is the decision of the individual prosecutor.THE COURT:Yeah.CROWN COUNSEL:Obviously there are policies that...THE COURT:Right.CROWN COUNSEL:...are involved.The Crown policy manual has effect in how we should exercise our discretion.THE COURT:Yes.CROWN COUNSEL:But certainly it is at the discretion of the Crown that’s conducted the trial or that is dealing with the case.THE COURT:Okay.CROWN COUNSEL:And who knows more about the case at hand.Filing of the Notice Held Unreasonable[66]On December 2, 2008, the trial judge provided reasons for judgment concluding that the prosecutor’s exercise of discretion to file a s. 727(1) notice was reviewable on a standard of reasonableness, and that in Mr. Singh’s case, that discretion had been unreasonably exercised:The escalating minimum sentencing scheme in section 255 is one based solely on recidivism: R. v. Garcia [2004] O.J. No. 1714; 20 C.R. 6th 63. On its own the section would require its minimums to be imposed no matter how old the previous conviction or convictions. Relief from this result has crept in only through a practice that has developed based on what is now generally understood to be the misinterpretation of section 727(2), notice of intention to seek increased penalty, as applying to minimum sentencing: R. v. King (2007) 48 M.V.R. (5th) 171. The Crown's exercise of discretion operates therefore in the direction of forbearance or exception from, rather than inclusion within, a fixed sentencing scheme.The Ontario Crown's office has established policy in an attempt to achieve some uniformity in approach to the exercise of discretion under the section: see excerpt in R. v. Sanghera (2002) 22 M.V.R. (4th) 155. The basic rule is that notice shall be given if there is a conviction within the previous five years. Exceptions shall be considered in consultation with the Crown Attorney or Regional Director. Further, notice may be given in cases falling outside of the five year rule at the discretion of prosecuting counsel (without the requirement of consultation). A number of relevant factors to the exercise of that discretion are listed: see Sanghera paras. 8 and 9. They include not only the age and number of past convictions but also consideration of the circumstances of the present offence and the offender.It can be seen then that while the statute itself focuses solely on recidivism, the guidelines respecting the Crown's discretion takes a wider approach. But it seems to me that even within these broader guidelines the discretion to invoke a minimum sentence \"by reason of previous convictions\" must give the substantial weight to the convictions themselves, their nature, number and date, as opposed to aggravating features of the present offence which may well be urged to justify an increased, though discretionary sentence.In this case there is a single conviction well outside the 5 year guideline. It was not for an aggravated form of the offence, such as cause bodily harm or death, and by the penalty imposed it would appear to have been a usual case of its kind. In short, there is nothing about the nature, number or date of the prior conviction that would favour the giving of notice. On the other side of the ledger, tolerably uniform application of the discretion is highly desirable. In my experience, at least in this jurisdiction, notice is rarely if ever given based on a record of this type and vintage. Finally, even adding circumstances of the present offence into the mix, those circumstances are not so egregious as to make this case highly exceptional. It is my view that the exceptional exercise of discretion in this case, markedly out of step with similar cases, renders it unreasonable. The Notice and the minimum sentence should be disregarded.This is not to say that the defendant may not still receive a jail sentence. The aggravating factors of the present offence and the past conviction provide a good argument in support of such a disposition. To this point, submissions have focused on the issue dealt with in these reasons. I will now hear submissions on the appropriate discretionary sentence to be imposed in this case.Sentence is Imposed[67]On the same date, Duncan J. sentenced the appellant as follows:Well it is my view that this is an aggravating case of its kind for the reasons Crown counsel has mentioned.The facts disclose a high level of impairment and while every impaired driver constitutes a danger, this man was a clear, present and actual danger to the other drivers on one of the busiest highways in this area.He has a prior conviction, he has been through this before.He was convicted in 1994 of impaired operation and was fined.While that was a significant period of time ago, it is still relevant.The defendant does not benefit from credit for showing remorse or responsibility either through a guilty plea.Of course, he is entitled to take the matter to trial, but he cannot seek to have credit for remorse, if he does so.Further, it is my view that the defendant has not recognized that he has a problem that needs to be addressed.He has done nothing to address an alcohol problem, which in my view, must be obvious on the facts of this case and in his history, which includes a prior conviction.Accordingly, I think it is a case where, for his specific deterrence and for general deterrence, it is important that there be a sting to the punishment.Accordingly, there will be a jail sentence of seven days imprisonment.In addition, he will be on probation for a term of one year.He will keep the peace and be of good behaviour, report to probation today, thereafter as required.And he will submit to an assessment with respect to substance abuse, particularly alcohol abuse.And he will take such counselling and programs as may be recommend for alcohol abuse.Further, there will be an order prohibiting him from driving a motor vehicle anywhere in Canada for a period of 18 months.POSITIONS OF THE PARTIESSingh’s Conviction Appeal – The Initial Phase of the TrialThe Appellant[68]Relying upon s. 650(1) of the Code, applicable to summary conviction trial proceedings by virtue of s. 795, the appellant asserts a statutory, and constitutional right as a principle of fundamental justice, to be present at his own trial in the absence of misconduct or consent.[69]Mr. Snell submitted that either the fairness of the trial was compromised by Duncan J.’s erroneous decision to commence an ex parte trial or, at a minimum, a miscarriage of justice occurred through the appearance of an unfair trial.Counsel further argued that:(1)while s. 803(2)(a) provides “another exception” to the general rule of presence for a criminal defendant at his own trial, it is an “extraordinary power” not to be routinely exercised(2)contrary to the trial judge’s view that the circumstances of the earlier thrown-away trial date were irrelevant, it was germane to the decision whether to proceed in Mr. Singh’s absence that he had been ready for trial on the prior occasion and, through no fault of his own, his case was not reached(3)there was no history of the defendant missing court dates or failing to appear(4)the trial judge had an overbooked court list and there existed no danger of running out of work(5)with the trial judge immediately voicing suspicion on hearing trial counsel’s explanation of his client’s absence, the court’s s. 803 decision implicitly reflected a continuing view of malingering on Mr. Singh’s part despite clear evidence, confirmed by a hospital discharge record and counsel’s submission as an officer of the court, that the defendant’s absence was not as a result of choice, carelessness or a cavalier attitude but on account of unexpected medical circumstances(6)appellant’s trial counsel had no opportunity to acquire instructions regarding proceeding with the trial in his absence.The Crown[70]In response, Mr. Doyle submitted that there exists no reversible error in the trial judge’s exercise of discretion to commence the trial on May 30, 2008 with only appellant’s counsel present having regard to the following:(1)the trial judge had the authority to determine whether an adjournment of the trial was appropriate and his exercise of discretion in that regard should be afforded deference(2)in summary conviction trial matters, a defendant may, pursuant to s. 800(2), appear personally at trial or simply by counsel as his agent – s. 803(2)(a), authorizing trial in the absence of a defendant, is therefore contextually different than s. 650(1)(3)given that the alleged offences were over 12 months earlier, the trial was not reached on the scheduled March 28, 2008 date, and a civilian witness would be inconvenienced a third time if the case did not proceed with the risk of a further diminishment of her memory, there existed a significant societal interest in beginning the trial(4)defence counsel acknowledged that he was prepared to cross-examine Ms. Jackson.[71]Crown counsel submitted that should this court be of the view that the broad discretion exercisable by the trial court ought to have been in favour of adjourning the entire trial, that no prejudice was occasioned within the scope of s. 686(1)(b)(iv), by this procedural irregularity considering that:(1)trial counsel for the appellant was indeed ready to cross-examine Ms. Jackson and did so relating to her bias and her out-of-court statement to the police and with respect to matters about which Mr. Singh would ultimately testify – that she gave him the finger and engaged in an angry pursuit of his vehicle(2)no affidavit from the appellant or his trial counsel was filed on appeal documenting actual prejudice or feeling of an appearance of an unfair trial.Compliance with s. 109 of the Courts of Justice Act[72]Section 109 of the Courts of Justice Act reads:Notice of constitutional question109.(1) Notice of a constitutional question shall be served on the Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney General of Ontario in the following circumstances:1.The constitutional validity or constitutional applicability of an Act of the Parliament of Canada or the Legislature, of a regulation or by-law made under such an Act or of a rule of common law is in question.2. A remedy is claimed under subsection 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in relation to an act or omission of the Government of Canada or the Government of Ontario.Failure to give notice(2) If a party fails to give notice in accordance with this section, the Act, regulation, by-law or rule of common law shall not be adjudged to be invalid or inapplicable, or the remedy shall not be granted, as the case may be.Form of notice(2.1) The notice shall be in the form provided for by the rules of court or, in the case of a proceeding before a board or tribunal, in a substantially similar form.Time of notice(2.2) The notice shall be served as soon as the circumstances requiring it become known and, in any event, at least fifteen days before the day on which the question is to be argued, unless the court orders otherwise.Notice of appeal(3) Where the Attorney General of Canada and the Attorney General of Ontario are entitled to notice under subsection (1), they are entitled to notice of any appeal in respect of the constitutional question.Right of Attorneys General to be heard(4) Where the Attorney General of Canada or the Attorney General of Ontario is entitled to notice under this section, he or she is entitled to adduce evidence and make submissions to the court in respect of the constitutional question.Right of Attorneys General to appeal(5) Where the Attorney General of Canada or the Attorney General of Ontario makes submissions under subsection (4), he or she shall be deemed to be a party to the proceedings for the purpose of any appeal in respect of the constitutional question.[73]The parties agreed that in neither the Mohla nor the Singh case was s. 109 notice given to the Attorney General of Canada.[74]Both parties were further in agreement that, in the absence of de facto notice through an equivalent of the required written notice, notice ought to have been provided in accordance with the legislation.[75]After the summary conviction trial proceedings were concluded and these appeals were pending with this court having raised the issue of s. 109 compliance, the provincial Crown contacted an authorized delegate of the Attorney General of Canada.In correspondence of June 28, 2010, the Attorney General Canada advised that it did not intend to intervene in the appeals and, on July 8, indicated that it “waives the notice that was required to have been served on our office at the trial level pursuant to s. 109 of the Courts of Justice Act”.A further letter of July 12 from Department of Justice Canada counsel stated:I write in relation to the Notice of Constitutional Questions filed in the above-noted summary conviction appeals.I kindly ask that this correspondence be placed before the Court.I am advised by Mr. Doyle, the provincial prosecutor, that a question has arisen regarding whether a notice of constitutional question was provided at the trial level and the impact that may have on the summary conviction appeal.In the present instance, the Attorney General of Canada takes the position that the absence of notice is not fatal and consents, for the purposes of the summary conviction appeal, to waive notice required pursuant to s. 109 of the Courts of Justice Act at the trial level.We expressly do not waive notice in any future appeals in this matter.[76]It was jointly submitted that the failure to provide pre-trial notice in accordance with the statute is not fatal in the particular circumstances of these cases because of the retroactive waiver tendered by Attorney General Canada.Validity of the s. 727(1) Notice ProcessThe Crown[77]On behalf of the Crown, Mr. Doyle submitted that the trial judges in both cases erred, in the absence of circumstances of abuse of process, in purporting to set aside the s. 727(1) notices on account of their respective views that the prosecution acted unreasonably in filing and proving pre-plea notice to the offenders that conviction on their current charges would lead to punishment as a recidivist for drinking/driving crime.[78]Crown counsel emphasized the essentiality of prosecutorial discretion to the operation of the criminal justice system.A unique, quasi-judicial role is held by the Attorney General and his or her agents.As such, the Crown is no ordinary litigant.[79]Because of the importance of prosecutorial discretion, it “is generally not subject to a review”.[80]It was submitted that failure by the judiciary to afford broad deferential treatment to a Crown prosecutor’s exercise of discretion risks impermissible erosion of division of power and responsibility – in effect blurring the judicial function into that of a “supervising prosecutor”.Government has the authority to set enforcement priorities and the resources and expertise to analyze data informing the setting of policy for example in furtherance of public safety.[81]Mr. Doyle argued that the Crown’s decision whether or not to prove service of a s. 727(1) notice is, implicitly and by analogy, an exercise of discretion within the “core elements of prosecutorial discretion” as described in Krieger v. Law Society of Alberta, 2002 SCC 65 (CanLII), [2002] 3 S.C.R. 372. Though not expressly identified in Krieger as an example of a core exercise of prosecutorial discretion, it can be said that proof of the s. 727(1) notice is within the contemplation of the Court’s “other discretionary decisions” phrasing.[82]The Criminal Code expressly confers upon the Crown the authority to prove service of a s. 727(1) notice and the exercise of such discretion in individual cases is “circumscribed internally” by policy of the Attorney General within the public law role of the Crown.[83]As the Crown’s decision regarding whether or not to prove s. 727(1) notice is within the core elements of prosecutorial discretion, it is unreviewable by the courts except in circumstances of flagrant impropriety by a Crown prosecutor.In the Singh case, there was no such allegation of abuse of process.In Mr. Mohla’s trial, there was no abuse of process demonstrated by the defence or found by the trial judge.Accordingly, in each case, the trial judge was bound to sentence the defendant as a repeat offender subject to the statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment in s. 255(1).The trial courts erred in effectively second-guessing the decisions of the Crown prosecutors amounting to impermissible intrusion on the Attorney General’s agents’ exercise of discretion without full knowledge of the circumstances of the prior offences, crime statistic trends or the informed justifications of government policy.[84]As an alternative position should this court not conclude that a prosecutor’s s. 727(1) notice decision lies within the core elements of prosecutorial discretion, Mr. Doyle submitted that the court may only undertake review of proof of a s. 727(1) notice where an offender establishes “a reasonable likelihood of breach of a Charter right”.While acknowledging that proof of the s. 727(1) notice curtails a court’s sentencing discretion, counsel submitted that no constitutional breach arises by that effect alone.The court retains a discretion respecting the imposition of imprisonment beyond the mandatory minimum and as to how the incarceration will be served (intermittently or not). There is no question of the s. 255 mandatory minimum sentence regime itself being unconstitutional.No s. 52 Charter challenge was taken in these cases suggesting that s. 727(1) was in all instances unconstitutional.In effect, the offenders sought to have the sentencing judges grant a constitutional exemption, a remedy legally unavoidable.The mandatory minimum sentences of 14 days’ imprisonment, representing the sentencing floor for the courts in these cases as a result of proof of pre-plea service of the s. 727(1) notice, could not be described as a “grossly disproportionate” punishment within the scope of the relevant s. 7 and s. 12 Charter jurisprudence.[85]Returning to the Crown’s alternative position, Mr. Doyle submitted that a s. 24(1) Charter remedy of a sentencing court holding that an offender is not subject to the combined effect of ss. 727(1) and 255(1)(a) would arise only in the exceptional circumstance of an offender demonstrating breach of a Charter right.[86]The discussion in this regard turned to Crown counsel’s acceptance that an arbitrary decision of a prosecutor to prove service of a s. 727(1) notice, though falling short of characterization as an abuse of process, could amount to a breach of an offender’s s. 7 Charter right having regard to the effect of the notice in such a case constituting a threat to liberty other than in accord with principles of fundamental justice.Mr. Doyle accepted within this alternative argument, that an unreasonable exercise of discretion could, in some cases, be described as arbitrary.That said, because reasonableness contemplates a range of views, the courts must give deference to the prosecution agents in their decisions to prove the s. 727(1) notice.Counsel acknowledged that, depending upon the particulars of a specific case, and leaving the prospect of a “rogue” prosecutor to the side, failure to consider relevant factors, reliance upon improper or irrelevant factors, or marked over or under-reliance on appropriate considerations could justify a conclusion of arbitrariness.[87]Questioned further as to this alternative position, and asked not for his own or his office’s view but for the position of the Attorney General as to how such review would play out before a sentencing court, Mr. Doyle filed a “Challenging the Crown’s Discretion to Seek a Mandatory Minimum Penalty in Drinking and Driving Cases: An Analytical Framework”:1. The following analytical framework is proposed to assist courts in resolving challenges to the Crown’s discretion to seek a mandatory minimum penalty in drinking and driving cases pursuant to sections 259 and 727 of the Criminal Code:STEP 1:The Applicant asserts that the Crown’s decision to seek a mandatory minimum penalty could constitute a violation of the Charter.In determining this issue, the Court considers only the criminal record (including the dates and punishment for prior drinking and driving offences), and the facts of the current case.If the Court is not satisfied that a violation of the Charter could be made out on a balance of probabilities, no further inquiry is undertaken; conversely, if a violation could be established, the Court proceeds to Step Two.STEP 2:With service to the federal and provincial attorneys general in accordance with section 109 of the Courts of Justice Act, the Applicant brings a formal application pursuant to the applicable rules of court to challenge the Crown’s decision to seek a mandatory minimum penalty.The Notice of Application must identify section(s) of the Charter allegedly infringed, and include an affidavit from the Applicant that states with precision the manner in which his or her Charter rights would be infringed by the imposition of the mandatory minimum penalty.The Applicant would be subject to cross-examination by the Crown concerning the contents of his or her affidavit.The Crown then identifies the factors taken into consideration in seeking a mandatory minimum penalty.In support of its position, the Crown may lead evidence of the facts behind any prior findings of guilt, as well as the particulars of any relevant charges that were withdrawn, diverted, or subject to a plea under the Highway Traffic Act, if such circumstances factored into the decision to seek a mandatory minimum penalty.The focus of the inquiry at this stage is whether the Crown acted judiciously in determining whether to seek a greater penalty.Acting judiciously in this context means that the Crown considered all the relevant factors, and neither placed undue weight on any of them, nor considered any irrelevant or extraneous factors.While the Crown Policy Manual will contain many of the factors to be considered, the list is not exhaustive, and the Crown may consider other grounds that are analogous to those contained in the Manual.Provided that the Crown acted judiciously, any claim for Charter relief must fail.The Court must show deference to the Crown in the exercise of its discretion and recognize that even if the Court disagrees with the Crown’s decision, it cannot interfere where the Crown acted judiciously.If the Court determines that the Crown failed to act judiciously, it proceeds to Step Three.STEP 3: The Court considers the issue of penalty afresh.Here, the Crown may continue to advocate for the imposition of the mandatory minimum penalty because such an outcome may nevertheless be appropriate notwithstanding the failure of the Crown to reach its sentencing position judiciously.(emphasis of original)[88]Crown counsel noted that the transparency of the process, and in turn respect for the administration of the criminal justice system, is enhanced where the prosecutor places on the record the reason(s) for the case-specific exercise of discretion to prove service of the s. 727(1) notice.Described as “addable” to the factors set out in the Ministry of Attorney General Policy is the factor of a plea of guilt – remorse, public acceptance of responsibility by an offender, and any saving of court resources will be relevant to prosecutorial exercise of discretion.[89]Mr. Doyle quite frankly conceded that the prosecutors in both the Mohla and Singh cases over-emphasized remorse and significantly under-valued the gap in the offenders’ respective prior records.Despite this reality, considering the entirety of the circumstances, proof of the s. 727(1) notice remained binding on the courts as it cannot be said that any unreasonableness in the prosecutors’ decisions rose to the level of abuse of process or amounted to arbitrary state action occasioning any s. 7 Charter breach.[90]Crown counsel submitted that in any event the trial judges erred in substituting their own conclusions as to whether proof of the notice was reasonable as opposed to asking themselves whether the prosecutorial decision was within the reasonable range of Crown discretion in the circumstances – a competent Crown acting reasonably could have concluded that proof of notice was warranted.For example, in the Singh case, Duncan J. stated at one point in his reasons, “It is my view that the exceptional exercise of discretion in this case...renders it unreasonable”.In the Mohla case, Gage J. stated at one point, “the following circumstances are, in my view, of some relevance”, and at another, “it is my judgment it is not a reasonable exercise of Crown discretion to bind the Court”.The Respondents[91]On behalf of the offenders, Mr. Snell submitted that an individual Crown prosecutor’s decision to prove pre-plea service of a s. 727(1) notice does not fall within the core elements of prosecutorial exercise of discretion as described in Krieger.Proof of service of the notice by a criminal defendant’s trial adversary, leading to material limitation upon a sentencing court’s traditional discretion to determine a fit and just sentence and in turn the threat to liberty posed by a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment, is not an integral aspect of the Attorney General’s decision-making as to “whether” a prosecution should be brought and if so for “what” the prosecution ought to be for.Nor is exercise of the s. 727(1) power within any “other discretionary decisions” forming the core elements of the Attorney General’s independent prosecutorial discretion.[92]Counsel submitted that because prosecutorial use of the s. 727(1) notice is all about the “how” of conducting a prosecution, a policy-driven tactical device, it is subject to judicial review on a standard less impervious to review by the defence than demonstration of abuse of process or gross disproportionality in the sentence imposed.[93]In noting that not every discretionary decision made by a prosecutor is within the scope of the core of protected powers of the Attorney General, of which the s. 727(1) notice is an example, Mr. Snell argued that a Crown prosecutor’s decision to inject the notice into a sentencing proceeding is judicially reviewable in appropriate cases:(1)by the inherent supervisory jurisdiction of the court at common law to control its own process to ensure fair trial proceedings(2)or in the alternative, in furtherance of ensuring that the sentencing of an offender whose liberty is at stake is not conducted arbitrarily but in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice protected by s. 7 of the Charter.[94]While acknowledging that the Ministry of Attorney General Policy relating to s. 727(1) of the Code constitutes a reasonable effort by the Attorney General to promote uniform, non-arbitrary exercise of discretion by individual prosecutors, the defence submitted that in some, not all, cases, a prosecutor’s decision to prove service of the notice warrants review by the court, for example, in circumstances of:(1)express use of the notice as a tactical device to secure a guilty plea in circumstances where a defendant who stands on his right to make full answer and defence and is convicted will be “punished” for that decision by the other party in the criminal proceeding through proof of the s. 727(1) notice – had the defendants not exercised that right, the Crown would not have removed from the court’s sentencing discretion the option of a non-custodial disposition or imprisonment less than a statutory mandatory minimum(2)a decision to prove the notice based upon an unreasonable or arbitrary deliberation process, which may involve an unreasonable application of the Ministry of Attorney General policy, thereby exposing an offender to loss of liberty in the sense that the court’s sentencing discretion is limited by the objectively unjustifiable actions of the very party in the trial who acted unfairly in deciding to trump the scope of judicial sentencing discretion through the use of the notice.[95]Relying on themes of judicial independence in the crafting of a fit sentence as well as fundamental principles informing the judicial sentencing function, such as the “gap” principle, Mr. Snell placed considerable reliance on the approach in the Gill decision and in particular on what is described as a principle of fundamental justice that the court, within boundaries constitutionally set by Parliament, not a prosecutor, decides what a fit sentence is in the individual circumstances of a particular offence and a particular offender.[96]The defence noted that provincial court trial judges in Ontario, for about a decade, have on exceptional occasions other than in an abuse of process context, reviewed a prosecutor’s exercise of discretion to prove service of the s. 727(1) notice.Some are reported cases.The Crown did not appeal this line of authority until recently.There has been no floodgates surge as a result of the exercise of such judicial review authority.Mr. Snell was in general agreement with Mr. Doyle’s “Analytical Framework” as a workable approach in cases where the defence seeks review by the court.[97]Mr. Snell noted that in the respective trial proceedings two highly experienced trial judges, who have presided over hundreds of drinking/driving offence proceedings and who have had a real opportunity to see prosecutorial exercise of discretion relating to proof of the s. 727(1) notice, immediately expressed surprise that notice would be proved in the circumstances of these trials.It was submitted that both jurists were, based on the experience of how repeat offenders were routinely treated before the court, rightfully concerned that in these cases the prosecution would, in effect, step into the judicial role within the sentencing arena of determining a fit sentence within the boundaries set by Parliament not by an individual prosecutor.[98]It was submitted that the trial judge in the Mohla case justifiably preserved the fairness of the sentencing process considering the unreasonableness of the prosecution decision to trigger the operation of s. 255(1)(a) after trial having regard to:(1)the respondent’s sole prior drinking/driving conviction was about 9 years prior to the current offence – a significant gap now conceded on appeal to be a factor improperly under-emphasized by the prosecutor who authorized proof of the notice(2)high speed was the only aggravating circumstance of the current offence and the BAC readings were conceded to be “relatively low”(3)right up to the morning of trial, the Crown expressly sought to leverage a guilty plea with the threat to prove service of the notice should the defendant choose to go to trial and be found guilty(4)the prosecution’s now-conceded over-reliance on remorse(5)prosecutorial punishment of a criminal defendant for successfully defending one charge while, with respect to the second, running an efficient defence with a justifiable Charter defence(6)Mr. Mohla had no other criminal record or outstanding charges and no provincial driving record was introduced.[99]Turning to the Singh case, it was submitted that the trial judge did not err in holding that the court was not bound by the s. 727(1) notice in circumstances of an unreasonable exercise of prosecutorial discretion considering:(1)the offender’s sole prior drinking/driving conviction was over 13 years prior to the current offence – far in excess of the 5-year policy rule – an important and individualized factor conceded on appeal to have been under-valued by the prosecutor who authorized proof of the notice(2)there were no aggravating features of the current offence such as excessive speed, personal injury or property damage(3)Mr. Singh successfully defended the refuse breath sample charge(4)the prosecution’s now conceded over-reliance on remorse(5)the offender had no other criminal record or outstanding charges and no provincial driving record was introduced.ANALYSISLegality of the Initial Phase in Singh’s Case[100]A defendant before a summary conviction trial court may appear personally or by counsel or agent on the authority of s. 800(2) of the Code.COUNSEL OR AGENT – A defendant may appear personally or by counsel or agent, but the summary conviction court may require the defendant to appear personally and may, if it thinks fit, issue a warrant in Form 7 for the arrest of the defendant and adjourn the trial to await his appearance pursuant thereto.[101]Where a defendant does not appear for his or her scheduled trial,s. 803 of the Code empowers the court with a discretion to proceed with an ex parte trial:COUNSEL OR AGENT – If a defendant who is tried alone or together with others does not appear at the time and place appointed for the trial after having been notified of that time and place, or does not appear for the resumption of a trial that has been adjourned in accordance with subsection (1), the summary conviction court(a) may proceed ex parte to hear and determine the proceedings in the absence of that defendant as if they had appeared; or(b)may, if it thinks fit, issue a warrant in Form 7 for the arrest of that defendant and adjourn the trial to await their appearance under the warrant.[102]Also in Part XXVII of the Code dealing with summary convictions iss. 795 which provides:APPLICATION OF PARTS XVI, XVII, XX AND XX.1 – The provisions of Parts XVI and XVII with respect to compelling the appearance of an accused before a justice, and the provisions of Parts XX and XX.1, in so far as they are not inconsistent with this Part, apply, with such modifications as the circumstances require, to proceedings under this Part.[103]Accordingly, incorporated by reference is s. 650 within Part XX of the Code.ACCUSED TO BE PRESENT – (1) Subject to subsections (1.1) to (2) and section 650.01, an accused, other than an organization, shall be present in court during the whole of his or her trial.(1.1)VIDEO LINKS – Where the court so orders, and where the prosecutor and the accused so agree, the accused may appear by counsel or by closed-circuit television or any other means that allow the court and the accused to engage in simultaneous visual and oral communication, for any part of the trial other than a part in which the evidence of a witness is taken.(1.2) VIDEO LINKS – Where the court so orders, an accused who is confined in prison may appear by closed-circuit television or any other means that allow the court and the accused to engage in simultaneous visual and oral communication, for any part of the trial other than a part in which the evidence of a witness is taken, if the accused is given the opportunity to communicate privately with counsel, in a case in which the accused is represented by counsel.(2) EXCEPTIONS - The court may(a) cause the accused to be removed and to be kept out of court, where he misconducts himself by interrupting the proceedings so that to continue the proceedings in his presence would not be feasible;(b) permit the accused to be out of court during the whole or any part of his trial on such conditions as the court considers proper; or(c) cause the accused to be removed and to be kept out of court during the trial of an issue as to whether the accused is unfit to stand trial, where it is satisfied that failure to do so might have an adverse effect on the mental condition of the accused.(3) TO MAKE A DEFENCE – An accused is entitled, after the close of the case for the prosecution, to make full answer and defence personally or by counsel.[104]Within a trial judge’s jurisdiction to control the process, to exercise a trial management function and to advance timely disposition of criminal proceedings, he or she is entitled to an adequate explanation as to why a scheduled case should be adjourned:R. v. Chen, [2009] O.J. No. 4589 (C.A.) (QL), at paras. 4-5. While it has been observed that “[a]nyone familiar with the operation of the courts knows that Defence counsel who says their client is ill and produces a “doctor’s note” is almost certain to get an adjournment” (R. v. Ramalheira, 2009 NLCA 4 (CanLII), at para. 25), every case must be evaluated on its own facts and balancing of relevant circumstances.[105]Confronted with the appellant’s absence on the second scheduled trial date, the experienced trial judge quite understandably sought evidentiary confirmation of the existence of the circumstances described over the phone by the appellant to his counsel only minutes before the trial was to commence.The faxed copy of the hospital discharge summary and the report by Mr. Posner, as an officer of the court, of his telephone communication with his client’s treating physician appeared to satisfy the trial court that the appellant had not sought to mislead the court.Objectively assessed, there was no reason to believe Mr. Singh was absenting himself from the proceeding in order to disrupt or delay the trial.[106]Fairly read, the trial record demonstrates that in the trial judge’s determination as to whether to adjourn the case to a third trial date or to proceed with the trial with the defendant before the court “by counsel”, he was rightly concerned with the position of the defence and the societal interests in bringing criminal cases to trial without delay.[107]A trial court entertains a broad discretion as to whether to adjourn a criminal trial: R. v. Nichols (2001), 2001 CanLII 5680 (ON CA), 46 C.R. (5th) 294 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 300 (leave to appeal refused, [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 508).The discretion to adjourn a trial requires a balancing of individual interests and factors affecting the administration of justice: Manhas v. The Queen (1980), 17 C.R. (3d) 348 (S.C.C.), at p. 348; R. v. C.(D.), [1997] O.J. No. 3568 (C.A.) (QL), at para. 12.Fair trial rights must be respected.Inconvenience to witnesses must be assessed as well in deciding whether to adjourn a trial:Nichols, at p. 300; R. v. Campbell (1999), 1999 CanLII 2688 (ON CA), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 258 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 262, R. v. Aymer, (1988), 27 O.A.C. 291 (C.A.), at p. 293; R. v. C.(D.D.) (1966), 1996 ABCA 303 (CanLII), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 323 (Alta. C.A.), at p. 330 (leave to appeal refused [1997] 1 S.C.R. vii); R. v. Bruneau, 1983 ABCA 137 (CanLII), [1983] A.J. No. 794 (C.A.) (QL), at para. 15; R. v. Griffith (1976), 33 C.R.N.S. 388 (Que. C.A.), at pp. 391-2.[108]Invoking a s. 650(2) exception to conduct a trial in an accused’s absence “may not be called in aid merely to convenience the trial judge or expedite the conduct of proceedings”:R. v. Lambie (1996), 1996 CanLII 7975 (ON SC), 28 O.R. (3d) 360 (Gen. Div.), at p. 369.While s. 650 of the Code reflects the principle of fundamental justice that an accused person be present at his or her criminal trial subject to judicial exemption, in summary conviction matters that provision must be read subject to s. 800(2) that presence or appearance may be personally, or by counsel or agent.In other words, under Part XXVII, a criminal trial may be conducted without a defendant ever attending in the absence of any judicial order to that effect.Accordingly, a judicial decision to proceed with a summary conviction trial in the defendant’s absence, but in the presence of his or her counsel, may not amount to conducting an ex parte trial within the scope of s. 803(2) of the Code as observed in R. v. Toor (2001), 2001 ABCA 88 (CanLII), 155 C.C.C. (3d) 345 (Alta. C.A.), at para. 13:There is some dispute whether the learned trial judge actually proceeded \"ex parte\". Proceedings by way of summary conviction provide for the attendance of the accused in person or by agent: s. 800(2). In this case, the applicant was represented. The learned summary conviction justice found that defence counsel had instructions from the applicant, cross-examined the Crown's witnesses and was familiar with the defence being advanced. Crown counsel submits, in those circumstances, while the court proceeded in the absence of the applicant for a portion of the trial, it did not proceed ex parte. I agree.[109]If the words in s. 803(2) “[i]f a defendant … does not appear” are to be interpreted, in light of s. 800(2), as meaning non-appearance by the defendant personally, or by counsel or agent, then Mr. Mohla’s trial was not ex parte as his counsel was before the court.[110]While it has been observed that there “[c]learly … is a risk of a miscarriage of justice inherent in an ex parte proceeding that does not exist where the defendant is present” (R. v. Jenkins, 2010 ONCA 278 (CanLII), at para. 31), that is not necessarily the case where a defendant has counsel present to conduct the trial.[111]Be that as it may, a purposive reading of ss. 800(2) and 803(2), in the context of the application of s. 650, and with particular emphasis on the statutory wording in s. 800(2), “[a] defendant may appear”, suggests that, absent some element of fault on the defendant’s part, it is his or her choice as to how the appearance will be made – if the defendant does not deliberately choose personal non-appearance then he or she has a right to be personally present for trial: R. v. McLeod (1983), 36 C.R. (3d) 378 (N.W.T.S.C.), at paras. 13-25; R. v. Leger, [1989] N.B.J. No. 1120 (Q.B.) (QL), at p. 2.[112]Insofar as the fair trial interests of the appellant, these circumstances were germane to the court’s decision-making process:(1)pursuant to s. 800(2), on the trial date, the appellant appeared before the trial court “by counsel”(2)undoubtedly, the trial judge was aware that Mr. Posner was an experienced criminal defence lawyer(3)not surprising, given the competence of counsel, was that Mr. Posner was well prepared for trial stating that he was “ready to go”, and “quite ready to cross-examine” the civilian witness(4)counsel stated that he did not want Ms. Jackson to have to come back(5)counsel did not expressly ask for a further recess to seek instructions from his client(6)defence counsel at no point expressly sought to adjourn the trial.[113]In terms of broader administration of justice concerns, the trial court was obliged to have regard to the following:(1)the case was not reached on a prior trial date(2)a further adjournment of the trial would necessitate a civilian witness returning on a third trial date to give her evidence(3)the charges in a simple, straightforward case had already been before the court for over a year.[114]In these circumstances, while this court may not have decided the matter in the same fashion, I am unable to say that Duncan J. abused his discretion, acted unreasonably or unfairly compromised Mr. Singh’s fair trial rights.[115]In the alternative, if the trial court’s decision to proceed to begin the trial without the appellant’s personal presence amounted to procedural irregularity then, pursuant to s. 686(1)(b)(iv) of the Code, the question generally becomes whether the appellant was prejudiced thereby: R. v. Cloutier (1988), 1988 CanLII 199 (ON CA), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 35 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 51-2 (leave to appeal refused, [1989] S.C.C.A. No. 194); R. v. F.E.E., 2011 ONCA 5738, at paras. 29-36; R. v. James, 2009 ONCA 366 (CanLII), at paras. 14-21.In all the circumstances, he was not considering that:(1)only the civilian witness’ evidence was heard with the remainder of the case adjourned to await Mr. Singh’s attendance(2)Mr. Posner, an experienced criminal litigator, was prepared to cross-examine Ms. Jackson and did so pressing the witness on the very matters relevant to the defence and consistent with the thrust of the appellant’s later testimony – during his questioning, counsel did not request a recess to consult with the appellant or, alert the trial judge that he had encountered difficulties in the absence of Mr. Singh on the May 30, 2008 date(3)the trial judge immediately ordered a transcript of Ms. Jackson’s evidence – the evidence was therefore available for counsel to review with his client prior to the trial resuming – on the October 9 return date, no application was made to have the witness recalled, for a stay of proceedings or for any other relief(4)no evidence of actual prejudice was adduced before the trial judge or this court on account of the manner in which the trial proceeded.I am further satisfied that it cannot be said that there was an appearance of unfairness or that the appearance of justice was compromised to such an extent as to have occasioned a miscarriage of justice.Non-compliance with s. 109 of the Courts of Justice Act[116]Although regularizing the notice and constitutional argument paperwork was briefly adverted to in each trial, no notice was given pursuant to s. 109 of the Courts of Justice Act.[117]On appeal, the parties agreed that service of a Notice of Constitutional Question was mandatory in these cases pursuant to s. 109(1).The application of s. 727(1) in the context of s. 7 of the Charter was in issue in both trials and the defendants were seeking a s. 24(1) Charter remedy respecting “an act” of the respective trial prosecutors, each representatives of the Ontario Government (see R. v.Vellone, 2011 ONCA 785 (CanLII), at paras. 2, 16-7, 25 as to the application of the s. 109(1) 2 prong of the notice provision).Failure to give notice where mandatory deprives the court of jurisdiction pursuant to s. 109(2) of the Act to grant the sought-after declaration or remedy.[118]In Eaton v. Brant County Board of Education, 1997 CanLII 366 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 241, at para. 48, the court described the purpose of s. 109:(1)within Canada’s constitutional democracy, to provide government “the fullest opportunity” to support the relevant legislation(2)to ensure that decision-making on the issue before the court is made with the benefit of a record “that is the result of thorough examination of the constitutional issues”.[119]Presumptively, government has not only a continuing interest and concern respecting in particular legislation it has enacted, its constitutional validity and application, but also is the repository of information and has the resources often best suited to assisting the courts.[120]Where s. 109 notice is properly given, it may be that one level of government declines to participate in the constitutional argument.It may choose, however, to provide relevant materials to the other responding government party to assist its argument or to provide the trial court a letter indicating that its position is in accord with that of the participating government party.It is of real assistance to the trial court to know the position of each level of government deserving of s. 109 notice.Without in any way suggesting this case is an example, what can be unhelpful is “progressive participation” – silence and non-participation before the trial court and/or summary conviction appeal court and then first in line with a record and factum before the provincial court of appeal with a position not perfectly in accord with “the government’s” position to that point and therefore one not before the pre-existing judicial decision-maker(s) in the matter.[121]Without necessity for a showing of prejudice, failure to provide the s. 109 notice bars the court from considering the relevant issue:Eaton, at para. 53; R. v. Briggs (2001), 2001 CanLII 24113 (ON CA), 55 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.), at para. 43 (leave to appeal refused, [2002] S.C.C.A. No. 31); Paluska Jr. v. Cava (2002), 2002 CanLII 41746 (ON CA), 59 O.R. (3d) 469 (C.A.), at para. 24.While there may be instances where failure to properly serve written notice may not be fatal “because the Attorney General consents to the issues being dealt with or there has been a de facto notice which is the equivalent of a written notice” (Eaton, at para. 54), that was not the case here before the summary conviction trial courts.[122]The Attorney General of Canada first received notice during these appeals, and therefore outside the time requirements of s. 109(2.2) applicable to the trial courts, when the parties jointly, through Mr. Doyle’s efforts, communicated with that level of government.However, before this court, the parties submit that an Attorney General can consent to not having received the s. 109 notice - in effect a retroactive waiver.While the court may have a discretion to permit a late notice to be given in the trial proceeding (Morine v. L. \u0026 J. Parker Equipment Inc., 2001 NSCA 53 (CanLII), at para. 46 per Cromwell J.A. (as he then was)), that was not the case here either.[123]While the matter is not entirely free of doubt, and ought not to become a practice, I am prepared to accept the parties’ submission that this court may entertain appeals of the trial decisions in light of the Attorney General of Canada’s position.The s. 727(1) Notice IssueWhat the Case is Not About[124]The threat to the life and safety of innocent Canadians posed by the drinking driver is notorious:R. v. Bernshaw (1995), 1995 CanLII 150 (SCC), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.), at pp. 204-5; R. v. Hufsky (1988), 1988 CanLII 72 (SCC), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 398 (S.C.C.), at pp. 408-410; R. v. Ramage (2010), 2010 ONCA 488 (CanLII), 257 C.C.C. (3d) 261 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 74-5; R. v. Seo (1986), 1986 CanLII 109 (ON CA), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 398-407.[125]It is apparent that the escalating punishment within s. 255(1) and s. 259(1) on account of rescidivism is to specifically deter repeat offenders and to emphasize for others the seriousness of contempt for the public safety hazard of drinking and then driving:Kumar, at p. 447; R. v. Garcia (2004), 2004 CanLII 26600 (ON SC), 20 C.R. (6th) 63 (Ont. S.C.J.), at paras. 106-114.[126]The application of s. 727(1) of the Code is not restricted to the circumstance of the graduated penalty provisions of ss. 255 and 259.There are a number of penalty schemes in the Code for which a greater punishment may be imposed by reason of a previous conviction. This would also attract operation of the s. 727(1) notice requirement requiring a court to impose at least the mandatory minimum penalty legislated for a subsequent offence (for example, ss. 85(3), 92(3), 95(2), 99(2), 100(2), 103(2), 202(2), 203, 244(2), 244.2(3), 272(2), 273(2), 279(1.1), 279.1(2), 344(1), 346(1.1)) or, in other cases of an indictable offence, would open up a higher maximum penalty available to a sentencing court, for example, s. 86(3).[127]In the trials, and again on appeal, the convicted motorists did not challenge the constitutional validity of s. 727(1) of the Code.Similarly, no challenge was taken to the mandatory minimum sentencing regime in s. 255(1) or s. 259(1).Further, no issue was taken with the relevant M.A.G. policy set out in the Ontario Crown Policy Manual as a balanced and transparent attempt to appropriately accommodate individual offenders as well as societal or public interest considerations and to promote uniformity in the exercise of discretion.Effect of s. 727(1)[128]As a “fact-finding, decision-making process of the criminal law” (R. v. Gardiner, 1982 CanLII 30 (SCC), [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368, at p. 413), sentencing is a highly individualized process.In weighing the objectives of sentencing to arrive at a just sanction, we “depend on the good judgment and wisdom of sentencing judges”: R. v. Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61, at para. 116. Recognizing that “[e]very offender [has] his or her own unique history” (R. v. McDonnell, 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at para. 61), “[j]udges enjoy a broad discretion to craft a sentence that is tailored to the nature of the offence and the circumstances of the offender”: R. v. Nasogaluak, 2010 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, at para. 43; R. v. Wust, 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455, at para. 44.[129]If the Crown does not prove, prior to the imposition of sentence, pre-plea service of the s. 727(1) notice of intention to seek a greater punishment by reason of a previous conviction, then the court has complete discretion to determine a fit and just sentence within the statutory range established by Parliament and with regard to the sentencing guidance from the appellate courts.In the instance of a recidivist drinking/driving offender, with no notice proven, a sentencing judge may take into account a prior related conviction and may impose a custodial sentence though not bound by the s. 255(1) mandatory minimum period of incarceration.[130]Where the prosecutor proves service of the notice in a drinking/driving context, the court’s sentencing discretion is curtailed in the sense that it is obliged to minimally impose a driving prohibition of a set duration and a custodial sentence at least equal to the applicable mandatory minimum period of imprisonment.In other words, it is the decision of a prosecutor which ensures not only that an offender will go to jail but also that he or she will serve the relevant statutory minimum period of imprisonment.[131]Crown counsel are not obliged by statute or Ministry policy to explain the reason(s) for the decision to prove the s. 727(1) notice in a particular case.Of course, an in-court statement on the record when the notice is proved tends to enhance the transparency of the process.Examination of the facts of the case and the offender’s history in the context of the Ministry’s published policy will ordinarily make apparent to the defence the rationale for a prosecutor’s exercise of discretion.Informally, Crown and defence counsel may discuss the notice issue and it is frequently addressed in the context of resolution discussions in and out of the judicial pre-trial context.[132]In theory, though it has not been the practice, service of a s. 727(1) notice could be proven by the Crown in the case of every recidivist drinking/driver offender without regard to the gap or remoteness of the prior relevant conviction.Only recently, in respect of certain crimes, has Parliament specifically implemented a 10-year gap principle in certain rescidivist sentencing regimes, i.e., ss. 273(3), 279.1(2.1), 344(2), 346(1.2).Pursuant to s. 4 of the Criminal Records Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-47, an offender may apply for a pardon 3 years after the expiry of a drinking/driving sentence punishable on summary conviction or 5 years after the sentence where the matter was prosecuted by indictment.[133]In R. v. Wust, 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455, at para. 18, the court stated:Mandatory minimum sentences are not the norm in this country, and they depart from the general principles of sentencing expressed in the Code, in the case law, and in the literature on sentencing. In particular, they often detract from what Parliament has expressed as the fundamental principle of sentencing in s. 718.1 of the Code: the principle of proportionality.“[I]t is important to interpret legislation which deals, directly or indirectly, with mandatory minimum sentences, in a manner that is consistent with general principles of sentencing, and that does not offend the integrity of the criminal justice system”: Wust, at para. 22.[134]While mandatory minimum sentences have become increasingly more common, the decision to enact criminal law policy in this way is constitutionally assigned to Parliament.These type of sentences constitute the law of Canada and agreement or disagreement with the wisdom of such legislation is not a justiciable matter.The issue, where challenged, is whether the provisions are Charter-compliant.As observed by Sopinka J. in R. v. Rodriguez, 1993 CanLII 75 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519, at para. 173, “The principles of fundamental justice cannot be created for the occasion to reflect the court’s dislike or distaste of a particular statute”.[135]“[A] correct balance must be struck between the judiciary and the other branches of government.Each branch must respect the limits of its institutional role”: Chaoulli v. Quebec, 2005 SCC 35 (CanLII), [2005] 1 S.C.R. 791, at para. 184 (per Binnie and LeBel JJ. dissenting in the result).[136]In the cases of Mr. Mohla and Mr. Singh, the effect of proof of the pre-plea service of the notice upon each of them required the respective sentencing judges to impose at least 14 days’ incarceration.Purpose of s. 727(1)[137]The predecessor history to what is today s. 727(1) of the Code, much of which was reviewed in R. v. Kumar (1994), 1993 CanLII 1445 (BC CA), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 417 (B.C.C.A.) (leave to appeal refused, [1994] 2 S.C.R. vii), at pp. 424 - 428 per Lambert J.A. (dissenting in the result), may be summarized as follows:(1)the provision can be traced to s. 494 of the English Draft Code (1879) and to s. 665 of the Criminal Procedure Act, S.C. 1886, c. 174, ss. 139, 207(2)there were no drinking/driving offences in 1886 – not until 1921 with the addition of s. 285C to the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1906, c. 146 was there a crime of driving while intoxicated with a graduated sentencing scheme based upon prior similar convictions(3)various incarnations of the notice provision, ss. 628 and 676 in the 1892 Code 55-56 VIC. C. 29, s. 963 in the 1906 and 1927 Codes, s. 572 in 1953-54 c. 51, s. 592 in R.S.C. 1970 c. C-34, s. 665 in R.S.C. 1985 c. 27 (1st Supp.) s. 135, and then s. 727 in S.C. 1995 c. 22 s. 6 (as amended 2003, c. 21, s. 16), have changed location in the Code over time from Part XVII Procedure By Indictment to Part XX Procedure In Jury Trials to its present position, Part XXIII Sentencing(4)the crime of driving with ability to do so was impaired by alcohol was added by S.C. 1951, c. 47 to the Code with mandatory minimum sentences – a penalty scheme however less severe than the driving while intoxicated sentencing regime(5)notice was routinely given by alleging the previous conviction in the information or indictment itself (R. v. Mah Chee (1939), 71 C.C.C. 63 (B.C.C.A.), at pp. 65-70) until a progression of Code amendments from 1906 onward, including 1943-44, c. 23, and later the enactment of s. 571 in the 1955 Code (“No indictment in respect of an offence for which, by reason of previous convictions, a greater punishment may be imposed shall contain any reference to previous convictions”) (see also R. v. Smith (1921), 38 C.C.C. 21 (Ont.C.A.), at p. 31 per Lennox J.A. (dissenting in the result),“the chance of prejudice to the accused by a premature disclosure of the previous conviction, is carefully guarded against in these sections”).[138]Accordingly, the history of notice in a charging document such as an indictment of the Crown’s intention to seek a greater penalty on account of a previous conviction of the same character, with proof of identity of the person charged as being a person subject to greater punishment to be determined by the trier of fact, effectively ended in 1955 for all cases.[139]Over time, while the timing and mechanism of notice has changed, it has been up to the prosecution to put in play the request to prove the existence of a prior conviction which would found greater punishment in the sentencing for an offender’s current conviction.On occasion, the prosecution would forgo seeking greater punishment on account of a relevant prior conviction.While an accused could of course seek to resist proof that he or she had been so previously convicted, where the Crown did discharge its proof, then the sentencing court was obliged to sentence the offender as a recidivist within any mandatory sentencing regime.Jurisprudence to Date[140]In the Kumar case, the defendant was to be sentenced for refusing to provide a breath sample.The prosecution proved pre-plea service of the notice relating to Kumar’s conviction 4 years and 9 months earlier for over .80 care or control.With the court required to impose a 14-day mandatory minimum sentence, the defence sought a declaration that the notice provision combined with the mandatory minimum as a recidivist offender breached ss. 7 and 12 of the Charter.Taylor J.A., speaking for the majority at pp. 448, 450-1, concluded as to the s. 12 argument:The lack of such a time-limit in s. 255(1)(a) seems to me important.It is, of course, recognized in the sentencing process that the significance of a previous conviction, especially if it is the sole previous conviction, reduces with the passage of time.There comes a point at which, in the case of all but the most serious of offences, a sole conviction registered many years ago no longer has any significance at all.The discretion given to the Crown under the sections here in issue to invoke a past conviction whose significance for sentencing purposes may be long spent, in order to oblige the court to impose a sentence of imprisonment in respect of a minor subsequent offence, introduces an element of arbitrariness into the process which has, in my view, to be considered to some extent under s. 12, and is obviously relevant under s. 7.…If a prosecutor were in such cases to invoke a previous conviction--particularly one which should be regarded as 'stale' or 'spent' by effluxion of time and intervening good conduct--the resulting mandatory 14-days imprisonment would be \"grossly disproportionate\". Such a punishment in such a case would not relate to the second offence at all, but be more in the nature of a second penalty for the first. Application of the minimum sentence in the remorseless manner which has to be presumed for the present purpose--that is to say without proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion--would result in some convicted persons receiving a sentence sufficiently disproportionate to the circumstances of the case as to violate Section 12.The lack of any limit on the time which may pass between a first and second offence seems at first glance to be the most serious problem, and possibly to represent a fundamental flaw in the scheme. But I am not satisfied that this is so. It seems to me that effluxion of time between convictions is not the sole factor relevant to deciding when a prior conviction has become 'spent' for sentencing purposes. For this purpose effluxion of time must generally be accompanied also by intervening good conduct, and this is something which can, of course, properly be assessed only in relation to the particular offender.I am not persuaded that there is a likelihood of grossly disproportionate punishment resulting 'commonly' under this mandatory minimum sentencing scheme, so as to warrant a finding that the scheme itself breaches Section 12, but I am persuaded that there is ample justification for the application of 'constitutional exemption' in those particular, perhaps very unusual, cases in which a breach of Section 12 could be shown on application of the 'first aspect' test in Goltz.[141]As to the alleged s. 7 Charter breach, the court stated at pp. 451-2:I believe the problem which arises in this case, so far as the Section 7 challenge is concerned, to be quite different from that which arose under Section 7 in either Smith or Konechny, and I do not believe the issue before us to be decided by anything said in those cases in this court or the Supreme Court of Canada. I agree with Mr. Dorchester's contention that prosecutorial discretion is properly exercised in deciding who shall be charged, and with what, and whether by indictment or summarily--a distinction of importance with respect to the maximum penalty to which the accused will be liable--and in matters relevant to the conduct of the Crown case, but not in deciding the outcome, including the decision whether a convicted person shall be imprisoned rather than submitted to a non-custodial penalty which the court would otherwise impose. It seems to me that the loss of liberty involved when a minimum penalty is invoked in this way is not brought about \"in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice\", and must contravene Section 7. It seems possible also that a violation of the Section 9 guarantee against \"arbitrary\" imprisonment is involved, but that is not before us.It was not contended by counsel for the Crown that invoking the minimum punishment in these cases should be regarded as anything other than an exercise of prosecutorial discretion. The position of the Crown is that such discretion is in the circumstances unobjectionable, so long as it cannot be shown to have been exercised in \"bad faith\". But it seems to me that a mandatory sentence subject to prosecutorial discretion is not in fact a \"minimum\" sentence at all, because it is entirely possible for a lesser sentence to be imposed. The mandatory sentence applies only if the prosecutor chooses that it shall. As I have said, when the result is to deprive a convicted person of liberty, and this would not otherwise have happened, the loss of liberty must be said to have been brought about otherwise than \"in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice\", and the fact that the prosecutor acted in good faith could not suffice to render the procedure acceptable under Section 7.Thus the mandatory minimum sentence provision must be said to breach the Section 7 guarantee against deprivation of liberty contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.[142]The court concluded at pp. 452-3 that the statutory regime was not unconstitutional:Applying the test to the present circumstances, it seems to me obvious that the objective of the impeached scheme is one of great public importance, that is to say protecting persons who use the roads from injury and death at the hands of those who repeatedly drive while their ability to do so is impaired by alcohol. The decisive question under Section 1, then, is whether the scheme can be said to impose the minimum restriction on Section 7 rights reasonably required for this purpose. It is in this connection that the discussion of 'constitutional exemption' as an available Section 12 option becomes relevant. So long as individual examination for \"gross disproportionality\" is available in those cases in which a Section 12 violation might occur in applying the mandatory minimum sentence, it seems to me that the consequences of the breach of Section 7 are significantly confined. The result is that the minimum sentence becomes the \"normal\" minimum, but is not applicable in those rare cases where, as a consequence of failure in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, it would result in a penalty being imposed which is grossly disproportionate to the circumstances of the case.Once the potential for manifest injustice is thus removed, Parliament's intention that deterrence have an emphatic place in the sentencing of second and subsequent 'drinking-driving' offenders would be given effect to the extent that a sentence of imprisonment might be imposed which a court would not normally think appropriate, or \"fit\", so long as the sentence was not \"grossly disproportionate\" in the circumstances.To allow the court any wider authority to depart from the minimum sentence in individual cases would, in my view, defeat this legislative intent, one which has, of course, been approved in Goltz.In the B.C. Motor Vehicle Act reference Mr. Justice Lamer (as he then was) found that \"imprisonment of a few innocent\", in breach of the Section 7 guarantee, could not be justified under Section 1 for the purpose of accomplishing whatever might be accomplished in the cause of ridding the roads of bad drivers. An amendment which would have created the absolute-liability offence of driving while prohibited, with or without knowledge of the prohibition, was thus found not to be redeemed by Section 1, and held constitutionally invalid, so that to be convicted a driver must be shown to have been aware of the prohibition order.In the present case we are dealing with a statutory scheme designed to discourage a more dangerous practice, and aimed at deterring repeat offenders. It could not result in any \"morally innocent\" person being imprisoned. If convicted persons could properly be so classified they would, of course, be entitled to exemption under Section 12. Only for those for whom the minimum penalty would be excessive according to the principles of sentencing without being \"grossly disproportionate\" would there be any detriment resulting from the Section 7 breach. It must, moreover, be borne in mind that prosecutorial discretion plays a large role in the criminal process, and this must be regarded as representing a relatively minor instance of its exercise. Because the Crown has absolute discretion to decide whether or not a person shall be charged at all and, if charged, with what offence, and to decide whether the procedure adopted shall be summary or by indictment, and thereafter to enter a stay of proceedings, before or after the trial has started, it follows that there can never be any legally-enforceable assurance that persons who have committed similar offences will always suffer the same consequences. While the courts strive to ensure that no one is unlawfully or unfairly treated in regard to the facts of the case and their particular circumstances, equality of treatment in the prosecution of those who have committed criminal offences is a matter entrusted in large part to the law officers of the Crown.[143]Lambert J.A., dissenting in part, observed at pp. 428-431:It is true that there is plenty of scope for prosecutorial discretion in relation to drinking-driving offences. The prosecution can decide whether to lay charges or not. The prosecution can decide whether to proceed by summary conviction proceedings or by indictment. The prosecution can stay the proceedings at any time before judgment is rendered. But those are traditional prosecutorial functions, controlled through the public accountability of the law officers of the Crown. On the other hand deciding whether to remove a sentencing discretion from a trial judge is not a traditional prosecutorial function, and deciding whether to impose a sentence less than an established minimum, which is what the prosecution does by deciding not to give the notice, is surely a judicial function.The injection of a prosecutorial discretion into the judicial sentencing function must give rise, in my view, to concern about the possibility of abuse of the discretion. In most ordinary cases of plea bargaining the prosecution agrees not to seek a higher sentence than the offender agrees to accept. But the sentencing judge retains all his powers of ensuring that the sentence is a fit one and that it complies with the application of the appropriate sentencing principles to the circumstances of the offence and the offender. However, the situation is different under s. 255 and s. 665. The prosecution has an absolute power, by giving or withholding the notice, to decide whether the minimum sentence must be imposed. If the accused pleads guilty the notice need not be served and the judge may impose a fit sentence. If the accused pleads not guilty then the prosecution may serve the notice and if the accused is convicted he must be sentenced to the minimum sentence at least, whether that sentence is fit or not. The possibility of the prosecution compelling inappropriate and unjust guilty pleas becomes a matter for concern.In my opinion the combined effect of s. 255 and s. 665 of the Code is contrary to s. 7 of the Charter which reads:7.Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security-of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.In this case the trial judge was prevented from considering the fitness and merits of a sentence of less than fourteen days which he regarded himself as being bound to impose on Mr. Kumar. In those circumstances, Mr. Kumar himself may well have been deprived of his liberty otherwise than in accordance with fundamental justice....It was suggested by the Crown in argument that if it was alleged that the prosecution's decision to give the notice was made in bad faith then an inquiry could be made into that allegation during the sentencing hearing. But soon such an inquiry would be required in almost every case. Comparisons would be made with cases where the notice was not given. Such a process is not likely to add any lustre to the reputation of the administration of justice....No matter which of those objectives is examined, the objective itself is demonstrably justified. The problem in this case relates to one key aspect of the means by which the objective is to be attained. That key aspect is, of course, the giving of a significant measure of control over the sentencing function to the prosecution instead of allowing it to remain with the sentencing judge; in essence, allowing the prosecution to override the sentencing judge on a sentencing matter.In my opinion that aspect of the means of attaining the policy objective is arbitrary and unfair. It raises concerns about the potentiality for abuse. And it is based on a concern about the giving of notice that a higher punishment will be sought which is, in its origin and development, unconnected to the policy objective and which, in relation to the policy objective, must be seen as resting on an irrational consideration.The irrational consideration that I have in mind is this: if a previous conviction can be taken into account whether the notice is served or not, as it can, and if a higher sentence can be imposed by reason of the previous conviction, as it can, the only effect of the notice is to take away the right of the sentencing judge to impose a fit sentence below the minimum, perhaps in circumstances where such a sentence is the only fit sentence. I do not regard that effect as being rationally connected to the policy objective.In my opinion, the violation of s. 7 of the Charter, either in its application to Mr. Kumar or in its application in reasonable hypothetical circumstances, because of the bowers given to the prosecution to grant or take away the discretion of the sentencing judge to impose a sentence less than fourteen days for a second offence or ninety days for a third or subsequent offence, in circumstances where such a lesser sentence is the only fit sentence, is not demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.I repeat, I express no conclusion in this appeal about the constitutionality of minimum sentences for repeat offenders in drinking-driving cases. My decision is confined in this appeal to the violation to the right to liberty through the exercise of a power given to the prosecution to prevent the imposition of a fit sentence by the giving of notice under s. 665.XIn my opinion a s. 12 analysis leading to the conclusion that whenever the sentence that results from the application of the combination of s. 255 and s. 655 is a sentence that is grossly disproportionate there will be a constitutional exemption from those provisions to prevent such a sentence, does nothing to ameliorate the situation where a person's Charter rights under s. 7 are violated through that person being deprived of liberty by the imposition of an unfit sentence. It is not likely to be any comfort to a person who is sentenced to an unfit sentence because of a prosecutorial discretion to know that though the sentence is entirely unfit, having regard to the circumstances of the offender and the circumstances of the offence, it is not so entirely unfit as to be grossly disproportionate under s. 12.So the possibility of a constitutional exemption under s. 12 does not affect my views on s. 7 and s. 1.(emphasis of original)[144]Perhaps the earliest judicial review of a prosecutor’s proof of pre-plea service of the s. 727(1) notice in Ontario was in R. v. Cordero, [2001] O.J. No. 2901 (Ct. J.) (QL), Feldman J. was required to sentence a defendant convicted of over .80 after a trial.The Crown proved the notice.The BAC readings were 100 and 110 mg. alcohol/100 ml. blood.Cordero had a conviction for the same offence in 1988.The court held that where a prosecutor’s exercise of discretion to prove the notice could be characterized as “arbitrary” as for example where the provincial ministry 5-year guideline was far exceeded in terms of the antiquity of the prior conviction in effect violating the “gap principle” in sentencing, and in turn resulting in an unfair and excessive sentence, that principles of fundamental justice within s. 7 Charter would be violated.In such circumstances, an offender should be granted a constitutional exemption from the application of the notice and the application of the mandatory minimum penalty.The decision was affirmed on appeal ([2003] O.J. No. 6246 (S.C.J.)) without the constitutional exemption issue being addressed.[145]In R. v. Sanghera (2002), 22 M.V.R. (4th) 155 (Ont. Ct. J.), the court was required to sentence the defendant, a taxi cab driver, following his guilty plea to impaired care or control of his vehicle.In 1988, Sanghera had been convicted of impaired operation and refuse breath sample.The prosecution proved pre-plea service of the s. 727(1) notice.The court considered, as a constitutional precept, that “the Crown’s discretion not be exercised in an arbitrary or capricious manner” and that exercise of prosecutors’ discretion ought not to be exercised without regard to relevant factors or “upon irrelevant considerations or place undue weight on one factor” likely to result in manifestly unfair and inconsistent sentences.The court held that it had an oversight role to play in instances of “unprincipled or arbitrary exercises of discretion, resulting in unacceptably unfair sentences”.In light of findings that in the circumstances of the case the gap principle had been largely ignored by the prosecutor, through what amounted to an “arbitrary” exercise of discretion, the court declined to give effect to the notice, in effect a constitutional exemption, in order to avoid “an unnecessarily and disproportionately harsh result”.[146]In a summary conviction appeal, R. v. Garcia (2004), 2004 CanLII 26600 (ON SC), 20 C.R. (6th) 63 (Ont. S.C.J.), at para. 167, in an obiter observation, I stated that I “would not foreclose the possibility of s. 7 Charter review, for example, where the Crown sought to use a very dated prior drinking/driving conviction to invoke a mandatory minimum penalty”.[147]In R. v. Miller (2005), 30 M.V.R. (5th) 68 (Ont. Ct. J.), an accused was convicted of impaired care or control.The defendant’s last prior drinking/driving conviction was in 1992.In the wake of the prosecution proving the s. 727(1) notice, the defendant asserted that his s. 7 Charter right was breached thereby as imposition of the mandatory minimum sentencing regime as a recidivist offender would effect a grossly disproportionate punishment.While the challenge failed on the aggravating facts of the case, the court did state that if the Crown sought to invoke the increased penalty provisions in a capricious or malicious way in the instance of a single, extremely dated drinking/driving conviction that there “could well be a successful s. 7 challenge”.[148]The parties accepted that in not all cases of a court declining to be bound by the effect of a properly proved s. 727(1) notice have the reasons for judgment been transcribed.In some of the reported cases, there are references to unreported cases.There are pending summary conviction appeals in Ontario raising the issue.There were no statistics before this court as to the particulars/frequency of “over 5 years” proof of the s. 727(1) notice. That said, the small number of cases in which the issue has arisen is undoubtedly a reflection of responsible exercise of discretion by Crown prosecutors.[149]In R. v. Sever (2006), 34 M.V.R. (5th) 87 (Ont.Ct.J.) the court held that the effect of the notice would be to require the court to impose an unfair, disproportionately harsh sentence in breach of the offender’s s. 12 Charter right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment.A similar conclusion was reached in R. v. Luc (2007), 67 M.V.R. (5th) 95 (Ont. C.J.).In Re King and the Queen (2007), 221 C.C.C. (3d) (Ont. Ct. J.), at pp. 95-96, the court stated:If the judge is satisfied that the notice has been served for reasons which exclude any prosecutorial misbehaviour or irrelevant consideration and take into account all relevant factors including those which are specific to aboriginal persons, then the notice and the minimum sentence can operate in accordance with fundamental justice.There will be no transfer of the Court’s responsibility to determine sentence to the prosecutor....Therefore, as a remedy for the s. 7 violation under s. 24(1) of the Charter, I find that until the prosecutor sets out the reasons for serving the notice for the Court to review, the case should proceed as if no notice had been served.[150]In R. v. Gill (2006), 2008 ONCJ 502 (CanLII), 238 C.C.C. (3d) 465 (Ont. Ct. J.), at p. 476, in the context of a s. 7 Charter challenge to proof of service of the s. 727(1) notice in a case with about a 17-year gap, the court stated:It is the role of Parliament to set the range of allowable sentences for particular offences. It is the role of the sentencing judge to hear submissions and determine a fit sentence. It is a principle of fundamental justice that Parliament or a Judge decide what a fit sentence will be, not the prosecutor. It is a principle of fundamental justice that Parliament is supreme and the judiciary is independent both of which co-exist but both of which are significantly undermined where the prosecutor in a particular case is empowered to make a decision which has the effect of suspending the operation of the laws of Parliament and also undermines judicial independence by filing notice. To be able to do so without stating any reason for so doing and which is not subject to review except in the most egregious circumstances would be contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.It is useful to compare the effect of a hearing in relation to a decision to file notice with a decision in relation to a core prosecutorial function such as a decision to proceed with a prosecution. Short of an abuse of process, Crown counsel should not be expected to state why it is pursuing a prosecution. The evidence will reveal whether an offence has or has not been made out. The decision to file notice and thereby require a minimum sentence, when an issue arises, as it does here, can only be addressed by hearing the reasons for such a decision. There would be no other forum to assess the validity of such a decision. Where the issue is raised, Crown counsel can be asked why it filed the notice and the reasons can be assessed, not for correctness, but for reasonableness. Asking counsel to justify their positions on sentencing is customary work of the Court.The Court's ability to conduct a limited review of that decision where the issue is raised permits the discretionary power of the Crown in the sentencing regime to co-exist harmoniously with the principles of fundamental justice.I agree with the reasons of in R. v. Kumar and in R. v. King which find that the decision to file notice is not a core prosecutorial function. In fact, the determination of a fit sentence can more properly be viewed as core functions of the Court, or Parliament.To conclude, the decision of the prosecutor to file notice is not a core prosecutorial function. As a result, where the propriety of the filing of the notice is a live issue, it is subject to review by the Court.[151]The decision was upheld on appeal ((2011), 2011 ONSC 1145 (CanLII), 273 C.C.C. (3d) 308 (Ont.S.C.J.) (on appeal to the Ont.C.A. for argument on March 15, 2012)).Kiteley J. held, at paras. 33, 44-8 that the decision to prove the s. 727(1) notice is not an element of core prosecutorial discretion:Krieger left the door open for the possibility of recognizing additional core prosecutorial discretions, with the only restriction being that they are decisions regarding the nature and extent of the prosecution. However, in Krieger, there is no mention of any core prosecutorial discretion which might exist in the sentencing phase of the prosecution....I turn to the application of those principles to this appeal. While it must be served before plea, the Notice of Intent to Seek Increased Penalty is an aspect of the sentencing phase of the trial, after the offender has been convicted. There is no longer a question of initiation, continuation or termination of the prosecution. Rather the decision to file the Notice could be characterized as tactical.The Trial Judge is required to exercise his or her discretion to impose a sentence taking into account the broad sentencing principles articulated in ss. 718, 718.1, 718.2 and 718.3 bearing in mind the unique circumstances of the offence and of the offender. Allowing the Crown to exercise unreviewable discretion to file a Notice is causing a \"clash of discretions.\" By reducing the sentencing options normally available to the sentencing judge, the Crown is effectively using its discretion to limit the trial judge's discretion in sentencing an offender pursuant to fundamental principles and pursuant to s. 718.3 of the Code. For example, if a sentencing judge feels compelled to prioritize rehabilitation based on the circumstances of the offender, he or she would be precluded from doing so based on the circumstances of the offence, and instead would be forced - by the exercise of discretion by the Crown - to impose a sentence promoting both specific and general deterrence and ignoring rehabilitation.As the Supreme Court held, the list of examples of the exercise of core prosecutorial discretion is not exhaustive. But additions to the list must be in the context identified by the Supreme Court, namely \"those powers that constitute the core of the Attorney General's office and which are protected from the influence of improper political and other vitiating factors by the principle of independence\". It cannot be said that the decision to file a Notice of Intention to Seek an Increased Penalty needs to be protected from improper political influence or that the office of the Attorney General is any less independent if the decision is subject to review.The Crown has the discretion to prosecute criminals to the full extent of the law, an aspect of which involves making sentencing submissions. That discretion has to be viewed in the context of the very wide discretion to be exercised by sentencing judges. Furthermore, the Crown Policy Manual articulates the basis upon which Crowns should exercise discretion to seek an increased penalty when the offence is more than five years old. The policy is not challenged. Rather, it is the application of that policy that is reviewable.In my view, the decision to file a Notice of Intention to Seek an Increased Penalty is not an aspect of core prosecutorial discretion. I am not persuaded that Borenstein J. erred in principle in arriving at that conclusion.(footnotes omitted)(emphasis of original)[152]The court agreed with the trial judge that the prosecutor’s s. 727 decision was judicially reviewable, within the s. 7 Charter context, on a standard of reasonableness stating at paras. 59, 65, 70:The Crown relied on Haneveld, [(2008), 78 M.V.R. (5th) 305 (Alta. P.C.)(aff’d on a different basis, 2009 ABCA 249 (CanLII))] in support of the proposition that any litigant seeking judicial review should be required to have appropriately investigated the election to seek greater punishment and be prepared to lead admissible evidence to demonstrate any alleged deficiency in its exercise.As in Haneveld, the Crown argued that judicial review should only be undertaken when the applicant has satisfied the Court that there is a “reasonable likelihood of establishing the violation of a constitutionally protected right”.In other words, the burden is on the accused to demonstrate entitlement to relief.......the defence to demonstrate a Charter breach based on an allegedly unreasonable exercise of discretion......Crown and defence counsel agree that in an application pursuant to the Charter, the burden is on the applicant to satisfy the court that the applicant is entitled to a remedy.In this case, the burden was on the offender to prove on a balance of probabilities that the exercise of discretion by the Crown was not reasonable.I do not agree that Borenstien J. reversed the burden of proof.He was simply stating the obvious, namely that a decision based solely on four prior very dated convictions did not constitute a reasonable exercise of discretion.[153]In R. v. Whiteman, 2008 ONCJ 658, the court declined the defence challenge that the court not be bound by the s. 727(1) notice holding that for Crown discretion to be in breach of s. 7 of the Charter “there must be evidence of bad faith on the part of the Crown” and that, on the facts of the case, not only was the prosecutor’s decision not capricious or arbitrary but also the court was not required by the notice to impose a grossly disproportionate sentence.[154]In R. v. Bolender, 2010 ONCJ 622 (CanLII), [2010] O.J. No. 5711 (Ct. J.)(QL), at paras. 12-17, the court held the decision to prove the s. 727(1) notice to be a core exercise of prosecutorial discretion, with the notice being set aside only in circumstances where the Crown exercised its discretion “arbitrarily, capriciously or for some improper motive”.To the same effect is the conclusion of the trial judge in the Haneveld case at para. 40 that the decision is within the core elements of prosecutorial discretion reviewable for “improper or arbitrary reasons”.In R. v. Smith, 2010 ONCJ 352 (CanLII), in the context of a s. 7 Charter challenge to the notice, the court considered that the evidentiary record did not support an abuse of process.[155]The jurisprudential landscape ranges across s. 7 and s. 12 Charter analyses, consideration or not of core prosecutorial discretion, the use of constitutional exemptions (unavailable after R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96), and review for abuse of process, gross disproportionality, unreasonableness or s. 7 arbitrariness.727 Notice – Core Prosecutorial Discretion?[156]The exercise of prosecutorial discretion is essential to the operation of the criminal justice system:R. v. Power, 1994 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at pp. 620-1; Proulx v. Quebec, 2001 SCC 66 (CanLII), [2001] 3 S.C.R. 9, at para. 4; Nelles v. Ontario, 1989 CanLII 77 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 170, at paras. 39-40.Where a discretionary decision falls within the “core elements of prosecutorial discretion”, the scope for judicial review is highly constrained as described in the Krieger case, at paras. 29, 32, 42-7:The gravity of the power to bring, manage and terminate prosecutions which lies at the heart of the Attorney General's role has given rise to an expectation that he or she will be in this respect fully independent from the political pressures of the government....The court's acknowledgment of the Attorney General's independence from judicial review in the sphere of prosecutorial discretion has its strongest source in the fundamental principle of the rule of law under our Constitution. Subject to the abuse of process doctrine, supervising one litigant's decision-making process -- rather than the conduct of litigants before the court -- is beyond the legitimate reach of the court. In Re Hoem and Law Society of British Columbia (1985), 1985 CanLII 447 (BC CA), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 239 (B.C.C.A.), Esson J.A. for the court observed, at p. 254, that:The independence of the Attorney-General, in deciding fairly who should be prosecuted, is also a hallmark of a free society. Just as the independence of the bar within its proper sphere must be respected, so must the independence of the Attorney-General.We agree with these comments. The quasi-judicial function of the Attorney General cannot be subjected to interference from parties who are not as competent to consider the various factors involved in making a decision to prosecute. To subject such decisions to political interference, or to judicial supervision, could erode the integrity of our system of prosecution. Clearly drawn constitutional lines are necessary in areas subject to such grave potential conflict.In making independent decisions on prosecutions, the Attorney General and his agents exercise what is known as prosecutorial discretion. This discretion is generally exercised directly by agents, the Crown attorneys, as it is uncommon for a single prosecution to attract the Attorney General's personal attention.\"Prosecutorial discretion\" is a term of art. It does not simply refer to any discretionary decision made by a Crown prosecutor. Prosecutorial discretion refers to the use of those powers that constitute the core of the Attorney General's office and which are protected from the influence of improper political and other vitiating factors by the principle of independence.L'Heureux-Dubé J., in quoting David Vanek's work, \"Prosecutorial Discretion\" (1987-88), 30 Crim. L.Q. 219, at p. 219, said that \"[p]rosecutorial discretion refers to the discretion exercised by the Attorney-General in matters within his authority in relation to the prosecution of criminal offences\" (Power, supra, at p. 622).As discussed above, these powers emanate from the office holder's role as legal advisor of and officer to the Crown. In our theory of government, it is the sovereign who holds the power to prosecute his or her subjects. A decision of the Attorney General, or of his or her agents, within the authority delegated to him or her by the sovereign is not subject to interference by other arms of government. An exercise of prosecutorial discretion will, therefore, be treated with deference by the courts and by other members of the executive, as well as statutory bodies like provincial law societies.Without being exhaustive, we believe the core elements of prosecutorial discretion encompass the following: (a) the discretion whether to bring the prosecution of a charge laid by police; (b) the discretion to enter a stay of proceedings in either a private or public prosecution, as codified in the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, ss. 579 and 579.1; (c) the discretion to accept a guilty plea to a lesser charge; (d) the discretion to withdraw from criminal proceedings altogether: R. v. Osborne (1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 405 (N.B.C.A.); and (e) the discretion to take control of a private prosecution: R. v. Osiowy (1989), 1989 CanLII 4780 (SK CA), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 189 (Sask. C.A.). While there are other discretionary decisions, these are the core of the delegated sovereign authority peculiar to the office of the Attorney General.Significantly, what is common to the various elements of prosecutorial discretion is that they involve the ultimate decisions as to whether a prosecution should be brought, continued or ceased, and what the prosecution ought to be for. Put differently, prosecutorial discretion refers to decisions regarding the nature and extent of the prosecution and the Attorney General's participation in it. Decisions that do not go to the nature and extent of the prosecution, i.e., the decisions that govern a Crown prosecutor's tactics or conduct before the court, do not fall within the scope of prosecutorial discretion. Rather, such decisions are governed by the inherent jurisdiction of the court to control its own processes once the Attorney General has elected to enter into that forum.(emphasis added)[157]It would seem that if the particular conduct or decision of the prosecutor falls outside of the core elements of prosecutorial discretion that, apart from the court’s jurisdiction to supervise within its inherent jurisdiction to control its own process, the court has authority to entertain a s. 7 Charter argument relating to a breach of fundamental justice impacting upon an accused’s fair trial rights, for example, unreasonably withholding disclosure.[158]In R. v. Nixon, 2011 SCC 34 (CanLII), [2011] 2 S.C.R. 566, the court again returned to the distinction between “constitutionally protected, core discretionary powers” reviewable only for abuse of process, and, tactical decisions “subject to broader review” (para. 22).At issue in the case was a repudiated plea bargain.At paras. 30, 52 and 68, the court stated:In my view, the question of whether the ADM's decision to repudiate the plea agreement is an act of prosecutorial discretion, although disputed in this appeal, is just as easily resolved. As aptly put by Paperny J.A., in determining whether any impugned decision falls within the core of prosecutorial discretion, it is useful to ask: \"... is it a decision as to whether a prosecution should be brought, continued or ceased, and if so, what it should be for?\" (para. 32). Applying this test, she held that the ADM's decision to repudiate the plea agreement \"fell squarely within the core elements of prosecutorial discretion\" (para. 33). I agree. In my respectful view, it is difficult to see how the ADM's decision could otherwise be characterized. The ADM effectively decided that the prosecution against Ms. Nixon should be continued and that it should be for the Criminal Code offences of dangerous driving, not for the traffic infraction of careless driving. Clearly, the ADM's decision to repudiate the plea agreement also constitutes an act of prosecutorial discretion. Prosecutorial discretion was not spent with the decision to initiate the proceedings, nor did it terminate with the plea agreement. So long as the proceedings are ongoing, the Crown may be required to make further decisions about whether the prosecution should be continued and, if so, in respect of what charges....The selected framework of analysis also occasioned a more fundamental error. The application judge's assessment of a decision made in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion for \"reasonableness\" runs contrary to the principles set out in Krieger. Paperny J.A. reiterated these principles, and explained that it is not the role of the court to look behind a prosecutor's discretionary decision to see if it is justified or reasonable in itself (paras. 46-49). By straying into the arena and second-guessing the decision, the reviewing court effectively becomes a supervising prosecutor and risks losing its independence and impartiality. Due regard to the constitutionally separate role of the Attorney General in the initiation and pursuit of criminal prosecutions puts such decisions \"beyond the legitimate reach of the court\" (Krieger, at para. 32). Thus, the court does not assess the reasonableness or correctness of the decision itself; it only looks behind the decision for \"proof of the requisite prosecutorial misconduct, improper motive or bad faith in the approach, circumstances or ultimate decision to repudiate\" (Court of Appeal decision, at para. 49)....As discussed earlier, the ADM's decision to resile from the plea agreement falls within the scope of prosecutorial discretion. In the absence of any prosecutorial misconduct, improper motive or bad faith in the approach, circumstances, or ultimate decision to repudiate, the decision to proceed with the prosecution is the Crown's alone to make. Reasonable counsel may indeed, and often do, differ on whether a particular disposition is in the public interest in the circumstances of the case. The ADM, in good faith, determined that Crown counsel's assessment of the strength of the evidence was erroneous and, on that basis, having regard to the seriousness of the offences, concluded that it would not be in the public interest to terminate the prosecution on the criminal charges. This can hardly be regarded as evidence of misconduct.(emphasis added)[159]Constrained by the ‘core elements of prosecutorial discretion’ paradigm, as opposed to the measure of the unfairness of state misconduct toward an offender, in terms of determining the nature of the review available to the court asked to review a prosecutor’s decision to prove service of a s. 727(1) notice, the question becomes whether such a decision is one which is, or is not, a constitutionally protected exercise of discretion immune from judicial review other than for abuse of process.[160]Applying the substance of the test enunciated in Krieger and in Nixon, as to whether the prosecutor’s discretion exercised on behalf of the Attorney General is a decision as to whether the prosecution should be brought, continued or ceased, and if so, what it should be for, the s. 727 decision is not expressly within the scope of that definition.The decision, made on a case-by-case basis according to Ministry policy in the form of a directive or guidelines publicly available, a decision which over the years has often come to be integrally related to plea bargaining respecting a defendant with a dated related criminal record, could therefore be viewed as a matter of discretionary tactical conduct.Acknowledging that unlegislated government policy, as an act of political authority as opposed to an act of administrative authority, can in certain circumstances of impact on Charter rights be reviewed for compliance with constitutional principles (Canada v. PHS Community Services Society, 2011 SCC 44 (CanLII), at paras. 105, 112-4, 116, 153; Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority v. Canadian Federation of Students, 2009 SCC 31 (CanLII), [2009] 2 S.C.R. 295, at paras. 31, 37, 47, 52-3, 57-66, 72-3, 90; Committee for the Commonwealth of Canada v. Canada, 1991 CanLII 119 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 139, at para. 40, 159-160, 254; Veffer v. Canada, 2007 FCA 247 (CanLII), at paras. 41, 72 (leave to appeal refused, [2007] S.C.C.A. No. 457)), it would reasonably be expected that a particular application of any such policy would also be subject to Charter scrutiny.[161]The argument favouring characterization of a prosecutor’s exercise of discretion to prove the s. 727(1) notice as coming within the scope of the protected core of prosecutorial discretion tends to centre in part on the aspects of the non-definitive language in Krieger including reference to the authority of the Attorney General’s agent to “manage” prosecutions, to determine the “extent of the prosecution”, and the existence of “other [non-enumerated] discretionary decisions” reserved to the core category.As is evident from the Ministry of Attorney General policy, the Attorney General’s guidelines respecting proof of service of the s. 727(1) notice, in the instance of a recidivist drinking/driving defendant, in many respects parallel the type of decision-making factors at play in a prosecutor’s quasi-judicial decisions to continue a prosecution, to withdraw a charge or to proceed with a particular charge or to elect to proceed by indictment (which might carry a mandatory minimum penalty i.e. ss. 96(2), 102(2), or different mandatory minimum penalty (i.e. ss. 151, 152, 153, 163.1(2) to (5)) – public interest factors including public safety as well as the circumstances of the particular defendant: see, Report of the Attorney General’s Advisory Committee on Charge Screening, Disclosure and Resolution Discussions (“The Martin Committee Report”) (Toronto: Queen’s Printer for Ontario, 1993) (the Honourable G. Arthur Martin, Chair), at pp. 65-94, 99-113, 309-312. The contents of the government’s policy, and its manner of application over time, may of course vary as the Crown, in its public law role, tracks and analyzes statistical information under its control as to road safety and the problem posed by recidivists drinking drivers.[162]In R. v. Lyons, 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309, a case in which the prosecutor elected to apply to have the accused declared a dangerous offender, the court stated at paras. 63-4:As I see it, then, the sole issue left for consideration under s. 9 is whether the lack of uniformity in the treatment of dangerous persons that arises by virtue of the prosecutorial discretion to make an application under Part XXI constitutes unconstitutional arbitrariness. The appellant is not suggesting that prosecutors, in his case or generally, have exercised their discretion arbitrarily in this regard...the legislation has, in general, not been abused. I have no doubt that if and when it is alleged that a prosecutor in a particular case was motivated by improper or arbitrary reasons in making a Part XXI application, a s. 24 remedy would lie. However, I do not think there is any warrant for presuming the executive will act unconstitutionally or for improper purposes.More important, however, is the fact that prosecutors always have a discretion in prosecuting criminals to the full extent of the law, an aspect of which involves making sentencing submissions. In this respect, I am in complete agreement with Crown counsel's submission that \"... it is the absence of discretion which would, in many cases, render arbitrary the law's application\". As he notes, \"the absence of any discretion with respect to Part XXI would necessarily require the Crown to always proceed under Part XXI if there was the barest prima facie case and the Court, upon making a finding that the offender is a dangerous offender, would always be required to impose an indeterminate sentence\".(emphasis added)[163]This dicta, within the context of Crown decision-making in the sentencing context, contemplates the exceptional circumstances of judicial review in an instance of “improper or arbitrary” prosecution motives.While the matter may not be entirely free of doubt, and bearing in mind that arbitrariness can have a variety of meanings ranging from unreasonableness to notions associated with abuse of process such as capriciousness, malevolence or acting on a whim (see paras. 186-7 infra), it appears that the Lyons court was addressing the abuse of process standard.[164]Despite the limiting impact on the breadth of the court’s discretion in sentencing, proof of the s. 727(1) notice, in my view, should be seen as within the core elements of prosecutorial discretion.Case-by-case supervision of the reasonableness of a prosecutor’s exercise of discretion to prove the s. 727(1) notice, apart from its disabling impact on trial delay initiatives, would inevitably plunge the court into second-guessing the assessment of cases by Crown counsel within their public law function.Constitutional separation of powers would be eroded.The Crown’s use of the s. 727(1) notice is therefore judicially reviewable within the limits of the abuse of process doctrine only.[165]Should the court be wrong in this conclusion, I will as well address the scope of s. 7 of the Charter in the context of a non-core element analysis.Abuse of Process[166]The doctrine of abuse of process, effectively a judicial technique of control for the protection of the processes of the court in particular where the state’s conduct can be described as sufficiently unfair or oppressive as to violate those principles of fundamental justice which underlie the community’s sense of fair play and decency, is well-established in our law:R. v. Jewitt, 1985 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 128, at pp. 132-5.Abuse of the court’s process may be judicially remedied in the clearest of cases where the state’s conduct “shocks the conscience of the community and is so detrimental to the proper administration of justice that it warrants judicial intervention”: Power, at pp. 613, 615-6.In R. v. O’Connor (1996), 1995 CanLII 51 (SCC), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), at pp. 33-9, L’Heureux-Dubé J. stated:Conversely, it is equally clear that abuse of process also contemplates important individual interests.In “The Stay of Proceedings as a Remedy in Criminal Cases: Abusing the Abuse of Process Concept” (1991), 15 Crim. L.F. 315 at p. 331, Professor David M. Paciocco suggests that the doctrine of abuse of process, in addition to preserving the reputation of the administration of justice, also seeks to ensure that accused persons are given a fair trial.Arguably, the latter is essentially a subset of the former.Unfair trials will almost inevitably cause the administration of justice to fall into disrepute … What is significant for our purposes, however, is the fact that one often cannot separate the public interests in the integrity of the system from the private interests of the individual accused.In fact, it may be wholly unrealistic to treat the latter as wholly distinct from the former.This court has repeatedly recognized that human dignity is at the heart of the Charter.While respect for human dignity and autonomy may not necessarily, itself, be a principle of fundamental justice (Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General) (1993), 1993 CanLII 75 (SCC), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 15 at p. 67, 107 D.L.R. (4th) 342 at p. 394, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519, per Sopinka J. for the majority), it seems to me that conducting a prosecution in a manner that contravenes the community’s basic sense of decency and fair play and thereby calls into question the integrity of the system is also an affront of constitutional magnitude to the rights of the individual accused.It would violate the principles of fundamental justice to be deprived of one’s liberty under circumstances which amount to an abuse of process and, in my view, the individual who is the subject of such treatment is entitled to presentarguments under the Charter and to request a just and appropriate remedy from a court of competent jurisdiction.[167]Also, in O’Connor, at para. 69, the court observed that remedies less drastic than a stay of proceedings are of course available under s. 24(1) of the Charter in situations where the “clearest of cases” threshold is not met but where it is proved, on a balance of probabilities, that s. 7 has been violated.[168]At paragraphs 36 and 38 of Nixon, the court summarized the extent of the merger between s. 7 of the Charter and abuse of process:Ten years later in R. v. O'Connor, 1995 CanLII 51 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, the Court noted that there was much overlap between the Charter and the common law doctrine of abuse of process, as the latter had found application in circumstances involving state conduct touching upon both \"the integrity of the judicial system and the fairness of the individual accused's trial\" (para. 73). Consequently, L'Heureux-Dubé J., writing for a unanimous Court on this point, held that the two regimes should be merged under s. 7 of the Charter. Depending on the circumstances, different Charter guarantees may be engaged by the alleged abuse of process and thus some claims may be better addressed by reference to the specific procedural guarantee. For example, \"where the accused claims that the Crown's conduct has prejudiced his ability to have a trial within a reasonable time, abuses may be best addressed by reference to s. 11(b)\" (para. 73). The Court identified two categories of abuse of process which would be caught by s. 7 of the Charter: (1) prosecutorial conduct affecting the fairness of the trial; and (2) prosecutorial conduct that \"contravenes fundamental notions of justice and thus undermines the integrity of the judicial process\" (para. 73)....Thus, in defining what constitutes a violation, it is important to recall what kind of harm the common law doctrine of abuse of process was intended to address and, in turn, why this degree of harm called for a stay of proceedings as the appropriate remedy. In other words, while s. 24(1) of the Charter allows for a wide range of remedies, this does not mean that abuse of process can be made out by demonstrating a lesser degree of harm, either to the accused's fair trial interests or to the integrity of the justice system. Achieving the appropriate balance between societal and individual concerns defines the essential character of abuse of process.(emphasis of original)[169]As described more particularly below, in light of our constitutionalization of many aspects of the sentencing phase of a criminal trial, “the fairness of the trial” includes the sentencing hearing.[170]Proof of prosecutorial misconduct in the sense of oblique motive or bad faith, while relevant, is not however a prerequisite to a finding of abuse of process – without those factors it may be determined, depending on the factual context, that the Crown’s exercise of discretion would “violate those principles of justice which underlie the community’s sense of fair play and decency”: Nixon, at para. 39; R. v. Keyowski, 1988 CanLII 74 (SCC), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 657, at p. 659; Power, at pp. 614-5; O’Connor, at p. 42; Conway (1989), 1989 CanLII 66 (SCC), 49 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.), at p. 302; R. v. Regan (2002), 2002 SCC 12 (CanLII), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.), at pp. 160-1 (per Binnie J. dissenting in the result).[171]Some s. 7 breaches are more serious than others.Given the high threshold for abuse of process, not every s. 7 breach may rise to the level of an abuse of process.The implication of immunizing core prosecutorial discretion from judicial review other than by abuse of process or identification of a s. 7 Charter breach of similar severity means that some exercises of core prosecutorial discretion resulting in lesser unfairness which contravene a principle of fundamental justice are incapable of redress.Section 7 of the Charter in the Sentencing Context[172]Section 7 of the Charter “should be given a generous interpretation”: R. v. Beare; R. v. Higgins, 1988 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 387, at para. 28.This is inherent in our constitutional philosophy of taking “a generous and purposive approach to the interpretation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter” (Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, at para. 27) and the recognition that “[r]ights and freedoms must be nurtured, not inhibited”: Committee for the Commonwealth of Canada, at para. 176.While “[s]ection 7 gives rise to some of the most difficult issues in Canadian Charter litigation” (Chaoulli, at para. 193, per Binnie and LeBel JJ. dissenting in the result), “[t]he task of the courts, on s. 7 issues...is to evaluate the issue in the light, not just of common sense or theory, but of the evidence”: Chaoulli, at para. 150 per McLachlin C.J. and Major J.[173]The analysis under s. 7 proceeds in two stages:(1)is there a deprivation of life, liberty and/or security of the person?(2)if so, does the deprivation accord with principles of fundamental justice?R. v. D.B., 2008 SCC 25 (CanLII), [2008] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 37.[174]In the cases of Mr. Mohla and Mr. Singh, the Crown did not dispute that the effect of proven service of the s. 727(1) notice impacted upon the liberty interests of a recidivist drinking/driving offender as he is subjected to a mandatory minimum imprisonment regime curtailing the discretion of the sentencing court.[175]Turning to the notion of principles of fundamental justice, our jurisprudence provides this guidance:(1)“[t]he real control over the scope and operation of s. 7 is to be found in the requirement that the applicant identify a violation of a principle of fundamental justice”: Chaoulli, at para. 199 (per Binnie and LeBel J.J. dissenting in the result)(2)the principles of fundamental justice are concerned with the interest of the person who claims his or her liberty has been limited but also with broader interests such as the protection of society, and accordingly a limited balancing is permissible to the extent of elucidating a particular principle of fundamental justice: Cunningham v. Canada, 1993 CanLII 139 (SCC), [1993] 2 S.C.R. 143, at pp. 151-2; Rodriguez, at pp. 592-3; R. v. Malmo-Levine, 2003 SCC 74 (CanLII), [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, at paras. 96-8; R.v.Rodriguez, 1993 CanLII 75 (SCC), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519, at para. 146(3)the principles of fundamental justice are to be found in the basic tenets and principles not only of our judicial system but also of the other components of our legal system: Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, 1985 CanLII 81 (SCC), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486, at p. 512(4)while the common law may not be determinative in assessing whether a particular practice violates a principle of fundamental justice, it is certainly one of the major repositories of the basic tenets of our legal system: Beare, at para. 39(5)as to identification of a principle of fundamental justice, Sopinka J. stated in Rodriguez, at para. 141:Discerning the principles of fundamental justice with which deprivation of life, liberty or security of the person must accord, in order to withstand constitutional scrutiny, is not an easy task. A mere common law rule does not suffice to constitute a principle of fundamental justice, rather, as the term implies, principles upon which there is some consensus that they are vital or fundamental to our societal notion of justice are required. Principles of fundamental justice must not, however, be so broad as to be no more than vague generalizations about what our society considers to be ethical or moral. They must be capable of being identified with some precision and applied to situations in a manner which yields an understandable result. They must also, in my view, be legal principles.(6)therefore, in determining whether the applicant for Charter relief has properly identified a principle of fundamental justice, a framework of three criteria has been developed:(1)it must be a legal principle(2)there must be a consensus that the rule or principle is fundamental to the way in which the legal system ought fairly to operate(3)it must be identified with sufficient precision to yield a manageable standard against which to measure deprivations of life, liberty or security of the person.D.B., at para. 46; Malmo-Levine, at para. 113.[176]In the Malmo-Levine decision, at paras. 159-169, the court converged the test for constitutional review of the fitness of sentence under ss. 7 and 12 of the Charter to one of “gross disproportionality”.The court recognized that not every disproportionate or excessive sentence can properly be characterized as reaching the high threshold of gross disproportionality.[177]The reach of s. 7 of the Charter within the sentencing context is not however exhausted by the proportionality analysis.That is apparent by reference to examples such as the jurisprudence respecting credit for pre-sentence custody, acceptance as a principle of fundamental justice of the requirement for the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt aggravating features of the offence justifying a more severe penalty (D.B., at paras. 78, 139-40), and recognition that “at a minimum the requirements of fundamental justice embrace the requirements of procedural fairness”: Lyons, at para. 85.[178]The “existence of well-established sentencing principles” may be relevant to the analysis of whether there is a breach of the Charter: Malmo-Levine, at para. 158.In other words, “[s]entencing decisions are always subject to constitutional scrutiny”: Nasogaluak, at para. 48.A sentence cannot be “fit” if it does not respect the fundamental values enshrined in the Charter:Nasogaluak, at paras. 48, 64.[179]A sentencing court is mandated to consider reducing a sentence on account of “any mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender”:Criminal Code, s. 718.2(a).Further, beyond the proportionality requirement of sentencing, there are, to adopt the expression in Nasogaluak at para. 40, “secondary sentencing principles” in s. 718.2, such as parity, totality and restraint in the use of incarceration.Accepted subordinate factors in the individualized sentencing process include remorse and the “gap principle”.These are all legal principles, identifiable and manageable standards, essential to fair operation of the sentencing process, and therefore themselves principles of fundamental justice.[180]Evidence of remorse engages an acceptance of responsibility for offending, acknowledges harm done to the victim and the community, and favours prospects for rehabilitation.Remorse is not limited to cases where a defendant pleads guilty.Where there is a guilty plea, however, there exists the additional benefit of a victim not being required to testify, and a saving of time and resources otherwise dedicated to a trial.A sentencing court may take into account in the exercise of its sentencing discretion, not as an aggravating feature of sentencing, but as the absence of a factor entitling sentence reduction, and as relevant to whether restorative objectives can be satisfied in a particular case, an offender’s lack of remorse and acceptance of responsibility for his or her crime: Proulx, at para. 113; R. v. Valle-Quintero (2002), 2002 CanLII 45123 (ON CA), 169 C.C.C. (3d) 140 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 164; R. v. A.(K.) (1999), 1999 CanLII 3756 (ON CA), 137 C.C.C. (3d) 554 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 570.It is error to consider a lack of remorse as an aggravating circumstance and to do so in the context of a defendant exercising his or her right to trial is contrary to fundamental notions of fairness:R. v. Valentini (1999), 1999 CanLII 1885 (ON CA), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 262 (Ont. C.A.), at paras. 81-3; R. v. Nash, 2009 NSCA 7 (CanLII), at paras. 29-33.[181]It may be quite wrong where there has not been a plea of guilty not to recognize in mitigation of sentence the efficient manner in which the defendant’s trial was conducted to responsibly shorten the proceeding, for example litigating Charter issues while offering no evidence on the merits of the matter: R. v. Fegan (1993), 1993 CanLII 8607 (ON CA), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 356 (Ont. C.A.), at pp 359, 361-2. “[A]ny perceived infringement upon the manner in which a defence is to be conducted, such as a fear that a particular tactic might induce a heavier penalty, would impair the right to make full answer and defence”, a principle of fundamental justice protected by s. 7 of the Charter: R. v. Kozy (1990), 58 O.R. (3d) 500 (C.A.), at para. 14.[182]The gap principle has emerged over time as a foundational consideration in sentencing.Where the principle is relevant, it is error for the sentencing court to fail to apply it: R. v. Nembhard, 2010 ONCA 420 (CanLII), at paras. 3-6.Often referred to in passing or application without further definition of the concept (R. v. Butler, 2010 ONCA 216 (CanLII), at para. 1; R. v. Carroll, 2010 ONCA 378 (CanLII), at para. 2; R. v. Black, 2010 NBCA 36 (CanLII), at para. 54; R. v. Mathers, 2009 ONCA 300 (CanLII), at para. 3; R. v. Crowell, [2005] O.J. No. 684 (C.A.) (QL), at para. 1; R. v. Ross, [2004] O.J. No. 2104 (C.A.) (QL), at para. 9, R. v. Gillan, [2003] O.J. No. 2513 (C.A.) (QL), at para. 2; R. v. Harrell (1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 480 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 481-2; R. v. Graveline (1958), 120 C.C.C. 367 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 371), the scope of the principle has attained a degree of precision over time:(1)a gap in an offender’s criminal record is relevant to future risk and to rehabilitative potential:Since both sentencing and crime are human endeavours, it is natural for the courts to give credit to someone who has made an honest effort to avoid conflict with the criminal law.In the nature of things, an effort such as this will often not be completely successful, but if a substantial period of time passes without convictions, this is often a matter which will be taken into consideration.As put by Cross: “Assuming that it is not merely the outcome of lucky non-detection, the trouble-free period shows in these cases that the offender is not a professional criminal, and therefore the public needs less protection from him.”It shows that there is some hope of rehabilitation.(C. Ruby et al., Sentencing (6th ed.) (Toronto: Butterworths, 2001), at s. 878 as quoted in R. v. Lohnes (2007), 2007 NSCA 24 (CanLII), 217 C.C.C. (3d) 392 (N.S.C.A.), at para. 43; see also R. v. Moreau, 2007 BCCA 239 (CanLII), at para. 10; R. v. Smith, 2006 NSCA 95 (CanLII), at para. 37; R. v. Oxford, 2010 NLCA 45 (CanLII), at paras. 21-2; R. v. Wright, 2010 MBCA 80 (CanLII), at para. 7)(2)“The basis of the principle is that a person who has rectified past behaviour for a substantial period of time should be considered as having better prospects for individual deterrence and rehabilitation”(R. v. MacLeod, 2004 NSCA 31 (CanLII), at para. 25 per Cromwell J.A. (as he then was))(3)“The “gap” principle.This means that if a man with a criminal record has not had any convictions for a number of years, he is to be treated if not as a first offender, then almost as a first offender”(R. v. Mulvahill (1991), 1991 CanLII 5765 (BC CA), 69 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (B.C.C.A.), at para. 34)(4)ordinarily, the gap should reflect a passage of time of sufficient duration to be relevant: R. v. Ashberry (1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 138 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 145 per Dubin C.J.O. dissenting in the result (leave to appeal refused, [1989] S.C.C.A. No. 136) (“a significant interval of time”); Lohnes, at para. 44 (an “appreciable gap”).[183]As noted at para. 132 supra, Parliament has recently integrated the gap principle into certain graduated mandatory minimum sentencing schemes in the Code.At common law, failure to apply the gap principle often invokes a concern closely connected to the gap principle – a principle of fundamental fairness that an accused not be re-punished for past offences: R. v. Taylor, 2004 CanLII 7199 (ON CA), [2004] O.J. No. 3439 (C.A.) (QL), at paras. 39-40; R. v. Stewart, [2003] O.J. No. 1958 (C.A.) (QL), at para. 9; R. v. Andrade, 2010 NBCA 62 (CanLII), at para. 20; R. v. Muyser, 2009 ABCA 116 (CanLII), at para. 8; Carroll, at para. 2; Smith, at para. 36.Ignoring the gap principle, where applicable, or unreasonably discounting its significance, may raise an inference of intended double-punishment or at least such an effect.[184]It “is a well-recognized principle of fundamental justice that laws should not be arbitrary”: Chaoulli, at para. 129; Malmo-Levine, at para. 135; Rodriguez, at para. 594.“The state is not entitled to arbitrarily limit its citizens’ right to...liberty”: Chaoulli, at para. 129.“[A]s with all exercises of discretion, the [government actor’s] decisions must conform to the Charter”: PHS Community Services, at para. 117.If, contrary to the interpretation given at para. 163, supra to the words “motivated by improper or arbitrary reasons” (Lyons, para. 63), there can be s. 7 Charter review of core prosecutorial decisions for behaviour falling short of abuse of process, or if the s. 727(1) decision falls within the non-core designation, then the alternative argument of the Crown on appeal becomes the relevant standard.[185]“Section 7 of the Charter requires not a particular type of process, but a fair process having regard to the nature of the proceedings and the interests at stake” – while the demands of fundamental justice depend on the context, “[t]he issue is whether the process is fundamentally unfair to the affected person”.Charkaoui v. Canada, 2007 SCC 9 (CanLII), [2007] 1 S.C.R. 350, at paras. 18, 20, 22-3, 28; Lyons, at paras. 22, 88.[186]While the notion of arbitrariness may vary with context, it is material to discussion of the role of s. 7 Charter scrutiny of the conduct of government actors which impacts on constitutional rights.In R. v. Cayer; R. v. Legree; R. v. Dawson; R. v. Boyer (1988), 66 C.R. (3d) 30 (Ont. C.A.) (leave to appeal refused, [1988] S.C.C.A. Nos. 370, 466, 505), in the context of the policy underlying a statute affecting a Charter right, the court described “arbitrary” at p. 43 as “being capricious, unreasonable or unjustified” and cited the Black’s Law Dictionary (5th ed.) (1979) definition including “not done or acting according to reason or judgment” and “[w]ithout fair, solid, and substantial cause”.In Levitz v. Ryan (1972), 1972 CanLII 399 (ON CA), 9 C.C.C. (2d) 182 (Ont.C.A.), at p. 189, the court described “arbitrary” as “unreasonable or capricious”.In R. v. Ladouceur (1987), 59 O.R. (2d) 688 (C.A.) (aff’d (1990), 1990 CanLII 108 (SCC), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 22 (S.C.C.), at pp. 700-1, the court reviewed a number of dictionary definitions for arbitrary including, “at the discretion or option of anyone”, “[d]erived from mere opinion”, or “left to one’s own judgment or choice”.[187]A number of other attempts to define arbitrary include: restrictions may be “arbitrary or unfair” where they have no relevance to the state’s objective (Rodriguez, at para. 147); where the limit is not necessary for the state’s objective or is inconsistent with the objective (PHS Community Services Society, at para. 132); “A detention is arbitrary if it is the product of an untrammelled discretion” (R. v. Duguay, 1989 CanLII 110 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 93, at p. 120 per L’Heureux-Dubé J. (in dissent in the result)); “random choice...unrestrained” (R. v. McIntosh (1984), 29 M.V.R. 50 (B.C.C.A.), at pp. 58-62); “...if necessary grounds exist for the exercise of discretion one way or the other and there has been a fair consideration as to whether, or in what way, the discretion should be exercised, the ultimate decision cannot be said to be arbitrary” ((1992), 72 C.C.C. (3d) 133 (Man. Q.B.), at p. 136).[188]If a sentencing court chose to ignore demonstrable remorse or application of the gap principle, or to unfairly penalize an accused for asserting Charter rights at trial, or effectively re-punished an offender on account of his or her previous criminal record, resort to s. 7 of the Charter would be unnecessary because, although such judicial error would properly be seen as violative of accepted fundamental principles of justice, an appeal court is empowered to remedy the result within its plenary jurisdiction to review the fitness of sentence.Where, however, an offender’s liberty interest in impacted by the conduct of a prosecutor making a decision based upon any of those very same erroneous approaches, it may be said that the decision was founded on a whim or upon unrestrained or unprincipled discretion breaching principles of fundamental justice.[189]Accordingly, if the decision to prove pre-plea service of the s. 727(1) notice is not within the core elements of prosecutorial discretion, then a decision made for improper or arbitrary reasons, though not amounting to an abuse of process, may nevertheless be subject to s. 7 Charter review.The Present CasesThe Mohla Case[190]Prior to arraignment and commencement of his trial, Mr. Mohla was aware of the Crown’s position regarding proof of the notice.He knew that an unconditional plea of guilt to either of the charges he faced would result in the prosecutor not seeking to have him sentenced as a rescidivist pursuant to ss. 255(1)(a)(ii) and 259(1)(b) of the Code.The Crown did not renege on a position or repudiate any aspect of the plea negotiation process.Mr. Mohla elected to proceed to trial to secure two acquittals.[191]Arguably, having regard to the wording of the Crown Charge Screening Form (para. 20, supra), the respondent had a lengthier period than normal to consider his options. The “deal” offered by the prosecution was not unfairly coercive and did not punish the respondent for exercising his right to trial.[192]Employing the approach of Ministry Policy, the “gap” between Mr. Mohla’s prior conviction and the current offence was about 8 years and 9 months.The gap from completion of his earlier 1-year driving prohibition and the commission of the present offence was about 7 years and 9 months.[193]The Crown was fully alive to the low BAC readings in exercising its discretion to prove the notice.[194]The respondent was not stopped in a R.I.D.E. checkpoint in a 60k/hr. zone on a rural road.He drove on a 400-series highway at night for 3 ½ to 4 kilometres at speeds just under 180k/hr.The driving caused a police officer to describe the respondent’s vehicle as speeding like a “race car...bombing in and out of slower traffic”.Any sober, rational individual would conclude that it was miraculous that a serious motor vehicle accident did not occur.[195]Ministry policy is intended to assess a particular case on the totality of its circumstances not simply aggravating factors. The prosecution office considered the gap, the particularly aggravated nature of the driving, the absence of a plea of guilty, and the lack of any mitigating information regarding the offender such as participation in treatment for alcohol abuse or the hardship impact of a custodial sentence.These were appropriate factors.[196]Mr. Doyle was correct to concede that the trial prosecutor overplayed her submissions respecting the role of remorse.As well, with the Crown prepared to accept a plea of guilt on the morning of trial with an agreement not to prove the notice, witnesses were already at court, inconvenienced, and court time booked for the trial.Asserting Charter rights and then expediting the course of the trial when unsuccessful in establishing a breach is not, as suggested by trial counsel, necessarily inconsistent with remorse or rehabilitative potential.That said, the record does not include an expression of regret by Mr. Mohla.[197]The conduct of the Crown cannot reasonably be characterized as an abuse of process in the sense of oppressive, at odds with fair play and decency, patently unfair, capable of shocking the conscience of the community, or so detrimental to the administration of justice as to warrant judicial intervention.Nor would honouring the proven notice, and in turn being restrained by the mandatory minimum punishment of s. 255(1)(a)(ii) and s. 259(1)(b), lead to the imposition of a grossly disproportionate sentence.[198]The trial judge erred in applying a reasonableness standard to the prosecutor’s decision (“in my view”, “it is my judgment it is not reasonable”, “[i]t seems to me”).There will always be cases where there is a range of perspective on whether it would be reasonable to prove pre-plea service of the s. 727(1) notice.Different prosecutors may view a case differently.That is inherent in the administration of criminal justice.It is not for the court, as was the case here, to review the reasonableness of the prosecutor’s exercise of discretion.[199]Even if the s. 727(1) decision here was not viewed as an exercise of core prosecutorial discretion, I could not conclude that the prosecutor’s decision was arbitrary or otherwise offensive to principles of fundamental justice protected by s. 7 of the Charter.The Singh Case[200]Like Mr. Mohla, Mr. Singh decided to proceed to trial on two charges knowing that if he pled to one charge the Crown would not seek to prove pre-plea service of the s. 727(1) notice.He too had counsel.He understood the jeopardy involved.[201]The gap, as that term is defined by Ministry policy, between the appellant’s prior drinking/driving conviction (April 11, 1994) and the current offence was about 13 years and 1 month.[202]Before the trial court, the Crown explained its exercise of discretion in part on the basis of the aggravated features of Mr. Singh’s driving including his presence on a high-speed public highway, the danger he created with a near collision at one point, and the apparent high level of intoxication.In the absence of a plea, witnesses testified and court resources were expended.There was no evidence of remorse nor acceptance of responsibility.These were entirely appropriate factors.[203]As in the Mohla case, the conduct of the Crown cannot reasonably be characterized as an abuse of process in the sense of oppressive, at odds with fair play and decency, patently unfair, capable of shocking the conscience of the community, or so detrimental to the administration of justice as to warrant judicial intervention.Nor would honouring the proven notice, and in turn being restrained by the mandatory minimum punishments of s. 255(1)(a)(ii) and s. 259(1)(b), lead to the imposition of a grossly disproportionate sentence.[204]The trial judge determined, based on his experience and on a standard of reasonableness, that the circumstances of the appellant’s case were not sufficiently exceptional to justify binding the court to the mandatory sentencing regime of ss. 255(1)(a)(ii) and 259(1)(b).That approach of itself weighing variables is not open to a trial court where Crown counsel makes a decision within the core elements of prosecutorial discretion.Nor, is a reasonableness assessment available on the alternative basis of the s. 727(1) decision being a non-core decision subject to s. 7 Charter review for breach of a principle of fundamental justice at a dimension less serious than abuse of process.Were reasonableness the standard, I would agree with the trial judge’s conclusion.[205]That said, because the 13+ year-gap is such a substantial time period, in the context of an absence of most of the aggravating factors delineated in the Ministry policy, the s. 727(1) decision on its face raises the prospect of arbitrary decision-making implicating s. 7 of the Charter in the sense of untrammelled discretion, decision on a whim or effectively without any regard at all to the gap principle.Were the s. 727(1) decision not within the core elements of prosecutorial discretion, the trial court may well, in these circumstances, have entertained a s. 24(1) Charter remedy respecting operation of the notice.CONCLUSION[206]Mr. Singh’s appeal against conviction is dismissed.[207]The Crown appeal against sentence is allowed in both cases.At the request of the Attorney General, as described in para. 10 supra, the court makes this declaration without varying the existing sentences._____________HILL J.Released:January 27, 2012CITATION:R. v.

Ray of the Superior Court of Justice on October 21, 2008 and thesentence entered on November 27, 2008.ENDORSEMENT[1]The appellants were charged with a number of serious offences arising out of a home invasion motivated by the mistaken belief that the home owners were operating a marijuana “grow op” and had a great deal of cash in the home.The appellant, Ranger, appeals conviction only.The appellant, Fijalkowski, appeals conviction and sentence.[2]The Crown’s case rested in large measure on K.G.B. statements given by two persons, who had participated in the home invasion, pled guilty and been sentenced prior to this trial.Both witnesses recanted their K.G.B. statements at trial, however, the statements were admitted on consent under the principled exception to the hearsay rule.Both witnesses were thoroughly disreputable and the trial judge, quite properly, gave himself a Vetrovec warning.The appellants did not testify.The Arguments[3]The appellants argue that the verdicts are unreasonable.They contend that given the obvious and numerous problems with the credibility of the two K.G.B. witnesses, it was unreasonable to accept the contents of the K.G.B. statements as true and to find that the Crown had satisfied the burden of proof based on the contents of those statements.Counsel for the appellants have taken us through inconsistencies between the two K.G.B. statements and inconsistencies between those statements and other independent facts that were proved in evidence.[4]Crown counsel responds by accepting that the two K.G.B. witnesses were liars and thoroughly disreputable individuals.She points out, however, the many consistencies between the two K.G.B. statements on important and specific details with respect to the events culminating in the home invasion.She also submits that there is no evidence of any possible collusion between these two witnesses prior to the giving of the K.G.B. statements.Finally, Crown counsel points to consistencies between the K.G.B. statements and other evidence adduced at trial.[5]There is merit to the arguments of both the appellant and the Crown.No doubt, similar arguments were made at trial.Our inquiry is, however, to determine whether a reasonable trier of fact, properly instructed, could convict and not to choose the more compelling of the arguments made for and against conviction.In our view, the evidence clears the reasonable verdict standard.We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.[6]Counsel for Mr. Ranger also argues that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence in several respects.He took us through a number of examples.In our view, none merit reversal.[7]Some of the alleged misapprehensions do not arise out of the trial judge’s review of the evidence at all, but rather address inferences that the trial judge indicated may or may not be available from parts of the evidence.In this part of his reasons, the trial judge was not reviewing the evidence, but was addressing defence arguments concerning inferences that should be drawn from some of the evidence.The trial judge was pointing out other inferences that were available on that evidence.[8]Other alleged misapprehensions of the evidence arise out of the trial judge’s reference to parts of the evidence that he ultimately rejected.For example, it would appear that the trial judge misapprehended part of the in-court testimony of one of the K.G.B. witnesses.However, the trial judge totally rejected that testimony for reasons that had nothing to do with any misapprehension of the substance of the testimony.[9]Finally, with respect to the other alleged misapprehensions of the evidence, a review of the entirety of the reasons dispels any concerns that the trial judge made any material error in respect of the evidence.For example, while it is arguable that his summary of the evidence concerning Ranger’s cell phone use was somewhat inaccurate, the trial judge had, moments earlier in his reasons, correctly reviewed that evidence in detail.[10]We are satisfied that any mistakes that the trial judge made in his review of the evidence were not material to the verdict and do not give cause to question the reliability of the verdict.[11]The appellants also argue that the trial judge failed to consider the cumulative effect of parts of the evidence that supported the position of the defence.Counsel contend that the trial judge looked at each of these potentially exculpatory portions of the evidence in isolation and after deciding that each piece of the evidence could not in and of itself raise a reasonable doubt, rejected the defence position with respect to that evidence.[12]It is true that the trial judge addressed the parts of the evidence relied on by the defence separately.He did so to properly outline those arguments and thoroughly address them before rejecting the defence position with respect to each.It is clear, however, from an examination of the reasons as a whole that the trial judge applied the proper burden of proof and applied it to the totality of the evidence.This ground of appeal cannot succeed.[13]The appellants also submit that the trial judge erred in taking judicial notice that certain cell phones were being operated in various geographical locations at different times.The Crown adduced business records on consent that detailed the operation of various cell phones that were owned by the appellants and one of the accomplices.The records also showed the cell phone tower to which the signal from a particular phone was transmitted in respect of each call.[14]The trial judge concluded that without expert evidence, he could take judicial notice of the approximate location of a cell phone at the time a particular call was made based on the cell phone tower that received the signal.Similarly, he could plot the directional movement of a cell phone over a particular time period by reference to the location of the differentcell phone towers that received signals from that cell phone during that time period.[15]We do not accept that the trial judge erred in ruling that he could take judicial notice of the facts outlined above without hearing expert evidence.The trial judge used the cell phone evidence for very limited purposes.First, he used the evidence to show association among the parties.This use is not challenged on appeal.Second, by taking judicial notice of the facts set out above, the trial judge used the evidence to show the approximate geographical location of the cell phones in relation to the cell phone tower that received the transmission.He did not take judicial notice that the cell phone was in any precise location, but rather that it could properly be placed in a general location, e.g. in downtown Ottawa as opposed to in the countryside west of Ottawa.The trial judge’s further inference with respect to the movement of the cell phones over a given period of time followed from his determination that judicial notice could be taken of the general location of the cell phone based on the cell phone tower that received a particular transmission.[16]We note that the appellants concede that it is now notorious that cell phone users engaged in a cell phone call and travelling from point A to point B will find their cell phone signal passes from one cell phone tower to another at different locations along the route from point A to point B.We agree with and accept that concession.Given that concession, we do not think it can be argued that the trial judge erred in taking judicial notice that a particular cell phone was in a general location based on the tower that received the signal and that the path along which the cell phone was moving could be determined by reference to the cell phone towers that received the signal transmission in respect of particular calls.[17]In holding that the trial judge made no error by ruling that he did not require expert evidence on this issue and that he could take judicial notice, we stress that the Crown was seeking to use the cell phone evidence only to show the approximate location of the users and movement of the users in a certain direction between locations.In another case, the Crown may seek to rely on this kind of evidence for more specific or precise inferences.The defence may also satisfy the court that more specific or detailed inferences are relevant to the issues raised by the cell phone evidence.In those cases, the trial judge will require the Crown to lead the expert evidence necessary to address the more specific inferences that the Crown or the defence argue can or cannot be drawn from the evidence.On the specific facts of this case, the trial judge correctly determined that judicial notice could be taken of the general propositions outlined above.[18]For the reasons set out above, the appeals from conviction are dismissed.The Sentence Appeal[19]The appellant, Mr. Fijalkowski, appeals his sentence of 10 years.Mr. Ranger received a sentence of 9 years after trial while Messrs. Barkley and Trepanier received 7 years and Mr. Crosby received 4 years following their guilty pleas.They also received credit for pre-trial custody.We think the trial judge erred in law by imposing a sentence on Mr. Fijalkowski that was higher than the sentence imposed on Mr. Ranger.[20]First, the trial judge failed to take into account the significant disparity between both the length and the seriousness of the adult criminal records of Mr. Fijalkowski and Mr. Ranger.Second, although the trial judge adverted to the fact that Mr. Fijalkowski was 20 years old, he did not address the significance or effect on sentence of the fact that he is a man four years younger than Mr. Ranger and of the age of only 20 years.Third, the trial judge gave undue effect to his view that the appellant was not a good candidate for long term rehabilitation based only on one transgression in leaving Harvest House while on release and in the face of an apparently positive report from that institution.[21]Finally, in his reasons for judgment, the trial judge concluded that on the evidence, he could not make findings of the respective roles of Mr. Fijalkowski and Mr. Ranger in the home invasion.Given that finding, the trial judge could not impose a higher sentence on Mr. Fijalkowski based on any greater role he may have played.[22]In our view, an appropriate sentence for Mr. Fijalkowski that would adequately reflect the above considerations and the parity principle is 8 years.The appeal against sentence is, therefore, allowed and the sentence reduced to 8 years minus credit for pre-sentence custody.“Doherty J.A.”“K.

SchwarzlReasons for Sentence released on December 8, 2010Mr. Martin Kerbel, Q.C..............................................................................for Minh-Phung DangMs. Cindy Nadler......................................................................................................for the CrownSCHWARZL, J.:1.0:INTRODUCTION[1.]Mr. Minh-Phung Dang pled guilty before me to two offences of domestic violence, namely (1)Forcible Confinement of his girlfriend Ms. Hien Thi Nguyen contrary to section 279(2) of the Criminal Code and (2) Assaulting Ms. Nguyen with a meat cleaver contrary to section 267(a) of the Criminal Code.The Crown elected to proceed by indictment on each count.[2.]Since the date of his pleas in March, 2010 Mr. Dang’s case has been adjourned on number of occasions for a variety of reasons including the preparation of a pre-sentence report, illness of defence counsel, conflicts with my schedule and due to concerns raised by me with counsel regarding the sentence being suggested.Both parties had submitted that in the circumstances of this offence and this offender that a custodial sentence within the intermittent range followed by probation is appropriate and I was troubled by this range.2.0:FACTS[3.]In November, 2009 Mr. Dang and Ms. Nguyen were in an intimate relationship with one another.On the 6th of November, 2009 the two had been out together at a social gathering.They argued over aspects of their relationship.They left the gathering and while Mr. Dang was driving Ms. Nguyen’s car, they argued some more.When the car stopped on the way home, Ms. Nguyen got out and began walking away.Mr. Dang grabbed her by the arms, forcing her back into the car.He then threatened to lay Ms. Nguyen in front of the car and run her over.Mr. Dang then sped away with Ms. Nguyen and drove erratically in a residential area for a quarter of an hour.He drove nearly 100 in a posted 50 km/hr zone, veered into on-coming traffic, and drove through a red light.The roads were slippery and the weather was poor at the time.While going through the red light, Mr. Dang told Ms. Nguyen that he did not care if they both died.[4.]On arriving at Ms. Nguyen’s apartment, Mr. Dang took a meat cleaver, held it against Ms. Nguyen’s throat, and threatened to kill her with it.No evidence was given as to the duration of the assault in the victim’s home.Ms. Nguyen was able to calm the offender down, get loose, and call the police.[5.]Six days following his arrest, Mr. Dang was released on a Recognizance of Bail.3.0:POSTIONS OF THE PARTIES AS TO SENTENCE3.1:Minh-Phung Dang[6.]Mr. Dang is 48 years old and comes before the court as a first-time offender.He has pled guilty prior to setting a trial date.He is employed full-time as a cook in a local pizzeria.Mr. Dang has accepted responsibility for his conduct and is amenable to rehabilitation as part of his sentence.The pre-sentence report is generally positive.[7.]The offender submits that in these circumstances, he should be sentenced to 60 days common jail to be served intermittently.He submits that pre-trial custody with enhanced credit at a ratio of 2:1, or twelve days, be deducted from the term of imprisonment for a final sentence of 48 days intermittent.[8.]Mr. Kerbel advised the court that he believed the victim may not be willing to testify should the matter have been set down for trial.In support of this, he pointed out that Ms. Nguyen declined to provide a Victim Impact Statement.[9.]The defence also submits that there is a joint submission before the court insofar as both parties agree that the sentence should a period of intermittent jail.[10.]Mr. Dang submits that the proposed sentence is fit for the following reasons:a)Mr. Dang pled guilty;b)He pled guilty before trial;c)There was a triable issue as to whether Ms. Nguyen would show up to testify if a trial was set;d)There were no physical injuries to the Victim;e)The pre-sentence report is generally favourable;f)An intermittent sentence is onerous because it spreads out the service of the sentence over a longer period of time;g)If probation is added, then that should decrease the custodial portion of any sentence;h)Mr. Dang can maintain his employment; andi)The sentence is one involving incarceration for a first-time offender.3.2:The Crown[11.]The Crown submits that Mr. Dang should be sentenced to 90 days intermittent minus time served on an enhanced credit of 2:1, or twelve days.The Crown also asks that following the service of his custodial sentence, Mr. Dang be placed on probation for 18 months.The Crown seeks a DNA Order and a s.109 Firearms Prohibition, both of which are mandatory given the nature of the offences.[12.]The Crown disagrees that there is a joint submission because they are seeking 50% more jail time than the offender (90 versus 60 days).[13.]The Crown does, however, agree with Mr. Dang that a sentence in the intermittent range is appropriate.[14.]With respect to mitigating aspects of the case, the Crown submits that the following weighin favour of Mr. Dang:a)He pled guilty;b)He pled guilty before setting a trial;c)The pre-sentence report is generally positive in that the offender was cooperative and remorseful; andd)Significant probation balances off the modest jail time being proposed.[15.]The Crown did not agree that Ms. Nguyen would not respond to a subpoena if the matter were set for trial, but Ms. Nadler acknowledged that Ms. Nguyen was difficult to track down to provide a Victim Impact Statement.When Ms. Nguyen was finally contacted, she declined to provide a Victim Impact Statement, saying only that she wants to forget about the situation.It should be noted, however, that Ms. Nguyen cooperated with Ms. Laura Giacomelli, the probation officer who prepared the pre-sentence report.[16.]In the pre-sentence report, Ms. Nguyen stated that she is fearful of Mr. Dang, especially since he tried to contact her despite his bail that prohibited such contact.She did not call the police to report these breaches.4.0:ISSUES4.1:Is this a joint submission?[17.]This is not a case where a joint submission has been put before the court.Mr. Kerbel recommended 60 days, less time served.Later, in explaining why this was an appropriate sentence, he added that custody can be ameliorated by probation.The Crown recommended 90 days (less time served) plus lengthy probation.[18.]In R. v. Christie (2004), 189 C.C.C. 93d) 274 the Alberta Court of Appeal defined a joint submission at paragraph 45 as follows:A joint submission reflects a process where both counsel advocate the same disposition for the sentencing of an offender.[19.]It is plain that this case is not a situation in which a joint submission is being presented because each side is asking for different periods of custody.Initially, the defence was not recommending probation whilst the Crown has always made probation a part of its submissions.[20.]While the submissions of each party bear some similarity to one another in that they each recommend a custodial period in the intermittent range, it would be wrong to characterize the positions as being a “joint submission.”4.2:What is the appropriate sentence in this case?[21.]Both parties submit that a jail sentence in the intermittent range is appropriate for the reasons set out, above.[22.]Two points, both which I agree with, are implicit by these submissions.The first is that in all of the circumstances, including those of both the offence and the offender, a custodial sentence is required.The second is that a conditional sentence is not appropriate, because the overarching principles of denunciation and deterrence could not be met by a conditional sentence.[23.]Appellate courts have long recognized that the principles of deterrence and denunciation are of paramount importance in determining the appropriate sentence for crimes of domestic violence:R. v. Inwood, [1989] O.J. No. 428 (C.A.); R. v. Edwards (1996), 1996 CanLII 1522 (ON CA), 28 O.R. (3d) 54 (C.A.); R. v. Campbell, 2003 CanLII 48403 (ON CA), [2003] O.J. No. 1352 (C.A.); R. v. Boucher (2004), 2004 CanLII 17719 (ON CA), 186 C.C.C. (3d) 479 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Bytyqi, 2004 CanLII 14964 (ON CA), [2004] O.J. No. 1938 (C.A.); Regina v. Rahaman, 2008 ONCA 1 (CanLII), [2008] O.J. No. 1 (C.A.).[24.]In addition to the views of appellate courts, Parliament has recognized domestic abuse as an aggravating factor on sentence through s. 718.2(a)(ii) of the Criminal Code.[25.]In Boucher, above, the Ontario Court of Appeal further held at paragraph 23 and 24 that…in the context of an attempted murder, the absence of physical injuries is a function of chance and does not necessarily justify a significant reduction in the range of sentence that is otherwise appropriate. As noted by Lamer C.J. in R. v. Logan, 1990 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 731, \"[T]he attempted murderer is no less a killer than a murderer: he may be lucky ... but he still has the same killer instinct.\" The Chief Justice also remarked that, \"while a conviction for attempted murder does not automatically result in a life sentence, the offence is punishable by life and the usual penalty is very severe\"…. Further, where an attempted murder is committed in the context of a domestic relationship, the likelihood of lasting psychological trauma to the victim arising from the irrational and obsessive nature of the misconduct is significant and, where present, justifies the imposition of a substantial penalty separate and apart from the issue of protection.(emphasis added)[26.]Although Boucher was an attempted murder case, the principles referred to apply equally to all domestic violence cases:R. v. Kopriva, 2008 ONCA 54 (CanLII), [2008] O.J. No. 233 (C.A.)[27.]I have reviewed the cases provided by counsel including R. v. Benjamin, [2008] O.J. No. 3330 (C.A.) and R. v. Rahaman, 2008 ONCA 1 (CanLII), [2008] O.J. No. 1 (C.A.).I have also considered the following cases on the topic of sentencing in domestic violence cases:R. v. Markotic, [2007] O.J. No. 860 (O.C.J.); R. v. Rooplall, [2008] O.J. No. 3514;R. v. Murray, [2008] O.J. No. 5473 (O.C.J.); R. v. Harding, [2009] O.J. No. 682 (S.C.J.); R. v. Harry, [2009] O.J. No. 5765 (O.C.J.);R. v. Meade, [2010] O.J. No. 319 (O.C.J.); R. v. M.I., [2010] O.J. No. 556 (O.C.J.); R. v. Galapate, [2010] O.J. No. 4917 (O.C.J.).There are many, many other cases to which reference may be made.All the cases stand for the need of courts to balance all the relevant principles of sentencing on a case by case basis.[28.]In this case, the facts are extremely serious.They involve out of control behaviour by the offender who (a) would not let the victim escape the car when she had the chance; (b) threatened to run her over; (c) drove recklessly in a rage while expressing that he didn’t care if they both died; and (d) held a meat cleaver to the victim’s throat and made more threats to kill her.[29.]Mr. Dang persistently terrorized Ms. Nguyen for a significant period of time both within a motor vehicle and within her own home.She was brutally attacked both psychologically and physically.While these offences appear to be spontaneous and unplanned, the potential of imminent death or grievous bodily harm was real and palpable on these facts.It is unclear whether it was fate, luck or something else that stayed Mr. Dang’s hand.Ms. Nguyen is fortunate not to have been wounded or worse.[30.]There is no Victim Impact Statement.However, one need only apply common sense to appreciate that what Ms. Nguyen experienced was harrowing and literally life-threatening.Ms. Nguyen has expressed through the pre-sentence report that she continues to fear Mr. Dang.[31.]Following the submissions made by counsel, I expressed my concern about the propriety of a sentence that involved custody limited to the intermittent range and invited further submissions on this concern.Both counsel accepted this invitation and made further submissions, both orally and in writing, to support their sentencing positions.Those submissions have not allayed my concerns given the entire circumstances of these offences and this offender.[32.]Since this is not a case involving a joint submission, I am not bound by either the lower or upper limits of the submissions put forward by both counsel.In determining the appropriate sentence in this case, I take into account all of the relevant sentencing principles as well as the presence of both mitigating and aggravating factors.[33.]The mitigating factors in this case include:a)Pleas of guilty prior to setting of a trial date;b)A generally favourable pre-sentence report;c)Willingness to participate in court-ordered rehabilitation;d)Mr. Dang is a first-time offender; ande)Mr. Dang is employed full-time as a cook.[34.]The aggravating factors include:a)Diminution of his acceptance of remorse as indicated at page 5 of the pre-sentence report wherein the offender “tended to shift the blame onto the victim” by alleging provocation;b)Very serious facts involving the expression of rage and terror over a significant period of time;c)Significant threats of death;d)The application of a meat cleaver to the neck of the victim.Although no physical injury was inflicted, such a utensil - by its design - is intended to hack through flesh and bone;e)The offences were committed in the context of an intimate relationship; andf)The victim has expressed ongoing fear of the offender.[35.]Balancing the mitigating and aggravating factors against the circumstances of the offence, the circumstances of the offender and both the common law and statutory principles of sentencing, I find that a sentence in the intermittent range does not adequately address the gravity of the offences, the role of Mr. Dang in committing those offences, nor the need to deter and denounce such heinous behaviour.[36.]In my view, the desire to permit Mr. Dang to continue working must be trumped by society’s need to be protected from such crimes being committed, and to hold him suitably accountable for his actions.A sentence in the intermittent range, in these particular circumstances, trivializes the gravity of the offences and Mr. Dang’s role in them notwithstanding his expressions of remorse and willingness to participate in rehabilitation.Each one of these crimes is punishable by a maximum of ten years.[37.]In the case before me, I find that a fit global range of sentence is between six and ten months followed by probation.Giving maximum credit to Mr. Dang for his guilty pleas and their timing, the sentence on Count #1 (Forcible Confinement) and concurrent on Count #4 (Assault with a Weapon) is as follows:a)In addition to pre-trial custody credit of 12 days, 5 ½ months common jail;b)Following the custodial portion of the sentence, probation for two years upon conditions I will outline after completing these Reasons for Sentence;c)In-Custody Primary DNA Order; andd)S.109 Firearms Prohibition.Released:Wednesday, December 8, 2010_____________________________________Richard H.K.

No.190 (P.C.) and R. v. Wauer, 2014 ABCA 270 (CanLII).STATUTES CONSIDERED: The Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985.JUDGMENT OF GORMAN, P.C. J.(SENTENCE)INTRODUCTION:[1]Mr. Hancock had an argument with his friend and neighbor (Mr. Kevin Gifford) over a set of lost keys. While inside Mr. Hancock’s residence, Mr. Gifford challenged Mr. Hancock to a fight.On the way out of his residence, Mr. Hancock picked up a metal pipe.Once outside, Mr. Hancock attempted to poke Mr. Gifford with the pipe, but Mr. Gifford grabbed the pipe and both gentlemen fell on to the ground.[2]After a trial (see [2015] N.J. No. 66 (P.C.)), I concluded that Mr. Hancock’s attempt to poke Mr. Gifford with the pipe constituted the offence of assault with a weapon, contrary to section 267(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada, R.S.C. 1985.[3]The sole issue remaining is the determination of an appropriate sentence for the offence committed by Mr. Hancock.For the reasons that will follow, I have concluded that this is an appropriate case for sentence to be suspended and for Mr. Hancock to be placed on probation for a period of twelve months. Let me explain my reasons for this conclusion by commencing with a review of the circumstances of the offence committed by Mr. Hancock.THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENCE[4]The evidence presented at the trial established that Mr. Gifford lives across the street from Mr. Hancock in Deer Lake.Mr. Gifford was a regular visitor to Mr. Hancock’s residence.[5]On December 9, 2013, Mr. Gifford came over to Mr. Hancock’s residence and they went to the storage room to have a cigarette. An argument ensued over the whereabouts of Mr. Hancock’s keys. Mr. Hancock asked Mr. Gifford to leave on several occasions.Eventually Mr. Gifford left Mr. Hancock’s residence, but before he did so he challenged Mr. Hancock to a fight.Mr. Hancock agreed to fight and on the way out of his residence, he picked up a metal pipe.[6]Mr. Hancock testified at the trial that outside his residence he attempted to “poke” Mr. Gifford with the metal pipe, but that Mr. Gifford grabbed his wrist and they fell to the ground where a struggle ensued.Mr. Hancock denied hitting Mr. Gifford with the pipe.[7]In convicting Mr. Hancock of the offence of assault with a weapon, I reached the following conclusions (at paragraphs 89 to 92):Thus, I conclude that Mr. Gifford and Mr. Hancock agreed to fight, but that this consent by Mr. Gifford did not extend to the use of a metal pipe by Mr. Hancock.The use of a weapon was solely Mr. Hancock’s idea.The evidence establishes that Mr. Hancock attempted to “poke” Mr. Gifford with the metal pipe.I am satisfied that this constitutes an assault pursuant to section 265(1)(b) of the Criminal Code because this constituted a threat to apply force and Mr. Hancock had the present ability to do so.An assault committed pursuant to section 265(1)(b) of the Criminal Code does not require the application of force (see R. v. Foti (2002), 2002 MBCA 122 (CanLII), 7 C.R. (6th) 161 (Man. C.A.)).While committing this assault, Mr. Hancock carried and used a weapon, contrary to section 267(a) of the Criminal Code.Thus, the Crown has proven that Mr. Hancock committed the offence with which he is charged.The evidence establishes that once Mr. Hancock made this gesture, Mr. Gifford grabbed the pipe and the struggle described earlier ensued.As stated earlier, I am not satisfied that the evidence presented establishes that during this struggle Mr. Hancock intentionally stuck Mr. Gifford with the pipe. The Crown has failed to establish that during this struggle Mr. Hancock’s application of force to Mr. Gifford was not for the purpose of defending himself or that it was not reasonable.Once the struggle ensued it was reasonable for Mr. Hancock to defend himself and his actions, at this stage, were reasonable.[8]In R. v. Lundrigan, 2012 NLCA 43 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal indicated that a “fit sentence” is one “that takes account of the circumstances of the offences and the offender.”THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENDER[9]Mr. Hancock is fifty-three years of age.He is married and his wife is presently in hospital.When she is released, Mr. Hancock will be her primary health provider.[10]Mr. Hancock’s source of income is a disability pension.[11]Mr. Hancock has prior convictions.His criminal record extends over the time period of 1986 to January 11, 2000.In 1989, he was convicted of the offence of assault.THE PRINCIPLES OF SENTENCING[12]In R. v. Knott, 2012 SCC 42 (CanLII), it was held that \"the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code are meant to take into account the correctional imperative of sentence individualization.\"[13]In R. v. Berner, 2013 BCCA 188 (CanLII), the British Columbia Court of Appeal indicated that the “purpose of sentencing is to protect the public through sanctions a court imposes upon a person found guilty of committing an offence. Each codified objective of sentencing is designed to further the protection of the community.”[14]Section 718 of the Criminal Code states that the fundamental purpose of sentencing \"is to contribute...to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful, and safe society.\"This is to be achieved by imposing sentences which have, among other objectives, the objectives of:-separating offenders from society, where necessary;-denouncing unlawful conduct;-general deterrence;-rehabilitation; and-the promoting of a \"sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgement of the harm done to victims and the community.\"[15]Section 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code states that \"a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.\"[16]Section 718.1 of the Criminal Code states that any sentence imposed must be \"proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\"In R. v. Cluney, 2013 NLCA 46 (CanLII), the Court of Appeal, at paragraph 16, indicated that the “principle of proportionality applies to sentencing for all criminal offences…The appropriate range of sentence is related to the gravity of the offence and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.”[17]Section 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code indicates that a \"sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender.\" In R. v. Briand, 2010 NLCA 67 (CanLII), [2010] N.J. No. 339 (C.A.), the Court of Appeal stressed the importance of considering an offender's personal circumstances in applying section 718.2(a) of the Criminal Code.[18]Section 718.2(d) states that \"an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances\" and section 718.2(e) states that \"all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.\"[19]In Berner, the British Columbia Court of Appeal noted that broadly “speaking, a sentencing judge looks to the conduct and culpability of the offender and punishes the offender for that conduct through the application of the principles and objectives of deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation and proportionality.”THE STATUTORY REGIME[20]The Crown proceeded by way of summary conviction. The maximum penalty which can be imposed for the offence of assault with a weapon, proceeded with by way of summary conviction, is a period of eighteen months imprisonment.THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIESTHE CROWN:[21]The Crown sought the imposition of a period of thirty days imprisonment followed by a period of probation.The Crown had no objection to any period of imprisonment imposed being served in the community.The Crown also sought a DNA order and a section 110 Criminal Code weapon/ammunition prohibition.MR. HANCOCK:[22]Mr. Hancock sought a non-custodial sentence.He submitted that a suspended sentence with a period of probation would be an appropriate sentence.THE RANGE OF SENTENCE[23]In R. v. Oake, 2010 NLCA 19 (CanLII), [2010] N.J. No. 94, the Court of Appeal indicated that a judge has a duty \"to impose sentences in line with precedent, noting always that for each offence and each offender some elements are unique.\"In Cluney, the Court of Appeal indicated that while sentencing ranges “are merely guidelines rather than hard and fast rules, a judge ordering a sentence outside the regular range should explain how it is in accordance with the principles and objectives of sentencing.”SENTENCING PRECEDENTS[24]In R. v. Wheeler, [2011] N.J. No. 391 (P.C.), I had the opportunity to consider a number of sentencing precedents involving the offence of assault with a weapon.I concluded that these “sentencing precedents suggest a range which extends from a suspended sentence with probation (though in that case the offender had spent 10 months in pre-sentence custody) to 2 years imprisonment.”[25]In R. v. Thornhill, [2014] N.J. No.190 (P.C.), the accused pleaded guilty to the offence of assault with a weapon.The trial judge described the circumstances in the following manner:On February 16, 2014, the parties were at the Legion in Fortune. An unidentified man had passed out in his chair. A number of members of the complainant’s party took photographs of the unconscious man, some posing with him, in a practice described by Crown counsel as “photo bombing”.The accused took offence at this behavior, and approached the group, asking them if they thought what they were doing was funny. The complainant replied that it was not just funny, but that it was “hilarious”.The accused responded by picking up a beer bottle and striking the complainant in the face with it. The complainant went to the floor, following which the accused kicked him.As a result of being struck with the bottle, the complainant had lacerations which required sutures. Specifically, he had five stitches to the area of his left eye, six stitches to his upper lip, and three stitches inside his lip.[26]Judge Porter imposed a period of ninety days imprisonment to be served on an intermittent basis.[27] In R. v. Brushett, [2015] N.J. No. 32 (P.C.), the accused was convicted of the offence of assault with a weapon. The trial judge described the circumstances involved in the following manner:The reasons for convicting the accused of assault with a weapon, contrary to s. 267(a) of the Criminal Code have been reported, at R. v. Brushett, 2014 CanLII 64745 (NL PC). In brief, while on a crowded dance floor, the accused was pushed from behind by some other person than the victim. The accused responded by swinging her arm back behind her, without having checked to see who was behind her. At the time, the victim was crossing the dance floor. The accused had a beer bottle in her hand. She struck the victim with the beer bottle, causing an injury which required sutures inside and outside her mouth, and which may require cosmetic surgery in the future. The accused immediately apologized to the victim.[28]The accused was twenty years of age and had no prior convictions.Judge Porter suspended sentence and placed the accused on probation for a period of twelve months.[29]In R. v. Hillier, 2015 NLPC 0815A00033, the offender was convicted of the offence of assault with a weapon and a number of other offences.The assault with a weapon offence involved the offender striking the victim on the head with a tire iron.Judge Porter imposed a period of six months imprisonment.ANALYSIS[30]Mr. Hancock should not have picked up the metal pipe.He turned an argument into a situation where someone could have been seriously harmed. However, Mr. Hancock did not use the weapon except to attempt to poke Mr. Gifford with it.[31]Mr. Hancock has a criminal record, but it is dated and primarily unrelated to his present offence.[32]The Criminal Code requires that I consider whether there are any reasonable options to a period of imprisonment being imposed.In determining whether to impose a conditional period of imprisonment the same analysis must be applied.A conditional sentence is a period of imprisonment and can only be imposed if a non-custodial sentence is unreasonable.It is important not to confuse the imposition of a conditional sentence with a period of probation.They are separate and distinct forms of sentence.As pointed out by the Alberta Court of Appeal in R. v. Scott, 2015 ABCA 99 (CanLII), at paragraph 35, “it is clear that Parliament intended a conditional sentence to be more punitive than a suspended sentence with probation, notwithstanding the similarities between the two sanctions in respect of their rehabilitative purposes.”[33]In this case, though Mr. Hancock introduced a level of dangerousness to the argument which was unnecessary, he did not strike Mr. Hancock with the weapon he possessed.Considering the circumstances of the offence and the offender, I am satisfied that there is a reasonable alternative to the imposition of a custodial sentence.[34]I conclude that this is an appropriate case for sentence to be suspended and for Mr. Hancock to be placed on probation for a period of twelve months.THE TERMS OF THE PROBATION ORDER[35]In addition to the statutory conditions which apply, Mr. Hancock must:-report to a probation officer in person as required;-comply with all directions received from his probation officer;-attend all counseling or treatment sessions arranged by his probation officer; and-refrain from having any contact or communication with Mr. Kevin Gifford.A VICTIM SURCHARGE[36]Mr. Hancock must pay a victim surcharge in the amount of $100.00 to the Provincial Court within thirty days of today’s date.A DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID ORDER[37]Section 267(a) of the Criminal Code is a \"primary designated offence.\" Therefore, section 487.051(2) of the Criminal Code applies.It indicates that the Court shall issue a DNA order unless the offender establishes that the \"impact of such an order on their privacy and security of the person would be grossly disproportionate to the public interest.\"Mr. Hancock has failed to do so and thus a DNA order will issue.A WEAPON/AMMUNITION PROHIBITION[38]Section 110 of the Criminal Code allows for a weapon/ammunition prohibition to be issued if the offender has committed an offence “in the commission of which violence against a person was used, threatened or attempted.”The provision requires that the sentencing judge be satisfied that \"it is desirable, in the interests of the safety of the person or of any other person, to make an order.\"[39]R. v. Wauer, 2014 ABCA 270 (CanLII), the Alberta Court of Appeal indicated that the principles of sentencing \"such as proportionality, apply to weapons prohibition orders\" and that as a result, a sentencing judge must \"tailor a section 110 order to the circumstances of the offence and the offender.\"[40]In the circumstances of this case, considering the use of a weapon by Mr. Hancock and his prior conviction for the offence of assault, I am satisfied that a section 110 Criminal Code prohibition should be issued.I conclude that it should be in force for a period of five years and include all of the items listed in section 110(1) of the Criminal Code.CONCLUSION[41]For the reasons provided, sentence is suspended and Mr. Hancock is placed on probation for a period of twelve months.[42]Judgment accordingly."}

No. 130922NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEALClarke, Hart and Matthews, JJ.A.BETWEEN:ARNOLD EDWARD SOMERSAppellant- and -HER MAJESTY THE QUEENRespondentthe appellant appeared in personDana W. Giovannetti for the RespondentAppeal Heard:January 21, 1997Judgment Delivered:January 21, 1997THE COURT:Appeal dismissed per oral reasons for judgment of Matthews, J.A.; Clarke, C.J.N.S. and Hart, J.A. concurring.The reasons for judgment of the Court were delivered orally by:MATTHEWS, J.A.:The appellant, Arnold Edward Somers, was charged that on January 11, 1996 he broke and entered the Future Stop Store situate at 484 Grand Lake Road in the County of Cape Breton and therein committed the indictable offence of theft contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.He initially pled not guilty, but on January 24, 1996, before a judge of the Provincial Court, his then counsel informed the trial judge that the plea was to be changed to guilty. In answer to a question by the trial judge as to whether he wished to change his plea, he responded in the affirmative.Although he appeared with counsel at trial, before this Court, he appeared on his own behalf.His grounds of appeal are:This is my first conviction under section 348(1)(b) C.C. I pleaded guilty as I was with Mr. Simon Fitzgerald when the offence occurred. I also did not want to put the courts through a lengthy and costly trial. When Mr. Fitzgerald picked me up that evening I was not aware of his intentions, even after we began walking. I now wish to draw the Court's attention to the fact I have very limited eyesight, in fact I have been diagnosed as being legally blind. Due to my blindness there is no possible way I could have assisted Mr. Fitzgerald in committing the offence and for this reason alone I feel the 22 month sentence was too severe. I trust you will consider my appeal on the above grounds.This is an appeal from the sentence of 22 months imposed by the trial judge.Unfortunately the pre-sentence report is far from positive. In addition, the appellant, aged 40, has fourteen prior convictions, many of them theft related. He has a marked problem with drugs and in particular alcohol. He was under the influence of alcohol when the offence was committed. His co-accused, with a lengthier record, received a sentence of three years. The appellant was on remand for approximately two months and on probation at the time of this charge. The Crown at sentencing recommended a sentence \"in the range of two years\", while appellant's counsel asserted a sentence \"in the range of a year or under\". Much the same submissions by counsel at sentencing were placed before us.After reading all of the material placed before us and hearing the appellant it is our unanimous opinion that the appeal is dismissed. The sentence is within the acceptable range of sentences for like offences, taking into consideration the circumstances of both the offences and this offender. It is not manifestly excessive, clearly unreasonable or demonstrably unfit.Matthews, J.A.Concurred in:Clarke, C.J.N.S.Hart, J.A.CANADAPROVINCE OF NOVA SCOTIA1996606919IN THE NOVA SCOTIA COURT OF APPEALon appeal fromTHE PROVINCIAL COURTHER MAJESTY THE QUEEN- versus -ARNOLD SOMERSHEARD BEFORE:THE HONOURABLE JUDGE D.L.

Kerr of the Ontario Court of Justice dated February 24, 2005 and sentence imposed June 28, 2005.E N D O R S E M E N T[1]The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in his treatment of the identification evidence by focusing solely on thehonesty of the witnesses and that in any event the sexual assaultconviction was unreasonable.[2]This case did not turn on the reliability of the identification. This was one continuous transaction and the complainant’s subsequent conversation with the appellant was inconsistent with the appellant not having been involved in the earlier sexual assault.[3]We are satisfied that the trial judge did not err in his appreciation of the identification evidence. The verdict was not unreasonable.[4]We are also satisfied that the trial judge did not err in refusing to direct averdict of acquittal on the concealed weapon charge. There was evidence that the complainants were wary of both assailants and did not see any weapon. In those circumstances there was some evidence of concealment.[5]Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.[6]As to sentence, the Crown concedes that the trial judge erred in applying s. 39(1)(d) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c. 1. In fairness to the trial judge, he did not have the benefit of this court’s decision in R. v. R.E.W., 2006 CanLII 1761 (ON CA), [2006] O.J. No. 265. In our view, given the time already spent in custody, the almost two years of house arrest, and the community service performed by the appellant, the appropriate disposition at this point is time served. We also see no benefit for a probation order.[7]Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is allowed and sentence is reduced to time served. The probation order is struck out.Signed:“M. Rosenberg J.A.”“S. Borins J.A.”“S. Lang J.A.”"}

Alexander, for the appellantRoger A. Pinnock, for the respondentHeard: In WritingOn appeal from the sentence imposed on May 2, 2011 by Justice David W. Salmers of the Superior Court of Justice.ENDORSEMENT[1]Following his conviction on a charge of fraud over $5,000, on May 2, 2011, the appellant was sentenced to 26 months’ imprisonment less credit of two months and one day for pre-sentence custody, resulting in a net sentence of imprisonment of two years less one day[1].[2]On December 13, 2011 we allowed the appellant’s sentence appeal and granted him 202 days additional credit for pre-sentence custody.[3]The appellant now applies to re-open his sentence appeal and to introduce fresh evidence on appeal concerning the immigration consequences of his sentence.[4]In all the circumstances of this case, we agree that the appellant’s sentence appeal should be re-opened, that fresh evidence should be admitted and that the appellant’s sentence should be further reduced. We reach these conclusions for the following reasons.[5]First, a sentence appeal may be re-opened where, at the original appeal hearing, the court “did not have the information needed to fully and properly adjudicate the issue of sentence on the merits”: R. v. De la Cruz, [2003] O.J. No. 3235 (C.A.), at para. 4.[6]Second, the appellant’s fresh evidence demonstrates that he was unaware when he was sentenced and at the time of his original appeal that, because he was sentenced to a sentence of imprisonment of two years or more, he would have no right to appeal a deportation order made against him. In the result, he did not bring this factor to the attention of the sentencing judge or this court.[7]Third, “the certainty of deportation” is a factor that can be considered in determining the appropriate sentence in a particular case: R. v. B.R.C., [2010] O.J. No. 3571 (C.A.) at para. 8; R. v. Hamilton (2004), 2004 CanLII 5549 (ON CA), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at para. 156.[8]Fourth, the appellant’s personal circumstances make the impact of his potential deportation a particularly compelling factor in assessing a fit sentence. The appellant is now 45 years old and has lived in Canada since he was 18. He has been in a long term relationship with a Canadian citizen, has a young child who is a Canadian citizen and has close connections to family in the Greater Toronto area. In contrast, he has no family, friends, contacts, employment or housing prospects in his homeland, Jamaica. Moreover, he has served the full sentence that was originally imposed.[9]Fifth, Crown counsel at trial took the position that a fit sentence fell within the range of two to three years’ imprisonment. In that context, a gross sentence of two years less a day imprisonment cannot be seen as unfit.[10]Sixth, while the gross sentence of 26 months’ imprisonment imposed by the trial judge was not unfit, it was imposed – and upheld – without all the information necessary to impose an appropriate sentence on the merits.[11]In all the circumstances, the appellant’s request to re-open his sentence appeal is granted, fresh evidence is admitted and leave to appeal sentence is granted. The sentence appeal is allowed, the sentence of 26 months’ imprisonment is set aside, and a sentence of two years less a day imprisonment is imposed less credit for two months and 203 days presentence custody. All other terms of the original sentence remain the same.“Alexandra Hoy A.C.J.O.”“Janet Simmons”“R.A. Blair”[1] The appellant was also ordered to make restitution in the amount of $63,396.30."}

ROBERT LEE NOWLANBefore :Judge Alfred H. BrienAt:Saint John, N.B.On:May 10, 2002.Appearances:Crown:C. McNallyDefence:A. Hayes___________________________________________________________REASONS ON SENTENCE___________________________________________________________THE COURT:[1]Well, for the record, Mr. Nowlan is being sentenced with respect to two counts under section 253(b) in which the Crown proceeded by way of indictment and one count under section 259(4)(a),Crown proceeded by way of indictment and one count under section 259(4)(b), which is a summary conviction matter.The incidents from which the offences arise are on two separate occasions, one is September the 9th, 2001 and one is on February the 25th, 2002.[2]This is a case that raises the issue of appropriate sentence for a person who has previously been convicted of drinking and driving charges and who has demonstrated a consistent and repeated propensity to re-offend, that is, that he consistently drives while impaired and since March 29th, 1999, appears to have a propensity to drive while prohibited.[3]Both counsel have, on this date and previous dates, outlined the factors which they consider that the court should consider in imposing sentence.I think the underlying principle of sentence here is deterrence.The case law reflects that.Obviously the graduation of penalties, as provided for in the Code, with increasing severity being attached to the continued repetition of the offence, indicates orcommunicates a message to those who repeat.[4]Obviously the Court does not have to reiterate the danger that people present who get behind the wheel of a car and they have had too much to drink There is also real concern when those persons, as part of their previous sentences, are prohibited from driving and that they continue to drive notwithstanding the prohibitions.[5]The aggravating factors are the ones which I'll deal with first.As noted, these offences present a real danger to public safety. As noted, the Crown proceeded by way of indictment on three of them. The Parliament of Canada has indicated that for those offences for which the Crown proceeded by way of indictment such carry a maximum penalty of five years.[6]With respect to the circumstances, I do note from the facts related by the crown and accepted by the defence, as far as the first instances in September 9th, 2001, that the accused was observed as a result of his driving manner and that this was weaving on the highway and taking a wide turn.It was at around ten o'clock at night.It was a Sunday night.It was in uptown Saint John area.His reading was two hundred and twenty, which is almost three times the legal limit and at the time he was a prohibited driver.[7]With respect to the second incident on February 25th, 2002, this was one day before his court appearance on the first matter, which was scheduled for February the 26th.Attention was drawn to him as a result of his driving manner, swaying on the highway.It came as a result of a civilian complaint.It was around six fifteen in the evening.It was in the town of Grand Bay.His reading was almost two times that which is permitted.Again he was a prohibited driver and, as noted, he was waiting trial on the first offence.[8]It does not take much from looking at those circumstances to understand how Mr. Nowlan presented himself as a real danger, a real menace to the public.While there was no actual physical harm in the form of injuries and damage, and no police chase, it would not appear that it was for no lack of effort on Mr. Nowlan's part.This is so when one considers the circumstances under which these offences were committed, particularly with respect to the high readings and the areas in which Mr. Nowlan was operating his vehicle.Those areas were not rural areas, they were urban areas where there is a higher concentration of persons using the roads.As observed by the Crown these readings would indicate a significant degree of intoxication.Parliament has specifically directed Courts to consider a reading above a hundred and sixty to be an aggravating factor.[9]Also very obvious as an aggravating factor is the criminal record of the accused.He has five prior related offences:(a)in 1989, an entry for breathalyzer refusal for which he received a fine of eight hundred dollars, three months probation and prohibited from driving for three months.That was in Saint John.(b)in Newcastle, New Brunswick, there was a breathalyzer refusal in October 29th, 1990, for which he received fourteen days in jail.He was permitted to serve that intermittently.He also received a fine and was prohibited from driving for six months.(c)October the 6th, 1993, in Dalhousie, New Brunswick, breathalyzer refusal, received a sentence of ninety days in jail, he was permitted to serve that intermittently and he was prohibited from driving for one year.March 29th, 1999, in the Miramichi, charged with driving while “over .08”.He received a conditional discharge, one year probation under what would appear to be curative treatment provisions of the Criminal Code.(d)Then in December the 15th, 1999, within the same year of receiving a conditional discharge, he was convicted of driving with over .08.He received five months in jail, prohibited from driving for four years and on a charge under section 259(4)(b), driving while prohibited, he received a sentence of one month in jail consecutive.[10]So in essence we have an individual who has committed these offences in various cities and towns in the province of New Brunswick.It would appear evident, from the sentences which have been imposed, that the full range of the sentencing options has been considered with progressively longer periods of jail except for the imposition of the exceptional remedy of curative treatment under section 255(5).[11]It would appear when one considers the offences of September the 9th, 2001 and February the 25th, 2002, that the prior sentences have done nothing to effectively deter Mr. Nowlan.He has a propensity to continue to demonstrate, not only to the Court but to the public in large, that he has abandoned any concern for anyone else using the highways.He is going to persist in his behaviour and he's not prepared to follow court orders and there appears to be little likelihood of successful rehabilitation through any alcoholic treatment program.[12]With respect to the latter, and noted also as an aggravating factor by the Court, is his attitude.The Pre-Sentence Report indicates that he has little insight to his problem and very little insight to the danger he poses.This is evident from his repeated offences, the fact that he does not believe he is an alcoholic, this statement despite having received successfully a curative treatment application wherein he must have convinced a Court at some point in time that he had a severe alcohol problem.[13]It's also evident from the Pre-Sentence Report and from his actions that he is more interested in his own self.This is evident from the reason that he gave for why he was driving on these particular dates in question, his indication of frustration with being inconvenienced as a result of being charged and convicted of these offences, inconvenience from being unable to work.It's also demonstrated by his appearance in Court on February 26th, still in what would appear to be an intoxicated state as endorsed and noted by the sitting judge, this being the date that he was to appear in Court on the first matter dealing with the offences of September the 9th for which he was intercepted and arrested on February the 25th.It gives an indication of the degree of intoxication which obviously had carried through until the next morning.So in essence, we have Mr. Nowlan on his way to Court in an intoxicated state and that was the condition in which he was at his appearance.[14]Mr. Nowlan presents as someone who feels at this juncture he does not need any assistance for alcohol abuse, but then would state to a probation officer that he would be prepared to take it if he could avoid going to jail.That clearly distinguishes Mr. Nowlan from those individuals who are still grappling with their problem and are sincere in their efforts or determination.This presents as an individual with very shallow knowledge or insight and prepared simply to avoid consequences of his own action by indicating that he would proceed in an alternate manner if it would look good.[15]With respect to the mitigating factors, Mr. Hayes has pointed those out on previous occasions and again both counsels have addressed them this morning and they are evident.First of all Mr. Nowlan has pled guilty but as counsel has noted it was not at the first opportunity with respect to the first offences. In fact, as noted, Mr. Nowlan committed the second set of offences while awaiting trial on the first set of offences.So in essence, by his plea of not guilty, which he had the right to enter and which is respected, he was allowed to continue to operate a motor vehicle to the extent that the right was still there and he had his freedom.16]The Pre-Sentence Report does indicate an individual who has a good work ethic and is stable financially.He is a fifty year old male with no dependents who obviously has been able to demonstrate over the years that despite whatever other problems he got into with respect to alcohol that he was able to maintain employment.[17]With respect to custody, that is, the time that he has been on remand, by my estimation it comes to approximately two months and ten days and credit will be given for such.However, the Court would have to consider that he was given his freedom after the first set of offences, but by reason of showing up intoxicated on the date — on the Court date for thesecond set of offences, a bail hearing was held and his liberty was restricted.Such is to distinguish it from the situations where individuals are in pre-trial custody from the initial set of events bringing them to Court.[18]Both counsel forwarded to the Court and the Court, at this juncture, wishes to indicate its appreciation to them, cases which they ask the Court to consider.As noted by Ms. McNally there appears to be a almost a full range of sentences when one considers the various dispositions made in cases across Canada.I just simply wish to utilize the cases which counsel have submitted and perhaps give an indication of what range they represent.[19]The first case, which I am going to refer to, isR. v. Bohaychuk [1997] A.J. No. 1112, a decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal.This was a sentence of a fifty year old male who had several prior convictions for related offences.He was charged with ten counts which included offences from two separate incidents. They included impaired driving and the two incidents were approximately ten months apart.The accused in that case pled guilty.He had been in custody prior to trial for three months.It was noted that he had two prior curative discharges.He received a global sentence of five years for the incidents arising from the two separate incidents, the longest term of which was two years for each of the impaired driving charges on the two separate incidents.This was appealed to the Alberta Court of Appeal who upheld the trial judge's global sentence.[20]The second case, again which perhaps would appear at the higher end of the range, is R. v. Bear 1994 CanLII 4609 (SK CA), 1994, 120 Saskatchewan Reports 294, (Saskatchewan Court of Appeal).The accused was being sentenced for a charge of breathalyzer refusal and driving while prohibited.In this particular instance the trial judge imposed sentences which were being appealed.It was a forty-nine year old who had twenty-seven related offences for drinking and driving or driving while prohibited.The Court of Appeal increased the sentence which had originally been given of six months for the breathalyzer refusal and three months for the driving while prohibited, to three and a half years with respect to the breathalyzer refusal and two years concurrent for the driving while prohibited.The Court of Appeal also imposed a three year prohibition from driving for each charge for a total of six years.[21]What I found particularly interesting in the Bear case and I would refer to it, was a quote as follows:\"In cases such as this, where it is clear neither general deterrence nor specific deterrence had any impact on the accused, and where it is clear rehabilitation is a faint possibility, how may protection of the public be achieved?If one accepts the fundamental goal of sentencing is the protection of society, the most direct method of achieving that goal, assuming protection of society cannot be achieved by rehabilitation or reformation, is incarceration.Persons like Mr. Bear are the persons law abiding users of the highways have the right to be protected from.There is but one way to protect the public from such people thereby incapacitating the offender by imposing a custodial sentence.\"[22]The next case to which I wish to make reference is R. v. Eashappie, also of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal (1994), 1994 CanLII 4624 (SK CA), 120 Saskatchewan Reports 161.In that particular case the Court was dealing with a charge of impaired driving causing bodily harm, which is not the offence for which Mr. Nowlan is being sentenced here today.But there are two observations made by that Court which I think have application in this particular instance.In paragraph 7 the Court says:\"The question is what to be done with an offender such as this [referring to repeated drinking and driving charges].Every rehabilitative measure open to the courts and virtually every form of deterrence has been tried, yet he continues to offend.And the consequences are tragic.Nothing seems to have worked.\"[23]Later at paragraph 8 the Court observes:\"There are many people in the community, people given to compassion and understanding and to careful thought and balanced judgment, who would suggest that the time has come to simply disable this man from driving for such period of time as the law will permit.Society must be protected from him.And since he pays no attention to orders prohibiting him from driving, the only thing to do is to imprison him for as long as the law allows.Who could sensibly contend against that, and on what ground?And who now would put concern for this person ahead of concern for others, not so much for those who have already suffered at his hands — that is done — but those [who] are apt again to do so?\"[24]In R. v. Remillard [1998] Alberta Judgments No. 701, (Alberta Provincial Court) a fifty-five year old male who was described as a professional painter, fully employed with four prior convictions for similar offences was being sentenced with respect to impaired driving under section 253(a) and driving with ‘over .08’ under section 253(b).This was a result of two separate incidents and these occurred months apart from each other.Mr. Remillard had spent twenty-four, sorry, thirty-four days in remand, he had expressed remorse and it was noted by the Court that the offences in both incidences were committed while he was prohibited from driving.He was sentenced to fines totaling seventy-five hundred and ninety dollars for driving while disqualified, six months for the charge under section 253(a) and twelve months consecutive for the second offence related thereto under section 253(b).There were other charges.The total incarceration period was twenty months.The court imposed a driving prohibition of three years in both of the two incidents for a total of six years.[25]The Court in R. v. Remillard reviewed many decisions across Canada and I accept the review of — by that judge as to drinking and driving precedents.Generally they ranged around two years, some with penitentiary, some without.I'm just going to refer to four that are within that range.R. v. Ermineskin, Alberta Supreme Court, 1991, R. v. Wells, Newfoundland Court of Appeal, 1997, R. v. Smallboy, 1996, Alberta and R. v. McDonald, Manitoba Court.[26]The last decision that I'm going to deal with as submitted by the Crown is R. v. Hanna 1995 O.J. 2122, the Ontario Provincial Court.That Court dealt with an individual that had nine prior convictions for related offences under the drinking and driving provisions.[27]What is significant about R. v. Hanna is that there was a joint recommendation from Crown and Defence for the imposition of a sentence of one year.The Court imposed a sentence totaling fifteen and a half months, apportioning it as twelve months for the charge under section 253(b) and three and a half months consecutive for the charge under section 259(4).In Hanna is the observation made by the judge that but for the guilty pleas and the positive,all be belated, indication that the accused was seeking treatment, the Court would have imposed an overall sentence of twenty-four months apportioned as eighteen months for the charge under section 253(b) and six months for the charge under section 259(4).[28]In R. v. Hanna the Court prohibited the driving provisions for three years in each and that would be consecutive.[29]The accused presented to the Court a number of cases as well and I wish to deal with a couple of those, in particular R. v. Lynch cited by Mr. Hayes this morning as well.This is a decision of the New Brunswick Court of Queen's Bench cited at 2000 N.B.J. No. 100.This was a thirty-one year old male who had four previous convictions for similar offences so that he was being sentenced for what would be his fifth conviction under section 253(b) as well as an offence under section 249(1), dangerous driving.[30]What was particularly noted in this case was that while being sentenced for his fifth conviction, one of the four previous convictions had been committed after this conviction.The Court imposed a sentence after rejecting an application for curative treatment under section 255(5).[31]Significant in R. v. Lynch is the fact that Lynch had shown a desire to seek treatment.It was observed by the trial judge, that he had demonstrated that he was able to follow Court orders, that he had steady employment, that he was, while not cooperative at the time of his arrest, obviously before sentencing, had indicated a measure of acceptance of responsibility and cooperation in wanting to undergo treatment for his alcohol problem.The Court imposed a sentence of five months for the charge under section 253 and a consecutive two months for the charge under section 249(1).[32]Also distinguishing Lynch from the cases dealing with Mr. Nowlan, is that there is no indication that the Crown was proceeding by way of indictment in Lynch, which would have left the maximum sentence for the judge of six months, whereas here the Crown has proceeded by way of indictment which makes the maximum penalty five years.[33]R. v. Riley cited as a Nova Scotia Court of Appeal decision [1996] N.S.J. No. 80 was a case of a forty-two year old male who had nine prior convictions.He was described as being in ill health.The Court had observed that he was a proven danger and the Crown had proceeded by way of indictment.The trial judge had imposed a sentence which the Court of Appeal found unacceptable by reason of its failure to adequately consider general deterrence and raised the sentence to one year for a charge under section 253(b), one year concurrent for the second charge under section 253(b) and six months for an unrelated offence.Again, what is noted, that is, in R. v. Riley, is that this was an appeal from a sentence which did not bear adequate — originally adequate provision for the principle of deterrence.[34]R. v. Marriott [1999] N.S.J.the Nova Scotia Provincial Court imposed a ninety day intermittent sentence.The individual had only two priors for which he had received only fines.Again this is a case where Mr. Marriott had made an application for curative treatment under section 255(5), the rejection of which took most of the judgment and the court then imposed a sentence of ninety days, which would have been the first incarceration for that particular accused.[35]Defence also referred to the Court three other decisions, R. v. Munkedal [1998] Yukon Territory Court of Appeal, in which an individual had appealed a sentence of nine months when he had been sentenced and at the time of sentencing he had six prior convictions.The appeal was rejected, the Court of Appeal noting that the accused had spent three months in pre-trial custody which would have brought the total to twelve months.[36]R. v. Bérubé [1994] N.B.J., an individual had two prior convictions and received a total sentence of five months for charges under section 253 and 259 and R. v. Kubinchak, Alberta Court of Appeal, where the court was called upon to correct what would have been generally referred to as an illegal sentence of fourteen days for an offence which carried the minimum of ninety days there having been prior convictions.[37]While not strictly a joint submission, it does appear that both counsel have indicated that the range would be a maximum of one year.The Crown has submitted to the Court that the global sentence for these offences should be one year and the defence has submitted that the global sentence should be less than that, in the six month range, but contends that it should be no more than one year.[38]If I were to take this as a joint recommendation for a maximum of one year, I would note that it’s not binding on the Court.Although it should be accorded some weight and some significant weight, the Court generally will only depart from it if there are exceptional circumstances.In my opinion, Mr. Nowlan's is an exceptional circumstance.A global sentence of twelve months for two indictable offences under section 253(b) and two offences under section 259 in the light of the facts and nature of his record, the need to deter him, the need to deter others, his overall attitude, is not a fit sentence.[39]In my opinion, given all the aggravating factors, particularly what would be the clear indication from the accused’s conduct as to faint possibility of rehabilitation and a clear expression by him, both by acts and words, that he will persist despite what Court order may be imposed, and given the range of sentences, that a more significant sentence than globally of twelve months should be imposed and I will do so.[40]Mr. Nowlan, would you stand please.With respect to the offences on September the 9th, 2001, the charge under section 253(b) would in my opinion ordinarily carry a sentence of six months and the charge under section 259(4)(b), two months consecutive.However, giving credit for the two months which you served on remand, I will reduce the sentence on count number one under section 253(b) to five months and reduce the sentence under section 259(4)(b) to one month consecutive.A victim fine surcharge will be fifty dollars assessed against the two charges under section 253(b) or in default two days and I would prohibit you from driving and do so for four years consecutive to any term currently in force.[41]With respect to the charge under section 253(b) on February 25th, 2002, the sentence is twelve months consecutive, the victim fine surcharge is fifty dollars or in default two days consecutive, prohibit you from driving for four years consecutive to any prohibition then in force and count number three, the charge under section 259(4)(b), is two months consecutive.[42]The global sentence is twenty months plus the prohibitionary periods which will be eight years consecutive to any other prohibition now in force and the total victim fine surcharge of one hundred dollars or four days."}

(for the Court):[1]The respondent, B.T., pled guilty to sexually assaulting the 15-year-old complainant (A.A.) who became pregnant as a result of the sexual assault (contrary to section 271 of the Criminal Code of Canada). In addition, he pled guilty to two counts of threatening to kill, contrary to section 264.1.[2]The Crown sought a term of imprisonment of three years, and the respondent requested a conditional sentence. The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of 20 months’ incarceration, consecutive to a three-month sentence currently being served, followed by a three-year period of probation with onerous terms. The Crown now appeals that sentence.I. Background[3]The facts giving rise to the offence can be briefly summarized as follows. The 19-year-old suicidal offender offered the complainant A.A. and her friend S.G. alcohol and cigarettes if they would go to his cousin’s place. He gained entry to his cousin’s home by breaking a window. Once inside, the respondent took A.A. to the bedroom where he lay on the bed and lit a cigarette for her and himself. He asked A.A. if she wanted to have sex. When she declined, the respondent threatened to kill her. He proceeded to take A.A.’s clothes off, hold her down, choke her and have sexual intercourse. S.G. came in the bedroom to see what was going on. A.A. was crying and she asked S.G. to get help. S.G. went to A.A.’s house for help. A.A.’s sister referred S.G. to their mother. Unfortunately, A.A.’s mother was too drunk to assist. S.G. went back and tried to help but was pushed away by the respondent. At one point, a gun was involved and the respondent threatened to shoot S.G., A.A. and then himself. S.G. was scared and told her friend to do what he wanted because she was frightened he would kill them. After some time A.A. was released and the two girls left the house.II. Sentencing Judgment[4]The sentencing judge was alive to the seriousness of the charge, noting that it was one of the more serious cases she had dealt with. She stated that the sentence must send a message to other people that such actions will result in serious consequences. Although the sentencing judge placed weight on the guilty plea, she denied the conditional sentence and sentenced the respondent to significant custodial time (20 months consecutive) followed by three years’ probation. The terms of the probation included a requirement that the respondent would: (a) remain busy by either attending school or having a job, (b) abstain from alcohol and drugs, (c) have no contact with the A.A. and S.G., and (d) perform 200 hours of community service.III. Appellate Decision[5]Appellate review of sentencing is governed by principles, and an appellate court is not entitled to simply substitute the sentence it would have elected for that chosen by the sentencing judge.[6]Absent an error in principle, over emphasis of factors, or a failure to consider relevant factors, an appellate court should only interfere to vary a sentence when the sentence is demonstrably unfit or clearly unreasonable. See: R. v. McDonnell, 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, [1997] S.C.J. No. 42; R. v. C.A.M., 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, [1996] S.C.J. No. 28; R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, [1995] S.C. J. No. 52.[7]The Crown argues that the sentencing judge erred in principle by finding that the respondent was too young to go to a penitentiary. The Crown also submits that the sentence fails to recognize that denunciation and deterrence are the paramount factors to consider in serious sexual assault cases. In addition, the Crown says the judge is entitled to consider the other charges.[8]Dealing first with the other charges, there is no evidence that any other offence was committed prior to the commission of the instant charge and, as a result, another offence does not become a reason for increasing the sentence for this offence.[9]Turning to the overriding principles of sentencing for major sexual assault, we agree that deterrence and denunciation are the paramount considerations. We also agree that this was a serious sexual assault that called for a significant term of incarceration. Were we setting the sentence in the first instance, we might well have imposed a sentence of imprisonment of considerably longer duration.[10]But the sentence we would have imposed in the first instance is not the test. Rather, our obligation is to examine the sentence imposed and the reasons for its imposition. Here the sentencing judge noted the problems of young people and their attraction to drinking and alcohol within the community in which the offence occurred. She went so far as to suggest that it was a problem the community needed to address. In addition, the sentencing judge heard from two elders of the community who provided traditional guidance to the offender as part of the sentencing process. She also found that, in all likelihood, the respondent would return to live in the community the offence was committed or a neighbouring community.[11]The Crown sought a three-year term of imprisonment. The sentencing judge imposed a significant jail term of 20 months (which would amount to nearly two years in prison considering the consecutive time). Rather than opt for the extra year’s imprisonment, the sentencing judge determined that time be served in the Baffin Correctional institute (with the potential treatment from its treatment facilities), combined with a lengthy probation period where the court could monitor this offender, was preferable for both the offender and the community.[12]In our view, deference is owed the sentencing judge. While the imprisonment portion of the sentence seems low considering the serious circumstances here, the sentencing judge chose the three-year probation over additional incarceration as the best method of carrying out the sentencing goals.[13]The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. C.A.M., Lamer, C.J.C. discusses the concept of protecting the community as part of the sentencing process as follows at para. 91:\"Perhaps most importantly, the sentencing judge will normally preside near or within the community which has suffered the consequences of the offender’s crime. As such, the sentencing judge will have a strong sense of the particular blend of sentencing goals that will be “just and appropriate” for the protection of that community.\"[14]We are satisfied that this is just such a case. The sentencing judge was familiar with the community and its needs. She wanted this offender to obtain the benefits of the programs available at the Baffin Correctional Centre. In addition, she wanted to keep, in her words, “tight control” of this young man upon his release. She stated:\"As well, three years probation, I can make your life quite miserable, quite tight, when you come back to Rankin Inlet to make sure that you don’t cause anyone any further difficulties; the complainants in this case and others if you’re drinking.\" [Trial Transcript 19][15]Familiar with the community, the sentencing judge was concerned about this young accused returning to the community without proper treatment and control upon his return. She crafted the judgment to meet those concerns. The conditions of probation are not easy ones.[16]In the result, we cannot say that this sentence is demonstrably unfit. Her decision is owed deference and we dismiss the appeal.Appeal heard on May 23, 2007Memorandum filed at Iqaluit, Nunavutthis25thday of June, 2007____________________Conrad, J.A.Appearances:S.

In February of 2016, he and Annette McPherson had been in a common law relationship for almost eight years but had been experiencing difficulties for some time. Beginning in September, 2015, they had agreed to continue sharing the house they had together in Couchiching but to live separate and apart.[2]On the evening of February 27, 2016, Mr. Morrisseau was upset after he learned Ms. McPherson had started a new relationship and confronted her angrily when she returned home from work. They argued in the kitchen and as the argument became more heated, Mr. Morrisseau caused some damage to the kitchen countertop. He also grabbed a baseball bat and threatened to cause more damage in the house. Ultimately, he did not break anything else and did not directly threaten Ms. McPherson but she became understandably alarmed and called 911.[3]Mr. Morrisseau left the residence before police arrived but was soon arrested and charged with mischief. He was released by the officer in charge after undertaking, among other things, that he would not to possess any weapons and not attend at the residence he shared with Ms. McPherson except for one occasion, with her consent, to retrieve his belongings until the matter was resolved.[4]Days later Ms. McPherson told Mr. Morrisseau she wanted him to remove his things from the house on March 17th. When she returned home from work that day Mr. Morrisseau was still at the house and she found him in a very distressed state. He told her he wanted to kill himself and he wanted his son to get his belongings and life insurance. Ms. McPherson tried to talk him out of it as he retrieved a shotgun from a closet and loaded it. Mr. Morrisseau insisted Ms. McPherson leave the house and she refused, trying to take the gun away from him. Eventually, Mr. Morrisseau, after pleading with her to leave, grabbed Ms. McPherson and pushed her out of the house and barricaded himself inside.[5]Ms. McPherson called 911 and the OPP Emergency Response Team, Crisis negotiators and Tactical Rescue Unit attended the scene. From approximately 10 pm until 1:30 am that night, Mr. Morrisseau was barricaded in the house while speaking to tactical team negotiators with the help of his lawyer. Eventually, he surrendered himself into police custody without further violence.[6]As a result of these two incidents Mr. Morrisseau was charged with a number of offences and eventually pled guilty to one count of mischief, one count of possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the public peace, one count of breaching his undertaking by possessing a weapon and one count of assault on Annette McPherson for pushing her out of the house before barricading himself inside.[7]Initially, after reviewing the allegations and noting the accused had a prior conviction in 2013 for the careless use of a firearm for which he received a $300 fine, the Crown screened this matter for a global disposition of two years custody. They revised their position after Mr. Morrisseau entered his guilty pleas and reviewed the Gladue report prepared by Ms. Becker from Grand Council Treaty #3. With the benefit of more detailed information about his background and aboriginal circumstances, the Crown now submits a global sentence of six months custody followed by two years of probation would be a fit sentence.[8]Ms. Morgan argues on behalf of Mr. Morrisseau that this Court ought to recognize the three days Mr. Morrisseau served in custody prior to his release following the March incident and otherwise suspend sentence and place him on probation for twelve to eighteen months.[9]It is obvious from the Crown’s decision to radically revise their perspective on disposition, as well as the continuing wide disparity in the positions of counsel, that a proper understanding and application of Gladue principles is central to arriving at a fit sentence in this case. For that reason, I intend to review that aspect of this matter in detail.BACKGROUND OF THE ACCUSED[10]Scott Morrisseau is a band member of the Couchiching First Nation located on Rainy Lake at the border between Canada and the United States, very near the Town of Fort Frances, Ontario.[11]Before looking at Mr. Morrisseau’s personal history and to put this sentencing in its proper context it is necessary, in my view, to say some brief things about the history that led to the creation of the present day community of Couchiching.[12]For thousands of years Anishinabe people lived on the lands between Lake Superior in the east and the Red River in the west. Prior to colonialization they were nomadic through this territory and the lands to the south in what is now Minnesota where the Ojibwa speaking people were known as Chippewa. Since records have been kept it has been recorded that they gathered near Couchiching falls in the spring for ceremonies, supported by the abundance of fish and wild rice there.They followed an annual cycle that involved hunting, fishing, and gathering and by the beginning of the 1800’s they had adopted agriculture around the Lake of the Woods and Rainy River regions.[13]Chief Ma-We-Do-Pe-Nais, the Chief spokesman for the Ojibway at the negotiation of Treaty #3 described his people’s understanding of the land and their relationship to it in this way to the Queen’s representative at the negotiations:...All this is our property where you have come. We have understood you yesterday that Her Majesty has given you the same power and authority as she has, to act in this business; you said the Queen gave you her goodness, her charitableness in your hands. That is what we think, that the Great Spirit has planted us on this ground where we are, as you were where you came from. We think where we are our property. I will tell you what he said to us - when he planted us here; the rules that we should follow - us Indians. He has given us rules that we should follow to govern us rightly.Treaty Research Report- Treaty Three (1873), Wayne E. Daugherty, Treaties and Historical Research Centre, Self-Government, Indian and Northern Affairs (Canada 1986) (p.31)[14]The first Europeans to visit the area where the Anishinabe made their home were French fur traders. In 1717 they built the first fort on Rainy Lake in an effort to establish a trade route to the west and protect it from Sioux tribes to the south and west.[15]Over the course of the next 150 years the Anishinabe people continued to live as they had always done with some agreeing to act as guides for the Coeur de bois and still others inter-marrying with the French traders. Because of its strategic location for the Europeans, being at the border with the United States and halfway between the Red River Settlement, at what is now Winnipeg, and Fort William on the north shore of Lake Superior, at what is now Thunder Bay, a fort was always maintained on Rainy Lake and eventually became known as Fort Frances.[16]Beginning in the middle of the 19th century, dramatic changes were taking place in the lives of the Chippewa people to the south of Rainy River as they made agreements with the pre-civil war American government.Major treaties between the United States and various Chippewa nations had been negotiated and according to one historian:These agreements appeared to have a positive impact on both parties. Americans, for instance, were busy logging the forests, mining copper, and building transportation systems in Minnesota as a result of the La Pointe Treaty of 1854. The Chippewa, for their part, found seasonal employment in these operations much of the year but returned to winter on their reservations where game was still plentiful. When they experienced bad weather and scarce game during the winter of 1869, however, these employment opportunities helped to limit their suffering.Edmund Jefferson Danziger, The Chippewas of Lake Superior (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1978) p. 94[17]The Anishinabe in Rainy Lake were aware of these agreements and the effect they had on their cousins to the south and not all of the impacts were considered to be positive. It appears they understood very well that even a small number of white settlers would have a very significant impact on their way of life.NAC RG1O Vol.254 File 541 The Indians.A Report by Simon Dawson to theMinister of Public Works.[18]As events transpired the period just prior to and following Canadian Confederation would have a decisive impact on the Anishinabe people of the Rainy Lake region.[19]At that time what is now Northwest Ontario and all points west were not yet part of Canada. The new Canadian government in Ottawa was concerned the United States would continue its expansion into the west and north and in 1870 it bought, through transfer, much of contemporary Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, northern Quebec, northern Ontario, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut from the Hudson’s Bay Company.According to the Truth and Reconciliation Report:Canadian politicians intended to populate the newly acquired lands with settlers from Europe and Ontario. These settlers were expected to buy goods purchased in central Canada and ship their harvests by rail to western and eastern ports and then on to international markets. Setting the “Northwest” -as this territory came to be known- in this manner meant colonizing over 40,000 Indigenous people who lived there.The Rupert’s Land Order of 1870, which transferred much of the Northwest to Canadian control, required that “the claims of the Indian tribes to compensation for lands required for the purposes of settlement will be considered and settled in conformity with the equitable principles which have uniformly governed the British Crown in its dealings with the aboriginals.” (p.51).[20]In addition to the Canadian government’s desire to fend off American expansionism there were at least two other reasons why the land belonging to the Anishinabe between Fort William and the Red River Settlement was important to the colonizers.[21]First, to secure British Columbia’s agreement to join Confederation the government had agreed to build a trans-Canadian rail line that would link central Canada to the Pacific Ocean coast. That rail line would have to pass through Anishinabe territory west of Lake Superior.[22]Second, the colonization of the Northwest was not proceeding smoothly. In 1869, Louis Riel was leading the Red River Rebellion of Metis against the government’s efforts to colonize the Red River settlements. In order to put down the rebellion, the government intended to send 100 militia men, known as the Wolseley Expedition, west from Ottawa toward the Red River settlements. To arrive there they to would need to pass through Anishinabe land.[23]A great deal is known about the concerns and intentions of the government representatives who eventually entered into Treaty #3 with the Anishinabe in 1873 at the Northwest Angle of the Lake of the Woods from their correspondence kept at the National Archives.[24]The government was concerned that the Metis of Red River might attempt to foster hostilities between the government and the Ojibway in Rainy Lake and sent a delegation in 1870 to negotiate a treaty. The importance of a treaty was stressed by a Captain of the Wolseley Expedition who wrote:There is no doubt that a hundred determined men might have inflicted tremendous loss on the troops with comparative impunity; for, thoroughly acquainted with the vast networks of lakes, they could have fired on the boats as they passed through narrow channels, or blocked up the portages and done much mischief in a variety of ways, while to have attempted to pursue them through the woods and lakes would have been madness.(Daugherty, Ibid, p.3-5).[25]The government negotiator who met with the Ojibway at Fort Frances in the spring of 1870 was aware of the power of the people he was dealing with and wrote:These people if ill-used or provoked would become a most serious bar to the settlement of the North West and could prevent any but strongly armed parties from going through their lands.(Daugherty, p.6).[26]In June 1870, the government’s representative met with 1,500 Ojibway at Fort Frances and asked them to allow the troops of the Wolseley Expedition to pass through their lands. The Chief of the Ojibway delegation advised him that they had no intention of interfering with the Canadian troops but if they intended to build roads through the territory they expected to be compensated for the right-of-way. The Chief stated his demands and said:For this we are willing to allow the Queen’s subjects the right to pass through our lands, to build and run steamers, build canals and railroads and to take up sufficient land for buildings for Government use-but we will not allow farmers to settle on our lands. We want to see how the Red River Indians will be settled with and whether the soldiers will take away their lands - we will not take your presents, they are a bait and if we take them you will say we are bound to you.(Daugherty, p.7).[27]Ultimately, the Anishinabe were not paid for the right-of-way and instead, negotiations shifted to the settlement of a treaty. Both parties to the potential treaty appeared to understand that once a road was opened to general traffic and large numbers of settlers arrived in the region, the existing delicate balance of race relations would end. \"In the interests of both,\" one negotiator wrote to Ottawa, 'the time has come when some provision should be made to meet the approaching change”.(Dawson, Ibid)[28]Aware of the experience of the Chippewa in Minnesota, the Anishinabe, according to the Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission:…were seeking agricultural supplies and training as well as relief during periods of epidemic or famine in a time of social and economic transition. They saw the Treaty process as establishing a reciprocal relationship that would be lasting. The goal was to gain the skills that would allow them to continue to control their own destinies and retain their culture and identity as Aboriginal people. (p. 53).[29]During the negotiation of Treaty #3, Chief Ma-We-Do-Pe-Nais said:I lay before you our opinions. Our hands are poor but our heads are rich, and it is riches that we ask so that we may be able to support our families as long as the sun rises and the water runs.(Dawson, ibid)[30]Ultimately, Treaty #3 took four years to negotiate. It had been expected to be the first treaty struck between Canada and the First Peoples when negotiations began in 1870 but the Anishinabe knew how much it would impact their future and how strategically important their land was to the long term viability of Canada as a country and they proceeded cautiously. The Treaty became an agreement to share the land and resources of the 55,000 square miles of Northwest Ontario and Manitoba between the Ojibway Nation, as represented by 28 First Nations, and Queen Victoria signed October 3, 1873 at Northwest Angle on Lake of the Woods. Chief Mikiseesis (“Little Eagle”) signed on behalf of the Anishinabe who lived on the lands now assumed by the town of Fort Frances and what is now the Couchiching First Nation.[31]A unique feature of Treaty #3 was the adhesion of the Metis in 1875. It was the Anishinabe themselves who asked that the Metis be included. During the negotiations of the main Treaty, the Anishinabe had been in counsel with the Metis in the area and ultimately it was agreed in 1875 that land would be set aside for those Metis who had taken Anishinabe wives and adopted Anishinabe traditions. Eventually, the land set aside for the Metis near Couchiching was merged with the land set aside for the Anishinabe to form what is now the Couchiching First Nation.(Daugherty, ibid, p. 56).[32]When Treaty #3 was signed none of the Anishinabe signatories agreed to surrender their rights of self-government and the treaty itself does not contemplate such an eventuality. It is noteworthy though that during its negotiation the Canadian government arranged for a magistrate to be appointed and stationed at Fort Frances to establish a presence in the region. They also arranged for the construction of a small stockade to ensure that the rulings of the new magistrate would be respected.(Dawson, ibid)[33]This decision today is being released very near the location ultimately chosen for the establishment of the seat of that magistrate and that stockade.THE INDIAN ACT OF 1876[34]The first Indian Act was enacted in 1876 and immediately:Canadian authorities argued that when Aboriginal people in the West signed the treaties, they had bargained away not only their lands, but also their powers over local affairs. Thus, the treaties were not what they seemed, nor indeed what the Indians had accepted in the 1871 and 1873 negotiations. By an act of the federal parliament, unilaterally conceived and drafted without Indian knowledge, Ottawa drastically altered the circumstances of Aboriginal life.(Report of the Aboriginal Justice Inquiry of Manitoba, Vol. 1 (Manitoba Report), p. 63).[35]By virtue of the terms of the Indian Act of 1876, as amended in 1881, Indian Agents, appointed by the federal government, took control of most of the daily affairs on First Nation communities:In every aspect of life, from criminal law to education and religious expression, from hunting to agricultures, from voting to the use of lawyers, Aboriginal people ran into regulations that restricted their freedom. Traditional systems of government were replaced by a restricted and illusory form of democracy in which only adult men had a voice and a vote. All real power rested with the Indian agent who supervised voting, chaired the meetings, kept the official records, decided when, where and if chief and council would meet and controlled councils agenda.(Manitoba Report, p. 64).[36]By 1881 all Indian agents were automatically appointed as justices of the peace with full authority to conduct trials anywhere in the country involving Indians charged with violating the Indian Act and certain crimes under the Criminal Code.(Manitoba Report p. 70).[37]The Indian Act represented a radical shift in the way the Canadian government dealt with the Anishinabe. Within three years from the conclusion of Treaty #3 they went from being recognized as having independent political and territorial rights to being subject to the unilateral legislative supremacy of the Indian Act.[38]While the Anishinabe acknowledged they were ‘poor of hand’, they believed they were ‘rich of the head’ and the evidence suggests that Aboriginal peoples regarded treaties as a tool to maintain cultural and political autonomy. The Canadian government on all the evidence was pursuing a different aim. Beginning as early as 1830 with the Colonial Office’s endorsement of the so-called ‘civilization policy’ and continuing through the passage of the Indian Act the goal of colonialists was ‘gradually reclaiming the Indians from a state of barbarism, and introducing amongst them the industrious and peaceful habits of civilized life’.Sir George Murray, quoted in The Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, p.58[39]One of the principal mechanism by which assimilation was to be achieved was residential schooling. The federal government entered the field of residential schooling Aboriginal children at the same time it was colonizing Aboriginal lands in the so-called “Northwest”. In 1883 Sir John A. McDonald told the House of Commons:When the school is on the reserve the child lives with its parents, who are savages; he is surrounded by savages, and though he may learn to read and write his habits, and training and mode of thought are Indian. He is simply a savage who can read and write. It has been strongly pressed on myself, as the head of the Department, that Indian children should be withdrawn as much as possible from the paternal influences, and the only way to do that would be put them in central training industrial schools where they will acquire the habits and modes of thought of white men.(Quoted in Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, p. 2).THE PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF SCOTT MORRISSEAU[40]Glenn Jourdain is the community historian for the Couchiching First Nation. Speaking to Ms. Becker, the author of Scott Morrisseau’s Gladue Report, he told her that St. Marguerites Residential School was built in 1906 for the children of the people of the Couchiching First Nation. According to community records, Scott’s maternal great-grandfather, William Morrisseau Jr. was among the first class at the school where he attended from 1906 to 1911.[41]His maternal grandmother, Eva Morrisseau, attended the same school from 1933 to 1941.[42]Scott’s mother, Rose-Marie, entered the same school when she was four years old and stayed until she was 16 years old. Glenn Jourdain said, “I was in an old photograph of St. Marguerite’s School, there must have been about 100 of us kids and adults in that photograph. The youngest child in the photograph was Rose Marie Morrisseau. She was so small she only came up to the knees of the Priest and the Mother Superior. She was really just a baby, about four years old”. (Gladue Report, p.8).[43]In talking about his mother’s residential school experience, Scott Morrisseau said:My Grandmother just left her there. She never went home for summer holidays or for Christmas break like the other kids did. Nobody came to visit her and spend the day with her on Sunday like the other families did. She just stayed there at the school and spent all her growing up years there alone. My Grandma Eva had a drinking problem. I don’t know why it was but my Grandma Eva never liked my mother, I don’t know why that was. People have told me that my Grandma was a mean person but I’d never seen it. Grandma never showed me her mean side.I don’t think my mother was a normal person when she got out of that school. My mother was a chronic alcoholic her whole life, she never beat it.(Gladue Report, p. 6).[44]Scott Morrisseau’s mother’s experience was not unique. According to Glenn Jourdain:I was looking at the picture of all of us at St. Marguerite’s and I realized that attending that school destroyed about 60 to 70% of them. There was one reason the school was there and that was to destroy us, that was the government’s plan! There never should have been residential schools. Booze was used to cover the pain and anger about what happened at the school. There used to be so much anger. You could get angry and cry, shout or swear but you had to learn how to control your anger and forgive and look to reconciliation. I’ve been sober 42 years and I’ve had to work at it.Scott has been impacted by residential school back to the fourth generation. The further back you go generationally, the greater the impacts on the succeeding generations. So Scott and his family has been severely impacted by the damaging effects of their attendance at Residential School.(Gladue Report, p.9).[45]Scott’s father was a non-aboriginal man from Fort Frances who was not involved in his upbringing. According to him, “I don’t know him, we didn’t ever have any kind of relationship. I don’t think he ever had a relationship with my mother either. I was just this little Indian kid from Couchiching.” (Gladue Report, p.16).[46]Because of his mother’s severe and chronic alcoholism, Scott spent many years in foster care, temporary shelters, group homes and crisis centres. By his estimate he went through fifteen different foster placements, all with non-aboriginal families, and in each case his strongest desire was to return home. Unfortunately, when he was home, his mother was unable to parent him, often hitting him with hot wheel tracks and expecting him to care for his four siblings when he was as young as eight.[47]In addition to being physically abused himself, he often witnessed his mother being assaulted herself by boyfriends as well as being sexually mistreated by them. Scott said:My mom was living in Duluth. She was a shipper whore, which means she would party with all the foreign men that came into port in Superior. This one time she was passed out on one of the ships, when they realized it, they put her ashore in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Yeah, that was my mother and I loved her anyway.(Gladue Report, p.24.)[48]Rose Marie Morrisseau died in 2004. Scott described her passing:It was alcohol related. She was living with this old white guy and they used to party with Native people and someone substituted her bottle of vodka with rubbing alcohol and she drank it and died. Of course, there was no autopsy or investigation. It was just another drunken Indian who died. (Gladue Report, p.10.)[49]When Scott was 17 and living in a foster home in St. Paul, Minnesota he met Barbara Gosselin, the future mother of his children. According to Scott:Barbara lived a couple of blocks away from the foster home I was in. We used to hang out in the park after school. I was still in foster care and I was working in a bowling alley at the time. We got together and got a place of our own and my daughter Kathleen was born when I was about 19 years old.[50]Scott’s son William was born 6 years later when he was 26 years old. Scott was in a long term relationship with Barbara Gosselin for the next 23 years and they raised their two children in Maplewood, Minnesota. His two children are:Kathleen Williams (Morrisseau) 32 and William Morrisseau 27. Kathleen is a trauma nurse in St. Paul, Minnesota and has two children; Myra two years old and Monroe three months old. William is single and he graduated from the U of MN in 2014 with his Bachelor’s degree in Kinesiology with a specification in clinical movement along with four additional semesters of medical school credits. William is currently applying to various schools to continue his education and obtain his doctorate in physical therapy.“I’m very proud of what my kids are up to,” said Scott. “Barbara is a good woman and she kept the kids in line. I have a good relationship with both of my kids. I speak to them every day, certainly every other day for sure.”[51]Barb Gosselin, Scott’s ex-partner and the mother of his children, provided information about the early years of their relationship together:I met Scott when I was 16 and he was 17 years old. He lived in a foster home two blocks behind our house. When Scott and I got together, we both worked and we were able to work opposite shifts so we never had to get babysitters. When I was at work, Scott got the kids off to school and made sure everything with school was taken care of. It was the same thing after school with their activities. Scott always coached the kids with their sports activities, especially once Will became involved in organized hockey. My family helped out somewhat but we took care of most of it together.Scott even helped my Mom. Scott did more for my Mom than my own family did. There are seven siblings in my family and Scott helped her out more than any of my siblings did. My family all liked Scott and even nowadays my family asks about Scott. How he’s doing? What he’s up to? They always tell me to be sure to tell him they said hello.[52] Scott described his work experiences in his Gladue report:“I went to College for two years for business management”, Scott said,“It was hard for me because I got booted out of foster care, I was working and I had a child to take care of. I would be so tired I would fall asleep in the study lounge. I worked various jobs over the years; as a foreman in a warehouse, I spent 10 years as a steelworker for the Teamsters Union and as a foreman in a brewery. I’ve always had good jobs”.[53]When Scott separated from Barb he returned to Couchiching and eventually began a relationship with Annette McPherson. His son, Will, joined him later to pursue an opportunity to play junior hockey. Discussing his father, Will said:“My dad is very supportive of my sister and I, not only in our education but in our sports as well. I played hockey and my sister played baseball and went to dance. Both my mom and dad were positive role models. They both had good jobs so they spoiled us with material things. I think my dad gave us so much because he had nothing when he was growing up, so he didn’t want us to do without. There was never abuse in our family. My sister and I were always on a short leash from both my mom and dad. They are responsible for the character we have and the integrity we carry.” (Gladue Report, p. 31).[54]Scott and Annette were together for eight years and by Scott’s account the relationship was positive for the first four or five years before accumulated stresses caused challenges prior to the index offences.[55]Since the offences, Scott Morrisseau lost his employment with the Band and started counselling to help him cope with the end of the relationship and his personal issues. He has abided by a strict curfew and recently obtained a new employment opportunity at a local mine.GLADUE ANALYSIS[56]I have reviewed the details of Scott Morrisseau’s aboriginal background in a great deal of detail for very specific reason. When the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision in Gladue in 1999 it said this about the problem of the over incarceration of aboriginal offenders:These findings cry out for recognition of the magnitude and gravity of the problem, and for responses to alleviate it. The figures are stark and reflect what may be fairly termed a crisis in the Canadian justice system. (R v. Gladue [1999] I S. C.R, 688, para, 64.)[57]The Court recognized that there are many complex factors that bear on the issue and that some of them are beyond the scope of the criminal justice system to address. But it also said:What can and must be addressed though, is the limited role that sentencing judges will play in remedying injustice against Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Sentencing Judges are among those decision makers who have the power to influence the treatment of aboriginal offenders in the justice system. They determine most directly whether an Aboriginal offender will go to jail or whether other sentencing options may be employed which will play perhaps a stronger role in restoring a sense of balance to the offender, victim and community and in preventing future crime. (Gladue, para, 65.)[58]Since then the Court has revisited the issue in their 2012 decision in R v. Ipeelee, 2012 SCC 13 (CanLII), [2012] 1 S.C.R. 433. They stated there that any cautious optimism that their decision in Gladue might improve the problem of Aboriginal over representation in Canadian jails had been proven misplaced. They said:In fact, statistics indicate that the over-representation and alienation of Aboriginal people in the criminal justice system has only worsened. (Ipeelee, para.62).[59]While recognizing that their decision in Gladue could not be expected to reverse all the negative momentum that drives the disproportionate incarceration of Aboriginal people in Canada, the Court also noted that there appeared to be some fundamental misunderstandings and misapplications of Gladue that were impeding the positive impact it was meant to have had on the problem.[60]In Ipeelee, the Court identified three areas of resistance to positive change. The first was the mistaken belief that sentencing is not an appropriate means of addressing over-representation. The second was a false belief that Gladue principles provide what is “essentially a race-based discount for Aboriginal offenders.”. Finally, the Court recognized that some decision makers may feel “providing special treatment and lesser sentences to Aboriginal offenders is inherently unfair as it creates unjustified distinctions between offenders who are similarly situated, thus violating the principle of sentence purity.” (Ipeelee, para.64.)[61]The Court tried to address these misunderstandings. Specifically, they affirmed that S. 718.2(e) of the Criminal Code is a remedial provision that was designed to address the issue of Aboriginal over incarceration. It also explicitly recognized that the unique history and experience of aboriginal people since colonization has created a situation where, in a broad range of circumstances, many aboriginal offenders may carry a diminished degree of moral culpability for their criminal conduct.[62]Unfortunately, in my experience as a sentencing judge, even after the release of the Ipeelee decision, I still see challenges to the effective implementation of Gladue principles and I struggle to see positive change.[63]The Court in Ipeelee emphasized that S. 718.2(e) of the Code “does more than affirm existing principles of sentencing, it calls upon Judges to use a different method of analysis in determining a fit sentence for Aboriginal offenders”. (Ipeelee, para, 59,emphasis added). The Code, in particular, requires sentencing judges to “pay attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders “because these circumstances are unique and different from those of non-Aboriginal offenders”. (Gladue, para, 37).[64]What then is the different method of analysis that considers the unique circumstances of Aboriginal persons? In my view, it starts with an understanding of what makes Aboriginal people and their circumstances unique.CONCEPT OF JUSTICE[65]Rupert Ross is a retired Assistant Crown Attorney who worked for many years in the courts in Northwest Ontario. Over the course of a long, distinguished career he had the opportunity to observe closely the differences in the way Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people relate to the concept of justice and he wrote extensively about it.In his book Dancing with a Ghost, he issued an important caution to those who would try to understand the difference in perspectives between Non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal people:Until we realize that [Aboriginal People] are not simply ‘primitive versions of us’ but a people with a highly developed, formal, complex and wholly foreign set of cultural imperatives, we will continue to misinterpret their acts, misperceive their problems and then impose mistaken and potentially harmful ‘remedies’. (Quoted in the Manitoba Report, p. 36.)[66]The truth of this cannot be over-emphasized, in my view. It is also important when seeking to understand the Aboriginal world view to avoid both romanticization and stereotypes. As the Manitoba Report notes, “Aboriginal peoples do not adhere to a single life philosophy, religious belief or moral code. Indeed, there are and have been considerable differences among tribes”. Having said that, the report also states:Psychological and anthropological profiles of Ojibway, Dakota, Apache, Navajo, and Cheyanne subjects have identified recurring personality characteristics, which seem to be culturally induced and which are so unusual that they could be equated with “primary native values”.The seven traditional values of the Ojibway, or Anishinabe, are wisdom, love, respect, bravery, humility and truth. A study of the psychological and behavioural patterns of the Sioux identifies several central values for the Dakota people. Conformity with the group and harmony within it, concentration on the present ability to make personal decisions, reluctance to show emotions, reverence for nature even while using it and constant awareness of God. The four great virtues of the Dakota taught in the sun dance are bravery, generosity, fortitude and integrity. Apache beliefs and value can be stated as respect for the autonomy of the individual, non-interference, desire for harmony in inter-personal relationships, respect for individual freedom and cooperation and sharing.( Manitoba Report,p.20-21).[67]The Assembly of First Nations in its brief to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal People and Criminal Justice in Canada explained how these values are expressed in an Aboriginal system of Justice:Even though First Nations do not adhere to a single world view or moral code, there are nonetheless commonalities in the approach of all First Nations to justice issues. A justice system from the perspective of First Nations is more than a set of rules or institutions to regulate individual conduct or to prescribe procedure to achieve justice in the abstract. ‘Justice’ refers instead to an aspect of the natural order in which everyone and everything stands in relation to each other. Actions of individuals reflect the natural harmony of the community and of the world itself. Justice must be a felt experience, not merely a thought. It must, therefore, be an internal experience, not an intrusive state of order, imposed from the outside and separate from one’s experience of reality. (Bridging the Cultural Divide, A Report on Aboriginal People and the Criminal Justice System in Canada, (“the Royal Commission Report”) p. 3).[68]Prior to colonization, Aboriginal people always had governments, laws and the means of resolving disputes within their communities. Over thousands of years they- developed vast, complicated inter-tribal trading systems that covered the continent and they developed relationships between and among the tribes that cemented political and commercial ties. (Manitoba Report, p.18).[69]The underlying philosophy in Aboriginal societies in dealing with crime was the resolution of disputes, the healing of wounds and the restoration of social harmony. It might mean an expression of regret for the injury done by the offender or by members of the offender’s clan. It might mean the presentation of gifts or payment of some kind. It might even mean the forfeiture of the offender’s life. But the matter was considered finished once the offence was recognized and dealt with by both the offender and the offended. Atonement and the restoration of harmony were the goals- not punishment. (Manitoba Report, p.27).[70]For a sense of how outside our usual conceptions of sentencing Aboriginal approaches could look, consider the following story told by Rupert Ross to the Manitoba Justice Inquiry:In March 1987 the city of Whitehorse hosted the Third Annual Northern Conference. It was convened to examine the delivery and impact of justice services in remote Indian and Inuit communities. One of the sessions explored mediation techniques to see if they might be more appropriate than our adversarial courts. Three participants were selected to form a panel to mediate a fictitious dispute between a young lad and the owner of a store which had been broken into. One of the panel members was Charlie Fisher, an Elder from the Islington Reserve at Whitedog, and Ontario’s first Native Justice of the Peace.He began by getting rid of the chairs, then the long table which had separated the three panelists from the disputants. Everyone sat in a circle, as equals. He then required two further participants to act as Elders “representing” the two disputants. As he continued, it became clear that it was not only the physical format or cast of participants which differed, but also its process and its very function.The boy and the store owner never spoke, not even to the panel. There was no discussion whatever about the break in itself, about the theft and damage, about how each party felt about the other, or about what each might do to set matters straight. Further, the panel would not impose restitution, punishment or any consequence at all. They would not even discuss the issue of consequences.Once those in attendance understood what was NOT going to take place, there was only one question left: “why, then, is there a panel at all?”Charlie Fisher then defined the purpose of the traditional forum. It was used to rid themselves of what he called “bad feelings”. Each would be “counselled” by his representative Elder, privately, until his spirit was “cleansed” and made whole again. At convocations of the panel the representing Elder could signify that such “cleansing” had been achieved by touching the peace pipe. The panel would convene as often as necessary until both Elders so signified. At that point, the peace pipe could be lit and passed to all. As far as the community was concerned, that would be the end of the matter. Whether the two disputants privately arranged recompense of some sort was entirely up to them. Both had been “restored to the community and to themselves” the moment the pipe was passed. (Manitoba Report, p. 28).POST-COLONIALIZATION[71]After colonization, non-Aboriginal forms of dispute resolution were substituted for the ones described above and residential schools were used as a tool to undermine the shared values that kept it alive. As I described earlier, the motivation of those who conceived and implemented the Canadian Indian Residential School policy was explicitly racist and based on a belief that Aboriginal people were savages and their traditions barbaric. This is a stark indictment but it is necessary to speak the truth about this matter.[72]It is important today, not for the purpose of assigning or apportioning guilt, because, to be clear, those who conceived and authorized those policies must bear the burden of history’s judgment on their conscience. It is important because those of us who follow them as stewards of our public institutions must take up the responsibility to ameliorate the devastating consequences of their actions.[73]Recently, there has been a great deal of discussion in this country about the legacy of Indian Residential schools. Some have argued the legacy is mixed. They contend it should be possible to both abhor the abuses many Aboriginal children suffered and also recognise that many Anishinabe people were poor and nomadic when the Treaties were signed and some learned valuable skills at residential school that helped them meet the challenges of a world that was rapidly changing.[74]I don’t doubt that many who advance this view are well intentioned and motivated by a desire to ensure a balanced historical assessment of the issue. Unfortunately, however, this argument misses the vital context I have gone to great lengths to explain.[75]To be schooled in an environment where your culture, your values and your identity are judged and taught to be inferior is harmful to the human spirit. The damage those policies and that instruction did to Aboriginal people and their children echoes through generations to this day. It is for this reason that it is entirely appropriate that s. 718.2(e) of the Code be remedial.[76]On June 11, 2008 the Government of Canada issued an apology that read in part:The treatment of children in Indian Residential Schools is a sad chapter in our history. For more than a century, Indian Residential Schools separated over 150,000 Aboriginal children from their families and communities. In the 1870’s, the federal government, partly in order to meet its obligation to educate Aboriginal children, began to play a role in the development and administration of these schools. Two primary objectives of the Residential Schools system were to remove and isolate children from the influence of their homes, families, traditions and cultures, and to assimilate them into the dominant culture. These objectives were based on the assumption Aboriginal cultures and spiritual beliefs were inferior and unequal. Indeed, some sought, as it was infamously said, to “kill the Indian in the child”. Today, we recognize that this policy of assimilation was wrong, has caused great harm, and has no place in our country. The government now recognizes that the consequences of the Indian Residential Schools policy were profoundly negative and that this policy has had a lasting and damaging impact on Aboriginal culture, heritage and language. While some former students have spoken positively about their experiences at residential schools, these stories are far overshadowed by tragic accounts of the emotional, physical and sexual abuse and neglect of helpless children, and their separation from powerless families and communities.The legacy of Indian Residential Schools has contributed to social problems that continue to exist in many communities today.To the approximately 80,000 living former students, and all family members and communities, the Government of Canada now recognizes that it was wrong to forcibly remove children from their homes and we apologize for having done this. We now recognize that it was wrong to separate children from rich and vibrant cultures and traditions that it created a void in many lives and communities, and we apologize for having done this. We now recognize that, in separating children from their families, we undermined the ability of many to adequately parent their own children and sowed the seeds for generations to follow, and we apologize for having done this. We now recognize that, far too often these institutions gave rise to abuse or neglect and were inadequately controlled, and we apologize for failing to protect you. Not only did you suffer these abuses as children, but as you became parents, you were powerless to protect your own children from suffering the same experience, and for this we are sorry.The burden of this experience has been on your shoulders for far too long. The burden is properly ours as a Government, and as a country. There is no place in Canada for the attitudes that inspired the Indian Residential Schools system to ever prevail again. You have been working on recovering from this experience for a long time and in a very real sense, we are now joining you on this journey. The Government of Canada sincerely apologizes and asks the forgiveness of the Aboriginal peoples of this country for failing them so profoundly.(Statement of the Right Honourable Steven Harper, Prime Minister of Canada, June 11, 2008.)[77]The Supreme Court in Ipeelee invites Judges to take judicial notice of all the factors I have described. (Ipeelee, para. 59). I have laid them out in exhaustive detail because I think it’s just as important, if not more so, that counsel who appear before this court be alive and attentive to this background.[78]We, in Northwest Ontario, all operate in an environment where the vast majority of people who appear in this court are Aboriginal. Counsel have to manage many cases and resources simply do not allow for each matter to receive the time and attention they demand. Many cases will resolve by way of joint submission and it is vital that when counsel are having resolution discussions they be working from a shared body of knowledge and understanding about Aboriginal circumstances here.[79]There are very real dangers to failing to understand our history and our moment in time. It is easy with the benefit of hindsight to look back at the well intentioned people who got caught up in the implementation of damaging policies and to judge their failings. It is less easy to take stock of the current moment and assess what role we are playing and how our grandchildren will assess our contributions to justice.[80]For many Aboriginal people and communities, the breakdown of families, the undermining of traditional values and the spiritual damage done has led to widespread dysfunction and chaotic, troubled lives. Recognizing this connection, even in people who are difficult to serve, is crucial because as the Court in Ipeelee observed Judges must ensure that systemic factors do not lead to discriminatory sentencing:Socioeconomic factors such as employment status, level of education, family situation, etc., appear on the surface as neutral criteria. They are considered as such by the legal system. Yet they can conceal an extremely strong bias in the sentencing process. Convicted persons with steady employment and stability in their lives, or at least prospects of the same, are must less likely to be sent to jail for offences that are borderline imprisonment offences. The unemployed, transients, the poorly educated are all better candidates for imprisonment. When the social, political and economic aspects of our society place Aboriginal people disproportionately within the ranks of the latter, our society literally sentences more of them to jail. This is systemic discrimination.(T. Quigley, “Some Issues in Sentencing of Aboriginal Offenders”, in R. Gosse, J. Y. Henderson and R. Carter, eds., Continuing Poundmaker and Riel’s Quest: Presentations Made at a Conference on Aboriginal Peoples and Justice (1994), 269, at pp. 275-76)Sentencing judges, as front-line workers in the criminal justice system, are in the best position to re-evaluate these criteria to ensure that they are not contributing to ongoing systemic racial discrimination. (Ipeelee, para. 67).RESTORATIVE APPROACHES[81]In my view, recognizing background factors and the way they may reduce the moral culpability of many Aboriginal offenders is only part of the “different method of analysis” to be used in determining a fit sentence. If it were the whole analysis it might justifiably be seen as an excuse for a race-based sentencing discount for Aboriginal offenders. The second part of the analysis is equally important and involves a careful re-assessment of the role of retributive justice in sentencing Aboriginal offenders.[82]Too often, in my experience, sentencing discussions reduce to the question “what is the offence worth?” .This appears to me to be a function of a number of factors. One is a perceived lack of sentencing options. This perception often drives decision makers to see only a seeming binary choice between incarceration and probation.[83]Second, all actors in the justice system recognize the need to measure consequences for offending behaviour. Unfortunately, the open secret in the justice system is that probation officers are mostly overworked and under resourced. The result, sadly, is to further reduce sentencing discussions to the question “jail or minor consequences?”.[84]Thinking like this is locked in a paradigm that badly needs re-evaluating. Ipeelee tells us, quoting the Aboriginal Justice Royal Commission that:The “crushing failure” of the Canadian criminal justice system vis-à-vis Aboriginal peoples is due to “the fundamentally different world views of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people with respect to such elemental issues as the substantial content of justice and the process of achieving justice”. The Gladue principles direct sentencing judges to abandon the presumption that all offenders and all communities share the same values when it comes to sentencing and to recognize that, given these fundamentally different world views, different or alternative sanctions may more effectively achieve the objectives of sentencing in a particular community”. (Ipeelee, para. 74).[85]The Court in Ipeelee stated very clearly that S. 718.2(e) of the Code was designed to “encourage sentencing judges to have recourse to a restorative approach to sentencing” (Ipeelee, para. 59). To address the problem of the over-incarceration of Aboriginal people, our court must expand our understanding of restorative justice principles because restorative approaches have always been more in keeping with Aboriginal conceptions of justice. The Manitoba Aboriginal Justice Report described part of that conception this way:Because the purpose of law in Aboriginal society is to restore harmony within the community, not only the accused has to be considered. Other people who have been or might be affected by the offence, particularly the victim, have to be considered in the matter of ‘sentencing’ and disposition. ( Manitoba Report ,p. 36).[86]In my view, it is important to understand that restorative justice is not code for permissiveness or absence of consequences. In fact, from the Anishinabe perspective, a jail sentence is sometimes seen as an unwarranted avoidance of appropriate consequences. According to the Manitoba Aboriginal Justice Inquiry:In the Ojibway concept of order, when a person is wronged it is understood that the wrongdoer must repair the order and harmony of the community by undoing the wrong. In most cases, the responsibility is placed on the wrongdoer to compensate the wronged person. This concept of order makes the individual responsible for the maintenance of harmony within the society.Restitution to the victim or victims is, therefore, a primary consideration.The person wronged, bereaved or impoverished is entitled to some form of restitution. In the eyes of the community, sentencing the offender to incarceration or, worse still, placing him or her on probation, is tantamount to relieving the offender completely of any responsibility for a just restitution of the wrong. It is viewed by Aboriginal people as a total vindication of the wrongdoer and an abdication of duty by the justice system. (Manitoba Report, p.37)[87]The challenge for non-Aboriginal courts is to craft dispositions that strike the right balance between restitution for the victim, reparations to the community and redirecting the offender’s behaviour. Additionally, the offender may have dependants and Aboriginal people believe care has to be taken so that actions to control the offender do not bring hardship to others. Justice in Aboriginal societies is relationship centred and attempts to take into account the consequences of dispositions on individuals and the community, as well as on the offender. (Manitoba Report, p. 37).[88]Too often, in my view, the concept of deterrence, both general and specific, is used to justify an exclusive focus on a punitive message. Punishments that are designed to deter offenders and send messages to ‘potentially like-minded people’, are often used as a justification for a jail sentence. This tends to be particularly the case in sentencings involving the breach of court orders.[89]It seems to me to be especially ironic that those court orders are often made in the first place to encourage the rehabilitation of offenders and ‘impose’ structures on their disordered lives ‘for their own good’ and in the interest of protecting the public. Yet they most often seem to end in the jailing of Aboriginals who are struggling to cope with the fallout of histories like the one I have described here. At a certain point such an approach stops being only absurd and begins to look like systemic racism.THE ROLE OF ELDERS[90]Striking the right balance in sentencing Aboriginal offenders is particularly difficult without the assistance of Aboriginal elders. To understand why that is requires an appreciation for the roles of respect and shame in a restorative sentence.[91]The concept of shame is very important in the Aboriginal conception of restorative justice. A report made by the Osnaburgh/Windigo Tribal Council Justice Review Committee to the Ontario Attorney General years ago includes this observation:Crimes were seen as a hurt against a community of people, not against an abstract state. Community meetings of “calling-to-account’ therefor played an important part in investigation, evaluation, sentencing and even through the shame they could inspire as punishment.(Report of the Osnaburgh/Windigo Tribal Council Justice Review Committee, prepared for the Attorney General (Ontario) and Ministries responsible for Native Affairs and the Solicitor General (Ontario), July 1990).[92]Shame will be most deeply felt in an environment where the opinion and approval of the community is respected. For Aboriginal people Elders have always occupied the center place that grounds the concept of right conduct. According to the Manitoba Aboriginal Justice Report:Elders-both men and women- are the “teachers” and, in some cases, are the “healers”-that is, the “medicine people”- of the tribe. The role of elders within Aboriginal communities sometimes varied, but generally consisted of helping the people, individually and collectively, to gain knowledge of the history, traditions, customs, values and beliefs of the tribe, and to assist them to maintain their well-being and good health. They were respected for their wisdom and for their experience, and for the fact that, having lived a long life, they were able to advise the people on what to do in difficult situations, as a result of that experience….Elders have long been considered the ones who bridge between the ancient traditions and beliefs of the people and the modern-day influences that come into play in the day-to-day lives of aboriginal men and women. This was so even in past times when there were only Aboriginal people on this continent. (Manitoba Report, p.19)[93]When the Sandy Lake First Nation made an application to the Ontario government for assistance to increase the role of Elders in their community’s fly-in court they described the importance of their traditional role:The element of community respect must be instilled by the court in order for any meaningful changes in attitude (of the offender) to occur. The court does attempt to cause respect in a formal sense, however, the factors of deep seated respect are absent. Respect for Elders occurs over a lifetime of familiarity and trust in their wisdom. It is therefore expedient that the event be perceived as part of a community process and that the offender is not only before the court but before the community.In earlier days the community practised public courts wherein a person was confronted in the presence of the whole community with his misbehaviour. This caused great shame because the community as a whole was respected by all. This shame and remorse laid the groundwork for the teaching that would occur…An important ethic…is the use of shame to teach and rehabilitate.(Quoted in the Royal Commission Report on Aboriginal Justice, p.68)[94]It should be obvious that a justice system alienated from Aboriginal people that responds to the symptoms of that alienation with harsh punitive actions will only lead to further alienation, loss of respect and ultimately, the need for ever greater repressive actions. It is a cycle that has to stop. Sadly, in our communities so many Aboriginal people have been incarcerated that that form of punishment is in danger of becoming less a source of shame for Aboriginal young people and more a rite of passage.[95]So, despite the challenges, our system of justice must become more adept at formulating restorative dispositions. This will require all of us to be more flexible in our approach and avoid the paradigms that lock us into primarily punitive approaches to the sentencing. As I was once told by Darryl Mandamin, our Aboriginal Liaison Officer, our job is to bridge the Rule of Law and the Natural Law. Our highest court has set us that mandate and we on the front line of the justice system need to remember that it can only be effected by us.NEW OPPORTUNITIES[96]I spoke earlier of how racist government policies damaged the spirit of Aboriginal peoples. In addition to the terrible harm done to them, those policies had another hidden cost. The arrogance of the law makers who formulated those policies blinded them to the richness of the traditions they sought to end and the unique wisdom they contained. Part of any honorable reconciliation with Aboriginal peoples, in my view, involves recognizing that wisdom and not repeating the mistakes of our predecessors.[97]One of the geniuses of the British common law has been its ability to adapt and grow to meet changing circumstance as western society evolves. Our criminal law is a codification of that common law and as a Code it has provided an enormously effective structure for the administration of justice. But it seems to me that we still have a great deal to learn from the great wisdom traditions of the Aboriginal people.[98]We have built a great machine for the delivery of justice but we should be careful not neglect the soul of the law. We are not an offender-processing system forever striving for ever greater efficiencies, we are also peacemakers. This should be most obvious in the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders but it is not exclusive to them.[99]Increasingly, as we recognize that rates of incarceration for the general population hold steady and continue climb for Aboriginal people, even as crime rates fall, we are looking for alternative ways to do justice. Ironically, this has led policy makers to ‘rediscover’ the value in the Aboriginal justice traditions we once tried to eradicate. The Royal Commission described the situation this way:Over the last decade, in some ways paralleling the Aboriginal justice inquiries, a series of major commissions and inquiries have addressed the directions that the reform of the criminal justice system should take. Large questions have been raised regarding Canada’s heavy reliance on imprisonment compared to many other countries and about the need to redefine the purposes of the criminal justice system so that the traditional emphasis on retributive goals is balanced with restorative goals….[T]he development of new approaches to and new concepts of law in relation to alternative dispute resolution lead to the discovery and recognition of the indigenous approaches and conceptions of Canada’s First Nations that date back centuries. (The Royal Commission, p.75)[100]The Supreme Court of Canada, very clearly in Gladue, and again, with some frustration, in Ipeelee has directed us to bring peacemaking approaches into the criminal law.And it should be remembered that Section 718.2 of the Code reads:A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:(e)all available sanctions or options other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders (emphasis added)This is entirely consistent with the finest traditions of our common law.[101]To make effective use of these approaches will require counsel from the moment a proceeding begins to move beyond the determination of responsibility for the offence stage to consider carefully all the various interests and values that have been affected by the offending behaviour. This will obviously include the victim but it will also often include the victim’s family, the offender’s family, law enforcement and various elements of the wider community. As a system we must become accustomed to seeing both the obvious and the subtle ways offences interfere with the harmony of the community. We also need to recognise that disharmony continues to cause interference until harmony is re-established. It should be obvious that jailing an offender for reasons other than the immediate protection of public safety is a highly ineffective and very short term way of creating peace and order.[102]Just as responsibility for making reparations belongs to the offender, each individual sentencing in many ways mirrors our country’s attempts to make an honourable reconciliation with our nation’s Aboriginal people. Our government’s apology and the amendment of the Criminal Code to include s. 718.2(e) is part of that effort and the proper and effective use of s. 718.2(e) by this court ought to be seen as our contribution to the discharge of that responsibility.[103]Where, as here, we lack the assistance of community Elders to help us identify all the energies disturbed by the offending behaviour and to craft a plan for how to heal them, we must be creative. I recognise community based resources are often limited and the safety and protection of the community is always a consideration as well as the need to rehabilitate offenders. It is our legal obligation, however, not allow ourselves to default to incarceration as a substitute for the exercise of imagination. Restorative justice requires us to identify the harm done, tailor a plan for the offender to make meaningful restitution and to get the help they need.[104]Before closing my comments on this point, I want to make a direct appeal to our Federal government. We as a nation entered into Treaty arrangements with First Nations people in Treaty #3. We did so to avoid conflicts but also, frankly, to acquire their land at minimal expense at a time when doing so was vital to the country’s future. We, as a nation, made promises to Aboriginal people and we have acknowledged and apologized for not fulfilling all of them. My request is for your assistance to do justice better where they are concerned. We are misdirecting valuable community resources to the incarceration of the poor and the mentally ill and the struggling that need to be directed to helping us achieve restorative outcomes and a more honourable reconciliation with Aboriginal people in Northwestern Ontario. There is still an opportunity to bridge the divide that diminishes us as a people but we need your help to build that bridge.DISPOSITION[105]The offences committed by Scott Morrisseau took place in the context of an intimate partnership with Annette McPherson at a time when that relationship was breaking down. This is always a situation of special concern. Considering his history of being abandoned as a child, I have little doubt their separation triggered tremendous anxiety in him and had a direct role in his wrongdoing. I also have little doubt that his intimidating and reactive behaviour caused genuine fear in Ms. McPherson. It is reasonable to believe that fear would have stayed with her for some time because of her uncertainty about whether Mr. Morrisseau might continue or even escalate his unpredictable behaviour. I expect that with the passage of time and in the absence of any further issues those fears will have abated but they would be valid and real concerns.[106]The facts are clear that at no time did Mr. Morrisseau ever turn his violence directly on Ms. McPherson. It is plain, however, that Mr. Morrisseau’s threats to commit suicide in their home was almost certainly done to cause emotional harm to Ms. McPherson. That harm, too, is real and must be addressed. The knowledge that Mr. Morrisseau has already been receiving counselling for his personal issues and has not interfered with her new relationship goes some way toward mitigating that harm. As does the fact that Ms. McPherson has had exclusive use of the house they shared and the belongings they acquired together over the course of their eight year relationship since the incidents.[107]Recognising that, Mr. Morrisseau still ought to make a written apology to Ms. McPherson in consultation with a community elder for his behaviour at the time of the two offences and provide a copy of that apology to his probation officer and the Court. Mr. Morrisseau has always been a good worker and he has found new employment. I consider it appropriate that he make a $1000 donation to the local women’s shelter within nine months and provide proof that he has done so to his probation officer.[108]I am concerned about Mr. Morrisseau’s resort to a firearm during his contemplation of suicide. Not only was it intimidating to Ms. McPherson but it led directly to the intervention of the Emergency Response Team, something that would have been alarming to most of people in the small community in Couchiching. Ms. Morgan, on behalf of Mr. Morrisseau, has characterized the police response as an unfortunate overreaction. With respect, I don’t agree. I expect that Ms. Morgan’s view is coloured to an extent by her conversations with her client on the phone that night and her consequent belief that he meant no one but himself any harm. Possessing a firearm while unbalanced by a marital separation is always a potentially dangerous situation and the police were obligated to treat it as such. The fact that the community’s peace was disturbed by the presence of police armed with assault weapons is something for which Mr. Morrisseau will need to take responsibility. Part of doing so will be my obligation under s.109 of the Code to prohibit him from possessing any firearms as defined for a period of 10 years. I will hear submissions on the lifting, temporarily or otherwise, of the Prohibition under s.113 in due course. I will also order that Mr. Morrisseau perform 100 hours of community service on the First Nation territory of Couchiching within 12 months as restitution for the harm done there.[109]Mr. Morrisseau has carried a heavy burden throughout his life as a legacy of his family’s residential schooling, a history that goes back four generations. He has carried that burden for the most part with fortitude and dignity. Importantly, he has raised two fine children and shielded them, to the extent he has been able, from the vast of the pain he experienced. He deserves respect for that.[110]In his address to the Court and in the Gladue report prepared on his behalf, Mr. Morrisseau has spoken of the shame he feels for what he has done. His family and his community have seen him stumble in a very dramatic and public way. I do not underestimate the important corrective element of the weight of that shame. Speaking to Ms. Becker. Mr. Morrisseau said “right now I don’t participate in Anishinabe ceremonies because I’m embarrassed by what I did and I’m laying low. Once I have these charges behind me, I would like to go to the Sweat Lodge and get purified and start over fresh”. (Gladue Report, p.2).[111]Mr. Morrisseau has agreed to attend the Trauma and Recovery Program at Enaahtig HealingLodge and Learning Centre and take a course designed specifically to deal with the inter-generational impact of Residential School. I will make it a term of his probation that he attend and complete that program as well as continue with the counselling he has been receiving since the incident.[112]In my view, the just sentence in this matter involves recognizing the days Mr. Morrisseau spent in custody immediately following the March incident and the strong message that sent to both Mr. Morrisseau and the community about the seriousness of his wrong doing. That time will be credited on the breach of undertaking count and an additional $100 fine will be imposed with 60 days to pay and 60 days to pay the Victim Fine Surcharge. There will be suspended sentences on the balance of the charges with probation for 12 months to reflect the fact he has been bound by restrictive conditions already for more than a year. In addition to the terms I have already mentioned he will not communicate with Annette McPherson or her new partner, directly or indirectly, except through legal counsel in any family proceeding and he will not attend their residence or be within 25 meters except as arranged through legal counsel.Released:May 9, 2017Signed: “Justice D. Gibson”"}

He said the Crown asked the question out of desperation because he had a \"terrible case\".[3]In our view, the trial judge was correct in instructing the jury in his charge that:Mr. Winter [defence counsel] referred to that question asked by the Crown in his address to you as a desperate act to bolster this prosecution. Mr. Winter's reference to the inadmissible question upon which I had ruled was improper. I emphatically instruct you, as a matter of law, to exclude from your consideration in arriving at your verdict, both the question posed by Mr. Sabbadini, [Crown counsel] which I ruled to be inadmissible, as well as Mr. Winter's characterization in reference to it in his jury summation to you. The single issue in this case is whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew she was bringing hashish into Canada.[4]In our view, the trial judge dealt with the Crown's improper question promptly and effectively. The witness did not even have the opportunity to answer it. Any lingering prejudice must be placed at the feet of defence counsel who revived the issue when he attempted to convert the improper question to his client's advantage. Accordingly, we are not prepared to give effect to the arguments with respect to conviction.[5]As to sentence, the appellant sought, for the first time, a conditional sentence for the offence of importing cannabis resin into the country. The quantity was one kilogram with a street value of $20,000. No such relief was sought at trial. Indeed, the sentence reflects the joint submission by Crown and defence. We, of course, must give deference to that. In the circumstances, we are not prepared to interfere with the sentence.[6]Accordingly, for the reasons given, the appeal against conviction is dismissed. Leave to appeal sentence is granted, but the appeal is dismissed."}

E. Schmaltz, in Yellowknife, in theNorthwest Territories, on the 2nd day of March, A.D. 2007.APPEARANCES:Mr. S. Hinkley:Counsel on behalf of the CrownMs. P. Taylor:Counsel on behalf of the Accused-------------------------------------Charge under s. 253(4) C.C1THE COURT:Rene Gaudreau has entered a2guilty plea to refusing to provide a breath3sample, an offence under 253(4) of the Criminal4Code.The matter was set for a two day trial to5commence yesterday.Mr. Gaudreau did not attend6yesterday morning.A warrant was issued for his7arrest and the matter was adjourned until 1:308yesterday afternoon.9At 1:30, Mr. Gaudreau had still not been10located but there was some indication that he may11attend this morning.So the witnesses, some of12whom were from outside the NorthwestTerritories,13were directed to reattend this morning at 9:30.14The warrant that was issued for Mr. Gaudreau15yesterday morning was executed last night and he16has been in custody since last night.17This morning, the witnesses once again18attended for the trial to commence today.This19morning, Mr. Gaudreau entered a guilty plea to20the charge of refusal to provide a breath sample.21The circumstances of the offence are that on22March the 23rd, 2005, Mr. Gaudreau met Rose23Ahegona either at or outside the Right Spot bar24here in Yellowknife.Ms. Ahegona had been25drinking that day and Rene Gaudreau had been26drinking that day.At about 8:30 or 9 p.m., the27two decided to go to Mr. Gaudreau's residence outOfficial Court Reporters11on the Ingraham Trail.Those were the facts that2were read in by the Crown and admitted to.In3her submissions, Mr. Gaudreau's counsel said they4were not initially going to Mr. Gaudreau's5residence but Mr. Gaudreau was giving Ms. Ahegona6a ride to another friend's house which was also7out on the Ingraham Trail.I do not know that8anything turns on that.9In any event, before Mr. Gaudreau and10Ms. Ahegona left Yellowknife, Ms. Ahegona gave11Mr. Gaudreau some money and he went and bought12some more alcohol at the liquor store before they13headed out of Yellowknife.Mr. Gaudreau drove14his pickup truck, and Ms. Ahegona was the15passenger.16On the Ingraham Trail, the accused Mr.17Gaudreau drove into the side of an empty fuel18truck which was returning from one of the mines.19When I say \"empty\", it had no fuel in it.It was20being driven though.21The driver of the fuel truck called the RCMP22after the accident and the RCMP members attended.23Several RCMP members noted that Mr. Gaudreau24showed signs of intoxication and also noted beer25cans in both the box of his truck and the26interior of the truck.There was also a Vodka27Cooler in the truck.Official Court Reporters21Emergency medical personnel attended the2scene and once it was determined that Mr.3Gaudreau was not hurt, he was then arrested,4chartered and cautioned for impaired driving and5read the breathalyzer demand.6Mr. Gaudreau was taken back to the7detachment where he was given an opportunity to8contact counsel, which he did, and after speaking9to counsel Mr. Gaudreau refused to provide a10sample of his breath, a demand having been made.11Ms. Ahegona was taken to the hospital from12the accident scene.She was taken to the13hospital here in Yellowknife by ambulance.She14had bruises and abrasions.She had a broken15tooth.She stayed in the hospital for four days.16She was released on March 27th.She remained in17the hospital in order to ensure there were no18internal organ injuries, which there were not,19and to manage or control her pain.20The accident caused significant damage to21both the tanker truck and to Mr. Gaudreau's22truck, damage which is evident from the23photographs that were entered.24Mr. Gaudreau has a prior criminal record.25He has been convicted of drinking and driving26offences ten times between 1964 and 1999.The27first four times he was convicted he received aOfficial Court Reporters31fine.The last six times that he was convicted2of drinking and driving offences he has received3jail sentences.Notably, for his 10th conviction4in 1999 he was sentenced to only three months in5jail.I expect that sentence was very lenient as6at the time it had been close to 21 years since7his last conviction before that.Today, it is8eight years since the 1999 conviction but this9offence is now two years old, so at the time this10offence was committed it had only been six years11since his last conviction.12No matter how one looks at it,13Mr. Gaudreau's record for drinking and driving14offences is highly aggravating.There does come15a point when the number of convictions is so16great that they begin to overshadow any17significant gaps in the record.18Mr. Gaudreau, you are going to kill someone19if you keep drinking and driving, it is only a20matter of time.Hopefully you see how close you21came this time and take what happened in March of222005 as a warning, because if you do keep23drinking and driving someone will be seriously,24perhaps permanently, injured or killed.And Mr.25Gaudreau, it is likely that that person will be26either an innocent pedestrian, an innocent driver27or passenger, not expecting it.Official Court Reporters41The Crown has suggested that a sentence of2nine to twelve months and a three year driving3prohibition would be an appropriate sentence.4Defence counsel has suggested that given5Mr. Gaudreau's personal circumstances a6conditional sentence would be appropriate.7The geography of where this accident took8place was thoroughly explained by counsel for Mr.9Gaudreau.Photographs of the area were entered10as exhibits.I accept that the Ingraham Trail is11what may be called a winding country road in12southern Canada.It is a lovely winding road13leading to many lakes and recreational areas14outside of Yellowknife.There are several cabins15on the Trail.Mr. Gaudreau himself lives in a16cabin on the Ingraham Trail.17Mr. Gaudreau, I want you to understand that18I find it in no way mitigating that this accident19took place on the Ingraham Trail.If anything,20it is aggravating that you were driving after21drinking on the Trail.If there is any time that22you should have your wits about you, that you23should be completely sober and alert in driving,24it is when you are driving on the Ingraham Trail.25There are a fair amount of drivers on the Trail,26and I would say that you are incredibly lucky,27all of you - you, Ms. Ahegona, the driver of theOfficial Court Reporters51tanker truck - that you are all here today to2talk about this.But I do want it to be clear3that I do not find in any way the fact that the4Ingraham Trail could be said to be a challenging5drive mitigating.If anything, driving after6drinking on that road is aggravating.I also7believe that if a driver has not been drinking,8what might be seen as challenges in driving the9Trail will be much more manageable.A sober10driver's judgment is better.His or her11reactions are quicker.All in all, the reflexes12and alertness would likely equip you or anyone13driving to deal with the road.I find it14completely illogical to say well it is a hard15road to drive so the accident was not really16because I was drinking.If it is a hard road to17drive, you should never be driving on it while18you are drinking.19I have reviewed some case law and some20different statements made by different courts.I21am going to refer to some of these statements22perhaps for the eloquence of those who said them,23than for any principles.24In the case of The Queen and Zoe, Justice25Boilard said:26Drunken driving has become a27national concern in Canada and notOfficial Court Reporters61only in the North.Concerned2Canadian citizens have even created3lobbies to influence4Parliamentarians to enact much5stiffer penalties in the presence of6the ever increasing numbers of7fatalities attributable to driving8under the influence of an9intoxicant.10Justice Boilard then quotes from a case of11Svarc.I find this an interesting statistic.12The problem we have is that in13Canada, in this century, I think it14is quite well known, there have been15more people killed and injured on16our highways by drunken driving than17were killed in two world wars...18He then quotes from the Alberta Court of19Appeal, who also voiced its concerns with20drinking and driving in the case of The Queen and21Jacobs.22The drunken driver disables himself23from meeting emergencies or from24instantly recovering, without25resulting harm, from the small26errors which all drivers frequently27commit.In the present case, forOfficial Court Reporters71example the sober driver on a dark2night on a paved road with an3irregular edge and no white line4might go off the paved edge through5momentary inattention.That driver6would, however, be able to recover7on the instant and would not proceed8down the road half in and half out9of the ditch with the tragic results10of this case.11If it is culpable to take12control of a motor vehicle while13impaired, all drivers guilty of that14act merit punishment and not merely15those involved in tragedy.Each is16potentially a killer.It is often17mere chance or mischance that18determines which one causes death19and which one gets home safely.20Should not the attack be on all the21impaired drivers of Canada, in their22tens of thousands, in addition to23condemnation of the smaller number24who cause death or injury?25In the case of The Queen and Boline, a26decision of Justice Vertes from 2001, in that27case Mr. Boline was convicted of impairedOfficial Court Reporters81driving, operating a motor vehicle while2disqualified from doing so and resisting arrest.3Justice Vertes says:4The circumstances of the offences5themselves are not particularly6serious or aggravating.It was a7relatively short sequence of events8and no one was injured.It is the9offender's circumstances that are10particularly serious.11Mr. Boline had a terrible criminal record.12He had 21 convictions since 1989.The list of13convictions included four previous drinking and14driving offences, the last one in 1998 so his15offences were more recent.Boline is from 2001.16He had a prior conviction for impaired driving17causing bodily harm and that was from 1990, so18that was some 11 years old.He had convictions19for dangerous driving, three for driving while20disqualified.21In Boline, the Crown had suggested a total22sentence of two years less a day.In the23circumstances of that case, and again in Justice24Vertes's own words the circumstances were not25that aggravating or serious, it was a relatively26short sequence of events and no one was hurt.27But with that record, Justice Vertes said:Official Court Reporters91I was initially under the2impression, having regard to the3offender's record of convictions,4that there might well be cause to5seek a penitentiary sentence.6In that case Justice Vertes on the charge of7impaired driving sentenced the accused to 128months in custody and a ten year driving9prohibition.10In the case of The Queen and Lafferty, a11decision of Justice Richard from 1989,12Mr. Lafferty had a very serious criminal record13of drinking and driving offences and in that case14he pled guilty to three more such offences.15Mr. Lafferty had six prior drinking and16driving offences on his record, consisting of17driving over .08 and refusals.Most of them were18refusals.There was no prior offences of causing19bodily harm or dangerous driving.They were all20either over .08, refusal, or driving while21prohibited.22The circumstances in the Lafferty case are23that Mr. Lafferty struck a parked vehicle.There24was property damage done but no one was hurt in25the accident.He was read a breathalyzer demand26and he refused, so it was a case of refusing.27The following day he again drove his vehicleOfficial Court Reporters101while he was impaired and some weeks later he2again drove.So he had three more on that day3besides the six priors.4He was sentenced to eight months on the5first one and a three year driving prohibition.6He was sentenced for ten months concurrent on the7second one.And on his third one, which would8have been the ninth one on his record, he9received a sentence of 18 months in jail and a10three year driving prohibition.11I refer to those cases, Mr. Gaudreau,12basically to let you know that I think the13Crown's position in this case is very generous,14that for your eleventh drinking and driving15offence a sentence of nine to twelve months is16certainly at the very low end of the range.17Your counsel has urged me to consider a18conditional sentence in this situation, the19suggested conditions being that you be prohibited20from drinking and that you be required to do21community service work.22A conditional sentence is a jail sentence23but it is a jail sentence that is served in the24community under strict conditions.It is25generally a more lenient sentence than a jail26term of the same duration.House arrest, which27is often imposed as a condition of a conditionalOfficial Court Reporters111sentence, does not have the same punitive effect2that a jail sentence has.There are no offences3excluded except offences which have minimum4prison terms as sentences, and there are no5presumptions in favour of a conditional sentence6for any offences.7The Crown in this case has not filed a8notice of intention to seek greater punishment9and therefore I am not bound to impose a minimum10jail term even though this is your eleventh11offence, therefore a conditional sentence in this12case could be available.13The criteria that must be present before a14conditional sentence can be imposed are set out15in the Criminal Code:An accused must be16convicted of an offence that is not punishable by17a minimum term of imprisonment; the sentence that18is imposed must be one of less than two years;19the safety of the community cannot be endangered20by an offender serving the sentence in the21community; and the conditional sentence must be22consistent with the fundamental purpose and23principles of sentencing set out in section 71824to 718.2.25As I have said, the Crown not filing a26notice of intention to seek greater punishment,27there is no minimum sentence for this offence.Official Court Reporters121The maximum sentence for the offence, having2proceeded by indictment, is five years.However,3I will impose a sentence of less than two years4in this case so therefore I have considered5whether or not to impose a conditional sentence.6The first and the second criteria are met.7Would the safety of the community be8endangered if Mr. Gaudreau were allowed to serve9his sentence in the community?I have to10consider the risk posed by Mr. Gaudreau, that is,11the risk that he will re-offend; and if he did,12what is the gravity of the damage that could13result in the event of reoffence?A14consideration of the risk posed by Mr. Gaudreau15should include the risk of any criminal activity16and not be limited solely to the risk of physical17or psychological harm to other individuals.18I find it very difficult to assess the risk19of whether or not Mr. Gaudreau will re-offend.20When one looks at his record, as is often done if21one is to predict future behaviour by past22behaviour, then I have very little confidence23that Rene Gaudreau will not drink and drive24again.If he does drink and drive again, the25gravity of the damage or harm to the victim is26significant.In considering his record, I cannot27be satisfied that the safety of the communityOfficial Court Reporters131would not be endangered if he were to serve his2sentence in the community.I have heard that he3likes to drink.I have also heard that his4partner would call the police if he did drink.I5am not confident that Mr. Gaudreau's partner can6effectively control Mr. Gaudreau, and nor do I7believe that she should have to.I have really8no material before me or evidence that Mr.9Gaudreau is willing to quit drinking or has quit10drinking.11That being said, even if I had found that12the third criteria had been met, when I consider13the fourth criteria whether or not a conditional14sentence would be consistent with the fundamental15purposes and principles of sentencing, I find16that a conditional sentence would not be.There17are some offences or some situations where either18the circumstances of the offence or the history19of an accused criminal behaviour are such that20the need for denunciation or deterrence is so21pressing that incarceration, that is actual jail,22is the only suitable way in which to express the23community's condemnation of the offender's24conduct or to deter similar conduct in the25future.26I find that when a person persists in27drinking and driving that the need for not onlyOfficial Court Reporters141specific deterrence but for denunciation of this2type of behaviour is considerable.This is3behaviour which in reality shows a contemptible4disregard for the safety of others.It is5behaviour which all too often results in tragic6consequences to innocent victims, and it is7behaviour that is completely avoidable.8As the Supreme Court of Canada said in the9Proulx decision at paragraph 106:10There may be certain circumstances11in which the need for denunciation12is so pressing that incarceration13will be the only suitable way in14which to express society's15condemnation of the offender's16conduct.17Where the objectives of denunciation and18deterrence are particularly pressing,19incarceration will generally be the preferable20sanction.Harsh sentences plausibly provide21general deterrence.22The court's role is to impose sentences that23are meaningful and that will achieve the24objectives of sentencing.The sentence that is25imposed by me must be one that will be seen by26members of the community as severe enough that it27will discourage Mr. Gaudreau from this type ofOfficial Court Reporters151behaviour and others as well.2I realize that Mr. Gaudreau is 71 years old3but I certainly do not accept that he is a feeble4old man.He cuts wood every day, he collects5water, he lives in a cabin.He certainly appears6to be entirely capable, and no evidence has been7called to show anything different.He has8difficulty hearing though he certainly appears to9hear all right if people speak loudly.I am told10that he has his hearing aid in today.I do not11accept the characterization or perhaps the12picture it brings to mind in any event, that he13is a hearing-disabled and forgetful old man.He14is a 71 year old man with a hearing problem for15which he has a hearing aid, who may or may not be16as forgetful as any, or perhaps many, of us are.17He is capable and self-sufficient.18Section 718 of the Criminal Code sets out19the fundamental purpose of sentencing.As I said20earlier, I have to be satisfied that a21conditional sentence in this case would be22consistent with the fundamental purpose and23principles of sentencing.24The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to25contribute to respect for the law and the26maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society27by imposing just sanctions or sentences that willOfficial Court Reporters161denounce unlawful conduct, that will deter2Mr. Gaudreau and other persons from committing3offences.Sentences that will, if necessary,4separate offenders from society, that will assist5in rehabilitating offenders, sentences that will6provide reparations for the harm done to victims7or to the community, and that will promote a8sense of responsibility in offenders and9acknowledgement of the harm done to the victims10and to the community.Sentences must be11proportional to the gravity of the offence and12the degree of responsibility of the offender.13There are sentencing principles set out in14section 718.2 as well.Section 718.2(d) says15that \"an offender should not be deprived of16liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be17appropriate in the circumstances.\"18Section 718.1 (e) states that \"all available19sanctions other than imprisonment that are20reasonable in the circumstances should be21considered for all offenders...\"22I recognize that section 718.2(e) states23that \"all available sanctions other than24imprisonment that are reasonable in the25circumstances should be considered...\"26I am also mindful that in the circumstances27where a conditional sentence or a sentence ofOfficial Court Reporters171incarceration would be appropriate, a conditional2sentence should be imposed.However, when I3consider all the circumstances of this case, I4find in these circumstances, especially5considering the persistence of Rene Gaudreau in6committing drinking and driving offences and the7risk of tragic consequences every time he gets8behind the wheel after drinking, in those9circumstances the need for specific and general10deterrence as well as denunciation is so pressing11that a conditional sentence could not meet those12objectives.I find that incarceration, that is13actual jail, is necessary to send a strong14message to denounce Mr. Gaudreau's conduct and to15deter him and others from engaging in similar16conduct.17In the circumstances of this offence, there18will be a term of actual imprisonment of one19year.There will also be a driving prohibition20for three years.21Mr. Gaudreau, you will be prohibited from22driving any motorized vehicle on any street,23road, highway or other public place for a period24beginning today and ending three years from the25date of your release from imprisonment.Do you26understand that?27THE ACCUSED:Yeah.Official Court Reporters181THE COURT:In the circumstances of this2case, the victim of crime surcharge will be3waived.To impose it I find would be a hardship.4Is there anything else required?5MR. HINKLEY:No, thank you, Your Honour.6THE COURT:Ms. Taylor?7MS. TAYLOR:Nothing, thank you.8THE COURT:Good luck, Mr. Gaudreau.9..............................1011Certified to be a true andaccurate transcript pursuant12to Rule 723 and 724 of theSupreme Court Rules of Court.1314______________________________15Annette Wright, RPR, CSR(A)Court Reporter161718192021222324252627Official Court Reporters19"}

JUSTICE KILPATRICKBETWEEN:AppellantHER MAJESTY THE QUEEN- and -RespondentJOSEPHIE GORDON PUDLATAccusedOn Appeal from the Sentence ofThe Honourable Madam Justice Browneon the 24th day of September 2004ORAL REASONS FOR JUDGMENT DELIVERED FROM THE BENCHCounsel:M. Bryant, for the AppellantM. Bloos, Q.C., for the RespondentRICHARD, J.A. (For the Court):[1]With respect to the Crown’s appeal on the Pudlat matter, the panel has come to a decision.The decision is unanimous, and I will deliver reasons.[2]The Crown on this appeal submits that the sentence imposed was demonstrably unfit, and also, that the sentencing judge has erred by not according proper weight to the aggravating circumstances of the offences.The respondent was before the sentencing judge to be sentenced for two separate and unrelated sets of offences and, at the outset of her sentence, the sentencing judge acknowledged that she had a challenging task in the matter of determination of sentence.[3]One group of offences concerned domestic violence.On May 10, 2003, the respondent, in his home community of Kimmirut, 23 years old at the time, assaulted his common-law spouse.He was charged with common assault contrary to Section 266 of the Criminal Code, and the Crown proceeded summarily.He was apparently released on an undertaking, one of the conditions being to have no contact with his spouse and to stay away from her residence.Approximately six weeks later, on June 27th, 2003, he breached that condition of his undertaking.[4]A number of months later, on January 21st, 2004, Mr. Pudlat attended in Kimmirut with his lawyer and entered a plea of guilty to the spousal assault of May 2003 and the breach of undertaking of June 2003, and also, some other charges, and the Court ordered preparation of a pre-sentence report, and sentencing was adjourned for four months pending receipt of the pre-sentence report.[5]One month later, on February 9th, 2004, while on the same undertaking, Mr. Pudlat again assaulted his common-law spouse by choking her to the point of dizziness.It is an aggravating circumstance that Mr. Pudlat committed a second assault on his spouse while awaiting sentencing for an identical offence.[6]On this group of offences related to domestic violence, in our view, a denunciatory sentence was required, absent any extraordinary circumstances.We say this because of the prevalence of domestic violence in this jurisdiction, and also because it is not merely one isolated incident of spousal assault, but rather, repetitive behaviour.We also note that Parliament has specifically prescribed spousal assault as an aggravating circumstance for which a sentence ought to be increased.[7]We are also of the view that in the normal course of events, there ought to be consecutive sentences for the June 2003 breach of undertaking and the second spousal assault of February 2004, all the while keeping in mind, of course, the principle of totality as directed by Parliament.[8]We turn now to the second group of offences to which the respondent pleaded guilty.That is the sexual assault of two underage girls.In the spring of 2003, Mr. Pudlatwas employed as a supervisor at the community recreation centre in Kimmirut.Through that employment, he had contact with the two young victims, 12 and 13 years of age, who attended at the recreation centre for youth activities and sports activities.[9]The respondent admits that he had sexual intercourse with the first victim after-hours at the recreation centre on three separate occasions.He also admits to one act of sexual intercourse with the second victim, 12 years old, who he invited to his home and had sex with her there.[10]At the sentencing hearing, Mr. Pudlat’s counsel asserted that the two underage girls were willing participants.Although the sentencing judge made no formal finding or reference to the point, we presume that sentence was imposed on that basis.We note that these sexual assaults, or at least some of them, occurred while Mr. Pudlat was on an undertaking.[11]There was some dispute at the sentencing hearing as to whether Mr. Pudlat was, at the time of committing the sexual assaults of the young girls, in a position of trust or authority in the sense that that phrase is used in Section 718.2 of the Criminal Code, wherein Parliament has stipulated that it is an aggravating circumstance in the determination of sentence if an offender, in committing a crime, abuses a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim.[12]The sentencing judge did not make any specific finding on the breach of trust issue.In our view, it is not necessary to make a formal finding one way or the other.It is a significant circumstance, though, that it was by virtue of Mr. Pudlat’s position as supervisor at the community centre that he had an opportunity to invite these two young girls to participate in illicit sex with him.[13]Quite apart from the terminology used in the Criminal Code, it is clear that Mr. Pudlat breached the trust that the community of Kimmirut placed in him when he was hired to supervise the activities of young people using the community’s recreationcentre, and, in any event, the 10-year age difference or the young age and immaturity and attendant vulnerability of the victims is an aggravating circumstance in the commission of these sexual offences.[14]Looking only at these two convictions for sexual assaults, the repetitive nature of the assaults on 12 and 13-year-old girls, in our view, required a denunciatory sentence, and, in the normal course of events, consecutive sentences, while again being careful to guard against an unduly harsh sentence in totality.[15]At the time of the sentencing hearing on September 21st, 2004, the sentencing judge had before her a pre-sentence report.In that pre-sentence report dated May 2004, the offender is described as being 25 years of age with a Grade 10-11 education, employed as a supervisor at the community recreation centre, in a common-law relationship of a few years, and with one child.It indicates he had no criminal record, that he was sexually abused himself when he was young.The pre-sentence report indicates Mr. Pudlat is remorseful and willing to take counselling.[16]The sentencing judge also had before her a psychiatrists’s report of Dr. Wood Hill.In that report, the psychiatrist indicates that he saw Mr. Pudlat for two hours on August 30th, 2004.The report describes the offender as a quiet, thoughtful individual, does not abuse alcohol or drugs, is not a pedophile, has no mental disorder, is not a significant risk to reoffend.The psychiatrist is unable to provide any specific connection between Mr. Pudlat’s own abuse and his becoming an abuser himself.[17]The sentencing judge in the Court below imposed a global sentence of two years less a day to be served as a conditional sentence in the community.In imposing that sentence, the main emphasis, perhaps the sole emphasis, was the rehabilitation of this offender, Gordon Pudlat.There was only a cursory reference to the important objective of denunciation.There was no specific reference to the important objective of deterrence, nor to the fundamental principle of proportionality.On this latter point, we reiterate the directive of Parliament that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.[18]We agree with the sentencing judge’s characterization of these offences as serious.With respect to the offender’s degree of responsibility, in our view, Mr. Pudlat had a high degree of moral culpability or blameworthiness, both with respect to the commission of the second or repeated spousal assault and with respect to the several acts of sexual intercourse with underage girls.At the time of committing the second spousal assault, he knew that it was wrong, as he had, just a month earlier, pleaded guilty to a similar spousal assault, and with respect to the sexual assaults, by his own admission, he knew that it was wrong to have sex with a girl under 14.[19]In all of these circumstances — in particular, the number of separate offences requiring consecutive sanctions — in our respectful view, the resulting global sentence must fall in the penitentiary range.For our purposes at this stage, we accept the Crown’s submission in the Court below that the appropriate range was three to three and a half years after consideration of the mitigating circumstances; in particular, the guilty pleas and the expression of remorse.For this reason, a conditional sentence pursuant to Section 742.1 of the Criminal Code was not available to this offender for these offences.[20]With respect, we find that the sentencing judge erred in principle in not giving appropriate weight to the principles of proportionality, denunciation and deterrence.Accordingly, we set aside the conditional sentence.In its place, we would imposea custodial sentence.We give Mr. Pudlat credit of six months for the portion of the conditional sentence already served, with a resulting sentence of two and a half years’ imprisonment.We grant leave to appeal.We allow the Crown’s appeal and impose a sentence of two and a half years’ imprisonment in place of the conditional sentence order.We will give a direction that he surrender himself to the RCMP in his home community of Kimmirut or Iqaluit forthwith.Richard J.A.Appeal heard at Iqaluit, NU, on the 18th day of May 2005"}

Taylor(Charged under s. 5(1) CDSA, s. 145(5.1) \u0026 s. 145(3) \u0026 s. 380(1)(b) of the Criminal Code)IN THE TERRITORIAL COURT OF THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIESIN THE MATTER OF:HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN-and-ANDREW DRASKOCZI______________________________________________________________________I.INTRODUCTION[1]Andrew Draskoczi has been convicted after trial of trafficking contrary to s. 5(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and he has pleaded guilty to fraudulently using a credit card, and 2 breaches of undertaking.After submissions were made with respect to sentence on these offences, I reserved my decision until today.II.FACTS[2]The facts of the trafficking offence are:in June 2007, Cst. Weatherby was working in an undercover capacity in Yellowknife in an operation known as Project Gargoyle; the operation was targeting street level drug dealers.[3]On June 23, 2007, Cst. Weatherby was driving around with another individual who was attempting to get some cocaine for Cst. Weatherby; they stopped outside of Boston Pizza, and Andrew Draskoczi got into the vehicle, and was introduced to Cst. Weatherby.The conversation in the vehicle was about cocaine and the difficulty of finding any – it was “pretty dry” in Yellowknife.At some point Draskoczi got out of the vehicle.Early in the morning of June 24, Cst. Weatherby, still in an undercover capacity, was outside the White Fox Bar around closing time and was told by one of his cover team that Draskoczi was in the area.Cst. Weatherby drove up to Draskoczi and initiated a conversation with him asking him“how’s it going”, Draskoczi replied “What do you need”, Cst. Weatherby told Draskoczi he was “looking for hard”, Draskoczi asked him “how much”, Cst. Weatherby told Draskoczi “an hour”, and Draskoczi asked him if he had “one twenty”.Cst. Weatherby handed Draskoczi six $20 bills.Cst. Weatherby then waited in his vehicle in the area for Draskoczi.Cst. Weatherby observed Draskoczi using a cell phone, and observed him speaking to a couple of males.Draskoczi then came and got into Cst. Weatherby’s vehicle which was parked close by, the two of them drove over to the White Fox again, and Draskoczi got out again and went into the crowd of patrons leaving the bar after closing.Draskoczi then got back into the vehicle and told Cst. Weatherby to drive to Fraser Tower.Cst. Weatherby drove and Andrew Draskoczi told him to stop at a white house that was known to Cst. Weatherby as a drug house.Draskoczi got out of the vehicle and told Cst. Weatherby that he would be back in a minute.Andrew Draskoczi did not return, with either cocaine or Cst. Weatherby’s money.[4]By “hard” Cst. Weatherby meant crack cocaine, by “an hour” Cst. Weatherby meant a gram; Andrew Draskoczi knew what was being discussed or talked about, knew what Cst. Weatherby was ‘ordering’, if I can put it that way.[5]The facts of the two breach charges are:on June 24, 2007, after being arrested, Andrew Draskoczi was released on a promise to appear and an undertaking given to a police officer.One of the conditions of the Undertaking was that Andrew Draskoczi was to report in person to the Yellowknife RCMP Detachment between 10:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.Andrew Draskoczi did report on June 25, 2007, but failed to report after that.On July 6, 2007, the charge of breach of undertaking given to a police officer was laid.On August 19 after being arrested on the Breach of Undertaking charge, Andrew Draskoczi was again released on an Undertaking given to a Justice, one of the conditions being that he report in person to the Yellowknife RCMP Detachment between 10:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.Andrew Draskoczi failed to report at all pursuant to this undertaking.[6]Lastly regarding the fraudulent use of a credit card:On February 17, an individual here in Yellowknife noticed that her wallet was missing – her wallet contained her driver’s license, identification, and Visa credit card – the last time she had used her credit card was February 15.Investigation revealed that her credit card had been used at numerous businesses in Yellowknife between February 15 and 16.Andrew Draskoczi, knowing he was not authorized to use the credit card, admitted to using the credit card at Shell Canada charging $162.82.[7]Mr. Draskoczi has been in custody on these and other outstanding matters since March 11, 2008, approximately 4.5 months.III.SENTENCE[8]The Crown is seeking a global sentence in the range of 2 to 2.5 years jail; Defence counsel on behalf of Mr. Draskoczi suggests that a sentence in the range of 18 months would be appropriate.I have considered the submission of both Crown and Defence, and given consideration to Mr. Draskoczi’s personal circumstances.[9]Andrew Draskoczi is 33 years old, and has amassed a terrible criminal record.There are 15 entries on his youth record with sentences ranging from CSW to probation to lengthy terms of secure custody.As an adult, he has a further 20 convictions, many related to the offences he is to be sentenced for today.As an adult, he has 7 prior convictions for offences against the administration of justice, 7 prior property related convictions.In June 2000, he was convicted of 2 counts of possession for the purposes of trafficking, contrary to s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, and received a sentence of 2 years; in July 2000, a sentence of 2.5 years was imposed; in August 2000, a further sentence of 5 months consecutive to the sentence he was serving.That translates to a penitentiary sentence of approximately 3 years.Mr. Draskoczi was released in June 2002, and recommitted in February 2003; he was released again in May 2003, and recommitted in June 2003.[10]The most serious matter Andrew Draskoczi has before the court today is the trafficking conviction.The maximum sentence is life imprisonment.From the facts, Andrew Draskoczi is low on the distribution chain – a street level trafficker at best; no cocaine actually changed hands here, but certainly there was an offer to sell a substance held out to be cocaine.Cst. Weatherby had only been introduced to Andrew Draskoczi earlier in the day, and yet Draskoczi showed no hesitation in offering to provide him with cocaine.[11]There are numerous cases from our courts in the Northwest Territories, dealing with street level traffickers in cocaine.It is unfortunate that there are so many reported cases, as it reflects the growing problem that cocaine poses in our communities.As Richard, J. said in R. v. D.P., [2004] NWTJ No. 73, cocaine has become a real scourge in our community, a scourge which has devastated the lives of many people.I have reviewed many cases from our jurisdiction which offer direction and guidance in sentencing for trafficking in cocaine, as well as cases which discuss the effect of the fact that no controlled substance is actually exchanged should have on the sentence.[12]In R. v. Furjes, [1992] N.W.T.J. No. 128, a case involving possession of 7 grams of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking,Furjes had a habit of drug use, and it was conceded that there were no indicia of large scale commercial activities and the evidence was more consistent with trafficking activities to support a personal habit.Furjes had a related record, with 2 prior simple possession convictions and a dated conviction for trafficking, all relating to soft drugs.Furjes was sentenced to 18 months in jail.[13]In R. v. Hein and R. v. Bryan, [1999] N.W.T.J. No. 92, both Hein and Bryan were dealers of street-level quantities of illicit drugs.Bryan had no prior criminal record, she was 32 years old and the mother of 3 children who were cared for by her mother.She was involved in 3 separate single gram sales of cocaine.Hein was involved in two separate 1 gram sales of cocaine.Hein had a related record with two prior convictions for simple possession of a narcotic, one possession conviction involving cocaine.Hein and Bryan were supplied by others higher up the chain.They dealt drugs as an ongoing activity so as to support themselves and their own drug habits.Both Hein and Bryan had 6 weeks pre-trial custody.Bryan was sentenced to 12 months jail and Hein to 15 months jail.[14]People traffic in illicit drugs for a multitude of different reasons:•to supply their habit; or to “be nice” as in the case of R. v. Fabian, [1999] N.W.T.J. No. 100, where the 20 year old accused was “just trying to be nice to the agent” - Fabian was dealing at the street level, and had a related record and 3 months pre-trial custody; Schuler, J. sentenced Fabian to 12 months jail.•Or to assist someone who appeared to be in discomfort as in R. v. Chamberlin, [2000] N.W.T.J. No. 25.Chamberlin was a security guard in a mall when he was approached by undercover agent who asked Chamberlin to get him some cocaine; Chamberlin obtained a gram of cocaine and a gram of marijuana and sold them to the undercover agent, alleging that he [Chamberlin] lost $20 on the sale but obtained the cocaine because the buyer appeared to be in some physical discomfort.Chamberlin was 20 years old and had no criminal record.Richard, J. sentenced Chamberlin to 10 months in jail.•Or to supply themselves and friends as in R. v. Swanson (1980), 5 W.C.B. 119 (N.W.T.C.A.) - Swanson with some of his own money and money from a friend and an undercover officer purchased approximately a gram of cocaine which he then distributed among himself, his friend and the undercover officer, the undercover officer getting approximately 1/3 of a gram. Swanson had no prior record.At trial Swanson was fined $1,750 and given 6 months probation; the Court of Appeal allowed the Crown’s appeal and imposed a sentence of 6 months jail.[15]The Court of Appeal stated in Swanson that the Northwest Territories, more than anywhere else in Canada, present special social problems not normally found in other parts of Canada and the climate should be made inhospitable to the introduction of narcotics in any form.Though the Court of Appeal increased the sentence in Swanson to 6 months jail, the Court (sitting as the Alberta Court of Appeal) in the later case of Maskell (1981), 1981 ABCA 50 (CanLII), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 408 (Alta. C.A.), specifically stated that the sentence in Swanson was “simply out of line” and must be disregarded.[16]Trafficking in cocaine has and continues to wreak havoc on our communities, on individuals, on families, on businesses – it preys on vulnerable victims, it results in many, many people and businesses being victims of spin off crimes.[17]As Richard J. said in R. v. Desjarlais, [2007] N.W.T.J. No. 23:The illegal trafficking in cocaine has caused huge social problems in our community in the past several years.……… [T]his sentencing decision is not just about Tom Desjarlais; it is also about the community.This is not a victimless crime.Cocaine trafficking has had a devastating effect on the citizens of this community in recent years, whether they are addicts, family members or dependents of addicts, recreational users, victims of violence, or just innocent property owners.The courts of this jurisdiction have long taken the position that those who are convicted for their involvement in cocaine trafficking can expect to receive a meaningful jail term.This has been felt to be necessary with a view to deterrence and, also, to denounce the continuing harm that is done to victims and to this community.[18]In R. v. Turner, 2006 NWTSC 64 (CanLII), [2006] N.W.T.J. No. 76, Richard, J. stated:The illegal trade in cocaine and crack cocaine in Yellowknife has had a devastating effect on the people and on the social life of our community. We know this because of the many cases that come before the courts where we see the snowball effect of the commission of crimes in this community. We see thefts, B and E's, assaults, domestic violence, and we have seen homicides, all related to cocaine addiction. We have seen broken families. We have seen destroyed lives.It has been said many times in this courtroom that the illegal cocaine trade is like a plague which has infested the social fabric of our community. Those who are involved in the supply and sale and trafficking of cocaine are like vultures or predators who are preying upon those weak members of the community who are addicted to this drug. The traffickers are doing this presumably for profit, for money. They apparently have no scruples about preying upon vulnerable people. For this reason alone, they ought to be punished. They are doing so even though there is a risk that they will end up in jail for a substantial period of time.[19]Richard, J. reiterated this position again in R. v. Gellenbeck, (2007) S-1-CR 2006000083:In all of these decisions by the courts in Alberta and the Northwest Territories, it has been made clear that unless there are unusual circumstances, a significant term of imprisonment will be imposed for trafficking in cocaine in order to satisfy the objectives of denunciation, deterrence, and the acknowledgement of the real harm that is done to the community and its citizens.(my emphasis)[20]As I said earlier, unfortunately, there is an abundance of cases where the courts have expressed the significant damage done by trafficking in cocaine, for example in:•R. v. Fraser, [2006] N.W.T.J. No. 90:Cocaine is a terribly addictive drug which spawns derivative crime.Trafficking in crack cocaine is a particularly serious crime, not only because it preys on the addiction of others for profit, but because of the incalculable damage and devastating consequences on our society in general, and addicted persons in particular.Or in,•R. v. Mudaliar, [2007] N.W.T.J. No. 40:Mr. Mudaliar’s crime is not a victimless crime.…[W]e regularly see evidence before the Court of the devastation that is caused to people’s lives and the serious harm done to the community.[21]There is also an abundance of cases wherein the courts have said that a meaningful jail sentence should and will be imposed for those who choose to participate in this life style.Those who traffic to support their addictions, those who are couriers, those who are salespeople, those who simply hold cocaine for others – they all play a role.Without them the “business” of trafficking in cocaine would dwindle, the “business” requires both the minor players and the major players.[22]I see no alternative but to impose a jail sentence in this case.I cannot ignore the effect this type of crime has on the community, I cannot ignore the need to denounce this behaviour, and to deter not only Mr. Draskoczi, but others as well from becoming involved in this type of life style.If people, including Mr. Draskoczi are going to choose to be part of the cocaine distribution business, even at the low end of the distribution chain, they have to realize the risk they are taking, and that the consequences will be severe.[23]Trafficking in crack cocaine is an activity that has become and continues to be a scourge on our communities.It destroys families, it destroys individuals, the activity leaves any number of victims in its wake.It has to be stopped.[24]In the north, the number of crimes associated with substance abuse can’t be overstated.It used to be that alcohol was the major problem in our communities, but sadly we are seeing more and more cases involving illicit drugs, cases involving trafficking in drugs, crimes of violence committed by those using illicit drugs, spin off crimes related to addictions to illicit drugs, child neglect related to parents who have become addicted to cocaine, it goes on and on.Trafficking in illicit drugs is the furthest thing from a victimless crime – the whole community is the victim.[25]The court’s role is to impose sentences that are meaningful and that will achieve the objectives of sentencing.The sentence that is imposed by the court must be one that will be seen by members of the community as severe enough that it will discourage not only Andrew Draskoczi, but as importantly, others from choosing to become part of this parasitic lifestyle.The sentence also has to express the community’s condemnation of this activity.[26]Section 718 of the Criminal Code sets out the fundamental purpose of sentencing, that being to contribute to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe community by imposing just sanctions.A sentence should:•denounce unlawful conduct;•deter offenders and other persons from committing offences;•if necessary, separate offenders from society;•assist in rehabilitating offenders;•provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and•promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.[27]A sentence must be proportional to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.[28]It may be that Andrew Draskoczi is relatively low on the distribution chain, he may be a “minor player” though he certainly was more than a social trafficker who was supplying friends or acquaintances.It seems that people barely known to him simply had to ask him “how’s it goin’” and he was ready to take their order and their money, ready and willing to supply them with cocaine.With respect to so-called “minor players” Richard J. said in Desjarlais:Mr. Desjarlais’ role in the cocaine trafficking enterprise is described as that of a minor player.With respect, however, that is merely a relative term.The existence of a cocaine trafficking enterprise in this community is a serious matter, and Mr. Desjarlais was part of it.[29]I have taken into account that Andrew Draskoczi has been convicted of trafficking (by offer) in a substance held out to be cocaine, that is that no cocaine actually changed hands in this case.In the case of R. v. Dumont, [1980] A.J. No. 189, where Dumont was convicted of trafficking in a substance held out to be heroin, a case where the substance sold did not analyze to in fact be heroin, the Alberta Court of Appeal held that it was an error in principle to equate the offence of trafficking in a substance held out to be heroin with the offence of actually trafficking in heroin itself.However the Court went on to state:We cannot treat the matter however merely as one of obtaining by false pretences.The Parliament of Canada has seen fit to make it a specific offence when one is trafficking in a substance held out, no doubt because it is all part and parcel of the drug scene.We think, too, that it is highly probable that in a case of holding out a substance to be heroin that the victim, if he is an addict, may crave the drug and turn to robbery or violence to get more money, and in addition there is the likelihood of violence to the one who has made the false pretence.We think the matter then has to be regarded more seriously than merely obtaining by false pretences.[30]In an earlier case, R. v. Lecapoy (1974), 1974 ALTASCAD 50 (CanLII), 18 C.C.C. (2d) 496 (Alta. S.C.A.D.), the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta also held that the nature of the substance in fact sold is an element that can properly be taken into account in conjunction with other circumstances.[31]The Ontario Court of Appeal expressed a similar view in R. v. Masters (1976), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 142.In Masters, an undercover officer approached Masters in a pool room and told him that he was interested in purchasing some heroin, which he referred to as \"junk\" at that time. At that time the appellant told him that he had some \"real good junk\". After a further discussion the appellant said \"my 'junk' goes for $130.00 a bundle.\" Pursuant to that discussion the appellant did deliver to the undercover officer a substance which the trial Judge found the appellant represented to be heroin. The substance was not in fact heroin or any other narcotic.The trial judge sentenced Masters as though he had in fact sold heroin.The Ontario Court of Appeal found that this was an error on the part of the trial judge.The Court of Appeal found there was no evidence that Masters believed he was selling heroin, but that the evidence was consistent with his attempting to perpetrate a fraud.In Masters, the court also recognized that there may be cases where no distinction need be drawn between trafficking in a substance held out to be, and trafficking in an actual narcotic, or controlled substance as they are now called.[32]Andrew Draskoczi also perpetrated a fraud on Cst. Weatherby.But the circumstances are much more serious than a $120 fraud or theft.This theft or fraud was in the context of trafficking in cocaine.[33]Mr. Draskoczi sentences of high territorial time, that is very close to 2 years, or penitentiary terms, over 2 years, are not uncommon for those convicted of being involved in the distribution of cocaine, even first time offenders.Realistically, Mr. Draskoczi, it may be fortunate that the person you decided to perpetrate the fraud on was an undercover officer; this type of activity too has to be deterred because of the violence that overshadows the world of illicit drug sales.I recall a case in Edmonton where two young men had sold a licorice nib to an undercover officer, holding it out to be a piece of hash.The court was told in that case of the seriousness of that offence, not because of the sale of a licorice nib for $20, but because such activity could so easily lead to a murder investigation.So, I do take into account that no cocaine was actually produced or sold here, but this situation, like Dumont and like Masters, is far more serious than a $120 fraud.This is a serious offence, and is so recognized by Parliament not drawing any distinction between the offences of trafficking in a controlled substance or a substance held out to be a controlled substance, no distinction between actually having the controlled substance change hands or simply offering to traffic in the substance.IV.CONCLUSION[34]On the charge of trafficking in a substance held out to be cocaine, taking into account that no cocaine actually changed hands, there will be a sentence of 18 months in jail.[35]On the fraudulent use of a credit card, considering the circumstances of that offence, and the aggravating circumstances of your past record for property offences, the fact thatyou were on process for at least three other criminal charges at the time, there will be a sentence of 4 months in jail.[36]On the breach of undertaking given to a police officer, there will be a sentence of 1 month in jail; on the breach of undertaking given to a justice, there will be a sentence of 2 months in jail.[37]If there had been no remand time I would have made all sentences consecutive to each other; to be clear, I do not see the 2 breaches of undertaking as one continuing act, and I would not make those sentences concurrent.I take into account that Mr. Draskoczi has been in pre-trial custody for approximately 4.5 months, but I also take into account that Mr. Draskoczi was detained after being released at least twice, and being charged with further offences.I will not give him double credit for pre-trial custody, but I will take into account that he does not earn statutory remission on pretrial custody, and will give him credit for 6 months.Consequently the sentences on fraudulent use of a credit card, and the breach of undertaking given to a justice, will be concurrent.The sentence on the breach of undertaking given to a peace officer will be consecutive – a total sentence of 19 months.[38]A 10 year mandatory firearms prohibition pursuant to section 109(1)(c) of the Criminal Code will also be imposed with respect to the conviction for trafficking.[39]Following your release from jail, you will be placed on probation for a period of 1 year.The terms of the probation will be as follows:•You are to be under the supervision of your Probation Officer, and report to your probation officer within 5 days of your release from jail, and thereafter as directed by your probation officer;•You are to make every effort to seek and maintain legitimate employment;•You are to have no direct or indirect contact with any known drug trafficker; and•You are to take and complete any counseling or programs recommended by your probation officer.[40]In the circumstances, taking into account that Andrew Draskoczi has been in jail for some time now, and will be incarcerated for some time to come still, the Victim of Crime Surcharge will be waived on all charges due to hardship.________________________________Bernadette E.

Boutsouvis for Mr. Agunbiade)Defendants))))HEARD:April 17, 2009.REASONS FOR SENTENCINGBOSWELL, J.Introduction:[1]The Defendants are jointly charged with a variety of offences including armed robbery, use of a disguise and possession of a prohibited weapon.[2]On April 2, 2009, the Defendants each entered guilty pleas to the following:(i)Robbery, contrary to section 343(d) of the Criminal Code;(ii)Wearing a face mask with intent to commit the indictable offence of robbery, contrary to section 351(2) of the Criminal Code;(iii)Possession of a loaded, restricted firearm, without authorization or license, contrary to section 95(1) of the Criminal Code; and,(iv)Occupying a motor vehicle in which they knew there was a firearm, contrary to section 94 of the Criminal Code.[3]A pre-sentence report was waived and the following are my reasons for the sentence imposed.The Facts:(a)The Circumstances of the Offence:[4]At approximately 12:20 a.m. on October 30, 2007, Mr. Agunbiade entered a Coffee Time restaurant on Highway 7 in Vaughan, Ontario.He was dressed in black and wore a mask and gloves to disguise his identity.There were no other customers in the store at that hour of the night.He robbed the lone, female attendant of money and cigarettes and then immediately fled the scene.[5]During the course of the robbery, Mr. Agunbiade pulled out a handgun.The gun wasloaded with two bullets, but it had a broken firing pin and was not in operable condition at the time of the robbery.Although he showed the weapon to the coffee shop attendant, Mr. Agunbiade did not point it at her.[6]The robbery was a joint enterprise between the Defendants.Mr. Miller was the “wheelman”, driving Mr. Agunbiade to and from the robbery.[7]The Defendants were both residents of Toronto at the time of the offences and had traveled to York Region for the purpose of committing the robbery.[8]About half an hour after the robbery, the Defendants were pulled over at a routine spot check being conducted by Toronto Police Service officers in north Toronto.An officer noticed an open bottle of alcohol in the car and proceeded to search it.The search yielded, amongst other things, several dark jackets, masks and a loaded semi-automatic gun.(b)The Circumstances of the Offenders:(i)Mr. Miller:[9]Mr. Miller was 23years old at the time of the offences and is presently 24.At the time of the offences he had no criminal record.He was initially released on a recognizance after about 2 weeks in custody.He subsequently breached the terms of the recognizance and was re-arrested.He has spent a total of approximately 10 months in pre-trial custody.[10]While awaiting trial on the robbery and firearms charges, Mr. Miller was convicted in the Ontario Court of Justice on a number of other charges, including possession of stolen license plates and possession of open liquor in his automobile.Those charges arose from the police stop on October 30, 2007.He was also convicted of the breach of recognizance.His sentence for the breach was 1 day in jail and 3 months time served in pre-trial custody.[11]There is an issue about whether, in this sentencing analysis, any credit afforded Mr. Miller for time served in pre-trial custody can include the 3 months referred to in the sentence for the breach of recognizance conviction.The Crown argues that Mr. Miller has already received credit for the 3 months of his time served.Any additional credit at this time would amount to double counting.Mr. Sederoff argues that, on a 2:1 credit, the sentence for breach would amount to 6 months – an excessive sentence for that offence.[12]I have reviewed the endorsement of Mr. Justice Armstrong on the Information laid in respect of the breach and other charges.It clearly refers to a sentence including 3 months of pre-trial custody.I have no evidence before me that any portion of that 3 months was meant to be reserved as a potential set-off against any future convictions.As such, Mr. Miller is left with 7 months of pre-trial custody to apply against the sentence imposed herein.[13]Mr. Miller has his high school diploma and has completed one year of a program in auto body work at Centennial College.He expresses a desire to return to that program of education.He has worked on and off at a number of different locations.He has a 19 month old daughter.He has a supportive family who have presented a plan of rehabilitation for him.(ii)Mr. Agunbiade[14]Mr. Agunbiade was 20 years old at the time of the offences.He is a week short of his 22nd birthday today.He has no prior criminal record.[15]Mr Agunbiade’s parents separated when he was 8 or 9 years old.His father died, at age 49, when Mr. Agunbiade was 14.His father’s death was hard on him.High school was not a successful time for him.He completed grade 10 and only parts of grade 11 and 12.He has worked on and off over the past several years in a variety of jobs.[16]He has 3 siblings, a brother, age 17 and two sisters, ages 19 and 20.His mother and his siblings are all productive members of their community.[17]Mr. Agunbiade began to live on his own at age 18.In October 2007, he was living alone in an apartment in Toronto.His girlfriend had left him and he was $5,000.00 in arrears in his rent.[18]Mr. Agunbiade did not have adequate sureties at the time of his arrest.He has been in custody since October 30, 2007 and accordingly has served approximately 18 months in pre-trial custody.(c)The Impact on the Victims[19]I have received and reviewed a victim impact statement from Jung Lee, the owner of the Coffee Time restaurant that was robbed.Ms. Lee was not working at the time of the robbery.Nevertheless she indicates that as a result of the robbery her sales have declined.She has had to equip the store with new locks.She has had difficulty finding employees to work the night shift and she herself has had difficulty sleeping.[20]No victim impact statement was received from the lone employee who was working at the time of the robbery.Her name is Palerma Malihan.The Crown provided me with a copy of a portion of her evidence given at the preliminary hearing.Her evidence was that she was working alone on the night in question, doing a shift from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m..Not surprisingly, she testified that she was scared during the robbery.She was afraid she might get shot if she did not do what was asked of her.Legal Parameters:[21]Pursuant to s. 344 of the Criminal Code of Canada (the “Code”), a conviction for robbery carries with it a maximum sentence of life imprisonment;[22]Pursuant to s. 351(2)(a) of the Code, a conviction for wearing a disguise with intent to commit an indictable offence carries with it a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment;[23]Pursuant to s. 95(2)(a) of the Code, a conviction for possession of a loaded, restricted firearm without authorization or license, carries with it a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a minimum sentence of 1 year imprisonment, in the case of a first offence.[1][24]Pursuant to s. 94(2), a conviction for being an occupant in a motor vehicle with knowledge that there is a firearm in the vehicle carries with it a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment.Positions of Crown and Defence:(i)The Crown[25]The Crown submits that the Defendants should receive different treatment.She points to their age differences and submits that the court should attribute a higher level of maturity to Mr. Miller.Moreover, she argues that Mr. Agunbiade accepted responsibility for at least some of his actions early on and has shown remorse, something she says is absent with Mr. Miller.[26]With respect to Mr. Agunbiade the Crown argues that a global sentence of four years is appropriate.The proposed sentence is comprised of two years each for the robbery, the wearing of a disguise and the possession of a firearm in an automobile, all to run concurrent to one another.A further one year consecutive is proposed for possession of a loaded handgun and finally a further one year consecutive for use of an imitation firearm in the commission of an indictable offence.[27]With respect to this latter charge, the Crown relied on s. 85(3) of the Criminal Code – a section under which charges had not been laid.Section 85(3) provides for a minimum one year sentence to be imposed on an accused who uses an imitation firearm during the commission of an indictable offence.Sentences under s. 85(3) are to run consecutive to any other sentences imposed for offences arising out of the same event or series of events.[28]It would not be appropriate for me to impose a sentence on Mr. Agunbiade pursuant to a provision of the Criminal Code under which charges were not laid.The Crown acknowledged in oral argument that s. 85(3) does not apply in this case.She nevertheless continued to pursue a global sentence of 4 years for Mr. Agunbiade.Crediting him for time served, she seeks a further sentence of one year’s incarceration.[29]With respect to Mr. Miller, the Crown seeks a global sentence of 4.5 years.(ii)The Defence[30]Mr. Agunbiade’s counsel submits that a global sentence of 3 years is appropriate.He describes Mr. Agunbiade as a youthful, first-time offender with good prospects for rehabilitation.He points out that Mr. Agunbiade sought to enter a plea at the earliest opportunity but was caught up in the proceedings between the Crown and his co-accused.He argues that the appropriate range of sentence for offenders with Mr. Agunbiade’s characteristics are 18-24 months on the robbery (including the disguise) and 12 to 24 months on the possession of a loaded firearm.He submits that 36 months in total is in the middle of the range and would be appropriate punishment in the circumstances of this case.He suggests a period of probation is appropriate beyond the time served.[31]Mr. Miller’s counsel submits that Mr. Miller was also a youthful, first-time offender at the time of the offences in issue.He points out that Mr. Miller also entered a guilty plea, though admits it was not at the earliest opportunity.He argues that the disparity principle should apply to Mr. Miller.He says Mr. Miller was the wheelman and was not the individual who entered the Coffee Time restaurant and robbed the attendant.He acknowledges his client’s culpability pursuant to s. 21 of the Criminal Code, as having aided and abetted the commission of the offences.Nevertheless, he says that it is still appropriate to consider the clear distinction in the roles between the two accused here.[32]Mr. Sederoff argues that, with respect to Mr. Miller, a global sentence in the range of 20 months is appropriate, together with a 2 year term of probation.Relevant Case Law:[33]All counsel agree that sentencing precedents for armed robberies vary widely, depending on the particular circumstances of the individual case.Nevertheless, numerous precedents were provided to me.I do not propose to refer to each of the cases provided, but I will comment on a general sampling of them.(i)Robbery:[34]In R. v. Burnett 2007 ONCA 478 (CanLII), a 19 year old accused was convicted of robbing a Blockbuster video store, while wearing a disguise and carrying an imitation firearm.The accused had no criminal record and favourable prospects for rehabilitation.There was no gratuitous violence involved in the offence.The accused had the support of his family.In light of these and other circumstances, the Court of Appeal imposed a sentence of 2 years less a day for the robbery, 3 months concurrent for the disguise with intent and 1 year consecutive for the use of the imitation firearm in the commission of an indictable offence.In other words, the global sentence was 3 years less 1 day.[35]In R. v. Swanek, [2001] O.J. No. 6033 (S.C.J.), a 19 year old accused was convicted of two counts of armed robbery, one count of wearing a disguise and one count of using an imitation firearm in the commission of an offence.In one robbery a large knife was brandished. Both robberies were of clerks working in small establishments late at night.The trial judge imposed a sentence of 2 years for each of the robberies, to run concurrently, plus a 1 year term for the use of an imitation firearm in the commission of an indictable offence, to run consecutively, for a global sentence of 3 years.An appeal against sentence was dismissed by the Ontario Court of Appeal (reported at [2006] O.J. No. 4783).[36]In R. v. Spence, 2004 CanLII 34919 (ON CA), [2004] O.J. No. 4449 (Ont. C.A.),a 20 year old accused was convicted of robbery, wearing a disguise and use of an imitation firearm in connection with the robbery of a Pizza Pizza deliveryman.The Court of Appeal discussed the importance of denouncing serious crimes of this nature, but also considered the youthful offender’s prospects for rehabilitation.The trial judge had imposed a sentence of 5 years on top of 7 months of pre-trial custody.The Court of Appeal reduced the sentence to 2.5 years for the robbery plus a mandatory one year consecutive for the use of the imitation firearm, for a global sentence of 3.5 years (4.5 years inclusive of pre-trial custody).[37]In R. v. A.C., 2008 ONCJ 614 (CanLII), the accused was charged with four counts of armed robbery, committed within days of one another.The accused was a young offender at the time of two of the robberies and an adult at the time of the other two.All of the robberies were of convenience stores or gas bars.In each case, two accomplices robbed the store attendants while armed and wearing disguises.The accused drove the getaway car.After being given credit for the equivalent of 3 months pre-trial custody, the accused was sentenced to 33 months in jail.(ii)Possession of a Loaded Firearm:[38]In R. v. Grant, 2006 CanLII 18347 (ON CA), [2006] O.J. No. 2179 (Ont. C.A.)[2] an 18 year old first offender was convicted of five offences relating to the possession of a loaded firearm.He was found in possession of the firearm in the middle of the day near a high school and while also in possession of marijuana.He was sentenced to 18 months.[39]In R. v. S.C., [2006] O.J. No. 3893 (Ont. C.A.), a 19 year old accused with a past record for assault causing bodily harm, was convicted of three weapons offences, including possession of a restricted weapon with readily accessible ammunition.The Court of Appeal found that at the time the appeal was heard, the accused had served a sentence equivalent to 2 years less 1 day -a sentence considered appropriate in all the circumstances.[40]In R. v.Carranza, [2004] O.J. No. 6041 (S.C.J.), the accused was convicted of two counts of possession of a loaded firearm and two counts of possession of a prohibited firearm, knowing that it had been obtained by the commission of an offence within Canada.He was 23 at the time of sentencing.A sentence of one year plus 18 months probation was imposed.(iii)Disparity Principle:[41]R. v. Drisdelle, 2002 CanLII 41547 (ON CA), [2002] O.J. No. 3901 (Ont. C.A.) is a case involving one of three individuals involved in the robbery of a pizza store and gas bar.Mr. Drisdelle, aged 19, was the driver of the getaway car in both robberies.During the robberies, his accomplices had worn masks and carried weapons.One accomplice was a young offender.The other received two years less a day.The trial judge imposed a sentence of 18 months incarceration and 18 months probation.[42]On appeal, the Court of Appeal reduced the sentence to 12 months on the basis that Mr. Drisdelle’s conduct had to be contrasted with that of his co-accused.While his role was serious, it did not involve the use of violence or weapons or an attempt to disguise.Disparity of sentence was a principle that deserved serious consideration in this instance as Mr. Drisdelle’s role could be clearly distinguished from the role of his accomplices.Mitigating and Aggravating Factors:[43]Section 718.2 of the Code mandates that the Court consider any relevant mitigating or aggravating factors relating to the offence or the offender that may increase or reduce the sentence to be imposed.(i)Mitigating Factors:[44]I have considered the following factors as mitigating ones in the circumstances of this matter:(i)Each of the Defendants entered guilty pleas.Admittedly, those pleas came as the trial was about to commence.Nevertheless, they did save the Crown and the courts several weeks of trial time and they saved the victims of the robbery offence from having to attend at court and testify.In Mr. Agunbiade’s case, the Crown accepts that he would have entered a guilty plea significantly sooner had his circumstances not been bound up with those of Mr. Miller;(ii)Each of the Defendants is a youthful offender with no prior criminal record.I acknowledge that Mr. Miller is a little older than Mr. Agunbiade and is approaching an age when the characterization of “youthful offender” will no longer apply.I do accept, however, that at the time of the offences, both remained youthful offenders;(iii)I accept that both Mr. Miller and Mr. Agunbiade have positive prospects for rehabilitation.Both come from good and supportive families.Neither has a prior criminal record.No evidence was submitted to suggest that rehabilitation should not be given serious consideration with respect to these two offenders;(iv)Although robbery with an imitation firearm is a very serious offence of violence, there was no gratuitous violence here.The firearm was not pointed at the victim.Quite frankly, I do not consider this factor to be so much as a mitigating one, but more so a factor that is not aggravating in the circumstances; and,(v)Each of the Defendants has been in pre-trial custody:Mr. Agunbiade for 18 months and Mr. Miller for 7 months.I am prepared to credit them with time served on a 2:1 basis, such that Mr. Agunbiade has a credit of 36 months and Mr. Miller has a credit of 14 months.(ii)Aggravating Factors:[45]There are a number of aggravating factors that I have considered, including the following:(i)The robbery occurred in the middle of the night.It involved the lone attendant of a donut shop – someone who was in a particularly vulnerable position;(ii)It involved a disguise, though I note that the use of a disguise is already part of a separate charge for which a conviction has been entered, so it can not truly be said, in my view, to be an aggravating factor;(iii)There was a level of sophistication and planning to the robbery.It occurred in York Region, while the Defendants were both residents of Toronto.They specifically arranged to travel to York Region to commit the offence, presumably lessening the likelihood of identification and increasing the likelihood of escape;(iv)A firearm was used.Although it was agreed that it was not operational at the time of the robbery, it was loaded with two rounds of ammunition.Principles of Sentencing:[46]Section 718(1) of the Code establishes the fundamental purpose of sentencing:to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and,(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.[47]Without lessening the importance of the remaining factors enumerated by s. 718(1) of the Code, I consider the principles of denunciation and deterrence to be of paramount significance in this case.Robbery, while armed with an imitation firearm is an extremely serious offence.Possession of a loaded firearm is also a serious offence.Substantial sentences are warranted to convey the clear message that offences of this nature will be severely punished.[48]The serious and growing danger posed by gun crimes in our community was recently discussed at some length by Mr. Justice Binnie in R. v. Clayton and Farmer,[2007]S.C.C. No. 32, at para. 108. There he referred to gun calls engaging the “fundamental issues of public peace and public order” and went on to observe that the public can not be expected to tolerate guns “flourished or waved about in public places.”[49]Given the ages of the Defendants, however, and the fact that neither had a criminal record at the time of the offences, rehabilitation remains an important consideration as well.Sentences:[50]The robbery of a vulnerable attendant working alone in an all-night donut shop is very serious.It strikes fear into the heart of the immediate victim, but at the same time victimizes the entire community.It brings into question the safety of the community as a whole.[51]In this instance, the Defendants are both youthful, first-time offenders.Rehabilitation remains an important objective for both of them.They have the support of their families and they both express, directly or through counsel, the desire to rehabilitate themselves and get back on the right track to becoming productive members of their communities.[52]Having considered the authorities that the Crown and defence counsel have provided to me, I consider the appropriate sentencing range for the robbery charge to be 24 to 36 months.The range for possession of a loaded, restricted weapon appears to be 12 to 24 months, with a 12 month minimum.[53]The totality of the sentences imposed is, of course, the overarching principle in arriving at appropriate punishments.[54]A significant issue in determining the length of the sentences imposed was whether the conviction under s. 95(1) for possession of a loaded, restricted firearm should be imposed consecutively or concurrently.The Crown has sought a consecutive sentence.Section 95(2) does not require that a sentence imposed under that section be consecutive to any other sentence.[55]The general principle is that where there is a reasonably close nexus between the offences in time and place, and where they appear to be part of one continuing operation, the sentences should be concurrent:see R. v. Dass, [2008] O.J.No. 1161 (S.C.J.) per Clark J. at para. 115.In my view, there is a close nexus between the offences here in time and place.It appears the Defendants committed the robbery and were stopped a very short time later at a routine roadside spot check, where they were arrested.The gun involved in the robbery was the same gun found in Mr. Miller’s vehicle a short time later.In my view, it is appropriate that all sentences imposed run concurrent to one another.[56]With respect to the weapons charges, I expressed concern to counsel about the fact that the Defendants have entered guilty pleas to two counts which require a finding that the gun was a restricted firearm.On the robbery count, the conviction requires a finding that the gun was an imitation firearm – in other words that it was not operable.[57]The Crown and defence counsel have agreed that a distinction can be made between the condition of the firearm at the time of the robbery and at the time the gun was recovered in Mr. Miller’s vehicle.They have prepared, signed and filed an Agreed Statement of Facts that, at the time of the robbery, the gun was not operable and could not be made operable at the scene and as such must be considered to be an imitation firearm for the purposes of the robbery charge.For the charges laid under sections 94 and 95(1), however, it is agreed that the gun could have been made operable at a future time and that the definition of “firearm” for the purposes of those sections has been satisfied.[58]I am prepared to accept counsel’s submissions and their agreed Statement of Facts, even though there is an apparent inconsistency in the treatment of the gun.It remains the case, in any event, that Mr. Agunbiade entered the Coffee Time restaurant and robbed it with a loaded gun.Though it is agreed it was not operable at the time, it is not clear that either Mr. Agunbiade or Mr. Miller knew that, although Mr. Agunbiade indicated to an arresting officer that he thought the gun might not work.[59]The use of the gun in the commission of the robbery offence is a significant aggravating factor in my mind and it calls for sentences in the upper end of the range provided by counsel.[60]In terms of Mr. Agunbiade, I believe that a global sentence of 3 years incarceration is appropriate.The sentence is broken down as follows:(i)3 years for the robbery;(ii)3 months for the wearing of a disguise during the commission of the robbery and 3 months for being an occupant in a motor vehicle in which he knew there was a restricted firearm, both to run concurrently; and,(iii)1 year for possession of the loaded, restricted firearm, to run concurrently.[61]As indicated, I am giving Mr. Agunbiade credit for 36 months for the time served in pre-trial custody, so his net sentence is for time served.In addition, however, I impose two years of probation, on terms that he:(i)keep the peace and be of good behaviour;(ii)appear before the court when required to do so by the court;(iii)report to a probation officer within two working days and thereafter when required by the probation officer and in the manner directed by the probation officer;(iv)notify the court or the probation officer in advance of any change of name or address, and promptly notify the court or the probation officer of any change of employment or occupation.[62]With respect to Mr. Miller, I agree with his counsel that disparity of sentences is an important principle to consider in these circumstances.Mr. Miller was the wheelman.He did not brandish the gun and he did not wear the disguise.Nevertheless his role was a serious one.I impose upon him a sentence of 30 months, comprised of the following:(i)2 ½ years for the robbery;(ii)3 months for each of the use of disguise and occupation of a motor vehicle with knowledge that it contained a restricted weapon, to run concurrently; and,(iii)12 months for the possession of the loaded, restricted firearm, to run concurrently.[63]Mr. Miller has 7 months of pre-trial custody and I will grant him 14 months credit on the basis of 2:1.His net sentence will accordingly be 16 months incarceration.In addition, I also impose two years of probation upon him, on the same terms as those imposed upon Mr. Agunbiade.Ancillary Orders:[64]The following ancillary Orders are also made:(i)The Defendants shall be prohibited for life from possessing any firearm, cross-bow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition, and explosive substance, pursuant to section 109 of the Code;(ii)A DNA order under s. 487.051(1)(b);(iii)A victim fine surcharge in accordance with s. 737(1)and (2) and,(iv)A weapons forfeiture order under s. 491(1);[65]The balance of charges set out in the indictment are withdrawn by the Crown.___________________________Boswell, J.Released:April 20, 2009.[1] The mandatory minimum sentence under s. 92(2)(a)was increased to 3 years in May 2008, after the offences in this case were committed.[2] Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada heard April 24, 2008 and reserved."}

(Orally)[1]Ms Harry, you have pleaded guilty to one count of Dangerous Operation of a Motor Vehicle Causing Death, and one count of Dangerous Operation of a Motor Vehicle Causing Bodily Harm.[2]The offences occurred on April 18, 2009 at approximately 12:50 a.m.On that date, you were driving a vehicle at a high rate of speed on a gravel road in the vicinity of Black River First Nation.The vehicle collided with a school bus, which was parked on the highway.Your brother, Gerald Harry, who was a passenger in the vehicle, died as a result of injuries he sustained in the accident.Percy Raven, a friend of yours, who was a passenger in the backseat, suffered serious injuries, including a fractured shoulder blade, torn axilla, a broken leg, broken ribs, a collapsed lung, a ruptured diaphragm, bruising and scratches.His thumb was amputated.He was hospitalized for two weeks.You were also hospitalized as a result of the accident.[3]The speed limit in the area where the accident took place was 50 kilometers per hour.Just prior to the impact, you were travelling approximately 92 to 96 kilometers per hour.Your blood alcohol level at the time of the accident was between 72 milligrams percent and 127 milligrams percent.Position of the Crown and Defence[4]The Crown takes the position that an appropriate sentence is a penitentiary term between two to three years.[5]Your counsel takes the position that a suspended sentence would be an appropriate disposition.Analysis[6]In sentencing you, I must take into consideration the purposes and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code.Section 718.2(e) requires me to take into account your Aboriginal status.Accordingly, what is commonly referred to as a Gladue pre-sentence report was ordered.[7]This report is generally a positive one.It indicates for the most part you have been a responsible member of your community and that you have strong family supports.Even though education is not a priority among members of your reserve, you have successfully completed grade 12.In spite of the limited opportunities for employment in your community, you have had at least two jobs.You worked at the Black River School as a secretary for two years and prior to that at a health clinic for six months.While you have had both alcohol and drug issues in the past, you appear to be to be successfully dealing with them, with the assistance of family and friends.You have the support of your parents.In fact, your mother has written a letter to the court in your support.[8]Based on your history, I believe you are a good candidate for rehabilitation.Your only prior convictions were in January, 2009 for theft under $5,000 and failing to appear.You have accepted responsibility for the accident by pleading guilty.You are genuinely remorseful.You have not been re-involved in any offence since the accident.You have suffered the loss of a brother and your friend was seriously injured.Under all the circumstances, you are probably at a low risk to reoffend.[9]I do not believe a lengthy custodial sentence will do anything to enhance your prospects of rehabilitation.Nevertheless, I cannot agree with your counsel that a suspended sentence would be an appropriate disposition.The sentence I impose upon you must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of your responsibility.Where a person is convicted of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle, particularly where death or bodily injuries are caused, public protection, denunciation and general deterrence are very important considerations.A suspended sentence would not adequately address the level of your moral culpability.In this case, there was a high degree of moral culpability on your part.You were driving at a speed far in excess of the posted speed limit and your consumption of alcohol was clearly a factor in the accident.[10]You voluntarily assumed the risk of driving at a high rate of speed after having consumed alcohol.This was not a momentary lapse of judgment.The sentence imposed upon you must be sufficient to adequately express society’s denunciation of this conduct and to deter others from becoming involved in similar offences.[11]However, I am satisfied a more lenient sentence than the one suggested by the Crown is appropriate in your case.I believe a somewhat shorter custodial sentence followed by a period of probation is more likely to enhance your prospects of rehabilitation.You are a relatively young offender – just 26 years of age.You are a single mother with a three-year-old child.A sentence of less than 2 years will allow you to serve the sentence in Manitoba, where you will be closer to your family supports and your child.Disposition[12]Accordingly, I am sentencing you to be imprisoned for a term of 18 months on each count.The sentences will be served concurrently.[13]I am also ordering you to enter into a probation order for a period of two years from the expiration of the term of imprisonment, upon the following conditions, that you must:1)Keep the peace and be of good behavior;2)Appear before the court when required to do so by the court;3)Notify your probation officer or the court before you change your name or address and promptly tell your probation officer or the court if you change your job or occupation;4)Report to a probation officer within two working days after your release from prison; after you report the first time, you must continue to report when and how you are told by the probation officer;5)Stay in the Province of Manitoba, unless your probation officer gives you written permission to go outside the province;6)Not consume alcohol, other intoxicating substances, or drugs, except in accordance with a medical prescription;7)Perform 100 hours of community service work as directed by your probation officer.The community service work must be completed by December 31, 2015.8)Attend, participate in and complete counseling as directed by your probation officer;9)Attend an addictions assessment and comply with the recommendations as directed by the probation officer;10)Reside at House 96, Black River, Manitoba.[14]Both offences are secondary designated offences within the meaning of the Criminal Code.The Crown is applying for a DNA order.I have considered your criminal record, the nature of the offences and the circumstances surrounding their commission and the impact a DNA order would have upon your privacy and security of your person.As I am satisfied it is in the best interests of the administration of justice to do so, I am making an order authorizing the taking of bodily substances from you for forensic DNA analysis.[15]I am making an order prohibiting you from operating a motor vehicle in Canada for a period of five years.[16]As I am satisfied payment of the victim fine surcharge would cause you undue hardship, I am making an order exempting you from payment of it.J."}

Walker,- and -)for the Accused)KELLY ZABOROWICZ,))Sentence deliveredAccused.)May 16, 2014_____ALLEN, P.J.(Orally)This, of course, is the sentencing of Kelly Zaborowicz.The accused, Kelly Zaborowicz, has pled guilty to Criminal Code offence, Section 334(a), theft over $5,000.00.The theft arose out of her employment as a nanny, personal assistant, and housekeeper, for Susan Wortzman, and her late husband, John Scurfield.Ms. Zaborowicz worked for the victims from July 1st, 2008, until March 25th, 2011.The sentencing of this matter began on September 16th, 2013, and was put over to October 11th, 2013, for further submissions.At that time defence counsel requested that the court order a report from Restorative Resolutions and a pre-sentence report, PSR.Final submissions were made on January 6th, 2014.A pre-sentence report was prepared but Restorative Resolutions declined to prepare a restorative resolutions plan.The sentencing of this matter was reserved to today's date.Facts.Ms. Zaborowicz was hired by the complainant and her late husband in July of 2008.At the time she was hired she was told that Mr. Scurfield was terminally ill, and it was explained to her that she would be expected to play a stabilizing role in the life of both the couple's infant son, and the maintenance of the family's home.At some point, while employed with the victims, Ms. Zaborowicz stole cheques and a credit card from Ms. Wortzman.She subsequently fraudulently wrote 192 cheques to numerous businesses for personal items purchased for her own use.Also while employed, the offender stole a credit card that Ms. Wortzman had activated but never used, and then used that credit card to make $57,549.95 worth of purchases for herself.The offender continued to write cheques for her own use and fraudulently utilized the credit card even after her employment with Ms. Wortzman ended in March of 2011.The total loss to the complainant was $165,673.21.The money stolen by the offender was used for the purchase of mattresses, orthodontics, golf equipment, dues at the YMCA, automobile tires, a leather sofa and loveseat, a dining room table, a home theatre system, jewellery, clothing, spa treatments, hair salon services, and luggage. The 192 stolen cheques totaled $165,673.21.That total included forged cheques Ms. Zaborowicz used to pay for items purchased on the stolen credit card to the amount of $57,549.95.The Crown provided an example of some of the fraudulent purchases.These included: March 14th, 2010, Future Shop electronics purchased in the amount of $2,441.55; May 21st, 2010, Golf Town, golf equipment valued at $980.00; May 23, 2010, again to Golf Town on McGillivray Boulevard to purchase golf accessories amounting to $357.07. Between June 23rd, 2010, and September 23rd, 2010: Defresne Furniture - items including a leather sofa and loveseat, a coffee table and a dining table and six chairs valued at $4,846.56.September 8th, 2011: Golf Town once again - golf equipment valued at $409.85.Other large purchases made by Ms. Zaborowiczusing the stolen credit card included: January 9th, 2010, The Bay - $1550.28 for a mattress and box spring;February 8th, 2010: ACP Orthodontics - $896.00;Future Shop, also that same day, a 5.1 channel home theatre system, a Sony blu-ray disc player and a Sony 46 inch LCD television.All of the electronics and furniture were delivered by the respective stores to Ms. Zaborowicz's residence.In addition, Ms. Zaborowicz made purchases at Tommy Hilfiger, RW\u0026CO. (which is a clothing store at Polo Park), Mappins Jewellers, Ben Moss Jewellers, Fabutan, Manitoba Liquor Mart, Urban Trail, and Mark's Work Warehouse.These activities did not stop until September 12th, 2011, when the complainant realized that there was something amiss with her bank account and contacted Winnipeg Police.Police subsequently contacted Ms. Zaborowicz and on September 29th, 2011, the accused turned herself in to police.On October 12th, 2011, acting under the authority of a warrant, police searched Ms. Zaborowicz's residence and seized goods purchased with the stolen credit card in the amount of $9,035.03.The complainant, Ms. Wortzman, subsequently brought a civil suit against Ms. Zaborowicz.The offender did not contest the action.Ms. Wortzman received a judgment for $165,673.21 and costs of $18,443.57.No monies have been voluntarily paid towards this judgment.The court was told that the accused had been employed for approximately one year before being garnished pursuant to the civil judgment.Pursuant to the Garnishment Order, $7,246.08 was taken from Ms. Zaborowicz's paycheques.At some point, in approximately January of 2013, the offender became ill and was not able to work.Counsel submitted that at the time of the initial hearing of this matter for sentencing, Ms. Zaborowicz had been off work due to meningitis for approximately one year.When this matter returned to court in January of this year, I was told that she had returned to work and had saved $200.00, which she intended to provide to the victim.The court was told that the fraudulent purchases made on the stolen credit card took place between December 23rd, 2008, and September 12th, 2011.The stolen cheques were dated from September 17th, 2008, to September 7th, 2011.The majority of the cheques were payable to the offender and then deposited into her bank account.The remainder of the cheques were used to pay off the balance of the stolen Hudson's Bay Company credit card.Position of the parties.The Crown and defence both agree that a period of incarceration is called for.The Crown believes that the jail sentence should be served in a provincial institution, and that incarceration in an institution is required to address the sentencing principles of general deterrence and denunciation.Defence counsel argues that those sentencing principles, when balanced with the sentencing principle of rehabilitation, can be met through the imposition of a Conditional Sentence Order.I will refer to a Conditional Sentence Order as I go along as the CSO.The maximum penalty for this offence is 10 years of imprisonment.Although at the time of this offence a CSO was an available disposition, with amendments to the Criminal Code of Canada in January of 2012 a Conditional Sentence Order is no longer an available sentence for crimes committed after that date.Background of the accused.Ms. Zaborowicz comes before the court with no criminal record.She has pled guilty to the offence, saving the Crown what could otherwise have been a complicated prosecution.The Pre-Sentence Report prepared by Curtis Moore from Restorative Resolutions, provided information that Ms. Zaborowicz became pregnant when 16 years old.She subsequently left school, but later attended night classes through Adult Education and obtained a GED.It is also related in the PSR that she suffered from asthma as a child and did not develop close friendships.She also indicated that in high school, she had aspirations to be a nurse and is currently inquiring about taking training to be a health care aide.In terms of employment, Ms. Zaborowicz was employed at Grand \u0026 Toy for approximately 18 years until losing her job in 2008. At that point she was engaged by Ms. Wortzman and Mr. Scurfield.After her employment with the victim ended in 2011, she was employed on a full-time basis as a store manager at Stokes Incorporated.As reported in the PSR, the accused told Mr. Moore that she contracted meningitis in January of 2013 and subsequently lost her job.Ms. Zaborowicz is now earning $18.00 per hour as a result of recently rejoining the workforce.Ms. Zaborowicz also reported that she had declared bankruptcy in 2000 after accruing significant debt with her ex-husband.As well, she told Mr. Moore that she had had her wages garnished \"approximately 10 years ago\" as a result of unpaid rent.The accused is currently living in an apartment with her youngest daughter.Amongst other expenses, she has a monthly payment on a debt to the Steinbach Credit Union in the amount of $5,000.00.Ms. Zaborowicz told the Probation Officer that she had a \"close relationship\" with her mother.However, when contacted, the offender's mother told Mr. Moore that she was \"shocked to hear what she did, as she thought (she) was working two jobs, and that is why she was not having any financial difficulties”.That's found in the PSR at the end of page 5 and the start of page 6.The mother also indicated that her daughter had never told her the details of the theft, and what she knows about it, she found out from newspaper articles.This lack of communication also applied to the offender's sister and brother, both of whom said they had not discussed the offence with their sister.It was this lack of communication with her family which resulted in Restorative Resolutions refusing to do a report on Ms. Zaborowicz.Mr. Moore, the Probation Officer who works for Restorative Resolutions, explained the situation in an email to counsel (Exhibit 4), which said:It has been determined that she is not a suitable candidate for a Restorative Resolutions community based plan.Ms. Zaborowicz does not meet the criteria for accepting responsibility and being accountable in her life.This was determined after speaking (with) family collaterals.It appears that although the family is aware of her offence, it is only because of what they have read in the paper.The family has never talked with Ms. Zaborowicz about the offence and she has never opened up to them about the offence.The family does, however, state they will support her however they can.And that's the end of the quote from Mr. Moore.It was later determined at the sentencing hearing that Mr. Moore's opinion that Ms. Zaborowicz had not accepted responsibility and was not being accountable arose because she had not revealed the details of the offence to her family.In being interviewed for the preparation of the PSR, Ms. Zaborowicz told the reporter that \"part of the money taken over the years was to help her financially with rent, groceries, clothes, and cash for his (her brother's) family.\" When contacted by the Probation Officer, the brother denied ever receiving financial help from his sister.Ms. Zaborowicz has two daughters ages 18 and 26.She does not have a relationship with her ex-husband, who she described as “an abusive and controlling individual”.Ms. Zaborowicz says that both her daughters have, at various times been, in her words, mentally unstable, and she told the court that her younger daughter had attempted suicide shortly before this matter appeared in court for sentencing.Mr. Moore asked Ms. Zaborowicz what she had used the credit card for.She replied:I was using the credit card and money for personal reasons.She indicated that she would purchase food for her family, pay rent, monthly bills, buy furniture, clothes, and stuff for grandchildren, braces for her youngest daughter and sending her child to camp.Ms. Zaborowicz also mentions that she went to the bar every weekend, on both Friday and Saturday nights, with her sister for a majority of the three years she was employed by Ms. Wortzman.That is from page 8 of the PSR.Ms. Zaborowicz reported to Mr. Moore that she had “never had any issues with drugs or alcohol”, and there is no indication that theft was motivated by issues of drug or alcohol addiction.It should be noted that Ms. Zaborowicz is assessed in the Pre-Sentence Report as being a medium risk to re-offend.In this regard, the report states:There are no significant criminogenic risk factors for this individual.Other factors that may have criminogenic potential and have an impact on this case are; underachievement, financial problems, parenting concerns, depression, low self-esteem, past suicide attempt, other emotional distresses such as her pending court date, family concerns, past physical, sexual, emotional abuse, and being interpersonally anxious.And that is from page 9 of the Pre-Sentence Report.Victim impact.Susan Wortzman testified before the court as to how she has been impacted by this crime.She told the court that of particular impact upon her was the fact that she had trusted Kelly Zaborowicz \"with the care of my son and my home,\" and that she had breached that trust and betrayed her.She said the shock and impact of this event has \"created ongoing difficulties for me in my professional, personal and family relationships.\"She says that to this day, she finds it very hard to trust others, including those with whom she places her son.She pointed out that as a single, working parent this is particularly stressful.Ms. Wortzman told the court that her loss of confidence in others has extended to her workplace, where she now \"discloses little information and keeps all records under lock and key.\"She related that she has installed comprehensive security systems in her home and has alarms activated at all times.Physically she said that she suffered many sleepless nights and she missed work due to exhaustion.Ms. Wortzman also talked about the hours of time spent with the police in an effort to determine what had been stolen.The impact on Ms. Wortzman was so severe that she ended up in therapy and included costs, and, and incurred costs to pay for that counselling.The depth of the anguish felt by Ms. Wortzman is underscored by her statement:I continue to this day to be impacted by the actions of Kelly.When my husband and I first hired Kelly it was after he had been diagnosed with stage 4 melanoma.I clearly remember my husband, John, telling Kelly about his terminal illness and asking her if she could stick around through what was likely to be a terrible time for our family.He said we needed somebody who could help support our family.He passed away in November of 2009.After that time as an only parent who travelled for work, I left Kelly, and trusted her implicitly to look after my son, my home, and help with some personal clerical matters.I needed tremendous support during this time and it feels like such a nightmare for me that a person in whom I placed so much trust betrayed me.Returning to the position of the parties.The Crown seeks a period of incarceration in a provincial institution.The Crown cited various factors in support of this position including their assertion that the Pre-Sentence Report reveals discrepancies between statements made by the offender and contradictory remarks made by other members of her family.The Crown also takes the position that on the whole the report is not positive.The Crown also noted that the PSR considers that Ms. Zaborowicz is a medium risk to re-offend.Further the Crown argued that the sheer magnitude of the theft in this matter calls for a significant sentence.Additionally the Crown suggested that sentencing considerations should include the fact that no stolen monies have been returned other than by garnishment and that the offender has never offered a repayment plan.The Crown argued that this crime is not only a breach of trust, but is a particularly egregious breach of trust in that a large portion of these fraudulent transactions took place when the victim was particularly vulnerable.In this regard the Crown pointed out that Ms. Wortzman's husband, John Scurfield, died on November 14th, 2009, and on November 9th, 2009, Ms. Zaborowicz signed a cheque for $1,347.00.On November 16th, 2009, two days after Mr. Scurfield's death she signed a cheque to herself for $895.47.And on November 30th, 2009, she signed a cheque for $1357.00.The Crown, in support of their suggestion that the principles of sentencing call for denunciation and deterrents in this situation suggested that the fact that Ms. Zaborowicz is a first offender should not preclude jail as it is normally the case that breach of trust thefts involve first offenders because it is people who do not have criminal records that are trusted by employers.Finally, the Crown argued that this crime is one of greed and as such should be dealt with accordingly.Defence position.Defence counsel argued that the principles of sentencing in this case can be adequately met by a period of incarceration in the community.In support of this position the following was presented:The accused not having made restitution payments before being garnished should not be held against her as any payments would be \"an admission against interest\".The PSR interview makes it clear that Ms. Zaborowicz is ashamed of what she has done and that she is currently more focused on issues with her daughter than she is on her own situation.Defence counsel argued that Mr. Zaborowicz's brother is an unusual person, and he may not have been completely accurate in denying to Curtis Moore that his sister had given him money.The PSR risk assessment which lists Ms. Zaborowicz as a medium risk to re-offend is contradictory because it says she has no significant criminogenic factors.Counsel argued that Ms. Zaborowicz has already suffered as the threat of jail has been hanging over her head for a considerable period of time.Additionally counsel argued that a Conditional Sentence Order is within an acceptable range of sentence for this type of offence and that the court should be mindful of the Criminal Code Section 718.2(e) which says that all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered.Counsel pointed out that the court was provided with letters of reference from her daughters and that the court should consider the offender's background as additionally revealed in those letters.Counsel stressed that his client has coping problems and is vulnerable, that she's a first offender and accordingly, should be treated with leniency.Counsel argued that his client is a victim of a difficult and impoverished childhood and an unsuccessful and abusive domestic relationship.Counsel pointed out that his client is now employed and she has so far saved $200.00 which she plans to forward as restitution, and that it is her plan to continue to save money and make payments towards this debt as she is able to.Finally, defence counsel suggested that his client should be given credit for her guilty plea and the quantum of the loss could have been a triable issue.Turning to the law.In assessing what is an appropriate disposition in this matter, I've listened to the representations from the Crown and defence, as well as the offender herself.As well the court heard from the victim, Ms. Wortzman, and was provided with reference letters on behalf of Ms. Zaborowicz.Having heard the above noted evidence I am satisfied that a jail sentence is required in this matter.I do not feel that a penitentiary term is called for.Both Crown and defence provided extensive case law.I turn now to an examination of the relevant law.The issue before the court is whether a Conditional Sentence Order pursuant to Section 742.1 is appropriate.I am satisfied that having Ms. Zaborowicz serve her sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community.The question remains as to whether a CSO in this case would be consistent with the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing as set out in Section 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code.The relevant principles include, and this is now quoting from the Criminal Code of Canada, purpose and principles of sentencing, Section 718:\"The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.\"The fundamental principle of sentencing, which is at 718.1 of the Criminal Code reads that:\"A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.\"Other relevant sentencing principles are found at 718.2, which read:\"A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,(ii) ...\"And I'm eliminating (i), I'm not referring to it, I don't believe it's relevant:\"(iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, shall be deemed to be an aggravating circumstance;(b) a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.\"As noted above in Section 718.1, the fundamental principle of sentencing in the Criminal Code is that the sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.In this case there is a high degree of moral blameworthiness.The offender committed a planned deceitful act of theft over a three year period.The amount of the theft is significant.The victim in this case was taken advantage of at an exposed, vulnerable, time in her life.The nature of the breach of trust, someone who had not only been trusted with the care of the victim's infant child, but was by the nature of her employment part of the victim's household, is particularly egregious.It is also of great concern that these thefts were largely to purchase luxury items and can really only be categorized as stemming from greed.It is clear when a review of the relevant case law is conducted that in cases wherein there have been significant thefts from employers in situations resulting from a breach of trust that principles of denunciation and deterrence are significant.It has also been accepted by the highest courts inCanada that these principles can be met by the imposition of a CSO.It is also important to remember that rehabilitation must be considered in this and in most sentencing considerations.As Ms. Zaborowicz stole money from her employer, this is a breach of trust situation.Section 718.2(iii) of the Criminal Code, as stated above, states that when an offender abuses a position of trust in relation to a victim, it is an aggravating factor to consider in sentencing the offender.In Manitoba, the case of R. v. Paul, 2003 MBCA 153 (CanLII), 2003 MJ 447, is considered the leading authority for breach of trust cases.Justice Freedman, speaking for the Manitoba Court of Appeal said at paragraph 14:\"Abuse of a position of trust is expressly stated to be an aggravating circumstance in sentencing (s. 718.2(a)(iii) of the Criminal Code of Canada).Deterrence is the most important principle in such a situation.\"And he references R. v. McEachern, from the Ontario Court of Appeal in 1978, which is found at 42 C.C.C. (2d) at page 189.Going on with the quote from Justice Freedman:\"Since the introduction of conditional sentences, courts have confirmed that abuse of a position of trust will tend to result in a custodial term.\"And he refers to R. v. Pierce, which is 1997 Canlii 2 at 3020 Ontario Court of Appeal 1997.Going on with the quote:\"The very strong message referred to by the trial judge, that persons in such a position who engage in this sort of conduct will be severely dealt with, cannot in my opinion be adequately communicated in this case by a sentence served in the community.While such a sentence can, obviously, have a deterrent aspect, especially when (sufficient) sufficiently stringent conditions are imposed, there are some cases where denunciation and deterrence can only be effectively achieved by incarceration in custody.A breach of trust, committed over a long period of time and involving considerable sums of money, will typically be such a case. \"Another leading case in Canadian law is R. v. Proulx, 2000, a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada.This case is often looked to by Canadian courts as instructive in determining whether a CSO will meet the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing.Chief Justice Lamer speaking for the court, said the following at paragraph 113:\"In sum, in determining whether a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing, sentencing judges should consider which sentencing objectives figure most prominently in the factual circumstances (for) the particular case before them.Where a combination of both punitive and restorative objectives may be achieved, a conditional sentence will likely be more appropriate than incarceration.In determining whether restorative objectives can be satisfied in a particular case, the judge should consider the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation, including whether the offender has proposed a particular plan of rehabilitation; the availability of appropriate community service and treatment programs; whether the offender has acknowledged his or her wrongdoing and expresses remorse; as well as the victim’s wishes as revealed by the victim impact statement (consideration of which is now mandatory pursuant to s. 722 of (of) the (Criminal) Code).This list is not exhaustive.Where punitive objectives such as denunciation and deterrence are particularly pressing, such as cases in which there are aggravating circumstances, incarceration will generally be the preferable sanction.This may be so notwithstanding the fact that restorative goals might be achieved by a conditional sentence.Conversely, a conditional sentence may provide sufficient denunciation and deterrence, even in cases in which restorative objectives are of diminished importance, depending on the nature of the conditions imposed, the duration of the conditional sentence, and the circumstances of the offender and the community in which the conditional sentence is to be served.Finally, it bears pointing out that a conditional sentence may be imposed even in circumstances where there are aggravating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender.Aggravating circumstances will obviously increase the need for denunciation and deterrence.However, it would be a mistake to rule out the possibility of a conditional sentence ab initio simply because aggravating factors are present.I repeat that each case may be considered individually.Sentencing judges will frequently be confronted with situations in which some objectives militate in favour of a conditional sentence, whereas others favour incarceration.In those cases, the trial judge will be called upon to weigh the various objectives in fashioning a...sentence.As La Forest (La Forest) J. stated in R. v. Lyons, 1987 (a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada) “[i]n a rational system of sentencing, the respective importance of prevention, deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation will vary according to the nature of the crime and the circumstances of the offender”.There is no easy test or formula that the judge can apply in weighing these factors.Much will depend on the good judgment and wisdom of sentencing judges, whom Parliament vested with considerable discretion in making these determinations pursuant to s. 718.3.\"And that's the end of that quote.Returning now to Section 718.2 of the Criminal Code is it important to note 718.2(b) which states that:\"A sentence should be similarto sentences imposed onsimilar offenders forsimilar offences...in similar circumstances.\"To that end I have been provided case law by both Crown and defence.What follows is an examination of those cases.Firstly, looking at cases provided by the Crown.R. v. Linda Cousins, which is an unreported decision of the Manitoba Provincial Court from July 5th of 2010.In this case, Ms. Cousins was employed as a controller/accountant for a private company selling flooring products.Over a period of approximately 20 months she stole $229,952.41 from the company.These thefts were accomplished by inflating her paycheques.Ms. Cousins's childhood and domestic background included frequent upheaval and domestic violence which included her father forcing her mother into prostitution and trying to force her, as a young teenager, into prostitution.By the age of 15-and-a-half years she had left home.In the Cousins case the offender was a gambling addict.It was also noted that she had a cocaine addicted child who had been stealing from the family.It was also agreed by the Crown and defence in that case that the money had been spent on financial obligations such as personal loans, a mortgage and tax payments, and that's from page 15 of that decision.Judge Stannard rejected a defence suggestion for a CSO and ordered Ms. Cousins to jail for 16 months.R. v. Hugh Geary, which is an unreported decision of Justice Schulman of Manitoba Queen's Bench, November 6th, 2006, in this case Mr. Geary served as secretary treasurer for his union while being employed as a mechanic by a large company.Over a period of approximately 22 months he stole $129,000.00 from the union.Most of this money was used for the purchase of crack cocaine for his own use.Once again the accused did not have a criminal record.Justice Schulman rejected the suggestion of a CSO on the basis that in this opinion:It would be insufficient to satisfy the needs of this case for denunciation and general deterrence.That quote is from page 9, lines 18 to 20.Mr. Geary was sentenced to 15 months of incarceration.Notable that in that case is the fact that Mr. Geary had confessed.He had found a good job and he had moved away from the drug culture.R. v. Wendy Holroyd, unreported decision of Provincial Judge Giesbrecht, Manitoba Provincial Court, January 8th, 2008.In this case, Ms. Holroyd pled guilty to theft of $81,000.00 from the daycare centre that had employed her.The duration of the thefts took place over an almost two year period.This individual, at the time of her thefts, had been addicted to crack cocaine, was abusing alcohol, and regularly gambled.It was also before the court that prior to the theft Ms. Holroyd had been diagnosed with a number of mood disorders, including depression, anxiety, ADD, and obsessive/compulsive disorder.She had been prescribed medication, but after becoming addicted to crack cocaine stopped taking those medications.In this case, Judge Giesbrecht felt that a CSO:Would not be consistent with the purpose and principles of sentencing and would not achieve the objective of denouncing this unlawful contact (sic), conduct or deterring others from committing similar offences.That quote is from page 44, lines 17 to 22.Ms. Holroyd had received a positive report from Restorative Resolutions and had completed substantial therapy.In that case the offender had already spent one month in jail and was sentenced to an additional period of 12 months in real jail.R. v. Brenda Paterson, unreported decision of Provincial Court Judge Guy from February 15th, 2012, in the Paterson case, Ms., Ms. Paterson was a financial controller, paid an annual salary of $40,000.00 a year.She worked for two related companies and stole $393,533.00 from the companies over a three year period.As is normally the case in breach of trust situations, the offender had no previous record.Some of the stolen money was spent on a mortgage, but it was also spent on gambling and luxury items.In this case Judge Guy made the following comment about applying provided case law:Counsel have been of assistance in filing not only these reports and exhibits, but a great deal of case law.And I do not downplay it because I have looked at the case law, but it is all over the place, if I could put it that way.Each case varies according to the individuals involved, the offender, and the circumstances of that case.So some cases are close to being on point, others emphasize one point rather than another, but there is no two sets of offenders, or circumstances that are the same, or otherwise somebody would give me one case and say there is the answer.These cases are important though because they distill some of the principles that the court has to consider and sometimes they can be helpful in emphasising certain points that the court must take into consideration.But all of these cases are fact and offender specific.The principles, I always say this, the principles that are given to the court on any case are quite understandable, the problem is that for the most part to draw some balance or emphasis between one case and another and where that balance and emphasis should be placed, where the weight should be placed to attach to a particular factor in a particular set of circumstances.That is why the task of judging is always a difficult one trying to get the right balance.And that quote is page 4 and page 5.It is noteworthy that in the Paterson case, Ms. Paterson had, at the time of sentencing, already made restitution of approximately one-third of the amount stolen.Judge Guy concluded that in that case the principles of sentencing could only be met by a period of actual incarceration.He described the major considerations in his decision as being the amount of the theft, the duration of the theft, and the use made of the money.Ms. Paterson received a jail sentence of two years less one day followed by three years of probation.R. v. Rekken, an unreported decision of Provincial Court Judge Wyant from May 31, 2011.In this case Ms. Rekken was an accountant in a small family run business.The offender had worked for the business for many years and was treated like a family member by her employers.Judge Wyant noted that the theft was not motivated by greed, but by addiction.He also noted that the likelihood of restitution was a factor.At page 5 he said:The fact that there is no reimbursement, and frankly, there's no hope of reimbursement on a realistic scale, whether you go back to work and 455,000.00, I've heard no plan that really would give me any kind of confidence to suggest that there is really any hope of reimbursement and it means that this company and this family is out that money.And it is clear in many of the cases when we deal with them when someone comes forward and has a plan for reimbursement, or has made efforts at reimbursement that is certainly a mitigating factor.So it's a factor to take into account that really we are talking about money that is not being repaid and little hope to repay it.Judge Wyant found that the fact that the offender did not disclose the breach was a significant factor.He said that at page 5, line 24.It's also found noteworthy in Rekken that, as in this case, the PSR revealed that the offender had not revealed the offence to her family.In speaking of the pre-sentence report Judge Wyant said at page 8:But what really jumped out of the page for me was the fact that basically the diagnosis was that she was not accepting full responsibility for her actions,that she did not fully understand her wrongdoing, that she lacked insight to it, all of those seem to be huge risk factors to me, and that she had not disclosed it to anybody, to her family, to her husband, to her present employer at that point in time, and really lacked that kind of support.In reference to an appropriate range of sentencing for breach of trust cases Judge Wyant said:The range of sentencing for breach of trust runs the gamut, and there are many, many cases in Manitoba for which conditional sentences have been given, and where periods of jail in a provincial institution have been given.If you look at the cases involving major, major losses, planned and pre-meditated, losses as this is over a number of years, it is pretty easy to conclude that the Crown is right when it says that the range of sentence is two to three years for first offenders, depending on again the presence or absence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.It is noteworthy that in this case the offender was rated as low risk to re-offend.Judge Wyant rejected a conditional sentence and sentenced Ms. Rekken to custody for 18 months and two years of probation.R. v. Bracegirdle, which is a decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal found at 2004 Carswell Alberta 9, 936.Ms. Bracegirdle was an office manager who stole about $145,000.00 over a period of five-and-a-half years.The victim was the Alberta Cystic Fibrosis Society.The Alberta Court of Appeal in that case replaced a two year CSO with the same period in actual jail.In doing so they said that the sentencing judge had under emphasized both the moral blameworthiness of the accused and the harm caused to the victim.On the issue of moral blameworthiness, the Court of Appeal said the following:\"Dealing first with moral blameworthiness, the Respondent’s actions were persistent, ongoing, planned and deliberate. They were callous, stealing from a particularly vulnerable victim. Her motive was greed. Many crimes are motivated by sudden unanticipated opportunity, intoxication, or impulse; few involve long term criminal behaviour, motivated by greed and visited upon one particularly vulnerable victim. The Respondent’s crime falls into the latter category. The consequences must be sufficient to deter others of like mind.\"That's from paragraph 40.Turning to cases provided by the defence.R. v. Davidson, which is a decision of the B.C. Court of Appeal 2012.In this case Mr. Davidson served as treasurer to a non-profit organization.He stole over $100,000.00.This case was distinguished by the fact that full restitution was made.The Court of Appeal noted that this was a significant factor, and said at paragraph 27:\"As to restitution, it is clear the judge recognized this as a distinguishing feature and expressly took it into consideration in deciding the appellant would be permitted to serve his custodial sentence in the community.\"R. v. Bunn, Supreme Court in 2000, Mr. Bunn was a lawyer who was retained by Russian lawyers to recover and remit inheritance money from the estates of six deceased Manitoba and Saskatchewan residents.In each case he stole some of the monies received.As a result of those thefts he was disbarred.Mr. Bunn was given a two year conditional sentence.The Supreme Court said:\"Turning to a consideration of the principles of sentencing, the court reasonably concluded that the ruin and humiliation that Mr. Bunn had brought down upon himself and his family, together with the loss of his professional status, could provide sufficient denunciation and deterrence when coupled with a conditional sentence of two years less a day with house arrest.The Court of Appeal also imposed a condition of 200 hours of community service which was capable of achieving the restorative objective of reparation to the community.Moreover, the Court of Appeal noted important mitigating circumstances in this case.The respondent was the sole provider and caregiver for both his wife, who suffered from multiple sclerosis and had been confined to a wheelchair for years, and their teenage daughter.\"R. v. Victor Loewen, a decision of the Manitoba Provincial Court 2002, found at Canlii 37336.In this case Mr. Loewen defrauded the Bank of Montreal of over 1.3 million dollars and a Manitoba company, Corona Enterprises, of in excess of $200,000.00.These thefts were done by “cheque kiting”, wherein he took advantage of “flow time” of the transfer of funds from one financial institution to another.Basically Mr. Loewen withdrew money which did not exist in order to keep a number of companies he controlled from declaring bankruptcy.Mr. Loewen was not considered to be in a position of trust with the bank, but he was with Corona Enterprises.It was also noted that Mr. Loewen's thefts took place over a short period of time.He was given a Conditional Sentence disposition in part because he had already served 60 days in jail for related charges, and because it was accepted that his motivation was not to benefit from a lavish lifestyle, but was to keep his, quoting the case, \"to keep his companies afloat and its employees paid.\"R. v. Champion, a decision of the Newfoundland Supreme court 2011, Carswell Newfoundland 30, Mr. Champion was the manager of a maritime fishing supply company.He stole $155,000.00 over a period of a year-and-a-half.In granting an 18 month Conditional Sentence Order, Justice Faour of the Newfoundland and Labrador Supreme Court emphasized that Mr. Champion had been assessed as a low risk to re-offend, but placed particular emphasis on the fact that the offender was employed and therefore would be capable of making restitution payments to the victim company and other individual victims.R. v. Miles,Alberta Provincial Court 2010, found at Carswell Alberta 1828.In this case, Ms. Miles was employed by the victim company as an office worker over an almost two and one half year period.She stole $203,712.00 by forging cheques and writing cheques to herself.After being caught the offender made a full confession.By the time of sentencing Ms. Miles had repaid $53,519.00 by way of restitution.She was considered to be of low risk to re-offend.Ms. Miles was ultimately given a CSO of two years.R. v. Shannon Phillips, 2006 a decision of the Manitoba Provincial Court.In this case Ms. Phillips was employed as an office manager and bookkeeper for Dubrovnik Restaurant Ltd. in Winnipeg.She defrauded that company of $57,870.00 over an 18 month period.Ms. Phillips used 18 company cheques to pay her personal credit card bills and forged the signature of the owner's daughter on another cheque and placed that money in her own account.When this fraud began in 2003, the offender's salary was $19,000.00 a year.She was a single mother raising a young child with no financial support from the father.The owner of the company told her that he couldn't afford to pay her a larger salary.Ms. Phillips started stealing because she felt that she was being underpaid.Eventually the stolen money financed not only living expenses, but travel, furniture, and luxury items.In this case, Ms. Phillips stopped stealing and resigned before the thefts were detected.Ms. Phillips did participate with Restorative Resolutions and in imposing a conditional sentence, Judge Judy Elliott felt that the support that the offender would receive from that organization would be a positive factor.In determining sentence Judge Elliott said:\"A custodial sentence would be more punitive towards Ms. Phillips than it would be to most other offenders, in that she would be incarcerated far away from her young son.Those factors tilt me in the other direction.\"That's paragraph 34 from that decision.Now to analysis.As is clear from a comprehensive review of the cases above noted as well as the other cases provided by counsel but not referred to, and many other sentencing cases related to Theft Over in breach of trust situations, each case is individual and must be looked at as to the individual circumstances of each offence and each offender.As stated previously the Criminal Code of Canada has specifically referenced crimes involving breach of trust at Section 718.2(a)(iii).In determining how much of an aggravating factor a breach of trust is we look to the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Grosbrink, which is a decision from 1992, which said:The extent to which a breach of trust in a particular case will operate as an aggravating factor will depend on the circumstances in which the relationship arises. (paragraph 7)Mitigating factors.In this case there are a number of mitigating and aggravating factors.Ms. Zaborowicz is 43 years old and has no prior criminal record.She has demonstrated remorse for the offence by her guilty plea.Additionally, she directly addressed the victim in court and apologized to her.She has expressed a desire to make payments towards restitution.Aggravating factors.The large amount of money stolen: $165,673.21.The duration of the thefts, which took place over a period of approximately three years and continued even after the offender was no longer employed by the victim.The offender did not stop stealing from the victim until she was caught.The number of thefts, which included $57,549.95 worth of credit card purchases, and 192 fraudulent cheques.The money stolen was for the most part used for luxury purchases to allow the offender to live a lifestyle beyond her means.Greed appeared to be the principle motivation for the money stolen.The nature of the breaches of trust.Unlike the vast majority of breach of trust cases, Ms. Zaborowicz was not employed by a company.She was employed by a husband and wife and her workplace was to be within their home and their household.Ms. Zaborowicz was hired by the couple and told that the husband was terminally ill.The husband's terminal status was not only disclosed by the couple, but it was made clear to her that they were looking to hire someone who would serve as a steady influence through that difficult time for their infant child.She was employed to be a nanny for the child, and a housekeeper for the family.Evidence from the victim in the Victim Impact Statement makes it clear that Ms. Zaborowicz was entrusted with not only the care and maintenance of the child and household, but with financial matters that pertained to provisioning of the house and child.A Victim Impact Statement was provided by Ms. Wortzman.The details of this statement have been related above.Suffice to say that the difference between a theft from a business or a company as opposed to an individual employer is underscored by the emotions demonstrated by the victim in this case.Unlike a company which can look on a theft of this magnitude as a business loss, likely covered by insurance, in a scenario like the one before this court, the loss is felt directly as a personal betrayal of trust.In her Victim Impact Statement, Ms. Wortzman dealt only incidentally with the significant financial loss.But more emphatically with the resulting loss of faith she has in other people.In considering the offender's circumstances in this matter, I considered the PSR that was prepared, as well reference letters provided by Ms. Zaborowicz's daughters.Her oldest daughter, Alexandra, wrote about her admiration for her mother's perseverance in her marriage despite abuse from her husband.She also spoke glowingly of her mother's patience in supporting her through the difficulties of adolescence.Above all she wrote of her appreciation for her mother's assistance and support in raising her own children.Ms. Zaborowicz's 18 year old daughter, Teagan, also provided a reference letter.Teagan also spoke as to the stability provided by her mother, particularly at times of personal crisis.Basically both letters describe Ms. Zaborowicz as someone who put her children's interests ahead of her own.The Pre-Sentence Report included a reference to Ms. Zaborowicz's aspirations to become a health care aide.The reporter says that she is currently making inquires about taking courses at CDI College or Assiniboine College in Brandon.While it is commendable that Ms. Zaborowicz has aspirations to pursue a health care career, it is also arguable that this ambition demonstrates a lack of concern for reparation to the victim.At this point, the only restitution that has been paid to Ms. Wortzman is the $7,246.00 that was garnished from her.It is also noteworthy that after the thefts were discovered, the offender was employed for a full year before the garnishment was effected and no reparation was paid during that time period.It is arguable that rather than Ms. Zaborowicz going into a training program, she should be focusing on retaining the job she currently has and making restorative payments to Ms. Wortzman.It is also noteworthy information from the PSR that the current garnishment is not the first time that the offender has been garnished.It appears that the offender had declared bankruptcy in 2000, and more recently had her wages garnished for unpaid rent.These matters coupled with the lavish nature of the purchases made with the stolen money, are to be considered in assessing the future risk presented by this offender.It is also worth noting that in preparing the PSR, the reporter asked Ms. Zaborowicz as to her income and expenses.I find it concerning that when her basic expenses are looked at against her income, and that is her income without any of the normal deductions which are automatically taken from employment income, her net income is only approximately $500.00 per month more than her expenses.Realistically, this provides very little room for reparation payments.Additionally concerning information from the PSR comes from Mr. Moore's interview with Ms. Zaborowicz's mother, who told him that she was shocked to find out about the theft and that she thought her daughter was doing so well financially because she was working at two jobs.It would appear that Ms. Zaborowicz, who claimed to be close to her mother, was not honest with her and was deceptive about her actual employment situation.It is also concerning as to Ms. Zaborowicz's honesty when we read in the PSR:That a part of the money taken over the years was to help her brother financially with rent, groceries, clothes and cash for his (her brother’s) family.That is from page 5 of the PSR.When the brother, Ken, was spoken to, he denied ever receiving financial help from her.Counsel for Ms. Zaborowicz suggested her brother may not have been telling the truth to Mr. Moore, but provided no satisfactory explanation as to a motive for doing so.Ms. Zaborowicz, through counsel, suggests that caring for her two adult daughters has been a significant strain on her and that her younger daughter recently tried to kill herself.Yet the grandmother, who concurs as to enjoying a close relationship with her daughter and who was interviewed within two months of the alleged suicide attempt, says her “grandchildren are doing well at this time in their life” (page 7).Restorative Resolutions declined to become involved with Ms. Zaborowicz because they felt that she was \"not accepting responsibility and being accountable in her life.\" This was determined after speaking to family collaterals.It appears that although the family is aware of the offence, it is only aware because of what they have read in the newspaper.The family has never talked with Ms. Zaborowicz about the offence and \"she has never opened up to them about the offence\" (which is included in the email from Mr. Moore at Exhibit 4).While it may be understandable that Ms. Zaborowicz is embarrassed and humiliated by what she has done, I am not prepared to accept that because she has not discussed this matter with her family she has not taken responsibility before the court and the victim.She has done that with her guilty plea and her apology to her, Ms. Wortzman, in court.However, the fact that she has not discussed it with her family suggests that she has not taken responsibility for her crime with them.And collaterally this raises concern as to how much assistance or support they might be to her in the future.The fact that she has not acknowledged her behaviour to her family is one of several factors, including her financial instability, previous problems with money and debt, the lavish nature of the spending, including attending bars \"every weekend on both Friday and Saturday nights with her sister for a majority of the three years she was employed by Ms. Wortzman\" (PSR page 8),would indicate that there is a risk that Ms. Zaborowicz may commit a similar offence in the future.Imposition of a Conditional Sentence Order.Section 741.(1) of the Criminal Code sets out criteria for the imposition of a CSO.Firstly, the sentence must be for a period of incarceration of less than two years.Having looked at case law both in Manitoba and the rest of Canada, I am satisfied that a sentence of less than two years would be appropriate in this case.I am also satisfied that the sentencing guidelines in Section 718, most particularly denunciation and deterrence, rule out the possibility that a period of probation alone would be an appropriate disposition.Going further, although I have concerns about the risk Ms. Zaborowicz presents to become re-involved, I do not believe, particularly based on her prior unblemished criminal record, that the service of an appropriate sentence in the community would endanger the community.This, of course, leaves the final criteria being whether a CSO would be consistent with the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing as set out in 718 to 718.2 of the Criminal Code.As clearly stated in Canadian case law, in substantial thefts of this nature involving a breach of trust, the primary sentencing objectives are the denunciation of the crime and the deterrence of the accused and others from committing similar offences.The issue before this court is whether these objectives can be met within the context of a CSO.As stated above, there are cases in our law which have found that these objectives could be met within the context of a CSO, and there are cases that have felt that a CSO would not meet these objectives.Denunciation was described by Justice Lamer in the Proulx case (paragraph 102) as “the communication of society's condemnation of the offender's conduct”.He also further attempted to define this principle in R. v. M(CA), 1996 Supreme Court Reports 500, at paragraph 81, page 369:It is “a symbolic collective statement that the offender's conduct should be punished from encroaching on our society's basic code of value....The relevance of both retribution and denunciation as goals of sentencing underscores that our criminal justice system is not simply a vast system of negative penalties designed to prevent objectively harmful conduct by increasing the cost the offender must bear in committing an enumerated offence.Our criminal law is also a system of values.A sentence which expresses denunciation is simply the means by which these values are communicated.In short, in addition to attaching negative consequences to undesirable behaviour, judicial sentences should also be imposed in a manner which positively instills the basic set of communal values shared by all Canadians as expressed in the Criminal Code”.In this case, the quality of the breach of trust is arguably more egregious than a theft from a company and therefore calls more emphatically for denunciation.Ms. Zaborowicz was employed on a personal services basis as a nanny.She took advantage of a victim who was trying to maintain her infant child, her business, and her household, while in the process of coping with the terminal illness of her husband.Within days, both before and after her husband's death, Ms. Zaborowicz was stealing from the family for her own greed.In my opinion, this is a breach of trust at the high end of the scale of wrongdoing and moral blameworthiness.The Supreme Court of Canada in P.(B.W.);N. (B.V.), a 2006 decision of the Supreme Court, explained the theory behind general deterrence:General deterrence is intended to work in this way.Potential criminals will not engage in criminal activities because of the example provided by the punishment imposed on the offender.When general deterrence is factored in the determination of the sentence, the offender is punished more severely, not because he or she deserves it, but because the court decides to send a message to others who may be inclined to engage in similar criminal activity.As stated earlier, R. v. Paul from the Manitoba Court of Appeal, in referring to Section 718.2(a)(iii) of the Criminal Code said that “deterrence is the most important principle in such a situation”.(paragraph 14)That case pointed out that while a CSO can have a deterrent effect:There are some cases where denunciation and deterrence can only be effectively achieved by incarceration in custody.A breach of trust committed over a long period of time involving considerable sums of money will be such a case. (Paragraph 16)While the case before the court would appear to meet the above requirements as to having taken place over a relatively lengthy period of time and concerning a large amount of money, each case must be looked at as to its individual circumstances.As a last word on denunciation and deterrence, Clayton Ruby in his textbook on sentencing (Sentencing, Clayton Ruby, 8th edition LexisNexis), quotes legal author Barbara Wootton from her book, Crime And The Criminal Law:Reflections of a Magistrate and Social Scientist, as suggesting that “Sentencing should focus on preventing social harm rather than punishing moral wrongs”. (page 17, paragraph 1.48)It seems to me that denunciation in this case is meant to serve this function.An appropriate sentence is not designed to punish Ms. Zaborowicz for her wrong, but must denounce this crime as harmful to the general well being of society and deter others from similar actions.In most criminal sentencing, the fact that the offender has no previous record will be mitigating.However, some Canadian courts have said that some kinds of offences are unsuited to mitigation for this reason.In R. v. Spiller, which is a 1969 decision of the B.C. Court of Appeal, the offender pleaded guilty to stealing and falsifying documents which amounted to a $492,000.00 loss to her employer, a chartered bank.On the issue of the perpetrator's general good character the court said the following:Good character may be a mitigating circumstance in some kinds of crime, i.e., an isolated case of criminal negligence or an unpremeditated assault in a fit of anger.But in my opinion this is not so where the offence is a series of acts planned and carried out over a lengthy period.The person of good character who can appreciate to the full how wrong what he is doing is, seems to me just as culpable as a person of poor character who appreciates less clearly the wrongness of his acts.She used her apparent good character to enable her to perpetrate her crime.Now, her counsel wants to use it in mitigation of penalty.In this case counsel for Ms. Zaborowicz argued that it is only in the community that his client can start to make reasonable reparation.He pointed out that her illness prevented her from working for approximately the last year, and that in the approximately six weeks she's been back to work she has set aside $200.00 to eventually make a restitution payment.While it is true that if incarcerated Ms. Zaborowicz will not earn monies for reparation, I see this argument as having little merit.The only monies paid back thus far have come from a garnishment and there's been nothing from that for a considerable time period.Additionally Ms. Zaborowicz is earning only a relatively small amount more than her basic costs of living and her prospects for reparation are not great.Very little has been repaid and realistically there's little hope that it will be repaid.Section 718(d) of the Criminal Code lists rehabilitation as one of the fundamental principles of sentencing.A general definition of this principle was provided in the case of Vartzokas v. Zanker, which is a Supreme Court decision from 1989.What follows is a quote from page 279 of that case:Rehabilitation as an object of sentencing is aimed at renunciation by the offender of his wrongdoing and his establishment or re-establishment as an honourable law abiding citizen.It is not confined to those who have fallen into wrongdoing by reason of physical or mental infirmity, or a disadvantaged background.It applies equally to those who while not suffering such disadvantages nevertheless lapse into wrongdoing.The object of the court is to fashion sentencing measures designed to reclaim such individuals wherever such measures are consistent with the primary objective of the criminal law, which is the protection of the community.In this case, there are a number of factorswhich must be considered in determining what, if any, effective measures can be looked at to assist with Ms. Zaborowicz's rehabilitation.Firstly it is important to note that she is described by Curtis Moore, the author of the Pre-Sentence Report, as a medium risk to re-offend.The factors he cited as having “criminogenic potential” are underachievement, financial problems, parenting concerns, depression, low self-esteem, past suicide attempts, other emotional de-stressors such as her pending court date, family concerns, past physical, sexual, emotional abuse and being interpersonally anxious.While all of these factors may have contributed to Ms. Zaborowicz's offending and may also contribute to her future potential to re-offend, the court has limited resources to effectively contribute to assist her in these areas.It is also arguable that this crime was a situational response to being in circumstances which allowed the opportunity to steal and that those circumstances arose because Ms. Zaborowicz was considered to be someone who could be trusted.As a result of this conviction, Ms. Zaborowicz will have a criminal record for a significant theft and the likelihood of her being trusted again will be diminished.There is a significant rehabilitative potential in probation.Probation Officers are dedicated individuals who have chosen a line of occupation which allows them to support and assist those involved in the criminal justice system.There's every reason to believe that Ms. Zaborowicz stands to gain considerably from the support offered to her by the monitoring and program referrals made by her Probation Officer.The issue of rehabilitation in my mind does not significantly impact the question before the court as to whether Ms. Zaborowicz should serve her sentence in jail or in the community.As the jail sentence in this case will be less than two years, probation will be employed in either case.Counselling is available in jail as it is in the community.I do not believe that anything the criminal system can provide Ms. Zaborowicz would be interfered with by a custodial sentence.While Ms. Zaborowicz's rehabilitation is one of the significant considerations, this sentencing, as with all sentencings, must balance all significant considerations.The Supreme Court of Canada summed this up succinctly in R. v. Lyons, a 1987 Supreme Court decision, which states at page 22:\"In a rational system of sentencing, the respective importance of prevention, deterrence, retribution and rehabilitation will vary according to the nature of the crime and the circumstances of the offender.\"Having looked at the nature of the crime and the circumstances of Ms. Zaborowicz, and having asked myself whether the purpose and principles of sentencing can be met within the context of a Conditional Sentence Order, I have come to the conclusion that they cannot.In this case, the aggravating facts of this offence outweigh the mitigating factors and circumstances of the offender.This is a serious offence with significant moral blameworthiness.I am not satisfied that the sentencing principles of denunciation and deterrence can be met with a Conditional Sentence Order.The theft in this case involves taking advantage of victims who were at their most vulnerable.While this couple was dealing with impending death, Ms. Zaborowicz was stealing from them.These thefts continued for a lengthy period of time, long enough that at some point the offender would have had time to think about what she was doing and to re-consider her actions.The thefts continued beyond the period of employment and only came to an end after discovery by the victim.The net result of Ms. Zaborowicz's greed was that not only did the victim suffer a significant financial loss, but suffered a significant loss of well being from the actions of the offender.I accept that in some cases a CSO can provide significant denunciation and deterrence.In this case, for all of the above reasons, I believe a period of incarceration in jail is required to communicate society's condemnation of this conduct and to let others know that in situations like this, there will be significant consequences.In considering the appropriate length of sentence I am taking into consideration that: Ms. Zaborowicz is a first time offender; she plays an important role in supporting her two children; and it is important that she return to the workforce as soon as practicable so that she can start making restitution payments to Ms. Wortzman.In determining an appropriate length of sentence, the precedents are of limited value because in almost all examples, the thefts were from companies or businesses. While I recognize that in many similar cases with thefts of significant amounts of money there is a range from one to two years of incarceration. I am satisfied that in this case the principles of sentencing are appropriately met by a sentence of 12 months in custody, served in an institution.This period will be followed by two years of supervised probation.The conditions of the Probation Order will include that she is to report to probation within 48 hours of her release from custody using the 1-800 number.She is to keep the peace and be of good behaviour and all the statutory conditions will apply.She's to attend, participate and complete all counselling programming and treatment as directed by her Probation Officer.She's to actively seek and maintain employment, and she's to notify all perspective employers about this conviction.Costs and surcharge are waived.All items seized are to be forfeited.The Crown has requested restitution and a stand alone Restitution Order is being made in the amount of $158,427.21, which is the requested restitution amount with the garnished monies subtracted.And unless either counsel have any comment about the probation conditions or about the amount of the Restitution Order?I understand that some furniture was seized and so on...I'm not sure.Mr. Sass, I'm assuming that if those items are sold, I'm assuming that money will go towards the restitution.MR. SASS:That's correct, Your Honour.Yeah, once --THE COURT:Okay.MR. SASS:-- once they've been sold they'll go against the restitution order.THE COURT:All right.Mr. Sass, did you have any other probation conditions that you would be looking for?MR. SASS:Not probation conditions, Your Honour.The only other thing I would suggest, it's only a secondary designated DNA offence, however, the Crown's requesting the court make a DNA order.THE COURT:Okay, well, do you want to comment?Does, Mr. Sawchuk, is Mr. Sawchuk not there?MS. WALKER:Mr. Sawchuk's not in attendance, Your Honour.It's Walker, first initial T., for the monitor.I'm aware of --THE COURT:Yeah.MS. WALKER:-- the case, and have been involved, and prepared the casebook for Your Honour.THE COURT:Okay.MS. WALKER:In terms of the DNA orders, I would suggest it's a secondary designated offence, and that in ordering one at this point goes beyond what the court needs to do to ensure that Ms. Zaborowicz follows the conditions, that it isn't necessary in this case.THE COURT:You know, I'm prepared to accept that suggestion.I think that under the circumstances, in thisbeing a first offender and the nature of this crime and so on, I'm not necessarily satisfied that a DNA order is appropriate.So I will decline to make a DNA order.Is there anything else counsel?MR. SASS:I'm not sure if Your Honour ordered a no contact and communication with the complainant.THE COURT:You know, I didn't, and I should have included that. Mr. Sass, thank you for that suggestion. Madam Clerk, there will be a clause included in the Probation Order which will prohibit contact with Ms. Wortzman, and will also include a non-attendance clause which requires that she stay 75 metres from where Ms. Wortzman is at any time, including her workplace, home, place of worship, and so on._____ORIGINAL SIGNED BY:LAWRENCE ALLEN, P.J."}

Curlissfor the CrownM.P. Bodnar, Q.C.for the accusedJUDGMENTSCHEIBEL J.September 9, 1999[1]The accused has plead guilty under s. 5(2) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, S.C. 1996, c. 19, of having in his possession marihuana not exceeding three kilograms for the purpose of trafficking. In addition the accused has also pleaded guilty to unlawfully producing marihuana contrary to s. 7(1) of the Act.[2]The accused’s basement in Rosetown had been converted to a marihuana growing area. It was a sophisticated operation involving extensive changes to the basement to accommodate this operation. The nature of the operation indicates that the accused was skilled in this process. The Crown alleges, and it is not disputed by the accused, that up to five crops could be grown each year.[3]The basement contained approximately 80 items which were used in the production of marihuana. Some of these are trays, plant pots, high pressure sodium lamp, scales, marihuana plants, temperature thermometers, track lights, timers, hash oil vial, as well as many other items ordinarily used in an extensive growing operation.[4]The Crown submits this operation was not one for street level trafficking but rather one of a much larger commercial scheme. As a result of the large sophisticated drug production operation the Crown submits this is not a case where a conditional sentence should be imposed and suggest a prison term of 18 months to be served in an institution. The defence does not dispute the facts as alleged by the Crown but states that a conditional sentence with electronic monitoring is the appropriate disposition.[5]In support of this the defence refers to two other cases, R. v. Dodge and R. v. Payne, (unreported) which also arose in Rosetown, where the Crown and defence jointly recommended a conditional sentence. The defence argues there must be parity in sentencing for similar offences and therefore the accused should receive the same sentence as did the other two who were involved in the production of marihuana.[6]The Crown points out that the facts in this accused’s case are much more serious than that of the other two. In particular the Crown points out that neither Dodge nor Payne were charged with trafficking. In addition, the Crown says that Dodge and Payne were minor players and the quantity which they grew was much less than that of this accused.[7]The accused is 32 years old and is single. His prior criminal record indicates several convictions between 1983 and 1993, but none since 1993. However, the accused has a previous drug conviction for possession of narcotics and is, therefore, no stranger to illegal drugs and the consequences of its use or production.[8]A pre-sentence report was ordered and the report states in part:Given the nature of the offence the court could consider a lengthy term of incarceration given the amount of contraband involved.. . .However, the report does not rule out the suggestion of a conditional sentence.[9]Section 742.1 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 provides:742.1Where a person is convicted of an offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, and the court(a)imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two years, and(b)is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community. . . .[10]It is not suggested by the Crown that serving the sentence in the community would endanger the safety of the community therefore the issue is: whether such a conditional sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in ss. 718 to 718.2.[11]Section 718 provides:718 The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a)to denounce unlawful conduct;(b)to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c)to separate offenders from society, where necessary;(d)to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e)to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and(f)to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to the community.Section 718.1 states:718.1A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.Section 718.2 directs the court to “take into consideration” that:(a)a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevant aggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender . . .(b)a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances . . . .[12]In this instance s. 718(a) and (b) are particularly relevant that is, the sentence must denounce the unlawful conduct and be such as \"to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences\". The accused has not been deterred by his previous drug conviction instead he has opted for a much larger involvement by producing marihuana for commercial purposes.[13]Therefore, it is necessary to consider a sentence which will be more of a deterrent for the accused to re-offend. The sentence must also be one which will send a message to those so inclined that serious consequences will follow for a conviction of offences of this nature. That is, the sentence must be one which will deter other persons of like mind from committing similar offences.[14]There is no doubt as to the seriousness of this offence, nor is there any doubt as to the degree of responsibility of the accused. By virtue of s. 718.1 the sentence imposed must be proportionate to both the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility.[15]It is clear that the accused intended to generate substantial income from the illegal production of marihuana (and even though I have not taken it into account, one might reasonably conclude that such income would have been tax free) compounding both the gravity of the offence and the degree of the accused's responsibility.[16]Nevertheless, s. 718.2(b ) requires the court to take into consideration that any sentence imposed \"should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances\". It is therefore necessary to consider previous sentences for similar offences.[17]In R. v. Booth (L.) et al.(1996), 1996 CanLII 5020 (SK CA), 144 Sask. R. 213 (Sask. C.A.) the trial judge sentenced the accused to a total of four years imprisonment for trafficking and cultivation. The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, in upholding the sentence, stated: \"this court has said on many occasions that commercial drug operations, and, in particular, large commercial drug operations, where there is enormous opportunity for profit will attract long prison sentences\".[18]In contrast, counsel for the accused refers to R. v. Gagnon (1999), 1998 CanLII 13076 (QC CA), 19 C.R. (5th) 309 (Que. C.A.). In Gagnon the accused pleaded guilty to importing 331 grams of hashish to pay for her vacation. She had no previous record, co-operated with the police and took drug addiction therapy at her own expense. She received a positive pre-sentence report which confirmed her rehabilitation. At trial she was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and a conditional sentence was rejected. The Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge had erred in holding a conditional sentence was not available in this instance. In imposing a 12 month conditional sentence the Quebec Court of Appeal concluded that the trial judge failed to give adequate consideration to the mitigating circumstances of the case. The court went on to say that while a sentence of imprisonment was warranted for this type of offence this particular case suggested leniency because of the absence of any criminal record, her co-operation with the police and her efforts to deal with her addiction. In addition, the court held that serving her sentence in custody would only endanger her rehabilitation.[19]There are several factors which distinguish the Gagnon case from the one at hand. Some of these are:➢this accused has a previous record including a prior drug offence➢there is no indication this accused is addicted to the use of drugs or has taken any steps towards rehabilitation➢there is no indication of any co-operation with the police➢there is no positive pre-sentence report and no meritorious conduct shown by the accused➢the actions of the accused appear to be solely for purposes of profit.[20]In R. v. Senko (Sask. C.A., May 14, 1998, Docket 7277, unreported) the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal set aside a conditional sentence and in doing so stated that such a sentence was \"not in accord with the fundamental principle of sentencing: that the sentence be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the responsibility of the offender\". The court went on to say: \"taking into account Mr. Senko's two previous convictions for conspiracy to traffic in narcotics, the quantity of marihuana involved in the present case, and the planning required for the hydroponic grow operation, a prison sentence of three to four years would have been in order\".[21]In R. v. Roney, 1999 CanLII 12270 (SK CA), [1999] S.J. No. 305 (Q.L.) (Sask. C.A.) the accused was convicted of cultivating marihuana, possession for the purposes of trafficking and theft of electricity.[22]In setting aside a conditional sentence the court held that \"the sentencing judge had understated the gravity of the offences, particularly the principal offence of cultivating cannabis marijuana\". The court went on to say: \"This constituted a serious offence, the gravity of which is illustrated by such cases as R. v. Senko (Sask. C.A., May 4th, 1998, unreported; R. v. Booth (L) et al (1996), 1996 CanLII 5020 (SK CA), 144 Sask. R. 213 (Sask. C.A.); R. v. Heatherington (1996), 1996 CanLII 4938 (SK CA), 141 Sask. R. 194 (Sask. C.A.); R. v. Monette (1994), 1994 CanLII 4648 (SK CA), 116 Sask. R. 214 (Sask. C.A.); R. v. Debrowney (1992), 1992 CanLII 8254 (SK CA), 97 Sask. R. 262 (Sask. C.A.)\".[23]The court in Roney held that the imposition of a conditional sentence in such circumstances did not have regard for the principle of parity and that the imposition of a conditional sentence \". . . constitutes a significant departure from the range of sentences customarily imposed by the courts of the province in relation to the commission of crimes of this nature, committed in similar circumstances by similar offenders. The cases cited a moment ago will serve generally to illustrate the point, though some featured more serious elements, some less serious.\"[24]I do not state that a conditional sentence could never be imposed for the types of offences the accused has pleaded to but given the facts and circumstances of the accused's involvement, such a sentence is not available to him and his sentence must be served in a penal institution.[25]In determining the sentence I have taken into account all of the principles of sentencing not just those set forth herein. I have also taken into account the accused's last conviction was in 1993, but for that and the representations by counsel on behalf of the accused, the sentence would have been longer.[26]The accused is hereby sentenced to serve a term of 15 months on each count in a provincial correctional centre. The sentences are to be served concurrently. The drug related articles seized by the police from the accused's residence shall be forfeited to Her Majesty in the Right of Canada to be disposed of in accordance with the Act. I do not consider it necessary or desirable to make an order under the Criminal Code prohibiting the accused from possessing any firearm, cross-bow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition or explosive substance. The surcharge is waived.J."}

Scaravelli,Solicitor for the Appellantand Greg Barro, Articled ClerkCraig Botterill,Solicitor for the RespondentGOODFELLOW, J. (Orally)This is the matter of sentencing of R. v. Michael J. Carlin.BACKGROUNDMichael J. Carlin was charged that at or near Fall River on the 29th of July, 1994:(1)Did have the care or control of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate the vehicle was impaired by alcohol or a drug, contrary to Section 253(a) of the Criminal Code of Canada.AND FURTHERMORE AT THE SAME TIME AND PLACE AFORESAID:(2) Did have the care or control of a motor vehicle having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood exceeded eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood, contrary to Section 253(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada.He pleaded not guilty to both counts.On April 3, 1995, he withdrew his not guilty plea on s.253(b), the second count, and entered a plea of guilty. The Provincial Court Judge then dismissed count one and proceeded with sentencing on the guilty plea to count number two.THE HEARING ‑ April 3, 1995The Crown outlined in some detail the circumstances of the offence.\"MR. LENEHAN:With regards to the circumstances, Your Honour, on the 29th day of July, 1994, the RCMP were advised by a citizen at 3 o'clock in the morning that this vehicle had just met another vehicle driving south in the northbound land on the Number 102 Highway. RCMP officers proceeded north on the 102 in a marked police car. Approximately ten after three they noted a 1983 blue Datson travelling in the wrong direction on the 102. The police car was stopped on the right hand shoulder of the road. When the vehicle passed, the police car engaged it's emergency lights and turned and followed the vehicle. Beyond travelling the wrong way on the highway, the vehicle was being driven in a erratic manner as it swerved several times onto the shoulder of the road and then back onto the pavement. It travelled only a short distance before pulling over and stopping for the police. The police officers approached the vehicle. There was a strong smell of alcohol coming from the driver. He had very red eyes. He was told to shut off his car and step outside. He started to get out without putting the car in park, causing the car to roll ahead slowly. He put the car in park. There was a can of beer open,sitting between the two front seats. He staggered on his way back to the police car and he was given the Breathalyzer demand and advised of his right to counsel. He acceded to the demand, Your Honour. The two readings were 270 milligrams per 100 millilitres ... 270 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood.With regards to this individual, Your Honour, there's an indication here that approximately 10 years ago in 1985 he had a conviction for refusing a roadside screening device. Other than that, this would appear to be his first offence in 10 years. Under the circumstances, Your Honour, given the high readings, the driving ... being on the wrong side of the 102 Highway, the Crown would submit that more than the usual fine would be appropriate, and perhaps a period of probation might be considered.\"Defense counsel advised the court:\"MS. LAVIOLETTE: Your Honour, Mr. Carlin is presently employed at Big Leaques Beverage Room which he was at the time of the incident. At the time of the incident Mr. Carlin was having some emotional problems. On the night in question it was his birthday and it marked the anniversary of his proposal to his fiancé who he has just broken up with.Mr. Carlin had been going to a psychiatrist for counselling just prior to the break‑up and at the time of the incident, and continued to do so for a short period afterward. He has indicated to me that he presently has his emotional problems under control and is no longer in psychiatric counselling, and has no problems with alcohol at present.\"SENTENCEHis Honour Provincial Court Judge Patrick Curran sentenced Mr. Carlin1)Fine ‑ $1,500.00 plus victim surcharge of $150.00 payable in six months, in default of payment, 60 days.2)Probation ‑ Terms ‑a)Keep the peace and be of good behaviour.b)Report as directed by the Probation Officer.c) Attend such alcohol or drug abuse assessment and counselling as directed by his Probation Officer.3)Prohibition on Mr. Carlin from operating a motor vehicle anywhere in Canada for two years.NOTICE OF APPEALThis appeal is on the basis the sentence imposed is excessive and seeks a recision of the Order of Probation.No factum or brief was filed by the Appellant.His counsel at the beginning of his address today advised the court that the relief they would like relates to the two year Prohibition. During the course of his address, Appellant's counsel stated he \"withdrew\" his opposition to the Probation Order. All the cases referred to by the Appellant made reference to Probation Orders.The Crown agreed I should consider the entire sentence in fairness to the Appellant and I have done so.CASESI reviewed all the cases submitted by counsel.In R. v. Rhodenhiser, unreported, December 29th, 1986, an appeal from sentence of failure of the breathalyzer reading .170 and .190 the trial sentence of probation for three years with a direction to attend a detoxification centre for treatment, a fine of $1,500.00 on the first offence and on the second offence eight days later $2,000.00 and a direction to take a safe driving course and suspension for one year was changed on appeal to $600.00 fine for the first offence, $1,000.00 on the second offence and remove the Probation Order. However, the one year suspension remained as did the order to take treatment at the detoxification centre.R. v. Johnson (1993), 1993 CanLII 4490 (NS SC), 127 N.S.R.(2d) 57 dealt with prior convictions.R. v. Tyre (1986), 74 N.S.R.(2d) 221 was another 1986 Bridgewater appeal and parallels R. v. Rhodenhiser above.As does R. v. Forsythe (1988), 86 N.S.R.(2d) 262, another Bridgewater appeal in which Freeman, C.C.J., as he then was, said at p.270:\"[44] What must be sought is a sentence severe enough to deter, and to reflect disapprobation both of drinking and driving and of the high level of alcohol in the system of the appellant when he chose to drive a vehicle on public streets, but nevertheless not one so harsh as to seem unjust or disproportionate, or to appear to deprive him of the \"equal protection and equal benefit of the law\".[45] In other circumstances I might find much merit in the probation order requiring attendance at Drug Dependency as required by the probation officer. Such provisions have been upheld by our Appeal Court.\"Finally, in R. v. Janes (1990), 94 N.S.R.(2d) 235, we have some guidance as to when a maximum sentence might be imposed.As I said in R. v. Richard (1993), 1992 CanLII 4827 (NS SC), 114 N.S.R.(2d) 428 at p.433, paragraphs 36 and 37:\"(36] Other cases and lengths of sentences previously handed down. I have reviewed all the sentencing cases referred to me by counsel. Determinations from other decisions, including those from Appellate Courts are useful and important guidelines.[37] In the final analysis, the sentence in each case reflects to a considerable degree the circumstances of the offence, the circumstances of the offender and the circumstances of the victim, weighed in light of the well known sentencing principles.\"ISSUE‑IS THE SENTENCE EXCESSIVE?Defence counsel took no exception to the outline of circumstances advanced to Judge Curran by the Crown and Judge Curran commented in his sentencing at p.3:\"I think it would be very hard to exaggerate the seriousness of this situation. For anyone to be driving in the wrong direction on a four lane highway like that is such a frightening prospect that it's enough to make a person shudder. I would say, given the amount of traffic that's on the road, it's probably almost a miracle that there wasn't a collision, especially when you consider what the Crown has had to say about the erratic ... not only the car being on that side of the road, but it being driven erratically.\"And further on:\"In my view, this calls for a very substantial penalty. I agree with the Crown that it also calls for a period of probation.\"And finally, on the same page:\"Mr. Carlin will be prohibited from operating a motor vehicle on any public roadway in Canada for a period of two years. That's a longer period than usual, but, in my view, it's called for, given the nature of what occurred there.\"I share Judge Curran's view. If Mr. Carlin had not been apprehended when he was, the likelihood of death or injury to himself was considerable and might well have resulted in the death and serious injury to innocents. The level of intoxication and circumstances justify ‑ indeed, in my view, required something more than a fine and one year prohibition.The sentence imposed by Judge Curran clearly addresses the principles of sentencing. The fine and prohibition are essentially for specific deterrence, but also have a general deterrence aspect. The terms of the Probation Order impact on general and specific deterrence and rehabilitation. These terms have the benefit of providing an opportunity for assumption in the future by Mr. Carlin of a greater sense of responsibility. Repeat offenders all too often become highway killers. The interest of the public in having the chances of Mr. Carlin repeating this criminal conduct diminished is fostered by the terms of the probation order. There is never any guarantee. Nevertheless, sentences with this goal in mind should be encouraged. Specific deterrence to Mr. Carlin and general deterrence to others is fostered by the two year prohibition which is a sentence of two‑thirds the maximum.CONCLUSIONThe sentence imposed by His Honour Judge Curran is fit and proper in these circumstances and the appeal is dismissed.J."}

WALLACE ROBSON (Appellant)BEFORE:KREVER, OSBORNE and DOHERTY JJ.A.COUNSEL:Edward L. Greenspan and John A. Sutherlandfor the appellantMorris Pistyner and Lisa Futermanfor the respondentHEARD:May 20-21, 1998E N D O R S E M E N TThe Conviction Appeal[1]We will assume that on the case as framed and presented by the Crown, the Crown was required to show that the secret commissions paid to Quenneville constituted employment income (as opposed to any other form of taxable income) in the hands of Quenneville. We read R. v. Poynton (1972), 1972 CanLII 534 (ON CA), 9 C.C.C. (2d) 32 (Ont. C.A.) as directly on point and against the appellant's submission that the secret commissions could not be employment income. Poynton holds that \"kickbacks\" paid to an employee by subcontractors doing business with the employee's employer were taxable income within the meaning of s. 3 of the Income Tax Act and that the payments constituted employment income within the meaning of s. 5 of the Act as it then stood. The terms of the former s. 5 are now found in ss. 5 and 6 of the Income Tax Act. Evans J.A., for the court, said, at p. 43:... There is no difference between money and money's worth in calculating income. They are both benefits and fall within the language of sections 3 and 5 of the Act, being benefits received or enjoyed by the respondent in respect of, in the course, or by virtue of his office or employment. I do not believe the language to be restricted to benefits that are related to the office or employment in the sense that they represent a form of remuneration for services rendered. If it is a material acquisition which confers an economic benefit on the taxpayer and does not constitute an exemption, e.g., loan or gift, then it is within the all embracing definition of s. 3.[2]This passage was quoted with approval by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Savage (1983), 1983 CanLII 32 (SCC), 83 D.T.C. 5409 at 5413. In Savage, the court accepted that the words of s. 5 (now s. 5 and s. 6) have a very wide scope and go beyond payments made by employers as remuneration for services provided.[3]If a taxpayer receives a benefit because of his or her employment then it must be said that the benefit was received in respect of or by virtue of the employment. This is so whether the benefit comes from the employer or a third party. Subject to any applicable exemption or exception, the benefit is, therefore, income from employment within the meaning of s. 5 and s. 6 of the Income Tax Act.[4]On the evidence, the suppliers paid benefits to Quenneville only because Quenneville's position with Fleetwood enabled him to direct specific contracts to specific suppliers. Absent Quenneville's employment and the authority it gave him over the business affairs of Fleetwood, the suppliers would not have paid the benefits. We need not, and do not, decide whether other more tenuous connections between the taxpayer's employment and a benefit received by that taxpayer would suffice to make that benefit employment income within the meaning of ss. 5 and 6.[5]It was ultimately for the jury to decide whether, on the facts as they found them to be, the benefits paid by the suppliers constituted employment income in the hands of Quenneville as defined in the Act and explained by the trial judge. Once the jury found, as they clearly did, that each of the various corporations to which the suppliers made payments at Quenneville's directions was a sham with no legitimate business purpose, it was inevitable that the jury would find that the benefits paid by the suppliers constituted employment income in the hands of Quenneville.[6]The trial judge's instructions with respect to the use of the acts and declarations of Quenneville and others against the appellant was incomplete, confusing, and probably unnecessary. It was also wrong to instruct the jury that Quenneville's admissions made upon his guilty plea to the same charges could have any evidentiary value against the appellant.[7]We are, however, satisfied that these errors occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. Given our interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act, there were only two live issues at trial:•Were the benefits paid to Quenneville?•If the benefits were paid to Quenneville, was the appellant aware that they were secret commissions paid to Quenneville in relation to his employment with Fleetwood?[8]The evidence on both these issues was overwhelmingly against the appellant. Indeed, in this court the appellant through counsel conceded that he was party with Quenneville to a scheme to evade the payment of income tax. He took the position, however, that his involvement was limited to certain interest payments which were fraudulently attributed to a third party rather than Quenneville. The appellant did not testify and, in our view, no reasonable jury, properly instructed, could come to any conclusion other than that he was privy to the entire fraudulent scheme.[9]The conviction appeal is dismissed.[10]The appellant received a sentence of 3 years. Quenneville had pleaded guilty to the same charges earlier and received a sentence of 2 years less a day. That sentence was the product of a joint submission. We are troubled by the disparity. The benefits were the product of Quenneville's criminal activity. He was the source of, the driving force behind, and the sole beneficiary of this fraudulent scheme. The appellant received only normal accounting fees. The appellant was, however, crucial to the scheme. He had the expertise and the stature as an accountant needed to fashion and implement the scheme. In doing so, the appellant clearly breached his professional obligations and did a great disservice to his family, his community, his profession in general and, in particular, to the other accountants with whom he worked. The duration and complexity of the scheme are also aggravating features of this case.[11]Quenneville pleaded guilty, although he denied his guilt when he testified at the appellant's trial. He was no doubt given credit on sentence for his guilty plea. The appellant cannot, however, be punished for exercising his right to a trial.[12]Balancing the various factors as best we can, we conclude that the trial judge erred in principle in imposing a greater sentence on the appellant than was meted out to Quenneville. We think the same sentence, 2 years less a day, would give effect to the applicable sentencing principles and avoid unjustifiable disparity.[13]Leave to appeal sentence is granted. The appeal is allowed and the sentence is reduced to 2 years less 1 day."}

In addition, to an alarm system, it was also protected by what are referred to in the trade as “man-trap entrances”.To enter the store by either the front or rear entrance, one must first pass through an outer door, either by having someone operate a switch inside the store or, in the case of owner or staff, by pressing the correct combination on the electronic keypad outside the store.Once inside the first door, the second door must be unlocked in the same way.That is only possible however, if the outer door has closed and re-locked.These discoveries caused Zwezdaryk to alter his plan.Realizing that he was incapable of opening the safe without setting off the alarm, he decided that, instead of burgling the business, he would break in, lie in wait for the proprietor, Mr. Lash, overpower him and force him to open the safe.To effect the altered plan, he enlisted the assistance of one James Voong, also a criminal, albeit with less of a criminal record than Zwezdaryk.He and Zwezdaryk had previously committed a break-in at a large food emporium in the City of Toronto, by entering through a roof vent and descending to the floor by means of a rope, in an effort to make off with the safe.Unfortunately for them, they managed to trip an alarm and were apprehended within the premises.Voong, however, according to Zwezdaryk’s evidence at trial, was adamant that he would not take a direct part in physically overpowering Mark Lash.He did, however, agree to be a lookout and getaway driver.Accordingly, Zwezdaryk realized that he would have to enlist a third person to be inside with him.He went to Joe Marini, he said, because Marini was someone that he knew would be interested in such a scheme.Marini agreed to participate.According to Zwezdaryk, although he did the majority of it, his two confederates also took part in a certain amount of surveillance.Joe Marini is said to have been at the scene of the intended robbery on a number of occasions in December 1999 and January 2000.Zwezdaryk’s original plan called for the robbery to be conducted before Christmas because he knew that this would be the optimum time insofar as jewellers typically have their largest stock of inventory at that time.Zwezdaryk described one occasion in December 1999 on which he, Voong and Marini were in attendance at the jewellery store on a Sunday night waiting to do the robbery. They waited several hours, but finally left when it became apparent that Mr. Lash would not be coming that night.Finally, on the evening of January 16, 2000, they went yet again to do the robbery.They wore dark clothing, balaclavas and gloves.After reaching the roof of 155 East Beavercreek by climbing a ladder permanently affixed to the side of the building, they gained entry to the premises by removing an inspection plate from an HVAC unit and climbing along the air ducts. Zwezdaryk then tied a knotted climbing rope he had brought with him to a pipe as a means by which to descend to the showroom floor at the appropriate time.The two men then waited atop the walk-in vault for Mr. Lash to arrive.As the robbers had anticipated, Mr. Lash arrived.This was at 11:47 p.m.With Mr. Lash was an employee, Niv Erez.Lash and Erez entered the store and shut off the alarm.They proceeded to the rear of the store to finish some last minute packing for the scheduled move the next day to new premises.Within a minute or so at most of having entered the store, Lash heard a loud noise.According to Zwezdaryk, the noise was caused when, instead of sliding down quietly so as to surprise Lash and Erez, Mr. Marini, unable to manage the descent on the rope with any skill, fell most of the way to the floor.When Lash went to investigate the noise, he was confronted by two men rushing toward him and Erez.One man approached each of the victims. The man who approached Erez forced him to the floor face down and attempted to bind his hands. The other man immediately began to pistol whip Mark Lash about the head, while at the same time making an effort to force him to the floor.Mr. Lash said that he was afraid for his life. In a panic, Lash bit the wrist of the man who was attacking him, causing the man to drop his gun.The man then recovered the gun and shot at Lash at least twice.One bullet pierced his clothing, but passed through without injuring him.Another bullet struck him in the torso, injuring him gravely.Despite having been shot, Mr. Lash was able to run into his office and close the doors.He then heard other shots.Niv Erez also managed to run at this point and managed to push one of the store’s several panic buttons.These buttons were connected to the offices of Chubb Security, the company employed by Lash Enterprises to provide alarm and other security services.From his office, Mr. Lash heard one of the men ask the other whether the panic button had been pushed and, if so, whether it had been pushed all the way.The other man replied that he thought that it had.Mr. Erez was not so fortunate as Mr. Lash.Mr. Erez was shot four times.One of those shots, presumably the last, was a near contact wound to the head, apparently administered as he lay wounded on the floor near the front of the store.Pieces of skull and brain matter were found a distance of a few feet away from the body.Although he lived for a short time thereafter, Mr. Erez’ wounds, particularly the shot to the head, were fatal.He was, in effect, summarily executed.Having executed Mr. Erez in that fashion, I am satisfied that the only reason that Mr. Lash was not hunted down in his office and likewise executed is that the robbers knew that the panic button had been depressed and that help would be on the way.Instead, presumably fearful of the imminent arrival of the authorities, the two intruders left the same way they had entered, by climbing the rope back into the attic area and exiting via the HVAC system.The Shooter:The Crown argues that Mr. Marini was the shooter.After careful consideration I am not able to make that finding beyond a reasonable doubt.Firstly, while I do not go so far as to say that I disbelieve him, I am not prepared to rely on the evidence of Shane Zwezdaryk to that effect standing alone.Zwezdaryk was simply too disreputable a witness with too great an incentive to lie.He was, after all, allowed to plead guilty to the offence of Manslaughter instead of murder based on his cooperation with the police, which included implicating Joe Marini.I am also mindful of the jury’s questions.The last question in particular was whether the person attacking Erez could be said to be helping the man attacking Mr. Lash.This suggests in very strong terms that at least one or more persons on the jury were of the view that Mr. Marini was the man attacking Mr. Erez, or, in other words, not the gunman.The question, to my mind, is not intelligible in any other way.At the risk of stating the obvious, if he were thought to have been attacking Lash there is simply no need to ask the question.The question then, standing alone, suggests very strongly to me that the jury did not find that Joe Marini was the shooter.Even were I to ignore the jury’s questions, as the Crown suggests I ought to do, I would nonetheless not be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Marini was the shooter for the following reasons.The Crown asks me to draw that conclusion on the basis that Zwezdaryk says Joe Marini had a scar on his wrist in the location where Mr. Lash bit his attacker.That evidence is borne out, says the Crown, by the fact that Zwezdaryk had no such mark on his wrist.However, no photograph I have seen of Joe Marini in the course of the trial depicts what I would call a scar of any significance on his wrist.That does not mean that he was not the shooter.Although Mark Lash seems convinced that he broke the skin when he bit his assailant, I am not at all convinced that he did.If he did break the skin, it is not necessarily the case that his assailant would have had a noticeable scar more than six months later.The Crown also says that Mr. Marini made efforts on the occasion of his arrest to cover up his scar by smearing fingerprint powder on his wrist.I did not see any photograph taken on the occasion of his arrest that depicted such smearing.The only evidence of this came from Zwezdaryk, who had, of course, a motive to fabricate his evidence on this point.In the final analysis, then, although I am suspicious that it may well have been Joe Marini who shot the two men, I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he was the shooter.That doubt must, of course, be decided in favour of Mr. Marini and, accordingly, I will proceed to sentence him as though he were not the shooter.Inside or Outside?Secondly, although it was the theory of the Crown up until the time that Shane Zwezdaryk agreed to plead guilty, I reject the defence theory that Joe Marini was the outside accomplice for the following reasons.According to Zwezdaryk, each of the three men went the scene of the crime in his own car. Voong and Zwezdaryk parked their cars in a nearby plaza.All three men left the scene, however, in Marini’s 1988 Chevrolet Caprice.In their haste to make away, Voong and Zwezdaryk left their cars in the nearby plaza where they had parked them.It is clearly established on the evidence that arrangements had to be made to retrieve the vehicles in the early morning hours of January 17, 2000.This evidence is confirmed by certain cellular telephone records and by 407 ETR records showing their vehicles entering onto the highway within a few seconds of each other. Therefore, by process of elimination, one can safely infer that it was Marini’s car that was used as the getaway vehicle.One might think at first blush, that if his car were to be utilized, Marini would be the person most likely to be driving it.On the other hand, however, the cellular telephone records reveal that it was Voong’s cellular telephone that was used to alert Zwezdaryk that Mr. Lash had arrived.The records reveal a phone call outgoing from Voong’s cellular telephone to Zwezdaryk’s cellular telephone at 11:42 p.m., the same time Chubb Security records indicate that Mr. Lash deactivated the alarm system.The line was open for approximately 12 minutes.This was consistent with Zwezdaryk’s testimony that Voong was to stay in contact with him in order to advise of any developments on the outside.Just as one might surmise that Mr. Marini would likely have been driving his own car, one might equally surmise that if Voong’s cellular telephone were to be used it would likely be Voong who would have been using it.But both propositions cannot be correct.For the following reasons, I am convinced that Voong was indeed outside with his own phone, sitting in Joe Marini’s car, and that all three men left the area in that car.I infer that because, inasmuch as he had his own cellular telephone, there would be no reason for Joe Marini to have Voong’s cellular telephone.There would, however, be several good reasons for Voong to have Marini’s car.Firstly, it was bigger than the other two, such that it could hold more property.In this regard, although gems and precious metals are small and readily transportable, the fact is that they were packed in boxes in the safe in preparation for the move the next day, such that the three men might have taken the boxes rather than unpack them before making their getaway.Secondly, the car was non-descript and less apt to be noticed than Voong’s Toyota 4Runner or Zwezdaryk’s Mercedes.That is borne out by the fact that numerous witnesses in this trial could only give a vague and general description of Mr. Marini’s vehicle, whereas virtually every witness who was asked about either Voong or Zwezdaryk’s car was able to describe it with no difficulty.Thirdly, Joe Marini’s car was old and of negligible value, such that it could be readily disposed of should the need arise.The need did in fact arise, and Marini took it to a body shop for the purpose of destroying the interior.While the car itself was seized, the police were not able to do so in time to prevent the destruction of the interior.In concluding that Marini was one of the two men inside, I am also mindful of Zwezdaryk’s evidence, which I accept on this point, that Joe Marini fell when descending the rope.This is confirmed by the broken ceiling tiles at the point where the descent took place and I accept his evidence in this behalf.Although the trial took place more than six years after the events, there were a great many photographs entered into exhibit showing Joe Marini around the time of the incident.In those photographs, Marini appears heavy set and looks a good deal less than fit.Voong, on the other hand, is a much smaller and lighter man, whom I would describe as wiry and well muscled.To the extent that one is able to discern the state of a person’s fitness from his appearance, throughout the number of weeks he was before this court in 2004, and at various appearances thereafter, Voong has always appeared to me to be very fit. In addition, Voong had experience, as mentioned above, ascending and descending ropes in the course of at least one criminal endeavour, namely, the break-in in Toronto.So, while it is possible, I doubt very much that Voong would have fallen had he been the second man.I also very much doubt that it was Zwezdaryk who fell because, as mentioned above, he is extremely adept at climbing ropes.Moreover, whereas Zwezdaryk and Joe Marini are approximately the same height and build, Voong is considerably smaller than either of them.That is of some moment because Mark Lash did not indicate that there was any appreciable difference in the size of the two men he saw.Lastly, I am mindful of the jury’s final question, mentioned above.As well as creating a doubt on the issue of whether Joe Marini was the shooter, it confirms for me the proposition that the jury was convinced that Mr. Marini was inside.It cannot sensibly be understood in any other way.For the foregoing reasons, then, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Joe Marini was the other man inside Mark Lash Enterprises with Zwezdaryk.Knowledge of a Loaded Firearm:Mr. Lafontaine asks me to find that there is a reasonable doubt that Mr. Marini knew that Zwezdaryk had a loaded firearm.In considering that submission, I wish to deal at the outset with a matter Mr. Lafontaine raised for the first time on the sentencing hearing, namely, that the court should amend the indictment as it relates to the count of Robbery.The count as it is currently framed alleges that Joe Marini committed the offence of robbery, contrary to section 344(a) of the Criminal Code.Mr. Lafontaine contends that this is inappropriate because (i) the accused was never committed for trial on that offence; and (ii) the jury was never instructed in terms of having to decide whether Joe Marini actually was a party to a robbery knowing that a firearm was used in the course of that robbery.A conviction based on s.344(a) has a potentially negative impact, counsel says, as it relates to the eligibility of the accused for parole.The first arm of the argument ignores s. 574(1) of the Criminal Code, which gives the prosecutor a plenary power to indict on any offence disclosed by the evidence taken at the preliminary inquiry.There was no count of robbery alleged on the original information upon which the preliminary inquiry was conducted.It was clear, however, on the evidence at this trial that Mark Lash testified on the preliminary inquiry and said, it would appear, much the same thing that he said in this court. It was abundantly clear on his evidence that a firearm was used in the course of the robbery of his store.That said, the Crown was entitled to put such a count before this court.If defence counsel thought there was a problem with this count, the time to have raised this argument was before the accused was arraigned and put in charge of the jury and not, with respect, on the sentencing hearing.As for Mr. Lafontaine’s second point, that the jury was not instructed as to this section, I disagree.Albeit there was no mention of s.344(a) per se, respecting the offence of robbery the jury was instructed, in part, as follows:“Whatever role you ascribe to Joe Marini, if any, whether he be the shooter, the other inside man, or the man waiting outside as the getaway driver, any of those roles would be a sufficient basis upon which to find that a reasonable person in those circumstances would know that the act was dangerous, provided that you were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly participated in the unlawful act of robbery that resulted in the death of Mr. Erez, and provided, further, that you were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew, whatever his particular role, that the robbery would be committed by means of using a handgun to intimidate the persons in the store.So long as you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Joe Marini knew that the robbery would be committed by means of an act that a reasonable person would understand to be dangerous, namely, using a gun to intimidate so as to rob the store, it does not matter for purposes of answering this question that he thought or hoped that the robbery would be carried out without the gun actually being fired or without anyone getting injured.”On the basis of that instruction, the jury could not have found Mr. Marini guilty had they not been satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew that a firearm would be used.I hasten to add, that the instructions in this behalf were discussed at no fewer than three pre-charge conferences.Relating to the offence of robbery, both sides agreed that the jury should be instructed solely in terms of s.343(c); relating to the offence of robbery, no complaint was raised that the jury should be instructed concerning any section other than 343(c).Respecting Mr. Lafontaine’s suggestion that a conviction under section 344(a) will have an impact on Mr. Marini’s parole, given that the jury’s verdict necessarily entails a finding that the offender knew that a firearm would be used in the commission of the robbery, the point is moot.Moreover, there is no evidence before me that it would have any impact beyond that which a conviction registered under s.343(c) would have.Rather, I have only Mr. Lafontaine’s submission to that effect.The parole board will have a copy of my reasons for sentence and will know that Mr. Marini was sentenced on the basis that he knew that the robbery would be committed using a firearm.On all three points, then, the argument is without merit.Returning to the facts, the store was, as mentioned above, alarmed and protected by man-trap entrances.To intimidate the store owner into opening the safe and relinquishing a large cache of gems and precious metals would require a considerable degree of coercive force.Given that the conspirators knew of the existence of the panic buttons, making help readily available to the jeweller if the need should arise, and given the difficulty of leaving the store quickly as a consequence of the man-trap doors, any reasonably intelligent person would doubtless have realized that anything less than the threat of immediate serious bodily harm or death could well be insufficient to intimidate Mr. Lash into relinquishing approximately $2 million dollars worth of stock.While it is fair to say that none of the conspirators would have known the precise value of what Mr. Lash had on hand, it is also fair to say that the plan was only ever conceived in the first place because Zwezdaryk was convinced that Mark Lash Enterprises would be an extremely lucrative place to rob.Presumably, the others would have come to have the same knowledge in order to be convinced to participate in such a venture.The jury’s verdict makes plain that they were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Marini knew that a firearm would be used.Did he, however, know that it would be loaded?It is particularly evident to me for the following reasons that the conspirators knew that the plan called for a loaded gun.Firstly, there is the fact that the men obviously anticipated that Mr. Lash might be accompanied, yet the appearance of a second person, in this case Mr. Erez, did nothing to dissuade the robbers from carrying out their plan.Had they not had a loaded gun, in my view, they may well have declined to attempt the robbery by virtue of the appearance of a second person.They simply would not have known what their chances would have been to successfully overpower the victims if it were a physical contest of two on two.Thus, put another way, it would have been foolhardy, in all the circumstances, to attempt such an enterprise without a loaded firearm.It is not by accident, to my mind, that the man who approached Mr. Lash immediately began to pistol-whip him, whereas the man who approached Erez forced him to the ground without any excessive violence.It is true that Erez was more compliant, as opposed to Mr. Lash who resisted.On the other hand, if all the man with the firearm had wanted to do was subdue Lash, he could have easily ordered him to get on the floor, with the threat of dire consequences, perhaps, if he were not to obey.Alternatively, instead of holding the gun in one hand, he could have used both hands to more effectively wrestle Lash to the ground.In point of fact, however, the man with the gun gave Mr. Lash no time to cooperate, had he been so inclined.Instead, the man approached Lash and instantly began to give him a beating of such severity that Lash’s vision started to blur and he thought that he would lose consciousness.The only sensible explanation for this sudden, unprovoked and brutal assault is that the man with the gun, knowing that Lash was the owner and had the combinations to the vault and the safe within it, wanted to terrorize Mr. Lash to the point that he would be willing to surrender the contents of the vault.It is of note, in this context, that when the man with the gun started to pistol-whip Mr. Lash, the other man neither said nor did anything to indicate that he was either surprised or chagrined by the fact that his confederate was savagely beating Mr. Lash.Lash said that he was struck repeatedly in the head with a handgun.Although the handgun was never recovered, the various projectiles, both spent and unspent, reveal that it was a fairly large calibre weapon, namely, a nine millimetre.I therefore, infer that it must have weighed at least several pounds.Leaving aside the actual shooting of Mr. Lash and Mr. Erez, the photographs of Mr. Lash entered into exhibit at trial show considerable injury to his face and head, attributable to the pistol-whipping.It is inconceivable to me that one could repeatedly strike a person in the face and head, or watch someone else do so, without realizing that the person being beaten would sustain significant injury at the very least.It is also inconceivable to me that a reasonable person would not also recognize the risk of death from such a beating.Objectively viewed, any reasonably intelligent person would realize that to beat another person savagely and repeatedly about the head with a metal object weighing several pounds could have fatal consequences.Additionally, although firearms are designed so as to no discharge accidentally, if a loaded firearm is knocked violently about, there is always the risk that it might discharge accidentally.Thus, I conclude beyond any reasonable doubt that, if it was not Joe Marini who actually administered the beating, Marini was nonetheless content to have his confederate, Zwezdaryk, injure Mr. Lash in order to terrorize him into a suitable frame of mind to surrender his property and, further, that Mr. Marini was indifferent to the risk of death that such a beating entailed.Furthermore, as distinct from using the firearm to pistol-whip Mr. Lash, there is no hint of any surprise or dismay on the part of the man attacking Erez even when the other man begins to actually shoot at Lash and, later, Erez.Surely, if the fact that his confederate not only had a loaded firearm, but was prepared to fire it, had come as a surprise to the man attacking Mr. Erez, one would have expected him to make some comment at that point.If it is not reasonable to expect that the man without the gun would say something at the exact point at which the other man was shooting, surely, if the shooting had come as a surprise, one would have expected some expression of shock or dismay in the immediate aftermath of the shooting.Yet Lash heard the men talking and nothing whatsoever of that nature was said, according to Mr. Lash; rather, the only conversation he heard, as mentioned above, concerned Mr. Erez having pushed the panic button such that they had to leave immediately.Accordingly, I am satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that, albeit he may have intended that the gun not be discharged, Joe Marini knew full well that a loaded firearm was to be used in order to carry out the plan and that it might well be fired if the need were to arise.Having said that, then, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Joe Marini embarked on this criminal endeavour with full knowledge of the circumstances that potentially could, and ultimately did, give rise to the death of Mr. Erez and the grievous wounding of Mr. Lash.Therefore, I find, for purposes of sentencing, that Mr. Marini was the man who initially attacked Niv Erez.That is obviously a very serious matter.It is made more serious because he was effective at subduing Mr. Erez. To my mind, it is because of the fact that he was initially subdued, by being forced to lie on the ground, that Mr. Erez had less chance to escape than Mr. Lash.THE LAW:In passing sentence the court is obliged to consider the concept of retribution, not in the vengeful sense, but, rather, in the sense of conveying society’s denunciation of the abhorrent conduct.In R. v. M. (C. A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, McLachlin C.J.C. said the following:“Retribution in a criminal context, by contrast to vengeance, represents an objective, reasoned and measured determination of an appropriate punishment which properly reflects the moral culpability of the offender… [U]nlike vengeance, retribution incorporates a principle of restraint. Retribution requires the imposition of a just and appropriate punishment and nothing more…. The objective of denunciation mandates that a sentence should also communicate society’s condemnation of that particular offender’s conduct… [A] sentence with a denunciatory element represents a symbolic, collective statement that the offender’s conduct should be punished for encroaching on our society’s basic code of values as enshrined within our substantive criminal law.”In terms of retribution, at the risk of stating the obvious, no sentence that I might impose could ever even begin to compensate the victims of these offences.Although the principal victims were Mr. Erez and Mr. Lash, there are a host of other victims as well.The families of both victims have been profoundly impacted.Friends and associates have also been affected.I listened with great care as the victim impact statements were read into evidence on the last occasion. I have since re-read those statements.Suffice it to say, they are profoundly moving and give the reader a glimpse of the deep and abiding misery that has been suffered, and will continue to be suffered, by but a few of the many innocent people whose lives have been forever changed by Mr. Marini’s callous and cowardly actions.As Watt J. observed in R. v. Browne, [2002] O.J. No. 900, at paras 17 ff:“The criminal law does not restore life.The objectives, principles and factors that govern the imposition of sentence are not meant to represent the value of the life that has been unlawfully taken.They are designed to reflect the moral blameworthiness of the person who commits an offence and the gravity of the offence, so far as the law is concerned, that he or she has committed.”It is trite to observe that sentences for the offence of manslaughter vary greatly. Sentences on the low end tend to reflect a lack of intention on the part of the accused to cause the bodily harm that gave rise to the death: R. v. Ly, [1994] B.C.J. No. 1325, (B.C.C.A.), at para. 59.On the other hand, cases where bodily harm was intended, or if not intended at least anticipated, tend to draw much higher sentences.In R. v. Martineau (1990), 1990 CanLII 80 (SCC), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 353, (S.C.C.), in discussing the constructive murder provisions of the Criminal Code, Lamer C.J.C. said:“[V]ery stiff sentences for the infliction of bodily harm leading to death in appropriate cases would sufficiently meet any deterrence objective that Parliament might have in mind.”This position was reiterated in R. v. Kutschera (1999), 1999 BCCA 748 (CanLII), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 254, (B.C.C.A.), where, in a dissenting opinion, Southin J.A. said, at para. 18 ff.:“In both Martineau and its predecessor, R. v. Vaillancourt, [1987] 2. S.C.R. 636, 1987 CanLII 2 (SCC), 39 C.C.C. (3d) 118, the Supreme Court of Canada addressed itself to the concept of subjective foresight of death as being a necessary ingredient of a conviction for murder.But, in neither case, did the Supreme Court of Canada say that to cause a death in the commission of an indictable offence was not a grave offence attracting a severe sentence.It did not reduce such a crime to the level, say, of manslaughter in a drunken consensual brawl.”*****“To my mind, the circumstances of the offender are of minor consideration in a case of what would once have been constructive murder.”Likewise, in R. v. Fujimori, [1995] B.C.J. No. 2648 (B.C.C.A.), McEachern, C.J.B.C., said “[i]t is often useful to distinguish between cases where a death is caused by foolish misadventure as opposed to deliberate criminal activity.” Here the death of Mr. Erez and the serious bodily harm and lasting psychic trauma to Mr. Lash was no foolish misadventure.It was deliberate, premeditated and violent criminal activity.The tragic consequences of January 16, 2000, came to pass as a consequence of the unbridled greed of this offender and his confederates and, in pursuit of their illicit goal, their utter indifference to the risk of serious harm or death to innocent people.While obviously any robbery in which someone is grievously injured and another person is killed is very serious, this case is rendered more serious still by virtue of the use of a firearm: R. v. Osbourne (1994), 1994 CanLII 7209 (ON CA), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 435, (Ont. C.A.). The court in Osbourne relied upon the following passage from R. v. Langevin (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d) 138, (Ont. C.A.), in which Martin J.A. said:“It is clear to me that Parliament intended by s.83 to repress the use of firearms in the commission of crimes by making such use an offence in its own right, and one which attracts a minimum sentence of one year consecutive to that imposed for the offence which such accompanies.The use of firearms in the commission of crimes is fraught with danger and gravely disturbing to the community, and Parliament has sought to protect the public from the danger and alarm caused by that use by enacting the present legislation.It is not for the Courts to pass upon either the wisdom or the necessity for the legislation, but to give effect to the clear intention of Parliament expressed in language which reflects that intention.That passage was later approved by Dickson J. (as he then was) in McGuigan v. The Queen (1982), 1982 CanLII 41 (SCC), 66 C.C.C. (2d) 97, (S.C.C.).The concern expressed in those cases persists to this day, as evidenced by the fact that the minimum one-year sentence has since been increased to a minimum four-year term and may in the near future be raised again as a consequence of a bill recently tabled in Parliament.Antecedents of the Accused:No pre-sentence report was ordered in this case. Instead, counsel saw fit to acquaint me with the background of the accused by way of his submissions.No issue is taken by the Crown with the information Mr. Lafontaine advanced.I am told that Mr Marini is now thirty-eight years of age.He was approximately thirty-two at the time of the commission of these offences. He is married with two children, ages six and three.He lives in a home the family owns in Mississauga.Very little was put before me by way of a work history for this offender.I am told that in the last three years he has mainly stayed at home to tend to the children while his wife goes out to work as a dental hygienist.I am told that this is by choice.There was evidence at trial that the offender worked for a time selling coffins.He was evidently involved with Zwezdaryk in this endeavour.This pre-dated the commission of these offences and the court was not told any details about this activity.There was a suggestion put to various witnesses by the Crown, and adopted by at least one of them, that Joe Marini around the time of the commission of these offences was involved in operating a bar in downtown Toronto.However, when cross-examined at trial, Joe Marini’s wife did not seem to be aware of this.There was evidence that the offender was, in the months following January 16, 2000, attempting to go into business selling window glass.No details were provided as to during what period and for how long this was the case.I was told by counsel that Mr. Marini worked for a time for his father in a tool and die shop.I was not told when or for how long that employment lasted.Counsel also mentioned that Mr. Marini worked in the construction trade. Again, I was not advised when or for how long that employment existed.Several of the transcripts I examined in the course of deciding a section 11(b) application refer to the accused having come from work to court, so I assume that he was working during some of the period of his pre-trial release. It is interesting that when his mother was asked in cross-examination she could not say what her son did for a living.In short, then, I am left with a very sketchy picture of what this man has done to support himself and his family throughout most of his adult life.The accused is a first offender.Accordingly, subject to what I will say in few moments, rehabilitation is an important factor in sentencing.That is particularly the case, of course, where the offender is youthful.That is borne out by an examination of the numerous cases provided by Mr. Lafontaine.Of all the cases he provided in which the age of the offender is mentioned, approximately a dozen or so in number, the average age of the offender is approximately twenty-four.In this case, the accused’s first-offender status, while still important, is diminished somewhat, in my view, since Mr. Marini is not particularly youthful.He was, as stated, approximately thirty-two years of age at the time he committed these offences and was married with one child, who was scarcely two weeks old on January 16, 2000.He had, therefore, the benefit of maturation and life experience not available to the offenders in the majority of cases relied upon by Mr. Lafontaine.Yet, despite that advantage, Mr. Marini nonetheless saw fit to embark upon this larcenous, and ultimately deadly, scheme.The offender has had by all accounts a relatively normal upbringing.He was raised in Toronto in what appears to have been a loving and nurturing environment.While not rich, the family appears to have been economically sound. There is no evidence of any abusive behaviour suffered by this offender.There is no suggestion that he was afflicted by any learning or other disability.As for his adult life, apart from the previously mentioned paucity of employment evidence, there is no evidence of any financial difficulties that the offender was undergoing at the time of these offences.Likewise, there is no evidence of any substance abuse or other dependency or situation that could account for why the offender chose to engage in this conspiracy.In short, there is no evidence before me of any unusual circumstance that could explain this behaviour.Absent other explanations, the only motivation that emerges is avarice.Principles of Sentencing:In sentencing a court must pay heed to a number of different principles.Sometimes those principles are in conflict in that the length of sentence required to properly serve one is inconsistent with the length of sentence required to serve another.In such a case, an appropriate resolution may require that one or the other of those principles be the predominantconsideration: R. v. Szola [1976] O.J. No. 1229, (1977), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 572.In R. v. Biln 1999 BCCA 369 (CanLII), [1999] B.C.J. No. 1411, (B.C.C.A.), at para 17, McEachern C.J.B.C. said: “[s]entencing is indeed an art rather than a science.What a sentencing judge must do is balance the various principles and decide which ones govern a particular case.”As stated above, rehabilitation is an important factor, in sentencing a first offender and I recognize that the sentence to be imposed on Mr. Marini must not be so long as to crush him or eclipse any prospect of his rehabilitation. Having said that, given the premeditation, the financial motive, and the extreme violence involved in these offences, the predominant principles of sentencing in this case must be deterrence, both general and specific, and denunciation: R. v. Rajakulasingham [1994] O.J. No. 2357, (Ont. G.D); R. v. Fleming [1993] N.S.J. No. 469, (C.A.); R. v. Fletcher-Jarvis, [2005] O.J. No. 271, (C.A.); R. v. O.T., [2005] O.J. No. 1499, (C.A.)Similar Sentences for Similar Offences:Paragraph 718.2(b) of the Criminal Code requires that a sentencing court take into account the sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.Accordingly, in an effort to arrive at an appropriate sentence, I have considered a number of similar cases, some of which are set out below.In R. v. Yaari, 1995 CanLII 1751 (ON CA), [1995] O.J. No. 3030, (Ont. C.A.), the accused was sentenced to sixteen years imprisonment for manslaughter arising from the robbery of a jewellery store in which the proprietor was killed.The accused had a prior record for rape, for which he had served six years in a Russian penitentiary.Although the amount is not stated in the decision, or in the respondent’s factum, which was filed on this hearing, it is clear that Yaari served some amount of pre-trial custody on the robbery and manslaughter charges.In dismissing the appeal, the Court said at para. 10:“The sentence must be examined in its totality.Considering the enormous amount of money involved and the sophistication of the plan, but more importantly the tragic death that ensued, the sentence of sixteen years cannot be interfered with.”Those comments are apposite this case.In R. v. Whyte, [2001] O.J. No. 212, a case provided by Mr. Lafontaine, the Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of fourteen years imposed by Ewaschuk J. on an offender for the offence of Manslaughter committed by the accused in the course of robbing a drug dealer.Because of a lengthy record, which included firearms offences, the trial judge had considered the accused to be approaching the “worst offender” status.That is not Mr. Marini’s situation. However, in terms of the likelihood of bodily harm, the Court of Appeal noted that the accused had been “a willing party to a robbery with an armed accomplice.”That is Joe Marini’s situation.In R. v. Crooks, [1996] O.J. No. 3965, (Ont. G.D.), the offender was sentenced to eight years for manslaughter.He and an associate, McKinnon, decided to rob the Firearms Training Centre in Ajax, Ontario, to steal the inventory of firearms for resale on the street.They attended the facility where MacKinnon rented a firearm from the victim.They proceeded to the firing range where MacKinnon practiced shooting for a time, then returned to the reception area where MacKinnon shot and killed the victim.They then stole three firearms and fled the scene, returning to school.Two factors accounting for a more lenient sentence for Crooks were the fact that he was seventeen at the time of the offence and that he had testified against McKinnon, who was convicted of First Degree Murder, such that he had a reasonable fear of reprisal.In R. v. Potter, [1979] A.J. No. 369, the accused beat and seriously injured the proprietor in the course of a jewellery store robbery.He pleaded guilty to the charge of attempted murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment.Potter was 19 years old with no previous record of violence.He had had a difficult childhood.On appeal, in light of his age, background and previous non-violent conduct, the sentence was reduced to 12 years.In R. v. McNarland, [2001] B.C.J. No. 1059, the Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of sixteen years, imposed at trial.The trial judge had reduced the sentence from twenty years on account of two years pre-trial custody.The accused had attempted to rob a drug dealer.When the initial plan went awry, the accused and his cohorts kidnapped the victim and drove him around in the back of a van.Ultimately, they shot the victim and threw his body on the street where it was found by passers-by.The jury could not decide who among several accused had actually shot the victim and, thus, McNarland was found guilty of manslaughter.He received lesser concurrent sentences for the offences of robbery and kidnapping.In R. v. Gough [1995] O.J. No. 4325, (Ont. G.D.) Ewaschuk J, said:“In arriving at a fit sentence for … the charge of manslaughter, I start with the legal proposition that an armed robbery in which an innocent victim is killed demands a very stiff sentence.This has been dictated by the judgment of Chief Justice Lamer in the celebrated case of Regina versus Vaillancourt.To my mind a very stiff sentence in the context of manslaughter during an armed robbery lies within the range of 15 years imprisonment to life imprisonment.”The sentence was later reduced to twelve years on account of the offender’s youth and lengthy pre-trial custody: [2001] O.J. No. 4096, (C.A.).In R. v. Browne, supra, Watt J. said at para 18:“The message in cases like this must be plain and simple: those who cause death, even by accident, by bringing weapons to a drug deal can expect a lengthy penitentiary sentence for having done so.”While this was not a drug deal, those remarks are no less apposite in the case at bar.In R. v. Carriere 2002 CanLII 41803 (ON CA), [2002] O.J. No. 1429, an aboriginal with a lengthy record, including crimes of violence, robbed a convenience store while armed with a gun and wearing a mask.He chased the owner to the back of the store, struggled with the victim and ultimately shot him twice in front of the victim's son.The Court of Appeal noted that manslaughter covers everything from intentional to unintentional, almost accidental killing.Considering the planned nature of the armed robbery and the vulnerability of the victim, the court concluded that the case came very close to murder. Inasmuch as Carriere approached the \"worst offender\" category, the court imposed a sentence of 17 years.Apart from the fact that Joe Marini is not the worst offender, the facts are obviously similar to the case at bar.In R. v. Marks [1996] O.J. No. 5262, one Farrell, 22 years of age, and Marks, 27, were convicted of manslaughter, conspiracy to commit robbery, possession of a weapon for the purpose of committing robbery, and wearing masks with the intent of committing robbery.They had participated in a robbery of a man in his home while masked and armed with at least one hand gun.Both had prior criminal records, although neither had served any substantial period in jail.They both followed itinerant criminal lifestyles involving illegal drugs, stolen property, and firearms.After two years of pre-trial custody, Marks received a sentence of nine years.Farrell, who was paralyzed below the waist as a result of having been shot in a subsequent, unrelated incident, received eight years.In R. v. Leaf [2004] O.J. No. 1692, (S.C.), the accused, an aboriginal, pleaded guilty to manslaughter.He had attempted to “rip off” several people who had approached him to buy contraband cigarettes.The robbery was planned and Leaf was armed with a loaded firearm.The death of the victim came about as a result of the accidental discharge of the firearm.The accused was sentenced to nine years; in light of twenty-nine months pre-trial custody this was the equivalent of twelve years imprisonment.He was sentenced to concurrent terms of six years for robbery and two years for possession of counterfeit money.Ratushny J. held that Leaf’s aboriginal status did not change the primary objectives of sentencing, which were denunciation and deterrence.However, the unique systemic or background factors that played a role in bringing an aboriginal offender to court were considered.Leaf had taken steps towards change and was encouraged to continue those positive steps.Parity of Sentence:As well as being obliged to consider similar sentences imposed on similarly situated offenders generally, in passing sentence I must also be mindful of the principle of parity respecting the sentences meted out to the other offenders in this case.However, the principle of parity is not absolute and should not divert the court’s attention from other sentencing criteria, such as the nature and seriousness of the offence, and the individual characteristics of the accused: R. v. LeBlanc, 1997 CanLII 9544 (NB CA), [1997] N.B.J. No. 125, (C.A.)Mr. Voong pleaded guilty on the basis of facts agreed between the Crown and defence that he acted as a lookout, never entered the jewellery store and did not know that a gun would be used. As I have said earlier, I do not accept that anyone who was a party to the conspiracy could have thought that it could be accomplished without a gun.That, however, does not change the fact that Voong was sentenced on that basis. Had the sentencing judge sentenced Voong on the basis that he knew of the gun, presumably the sentence would have been longer.Voong had a criminal record, although less lengthy than Zwezdaryk’s record; it consisted of seven convictions, six of which had been in youth court.His only adult conviction was the offence respecting which he was co-accused with Zwezdaryk.McIsaac J. sentenced Voong to the equivalent of 9 and a half years imprisonment, when pre-trial custody is taken into account.Defence counsel does not argue that McIsaac J. erred in imposing a sentence of that length.I have found as fact, as stated above, that Mr. Marini was inside and an active participant in the violence that ensued, albeit, I do not find that he was the shooter.That said, even allowing for the fact that Voong had a criminal record, it would seem to me to be anomalous that Marini should be sentenced to less time than Voong.Zwezdaryk received a sentence that was the equivalent of 11 years when allowance was made for pre-trial custody.Like Mr. Marini, Zwezdaryk was sentenced on the basis of being not the shooter, but, rather, the other inside perpetrator.Zwezdaryk has, of course a lengthy criminal record and is, by his own admission, a career criminal.This accused has, as stated above, no criminal record.Mr. Lafontaine maintains that this difference is such that it militates toward a sentence for Mr. Marini that is appreciably less severe than that received by Zwezdaryk.The presence of remorse is a mitigating factor in sentencing.A guilty plea is taken to be a sign of remorse.Respecting their criminal antecedents, offsetting the difference between Zwezdaryk and Voong, on the one hand, and Joe Marini, on the other, then, is the fact that Zwezdaryk and Voong pleaded guilty, whereas the accused stood his trial.Before Zwezdaryk’s guilty plea, it was thought that the trial of the three accused together would require six months of court time.That estimate was realistic, in my view.Inasmuch as this trial took three months, in point of fact, by pleading guilty, Zwezdaryk and Voong together saved the state approximately three months of trial time.Although obvious, perhaps, it is also worthy of mention that a guilty plea is not mitigating only because it saves the state the time and expense of a trial.In a case such as this, it also saves the victim the anguish of having to relive horrible events in minute detail.In this case Mr. Lash was in the witness box for more than a day.There were times during his evidence when Mr. Lash had to stop and take time to compose himself before being able to carry on.It was obviously a deeply traumatic experience for him to have to relive and recount the events of January 16, 2000.The fact of a guilty plea by one accused can be a proper basis upon which to distinguish a more lenient sentence for that person as against the sentence imposed upon a co-accused who does not plead guilty: R. v. Mohamad, 2004 CanLII 9378 (ON CA), 69 O.R. (3d) 481, [2004] O.J. No. 279, (C.A.).In that case the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by Mohamad from a custodial sentence despite his co-accused having received a conditional sentence for the same offences.Having said that, I do not make as much of the presence of remorse on the part of Zwezdaryk and Voong as I might in another case.It would be naïve to think that either of them, particularly Shane Zwezdaryk, despite his protestations to the contrary, has had an epiphany.I recognize that they were in all likelihood motivated by largely by self-interest, as determined by a cost/benefit analysis of pleading guilty versus standing trial.Nonetheless, whatever the motivations underlying a guilty plea, it is well settled that it is to be recognized as a sign of remorse.That said, I must give Zwezdaryk and Voong credit for remorse in weighing parity of sentence in relation to Mr. Marini: R. v. Gagne, [1996] O.J. No. 3839, (S.C.).Mr. Lafontaine suggests that it must be remembered that the sentence meted out to Shane Zwezdaryk also reflected his guilty pleas to three other unrelated break and enter charges, such that the global sentence for the offences we are concerned with here should be considered to somewhat lower.In addition, Mr. Lafontaine points out, a large number of other break and enter charges were withdrawn, suggesting that this court should take account of those charges as part of the global sentence of eleven years. I disagree with this analysis.As for the charges withdrawn, there is nothing before me to indicate why they were withdrawn or whether they were capable of being proven, in any event.Moreover, accused persons are sentenced for what they are found guilty of, not what they were charged with when the charges have been withdrawn.Accordingly, I do not accept that the withdrawn charges somehow factored into the sentence that Zwezdaryk received.Respecting the three Toronto break-ins, notwithstanding two of the three residences were occupied, there was no injury to anyone and relatively little property was taken, all of which was recovered when Zwezdaryk was arrested on the scene of the last of the three break-ins.Without meaning in any way to minimize the seriousness of those offences, or the upset to the respective homeowners, when contrasted with the gravity of the offences we are concerned with here, they pale into relative insignificance.This discussion is somewhat artificial, of course, because in actuality Zwezdaryk only received one day in jail as a function of the calculus applied to his five-plus years of pretrial custody.Having said that, taking the eleven-year equivalence at face value, I simply do not accept that the sentence would have been any less here had those other offences not been part of the resolution of Zwezdaryk’s outstanding charges.That view is borne out by the fact that the sentences for those offences were concurrent to the offences arising from the robbery of the Lash jewelry store.In contrast to Zwezdaryk and Voong, however limited their remorse may be, there is no evidence before me of any remorse on the part of Mr. Marini.Accordingly, while I do not treat the fact that Joe Marini stood his trial to be an aggravating factor, he cannot now rely on remorse to mitigate what would otherwise be an appropriate sentence: R. v. Pavich, 2000 CanLII 16971 (ON CA), [2000] O.J. No. 4209, (Ont. C.A.).What, then, is the appropriate approach to sentencing Mr. Marini relative to the sentences received by Voong and Shane Zwezdaryk, understanding that each of them had a prior record?In R. v. Price, 2000 CanLII 5679 (ON CA), [2000] O.J. No. 886, (Ont. C.A.), Fred Price was sentenced to nine years imprisonment for the robbery of a jewellery store.He had been the getaway driver, but had not participated in the robbery itself.The court found that there had been no evidence that Price had “either countenanced or envisaged the violence that occurred.”Price had a positive pre-sentence report and, although he had a prior record, it did not contain any convictions for offences of violence.A co-accused, Victor Price, had pleaded guilty and testified against Fred Price.Notwithstanding what McMurtry C.J.O. described as “a serious criminal record”, and the fact that he had taken part in the robbery while being armed, Victor Price was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.The Court of Appeal held unanimously that the trial judge had erred in treating Fred equally to the other participants in the robbery, when the net effect of that was to give him a sentence that was nearly twice that received by Victor.Accordingly, they reduced Fred Price’s sentence from nine to six and a half years.For present purposes, the important fact that emerges from this case is that, even after Fred Price’s sentence was reduced on appeal, notwithstanding the fact that Victor Price was armed and actually participated in the robbery, and notwithstanding his serious criminal record, Victor still received a lesser sentence than Fred Price.See also R. v. Green [1999] O.J. No. 5607, where O’Connor J. distinguished between the sentences to be imposed on two offenders on the basis that one had pleaded guilty whereas the other stood his trial.Similarly, in R. v. Barton, 2003 BCCA 206 (CanLII), [2003] B.C.J. No. 853, the British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld an eleven-year sentence for manslaughter arising from a home invasion.Barton was twenty-two years of age at the time of the offence and had had a very unfortunate background.When twenty months pre-trial custody was considered, the sentence was the equivalent of fourteen years. One ground of appeal was that the sentencing judge did not properly consider the differing levels of moral culpability of the two offenders.In that case Barton had a serious criminal record, but a lesser role than his co-accused in causing death.The sentencing judge held that, despite his lesser role, Barton’s longer criminal record, and the fact that it was a planned joint venture, made the two equally culpable.Levine J. A., speaking for the court, held that the sentencing judge made no error in principle in imposing the same sentences on the two offenders.He also observed that the sentencing judge was correct in her conclusion that the principles of denunciation and deterrence are the most important in crimes of the nature of those committed by the appellant and his co-accused, and that retribution was also a relevant objective.In R. v. Marks, supra, in addressing the relative degrees of culpability between two offenders, Rutherford J. said:“It is my conclusion that the jury was satisfied that in these circumstances that both Farrell and Marks were parties to the homicidal shooting of Tomlinson by virtue of sub-section 2 of s.21 of the Criminal Code, in that whether one or the other, or even Wilkins, actually fired the fatal shot, both of the accused share culpability in that homicide because of the obvious risk of harm involved in the illegal and dangerous enterprise that they were carrying out.”I am also mindful of the fact that Zwezdaryk, unlike Voong, agreed to cooperate with the authorities. While it seems fair to say that the jury did not believe much of what he had to say, Zwezdaryk’s cooperation with the police is, nonetheless, an extremely significant factor.It must be remembered that, but for the information he gave the police, the hair that matched Joe Marini’s genetic profile to a probability of 1 to 120 billion would never have been recovered.That hair was, to my mind, the single most important piece of evidence in this trial.Having considered the authorities relating to parity, and bearing in mind that, at the end of the day, they will both have been sentenced on the basis of being the non-shooter, I am of the view that Mr. Marini should receive a sentence in the same general range as was meted out to Zwezdaryk.Pre-trial Custody:I must take account of the custody already served by Mr. Marini both initially before being granted bail and since his bail was cancelled upon conviction.That custody amounts in the aggregate to approximately six and a half months.Accordingly, employing the usual calculus, I credit him with fourteen months of time already served.Judicial Interim Release:I must also take account of time spent on bail where the nature of that bail amounted to a significant restriction upon the liberty of the offender: R. v. Downes, (Ont. C.A.).Unlike pre-trial custody, respecting which there is a well-established norm as to how much credit to award, Downes makes it clear that there is no similar calculus in relation to judicial interim release and that it is a matter entirely for the trial judge to determine, provided that he or she does take it into account in some measure.Mr. Lafontaine argues that I should credit the accused on a scale of four to one or, failing that, no less than five to one.In that behalf, although the terms of his bail appear at first blush to be very restrictive, amounting to house arrest, I am not persuaded that Joe Marini deserves anything so generous as the ratio suggested by Mr. Lafontaine.Looked at carefully, his bail does not seem to me to have amounted to a significant restriction on Joe Marini’s liberty.I say that for the following reasons:(i)He was allowed to leave the house for work. He must have been working for at least some part of the time he was on judicial interim release because, as I noted in my reasons in connection with the application for a stay based on an alleged breach of s. 11(b) of the Charter, there is mention in several of the transcripts of various appearances in this matter that the accused had come to court directly from work.(ii) I am advised by Mr. Lafontaine that in the last three years or so, since the birth of Mr. Marini’s second child, he has stayed at home while his wife has gone out to work and is, of his own volition, a “stay-at-home father”.(iii)His bail order provides that he may be out of his house in company with any one of his sureties.On his original bail he had two sureties.On a subsequent variation of bail, he had three sureties and, more latterly still, five sureties.To my mind, this put him at a considerable advantage over the average accused person, who, as often as not, has only one surety upon whom to call when he needs to be chaperoned outside his house.(iv)There was also a period of some six months prior to the birth of his second child when, as well as being allowed to go to work on his own, Mr. Marini was allowed to be outside his house during the day unescorted.This had to do with his wife being in hospital with a difficult pregnancy.(v)Although he brought several bail reviews, he never actually pursued any of them to completion.At the most, on two occasions, his counsel persuaded the Crown to consent to certain very basic changes that did not increase his liberty; rather, they simply took account of a changed situation, for example, when he moved from one residence to another.In light of the considerable liberty he did have, as mentioned above, Mr. Marini’s failure to follow through with any bail review that actually sought to lessen his restrictions, suggests to me, that he did not consider the conditions under which he was released to be particularly onerous.Rosenberg J.A. makes clear in R. v. Downes that “[w]here the offender asks the trial judge to take pre-sentence bail conditions into account, the offender should supply the judge with information as to the impact of the conditions.” No evidence has been put before me as to the impact upon this offender of his bail conditions.It has been about 70 months since the offender was arrested.For about 63 of those months he has been on judicial interim release.I credit, Mr. Marini with ten months time served in respect of the period of pre-trial release. Based on the foregoing factors, and the lack of any direct evidence of the impact of his bail, that is somewhat more than is warranted in my view, but, added to the 14 months I have allocated for pre-trial custody, it is a convenient number inasmuch as it makes the total period to be deducted an even two years.SENTENCE:In R. v. Laberge (1995), 1995 ABCA 196 (CanLII), 165 A.R. 375 (C.A.), Fraser C.J.A. stated at p. 382:“[T]he court must look not only at thephysical characterization of the act itself, but must assess a range of other considerations. These include the choice of weapon used to effect the unlawful act, the degree of force the offender used in perpetrating the act, the extent of the victim's injuries, the degree of violence or brutality, the existence of any additional gratuitous violence, the degree of the deliberation involved in the act, the extent to which the act reflected forethought of action or planning, the complexity of the act, what, if anything, provoked the act, the time taken to perpetrate the act and the element of chance involved in the resulting death.”This case has the following mitigating factors:(i)the accused is a first offender; and(ii)the accused has strong family support.This case has the following aggravating factors:(i)the initial offence of robbery was preceded by a conspiracy to commit it;(ii)the offence of robbery involved considerable planning, including surveillance and multiple prior break-ins into the Lash jewellery store, each a serious offence in itself;(iii) a loaded firearm was used;(iv) the perpetrators were masked;(v)the initial plan involved a degree ofviolence that had a high risk of serious bodily harm and possibly death;(vi) there was serious injury to Mark Lash from the initial violence;(vii) Joe Marini was an active participant inthe initial violence;(viii)the shooting of Mr. Lash nearly resulted in his death;(ix) the lasting trauma to Mark Lash;(x)that Niv Erez was executed;(xi) the property the robbers hoped to steal had a wholesale value of approximately $2 million dollars;(xii) the vulnerability of shopkeepers as aclass of victims; and(xiii) the accused attempted to obstruct the course of the investigation by attempting to destroy evidence, namely, by taking his car to Rogers Road Autobody to have the interior removed.Based on those factors, I am of the view that the appropriate range of sentence is between ten to fifteen years to properly take account of the principles of deterrence and denunciation, which must be the foremost considerations in such a crime.Having said that, guided by fact that the accused is a first offender and by the principle of parity respecting the other offenders in this case, I am of the view that an appropriate sentence in this case, is one of twelve years. As earlier stated, considering his pre-trial custody and the conditions and length of his pre-trial release, I give Mr. Marini a total credit of two years time served.Please stand, Mr. Marini.In the result, for the offence of Conspiracy to Commit Robbery, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of four years imprisonment.For the offence of Robbery, I sentence you to six years imprisonment.For the offence of Aggravated Assault, I sentence you to eight years imprisonment.For the offence of Manslaughter, I sentence you to ten years imprisonment.The sentences will all run concurrently for a total sentence of ten years in the penitentiary.I make no order pursuant to s.741.2 of the Criminal Code.You may be seated.Section 109(2) Order:Pursuant to subsection 109(2) of the Criminal Code, I am required by law to order, and I do so order, that Mr. Marini be prohibited from possessing any firearm and any cross-bow, restricted weapon, ammunition or explosive substance for a period commencing today and ending ten years from the day of his final release from custody on the sentence that I have just imposed.In addition, Mr. Marini is prohibited from possessing any prohibited firearm, restricted firearm, prohibited weapon, prohibited device or prohibited ammunition for life.Section 487.051 DNA Orders:In relation to the two primary designated offences, Mr. Marini, of which you stand convicted, namely, Manslaughter and Aggravated Assault, I make an order, pursuant to subparagraph 487.05(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, in Form 5.03, authorizing the authorities to take from you, for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis, such number of samples of one or more bodily substances as are reasonably necessary for that purpose, by means of the investigative procedures described in subsection 487.06(1).In relation to the two secondary designated offences of which you stand convicted, namely, Conspiracy to Commit Robbery and Robbery, I make a further order, pursuant to subparagraph 487.051(1)(b) of the Criminal Code, in Form 5.04, authorizing the authorities to take from you, for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis, such number of samples of one or more bodily substances as are reasonably necessary for that purpose, by means of the investigative procedures described in subsection 487.06(1).In deciding to make an order relating to the secondary designated offences, I have considered, on the one hand, that the offender has no prior criminal record.On the other hand, these offences are extremely serious and the circumstances surrounding their commission are extremely grave.Nev Erez was brutally and senselessly executed.It is little short of miraculous that Mr. Lash was not killed.These facts satisfy me that this offender is capable of participating in acts of extreme violence, or, at the very least capable of acquiescing in such acts by other persons when it serves his needs.In the absence of any indication of remorse, I am of the view, that Mr. Marini is the sort of person who might well re-offend if given the opportunity.The public is entitled to the assurance that, should that happen, the authorities will have at their disposal, the appropriate tools to enable them to detect that Mr. Marini is the culprit.Furthermore, although, in keeping with the language of the sections, these orders allow for the taking of more than one sample, such orders are generally accomplished with the taking of one sample.Therefore, in light of the fact that the taking of such a sample is mandatory in relation to the primary designated offences, the making of the discretionary order under paragraph 487.051(1)(b) will have no impact upon the offender’s privacy or his security of the person that is not already extant by virtue of the mandatory order.That completes my reasons for sentence.FORM 2Certificate of TranscriptEvidence Act, subsection 5 (2)I, Deborah Tinmouth, certify that this document is a true and accurate transcript of the recording of R. v.

Coombs, for the appellantW. Kent Brown, Q.C., for the respondentMcQUAID J.A.:FACTS AND BACKGROUND[1]On August 23, 1999 at approximately 6:00 p.m., the respondent was driven to the Oak Tree Place Mall on Upper Queen Street, Charlottetown, P.E.I.The driver of the vehicle parked in front of the parcel pickup exit of the Island Food Centre Co-op. The respondent exited the vehicle and entered the Co-op through the parcel pickup exit door, walked down a dimly lit alley which led to a small office where the head cashier was totalling the cash and preparing a bank deposit.[2]The respondent wore a dark blue nylon stocking over his face.He was dressed in black, carried a 12-gauge sawed-off shot gun and wore two belts full of shotgun shells, one around his neck and one around his waist.There were very few customers in the store when the respondent entered and only two cashiers were working.[3]The respondent opened the door to the office where the head cashier was working and said “give me all your money.”The head cashier initially thought another employee was playing a practical joke.The respondent pointed the sawed off shot gun at her and shouted “I am not fucking around.”[4]He opened his jacket and showed the clerk the gun belts full of shot gun shells.He then threw a black nylon bag on the floor and ordered the clerk to fill it with money. She emptied her cash tray and was ordered by the respondent to fill the kit bag with cash and cheques from a locked cabinet.The total amount of cash put into the bag was $10,114.00 and cheques in the amount of $3,214.68.He left the store through the alley leading to the parcel pickup exit.The robbery was witnessed by one of the cashiers whose work station was close to the office of the head cashier.[5]The respondent drove off in the vehicle and proceeded directly to a residence situated at 10 Young Street in Charlottetown.The residence was occupied by the former common law spouse of the respondent and the mother of his two teenage daughters. The arrival at the residence by the respondent and his accomplice was both unannounced and uninvited.[6]The respondent ordered his former common law spouse to get rid of the vehicle. In accordance with these orders the vehicle was driven to premises located at Jordan Crescent in Charlottetown. He also ordered one of the occupants of the home at Young Street to dispose of the shot gun, and it was dismantled as ordered by the respondent and thrown in the marsh near Jordan Crescent.Without informing the occupants, the respondent hid the two gun belts and shot gun shells in the basement of the residence at Young Street, where they were discovered a few days following the robbery.[7]The respondent phoned a taxi from the residence at Young Street and directed the taxi driver to drive him and his accomplice to Summerside.On the way to Summerside, he directed the taxi driver to take them to Moncton, N.B.At approximately 8:30 p.m., while driving to Moncton, the taxi was stopped by the R.C.M.P. The respondent and his accomplice were arrested and found to be in possession of $9,447.42 in cash.The cheques in the amount of $3,214.68 were not recovered.[8]The respondent was charged with having committed robbery in contravention of s-s.343(d) of the Criminal Code. He was held in custody from the time of his arrest until sentencing, a period of approximately four months. After a preliminary inquiry, where he was committed to stand trial in the Supreme Court, he entered a plea of guilty before a judge of the Trial Division and a sentencing hearing was held on November 26, 1999.There was no pre-sentence report.On November 29th the Trial Division judge imposed a sentence of five (5) years in a Federal prison and pursuant to s.109 of the Code he imposed a weapons’ prohibition for ten years.THE DECISION OF THE SENTENCING JUDGE[9]The sentencing judge acknowledged the seriousness of the offence and the need of the criminal justice system to protect the public from offenders who use weapons in the commission of an offence.He indicated that while the rehabilitation of the offender was a consideration in all sentences, in this case the sentencing objective of general deterrence was to have paramountcy particularly in view of the fact that Parliament had amended the Criminal Code in 1996 to provide that the minimum sentence for the use of a weapon in the commission of a robbery was four years in prison.He then went on to review a number of authorities in this jurisdiction and others where varying terms of imprisonment were imposed for robbery.Some of the offences he reviewed involved robbery with the use of a weapon, others did not.He specifically relied upon a decision of this court,R v. Doughty (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 224 (P.E.I.S.C. in banco).[10]The sentencing judge concluded that the amendment to the Criminal Code which resulted in the provision of a minimum punishment of four years imprisonment did not “emasculate” the principles of sentencing set forth in Doughty and that these principles continued to apply.He found the range of sentence for an offender like the respondent and for a robbery similar in circumstances to the one committed by the respondent was six years.The sentencing judge gave weight to the fact a guilty plea had been entered, and he also took into account the respondent’s expression of remorse, which he concluded was genuine.He found, however, that even with “due consideration” for the four months spent in custody prior to sentencing, the sentence to be imposed should not fall below five years.THE OFFENDER[11]The respondent is 38 years old.He has a long history of personal problems which include an addiction to drugs, attempted suicide, the inability to retain employment and a lengthy criminal record spanning a period of 20 years.His criminal record as admitted for the sentencing is as follows:JAMES PATRICK CULLENCRIMINAL RECORDSENTENCING DATEOFFENCESENTENCESeptember 1, 1979Break \u0026 Enter with intent sec.306(1)(a) C.C.$250. and Probation for 6 monthsJuly 9, 1981Common assault sec.245(1) C.C.$300.August 31, 1981Possession of a narcotic sec.3(1) N.C.A.Conditional discharge - Probation for 3 months andRestitution of $50.April 20, 1983Possession of a narcotic for the purpose of traffickingsec.4(2) N.C.A.$750. and Probation for 1 yearFebruary 17, 1986Possession of a narcotic sec.3(1) N.C.A.$250.December 4, 1987Armed robbery sec.303 C.C.30 monthsOctober 3, 1988ParoledMarch 13, 1990Threaten to use a weapon in committing assaultsec.267(1)(a) C.C.3 monthsAugust 22, 1991Obstruction of a police officer sec.129 C.C.$750.December 7, 1992Robbery sec.344 C.C.3 yearsDecember 7, 1992Use of a firearm during commission of an offencesec.85(1)(a) C.C.1 year consecutiveApril 8, 1994ParoledMay 25, 1995Assault on a peace officer sec.270 C.C.6 months consecutive with unexpired portion of sentenceJuly 2, 1995Parole violatorRecommittedJune 26, 1997Fail or refuse to provide sample sec.254(5) C.C.7 days and $700.[12]A review of this criminal record will disclose that the respondent has not only a previous conviction for armed robbery in 1987 but, as well, a conviction for robbery, a conviction for the use of a weapon in the commission of an offence and a conviction for threatening to use a weapon in the commission of an assault.Finally, it should be noted that his criminal record includes eight violence-related offences, three of which involved the use of a weapon or threatening to use a weapon.[13]At the time of this robbery, the respondent was under the influence of drugs. He committed the offence to obtain money to repay approximately $15,000 in drug debts.DISPOSITION[14]I would allow the appeal and set aside the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge. I would impose a sentence of seven and one-half years imprisonment, allowing for time spent in pre-sentence custody.I would also impose a lifetime weapons’ prohibition.ANALYSIS[15]An appellate court may interfere with the discretion exercised by a sentencing judge in two kinds of cases.The first is where the sentencing judge commits an error in principle.Such an error arises when the sentencing judge fails to take into account a relevant factor; takes into account an irrelevant factor; fails to give sufficient weight to relevant factors; overemphasizes relevant factors, and generally, when the sentencing judge commits an error of law.The second situation is where a sentencing judge may not have committed an error in principle but yet imposed a sentence which is outside an acceptable range of sentence.In such situations, the appellate court might consider whether the sentence imposed is clearly unreasonable, clearly excessive or inadequate, demonstrably unfit, or a substantial and marked departure from other sentences imposed for like offences by like offenders.See: R. v. Proulx 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII); R. v. Shropshire, 1995 CanLII 47 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227 (S.C.C.); R. v. M. (C.A.), 1996 CanLII 230 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500 (S.C.C.); R. v. McDonnell (1997), 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 436 (S.C.C.).[16]In this case the sentencing judge imposed a sentence which was outside an acceptable range of sentence having regard to: (i) the fact the Criminal Code was amended in 1996 to provide for a minimum punishment of four years in prison for the use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery; and (ii) the objectives, purposes and principles of sentencing set forth in the Criminal Code.In light of Parliament’s clear direction to the courts to mete out harsh punishment for the use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery, the sentencing judge also erred in principle when he gave too much weight to the range of sentence set forth in the decision of R. v. Doughty supra.In the circumstances of this offence and this offender, the sentencing judge imposed a sentence which was demonstrably unfit.[17]The offence of robbery always included the theft from another “ . . . while armed with an offensive weapon or imitation thereof.”See: Section 343(d) of the Code. In 1977 \u0026 1978 at the time of the decision in Doughty supra, the offence was described in s.303.The maximum punishment was always life imprisonment. There was no minimum punishment prescribed.[18]Prior to 1996 s.85 of the Criminal Code provided that it was an offence to use a firearm in the commission of an indictable offence, including robbery.There was a minimum punishment of one year prescribed for a first offence and three years for a second or subsequent offence.As counsel for the respondent points out in his factum it was, therefore, the practice in each case, prior to 1996, to charge both robbery - s.344, and using a firearm - s.85.Section 85 was proclaimed on January 1, 1978 as part of a number of amendments addressing “Firearms and Other Related Offences.”Prior to 1978 there was no specific offence for the use of a firearm in the commission of an offence.[19]It was not until 1996 that Parliament prescribed not only a separate punishment for the use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery but most significantly it prescribed a severe minimum punishment. Section 344(a) of the Criminal Code was proclaimed into force on January 1, 1996. It was one of the amendments to the Code arising from the enactment of the Firearms Act, S.C. 1995, c. 39. The relevant part of the section provides as follows:ROBBERY.344.Every person who commits robbery is guilty of an indictable offence and liable(a)where a firearm is used in the commission of the offence, to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of four years; ...[20]The legislative history of the offence of robbery and the prescribed punishment illustrates two points: (1) that Parliament has progressively recognized the seriousness of the use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery by prescribing a minimum mandatory punishment; and (2) the reasoning in Doughty supra, which may have been sound in the context of the law in relation to sentencing as it existed in 1977 and 1978, is not applicable in the context of the law today as it relates to punishment and sentencing for the use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery.[21]In passing the most recent amendments to s.344, courts may assume Parliament was directing particular effect should be given to the sentencing objectives of denunciation, deterrence (of both the offender and other members of the public), and the separation of the offender from the public. Except as to the imposition of punishment in excess of the minimum mandatory four years imprisonment, Parliament has removed from the courts any discretion it may have had in passing sentence on an offender who uses a firearm in the commission of a robbery, subject to s.719(3) of the Code (consideration of time spent in pre-sentence custody) and s.12 of the Charter (the minimum punishment, constituting in the particular circumstances, a punishment which is grossly disproportionate to the circumstances of the offence and the offender).See: R. v. Wust 2000 SCC 18 (CanLII). Parliament has sent a clear message that for the protection of the public it wants to eradicate firearms related crimes and in particular the use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery.[22]R. v. Doughty supra, should no longer serve as a guide to the imposition of a sentence where a firearm, as opposed to another offensive weapon, is used in the commission of a robbery.MacDonald J. (as he then was) wrote separate reasons in Doughty which were concurred in by the other two members of the court.He reviewed a number of sentencing decisions from courts in other provinces and concluded, that with respect to the range of sentence for robbery, seven years in prison was the high end of the range of the sentence to be imposed where the robbery took place in a private dwelling (the place of the robbery in Doughty) and a firearm was used.He also reviewed sentencing decisions in the courts of this province up to that time and concluded that where an armed robbery is committed, where there has been no violence in the sense of injury to the person and where the offender has a lengthy criminal record, the upper limit of the range of sentence would be five years.See: pp.236 \u0026 237. In my view, a range of sentence for the use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery, where there is no physical injury and where the offender has a lengthy criminal record, which has as its high end five years, is simply inadequate in the context of the overall sentencing scheme now in place under the Criminal Code and in the context of a provision in the Code which provides for handing out a minimum punishment of four years in prison to a person who may be a first offender, who inflicted no bodily injury and who had no criminal record.[23]There is always an element of violence inherent in the commission of robbery when a firearm is used, even if the firearm is never discharged and no bodily injury is inflicted.The sentencing judge put it this way and he put it correctly when he made the following comment in passing sentence on the respondent:The gist of the offence of armed robbery is taking by force and terror; not the value of the property taken.The offence is essentially one against the person, involving the victim’s life, security and liberty.[24]Regardless of whether physical injury has occurred, robbery with a firearm involving an encounter with a person is an act of violence against the person, despite the fact it is included in Part IX of the Criminal Code “Offences Against Rights of Property.”Reference to the victim impact statement of one of the clerks who witnessed the robbery by the respondent will illustrate that the act of using a loaded firearm in the commission of a robbery is an act of violence, even if the victim is so fortunate as to escape or avoid physical injury.Should the victim be so unfortunate, the fact of bodily injury becomes yet another aggravating factor in determining a fit sentence.[25]As I have concluded the sentencing judge erred in principle in imposing sentence on the respondent, or alternatively, he erred in imposing a sentence which was demonstrably unfit, it is necessary for this court to determine a sentence which is fit.The issue on this appeal is how much greater than the minimum punishment should the punishment be and what are the factors to be considered in imposing such a punishment.[26]As a basic sentencing principle s.718.1 of the Code provides that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the responsibility of the offender.Section 718.2 of the Code sets forth other sentencing principles and those in ss.718.2 (a) - a sentence should be increased or reduced having regard to any relevant aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and 718.2 (b) - a sentence should be similar to those imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances - are applicable to this case.[27]Subsection 718.3(1) of the Code provides that, subject to the provisions of an enactment, the form and the measure of the punishment in respect to an offence is in the discretion of the court that convicts the offender. Furthermore, s-s.718.3(2) provides that, subject to the limitations set forth in the enactment, the punishment to be imposed upon the offender is in the discretion of the court imposing the conviction, and that there is no minimum punishment unless the enactment specifically declares a certain punishment to be a minimum punishment.[28]In R. v. Wust supra, the Supreme Court of Canada very recently (April 13, 2000) had occasion to consider the provisions of s-s.344(a) in the context of the allowance against the minimum punishment of time served in pre-sentence custody as provided for in s-s.719(3) of the Code.While the latter provision is not directly in issue here, some of the general comments about s-s.344(a) made by Arbour J., who wrote for the Court, merit consideration in the determination of what would be a fit sentence to be imposed in this case.[29]In paras. 18 to 23 of her reasons Arbour J. points out that mandatory minimum sentences are more the exception than the rule in Canada, and they may frequently detract from the fundamental principle of sentencing set forth in 718.1 of the Code. As a result, she notes that courts have frequently struck down a mandatory minimum sentence as being in violation of s.12 of the Charter or they have, alternatively, created a constitutional exemption from the mandatory minimum sentence and in some cases where they have been upheld as constitutionally valid, courts have commented they may be demonstrably unfit or harsh.As she concludes this part of the discussion with respect to s.344(a), she states it is important to deal with legislation which provides for mandatory minimum sentences in a manner consistent with the general principles of sentencing, and it is required such provisions be understood in the full context of the sentencing scheme.[30]Parliament has clearly provided for a minimum punishment of four years in prison for a person convicted of using a weapon in the commission of a robbery. Therefore, the discretion of the convicting court generally conferred by s-ss.718.3(1) \u0026 (2) to impose the form and measure of punishment has been removed, at least to the extent of imposing the minimum punishment of four years in prison.The convicting court continues to have the discretion to impose further punishment, above the statutorily prescribed minimum punishment, if the circumstances of the offence and the offender would so warrant.Such punishment must, as Arbour J. stated, be meted out and the sentence must be imposed having regard to the purpose and principles of sentencing set forth in ss.718, 718.1 and 718.2 of the Code.[31]The quantum of the sentence should be broadly commensurate with the gravity of the offence committed and the moral blameworthiness of the offender.This is one of those offences and the court has before it one of those offenders where punishment at least twofold greater than the mandatory minimum would be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the responsibility of the offender.The integrity of the criminal justice system and the confidence of the public in that system is undermined if the punishment imposed is inadequate and likewise if it is too severe.A sentence of eight years in prison in this case strikes the proper balance and would not undermine confidence in the criminal justice system.[32]The circumstances surrounding the commission of this offence are extremely serious, and only one where shots were fired and/or individuals injured, could have been more serious. The potential for bodily injury to the staff at the Co-Op was very real in this case given the firearm the respondent was brandishing, the extra ammunition he carried on his person, his apparent desperation to acquire cash to pay his drug debts and his state of mind, which was impaired by drugs.Add to these circumstances the fact the relatively large food market, which was the subject of his robbery, was located in a shopping mall, a place where, potentially, a large number of people might possibly have congregated on an evening in August.[33]The respondent who has, as I have pointed out above, an unenviable criminal record, must assume a very high degree of moral blameworthiness for the offence. The manner in which he committed the offence indicates it was carefully and meticulously premeditated.According to Crown counsel and this was not disputed, there was evidence at the preliminary inquiry the respondent had been in the store a few days prior to the robbery.He obviously had to obtain the firearm and the additional ammunition. He planned a selective entry to the mall with his face covered, and he proceeded directly to an office he obviously knew was occupied by a person in the possession of cash at a time of day when it would be reasonable to assume much of the cash from the day’s sales would still be on hand.Following the commission of the offence, he went to a residence and involved innocent third parties, no doubt under some threat as he was still armed, to assist him in covering up the offence by disposing of his vehicle and the firearm. Without their knowledge, he used their basement to store his ammunition. Finally he involved an innocent and vulnerable cab driver, although there is no indication he commandeered the cab.[34]There are only two mitigating circumstances against the imposition of a severe punishment.They are, the respondent’s guilty plea at a relatively early stage in the proceedings, although he put the victims through a preliminary inquiry and his expression of remorse which must be taken lightly because of the respondent’s lengthy involvement in criminal behaviour.[35]The second principle of sentencing which I indicated was applicable here is that the sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences in similar circumstances.See: s-s.718.2(b) of the Criminal Code. Fortunately the incidence of the use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery is not high in this province and thus there are no reported decisions of this court since the amendment to s.344 providing for a minimum mandatory punishment.I do not consider decisions from this court prior to 1996 of much assistance as they relied upon the decision in Doughty.[36]Upon reviewing a number of decisions from other provinces, I am satisfied that a sentence of eight years in prison for this offender is within the range of sentence imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances.I will briefly review three of these decisions.[37]In R. v. Callan, [1999] O.J. No. 2850 (QL) (Ont. S.C.), the offender committed five bank robberies over a period of one year using a handgun, although no shots were fired.There was one incident of physical harm to a bank employee.The offender was 30 years of age and he had only one prior conviction of assault. Rehabilitation was found by the court to be a substantial but not a dominant consideration and there was no remorse shown as the offender continued to deny responsibility for the offences.He had served seventeen months of pre-sentence custody.The court considered that a sentence of fifteen years in prison was fit sentence; however giving credit for the pre-sentence custody this was reduced to twelve years.[38]In R. v. Ross, 1999 CanLII 4397 (MB CA), [1999] M.J. No. 238 (QL) (Man. C.A.), the offender pleaded guilty to a charge of break enter and theft and using a firearm in the commission of a robbery.The victims who were the occupants of the home were awakened and confronted by the offender who was pointing a weapon.At one time the gun was pointed at the victim’s head, the trigger was pulled but the gun did not fire.The offender was nineteen years of age with a prior youth record and he showed no remorse.There was an indication that rehabilitation was unlikely.He was sentenced to serve eight years in prison.[39]In R. v. Klopcic, [1997] B.C.J. No. 2795 (QL) (B.C.S.C.), the offender was charged with robbery and assault with a weapon.He had robbed an elderly lady at an automated banking machine and assaulted her when she tried to escape.The offender had a significant criminal record over a long period of time including several convictions for robbery.He had spent fourteen months in pre-sentence custody and taking this into account he was sentenced to serve ten years in prison.[40]Sentencing is a very individualized process having regard to the offender and the circumstances of the crime; however, the above sentences indicate that a sentence of eight years in prison for the respondent and for the commission of this offence is within an acceptable range of sentence.The protection of the safety of the residents of this province, by deterring this offender and others from committing these kinds of offences, must be the paramount consideration in the imposition of the sentence.[41]The sentencing objective of rehabilitation cannot be entirely ruled out when imposing a sentence on the respondent, as it would be inconsistent with the existing sentencing scheme to conclude the respondent can never be rehabilitated.However, in light of his criminal record, which includes other violence related offences over a prolonged period of time, and the need to separate him from society, rehabilitation will have to take place when the respondent is incarcerated and separated from the public.Through a gradual release program available through the corrections system, officials will be in a position to monitor the rehabilitation of the respondent and to know when it will be safe to return him to society.Hopefully, when he does return to society he will be of a mind to complete this rehabilitation and take up a life as a law abiding citizen.[42]In the context of the entire sentencing scheme as now provided for in the Criminal Code, having regard to the applicable objectives of sentencing, applying the principles of sentencing, considering the relevant aggravating and mitigating factors, as well as the sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances, the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge should be set aside.A fit punishment, having regard to the foregoing, would be to serve a sentence of eight years imprisonment. The respondent spent four months in custody after the commission of the offence and before he was sentenced.Having regard to s.719(3) of the Code, which provides that in determining a sentence the court may take into account any time spent in custody prior to sentence and as the result of the commission of the offence, I would reduce the sentence by six months. The respondent will, therefore, be sentenced to serve seven and one-half years in a Federal institution.[43]Finally, it is necessary to address the firearms prohibition of 10 years imposed by the sentencing judge.This was also in error as the respondent had previous convictions for offences referred to in s-s.109(1)(d) of the Code.[44]In conclusion, the appeal is allowed, the sentence and the firearms’ prohibition imposed by the sentencing judge are both set aside. The respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for a term of seven and one-half years.In accordance with s-s.109(3) of the Criminal Code, he is prohibited from owning or possessing firearms, or any item listed in s.109(1) of the Code, for the remainder of his life._____________________________________The Honorable Mr. JusticeJ.A.

(for the Court):1The appellant is a young man whose behaviour in the six months prior to his sentencing on November 8, 1999, demonstrated that he required structure in his life.2A review of his criminal behaviour follows.3On June 10, 1999, he was arrested and charged with three counts of possession of stolen property.He was released on an undertaking requiring him to abide by a 9:00 p.m. curfew.4On June 14, 1999, he was arrested for failure to comply with his undertaking and detained in custody.5On June 30, 1999, he pled guilty to the possession charges, as well as the charge for failure to comply, and was released on his own recognizance.He was ordered to have no contact with Raymond Best and to follow the curfew that had been imposed upon him.6On July 12, 1999, he was arrested and charged with break, enter and theft and failure to comply with the conditions of his release.He was detained in custody.7On August 5, 1999, he was charged with robbery and with failure to comply with his recognizance.8In November 1999, he pled guilty to both of these latter charges.He was sentenced to one-year secure custody on the robbery charge and concurrently to two months’ secure custody on the failure to comply charge.The sentencing judge also imposed a two-year supervised probation order.He appeals from his sentence.9The sentencing judge referred to the aggravating factors in this case.She noted that the appellant was already on probation at the time of the robbery, that he breached the terms of his release, and that his criminal behaviour had escalated.She determined that he required a term of secure custody.10In the course of giving her reasons, the trial judge noted she did not have the benefit of a current pre-disposition report.The report that she did have, dated July 28, 1999, was prepared in anticipation of the appellant’s disposition on the pending three counts of possession of stolen property and breach of recognizance.However, she did have a glowing report from June Murray, a school social worker from the Portage la Prairie School Division, indicating that, in her opinion, by the fall of 1999, the appellant had accepted responsibility for his actions and was expressing an intention and willingness to turn his life around.He showed signs of genuine remorse to Ms Murray.11The record indicates that the sentencing judge made only passing reference to Ms Murray’s report.Additionally, Crown counsel acknowledged that there is no indication in the transcript that the sentencing judge was aware that Raymond Best, the appellant’s co-accused on the robbery charge, was an adult.Crown counsel conceded that the sentencing judge may have misapprehended a significant piece of the evidence.12The appellant was only 14 years old at the time of his criminal involvement.That being said, his behaviour was very serious and required the imposition of controls.In my view, a one-year sentence of custody was appropriate.However, given the appellant’s youthfulness and the sentencing judge’s apparent oversight that the appellant was under the influence of an adult, who utilized the weapon (a knife) during the robbery, secure custody for this young man was unfit.A more appropriate disposition was one of open custody.13Ms Murray’s report indicates the appellant is a suitable candidate for rehabilitation.While a sentence which addresses denunciation and deterrence is fit, one which appears to ignore the appellant’s readiness to begin rehabilitation is not.The sentencing judge’s failure to distinguish between the moral culpability of this appellant and his adult co-accused on the robbery charge and her failure to place any weight whatever on Ms Murray’s report lead me to conclude that the sentence was unfit.14I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the one-year term of secure custody, and in its place impose a term of one-year open custody.In all other respects, the sentence is confirmed._______________________________ J.A.______________________________ J.A.______________________________ J.A."}

No. 1757Between:Her Majesty The Queen (Appellant)andGeorge Glynn (Respondent)Lang, J.Counsel:Anne Fagan, for the appellant;Robert Buckingham, for the respondent.[1]Lang, J.: This appeal was heard on February 10, 19 and 26, 1997.[2]The respondent pleaded guilty in Provincial Court at St. John's, Newfoundland, on March 25, 1992, to two breaches of the Fisheries Act of Canada, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-14, (the Act).[3]The appellant is appealing the sentences handed down on April 24, 1992, in this matter on two counts:Count 1 - Fine of $1,500 in default 15 daysCount 2 - Fine of $ 500 in default 5 daysSix months to pay fines[4]The grounds of appeal as stated by the appellant are as follows: :\"1. Imposing sentences on the Respondent that were unjust and unequitable, in comparison with fines imposed by other Courts, for similar offences to those with which the respondent was charged;\"2. That having regard to the nature of the offences and all the surrounding circumstances, the sentences were inordinately low;\"3. Misapplying the principles of sentencing;\"4. Misinterpreting the obligations on the respondent to report as stipulated by Sections 61 and 63 of the Fisheries Act as amended, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-14.\"[5]The following information is contained in the appeal brief of the appellant.\"1. Vessel's offloading monitored on 8 March 1991. Captain and Ship's owner underreported the catch to officers of the appellant (DFO). The respondent was hired by the owner of the ship to monitor offloading in Newfoundland and was an agent for five years.\"2. The Captain and owner of the ship were required to report regularly to DFO under s. 61 of the Act. The purchaser was also required to report to DFO and this helped to set quotas from information reported.\"3. There was a system of cross-checking in place and if inconsistent figures arose, then an investigation would take place.\"4. The respondent was questioned by DFO on 13 and 17 March 1991 and his reply to DFO was false.\"5. The respondent in reply to a question from DFO, as to whether he had a record of the fish offloaded, produced a ledger for DFO which had false entries.\"6. The catch figures from the owner and the Captain's log underreported the catch.\"[6]The appellant in paragraph 24 of her appeal brief filed herein, states that the respondent was asked under 63(1) of Fisheries Act for information on an ad hoc basis. I think this should be s. 61(a)(d) of the Act.[7]The respondent was not required to report to DFO on a regular basis like the owner, the Captain and purchaser, and this distinction, the respondent's counsel submits, is one of his grounds for no increase in the fines imposed by the trial judge.[8]The respondent pleaded guilty to two counts of breaching the Act, namely:1giving a ledger which contains false information re catch figures to DFO2giving false information to DFO respecting catch figures[9]One should not receive a higher sentence because of proceeding to trial. A guilty plea saves time and expense and in some cases avoids the ordeal of victims having to testify. Generally some reduction in the sentence is given where a person pleads guilty.[10]The fact of no record is a mitigating factor. The transcript shows the respondent has no record.[11]A first time offender generally should not be treated the same as one with a record and in particular a record for similar offence(s). Here the respondent was a first time offender.[12]The issue on this appeal is, was the sentence of the trial judge within the range of sentences for the offences of which he pleaded guilty and is the sentence a fit and proper sentence considering all relevant factors?[13]A range of sentence is established by practice and is not the maximum and/or minimum contained in the Criminal Code or in another Act. The maximum sentence is for the worst scenario of an offence. For example, sexual assault cases may involve touching or rape and the sentence varies from case to case.[14]No range has been established for the within offence and therefore it is impossible to state whether the sentence of the trial judge is or is not in the range of sentence for this offence.[15]According to the appeal brief of the appellant, the owner in this matter was fined $25,000. I believe the owner's case involved a guilty plea in Nova Scotia.[16]Also according to the appeal brief of the appellant, the Captain of the ship pleaded guilty to:2charges exceeding quota4charges of unreporting7charges of providing false returnsand received a total fine of $40,000 imposed by a Provincial Court judge in St. John's, Newfoundland.[17]In R. v. Grandy and Bell (1992), 113 N.S.R.(2d) 85; 309 A.P.R. 85 (Co. Ct.), Palmeter, J., stated the following at page 88:\"... in the context of regulatory offences in general and particularly relating to offences under the Fisheries Act and Regulations, and other Acts dealing with the fishing industry, general deterrence is the paramount and overriding principle to be considered in imposing sentence. This is certainly applied in sentences imposed by our Courts in Canada under the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act. Although this is different legislation our Courts have recognized that deterrence both general and specific, is the most important factor to be considered for the purpose of protecting our fishery resource.\"[18]See also decision of Newfoundland Court of Appeal in R. v. Vila and Otero (1986), 1986 CanLII 2438 (NL CA), 60 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 67; 181 A.P.R. 67 (Nfld. C.A.), at page 69.[19]In 1991, Parliament saw the need for increased deterrence in fines under the Act and increased the maximum fine from $5,000 to $100,000.[20]I agree with the appellant's conclusion in paragraph 52 of her appeal brief that the learned trial judge gave detailed reasons for imposing sentence on the respondent and correctly recognized that deterrence was the primary consideration in sentencing under the Act.[21]The Newfoundland Court of Appeal in R. v. Carl Coveyduck, 1993 No. 238, Nfld. C.A. (unreported decision) stated the following at page 5:\"A court of appeal should only interfere with a trial judge's discretionary powers as to sentencing if it is apparent that the judge has misapplied one or other of the accepted principles of sentencing in all the circumstances of the case, with the result that the sentence imposed is outside the range of sentencing for the type of offence.\"[22]As stated previously no range has been established for the within offences. I agree with counsel in this regard, because there appears to be no case similar to the within matter.[23]In this case, the owner, captain and purchaser were required to report to DFO on a regular basis, on the quantity of fish caught pursuant to s. 61(1) of the Act.[24]The respondent was asked to provide information under s. 61(1)(d) of the Act, not on an ongoing regular basis, but on an ad hoc basis and he supplied false information and a ledger containing false information to DFO.[25]I have reviewed the appellant's appeal brief and I have considered the submissions of both counsel and I have reviewed the transcript of the sentence hearing before the trial judge and his written decision which is on file.[26]The learned trial judge reserved his decision after hearing counsel on sentence and wrote a detailed and well reasoned decision. Counsel for the appellant presented a summary of the facts to the learned trial judge and counsel for the respondent also commented on same to the learned trial judge. A copy of the transcript before the learned trial judge is on file.[27]Counsel for the appellant on February 26, 1997, stated for the Court of Appeal, the agreed facts in this matter, and counsel for the respondent took no exception to same. These agreed facts are as follows:1. The respondent admitted to being an agent of the owner of the ship.2. The respondent provided information on the catch weight for four trips.3. Agreement on the name of the owner of the ship.4. The respondent had false figures.5. The respondent's figures were the same as those of the Captain.6. Note from respondent respecting 10,000 lbs. of fish.[28]The trial judge states in his decision, that the respondent was under no duty to report anything to anybody (Lines 12 and 13 at Page 48 of the transcript). This is not correct, because the respondent was asked by DFO to supply information pursuant to s. 61(1)(d) of the Fisheries Act and once asked he had a duty to supply same. This finding of mixed fact and law does not appear from the transcript to have been agreed to by counsel for the respondent nor was there any evidence at the sentence hearing to support such a finding. This finding of the trial judge was appealed as part of the appellant's grounds of appeal on sentence. (See also lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 19, 21, 22 and 23 at page 33 of the transcript of the sentence hearing filed herein.)[29]Counsel for the respondent at the hearing of the within appeal, submitted that the trial judge was really saying that the respondent was not required to report to DFO on a regular or ongoing basis.[30]At page 49 of the transcript of the sentence hearing before the trial judge, the trial judge stated the following:\"... and any person who wilfully involves himself in a cover-up scheme relating to resources management for his own benefit must be treated severely.\"[31]At page 25 of the transcript the following is stated \"I'll accept the guilty pleas\".[32]The respondent pleaded guilty to supplying false information to DFO and breaching ss. 63(3) and 63(1) of the Act.[33]According to the transcript of the sentence hearing filed herein, the respondent was asked for the information under s. 61(1)(d) of the Act. Once asked he had a duty to supply true information to DFO.[34]It would appear that ability to pay when imposing fines is an area that has to be canvassed as per R. v. Willaert (1953), 1953 CanLII 107 (ON CA), 105 C.C.C. 172 Ontario Court of Appeal and the Newfoundland Court of Appeal in R. v. Sullivan (1978), 15 Nfld. \u0026 P.E.I.R. 271; 38 A.P.R. 271 (Nfld. C.A.). This procedure is in place, so as those requiring time to pay a fine, will receive such time.[35]If there is no agreement on facts at a sentence hearing, then such facts have to be proved by the Crown by calling evidence. There was clearly no agreement between counsel at the sentence hearing before the trial judge, that the respondent had a duty to report to DFO when requested to do so. There was also no agreement between counsel at the sentence hearing before the trial judge, that the respondent had no duty to report to DFO when requested to do so. There was also no evidence called at the sentence hearing. Therefore the learned trial judge made an important finding on the matter of reporting, without evidence and without an agreement between the parties on same. There was also no trial because the respondent pleaded guilty.[36]The learned trial judge's statement at lines 12 and 13 on page 48 of his decision that Mr. Glynn was under no duty to report anything to anybody is not solely a question of law. It is a decision either of fact based on relevant law or a finding of mixed law and fact.[37]The respondent was charged with a breach of s. 63(3) of the Act in Count 1 and with a breach of s. 63(1) of the Act in Count 2. The respondent was not charged with a breach of s. 61 of the Act namely failing to provide information or to keep records, books of account or other documents.[38]Section 63 of the Act applies, whether a person is or is not required to provide information or to keep records, etc., under s. 61 of the Act.[39]In the within matter, the respondent was asked to supply information under s. 61 and was correctly charged under s. 63 of the Act.[40]The respondent was charged with breaching s. 63 of the Act. The respondent pleaded guilty to breaching s. 63 of the Act and not s. 61 of the Act.[41]Therefore the statement of the learned trial judge at lines 12 and 13 of page 48 of his decision namely \"Mr. Glynn was under no duty to report anything to anyone\" at page 48 of the transcript is not only in error but since there was no evidence or agreement on the point and no charge under s. 61 of the Act, it was not a fact for consideration at the sentence hearing by the trial judge.[42]The following was stated by counsel for the respondent at trial and appears at lines 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 at page 7 of the transcript of the sentence hearing:\"MR. MCDONALD: We should also agree perhaps beforehand that this is not an agreed statement of facts. There is no real agreement between the Crown and the defence in relation to any of all this, your Honour.\" Emphasis added.[43]A court of appeal can only interfere with the sentence of a trial judge where the trial judge has misapplied an accepted principle of sentencing, resulting in the sentence being outside the range of sentencing for that offence.[44]We also cannot say the sentence is outside the range, because no range has been established for the within offence.[45]Although the learned trial judge in the within matter has not misapplied the accepted principles of sentencing, the trial judge has in part based his decision on sentence in this matter, on a finding of mixed fact and law without an agreement of counsel on such fact and without hearing evidence respecting same. This finding is an important finding namely that \"Mr. Glynn did not have to report anything to anybody\" (Page 48 of the transcript). It is my opinion that such a finding is not only erroneous but was irrelevant to the within matter for reasons hereinbefore referred to.[46]Therefore the matter is remitted back to the Provincial Court of St. John's for a rehearing on sentence.

Ferguson, Esq. for the RespondentBY THE COURTLeave to appeal sentence is granted. The appeal is allowed. The terms of payment for restitution are varied.BY THE COURTOn August 11, 1995, following pleas of guilty, the appellant Paul Allan Hachey was sentenced by Strange, C.J.P.C. to a total of 20 months imprisonment for five offences that occurred on June 3, 1995. The five charges were:1.Wilful damage to property of McFadzen Holdings Ltd., contrary to s. 430(4)(b) of the Criminal Code of Canada;2.Assault upon Clarence VanMarrum, contrary to s. 266(a) of the Criminal Code;3.Wilful damage to property of Bonnie Perley, contrary to s. 430(4)(a) of the Criminal Code;4.Wilful damage to property of Kathy Connors, contrary to s. 430(3)(a) of the Criminal Code; and5.Break, enter and assault contrary to s. 348(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.For the first offence, Mr. Hachey was sentenced to imprisonment for one month. For the second offence, Mr. Hachey was sentenced to three months imprisonment to be served consecutively and placed on probation for two years following his release from jail. For the third offence, he was sentenced to two months imprisonment to be served consecutively and placed on probation for two years following his release from jail. Among the terms of the probation order was one for restitution of $2,000.00 to Bonnie Perley within 12 months of his release from jail. For the fourth offence, he was sentenced to two months imprisonment consecutive together with probation for three years following[Page 2]his release from jail. Among the terms of the probation order was one for restitution of $4,000.00 to Kathy Connors within 18 months of release from jail. For the fifth offence, he was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment consecutive and placed on probation for three years following his release from jail.Mr. Hachey seeks leave to appeal the five sentences. He submits that they are too long in total and that the sentences should not have been made consecutive. He also submits that because he was detained for more than 24 hours after his arrest before being taken before a Provincial Court Judge, he was unlawfully detained and, for that reason, his sentence should be reduced to time served. In addition, he submits that the two orders for restitution should be extended to the end of his probation. We grant leave to appeal.The five incidents all resulted from a rampage that Mr. Hachey, who was then 28 years old, went on during the afternoon of June 3, 1995. He became agitated following a period of drinking at a Fredericton bar. When another patron, Clarence VanMarrum, attempted to calm Mr. Hachey, he pushed Mr. VanMarrum down and kicked him three times, in his jaw, ribs and left thigh, causing injury to Mr. VanMarrum. He then damaged property at the bar before leaving to attempt to find his former girlfriend, Kathy Connors, who was then living with a friend, Bonnie Perley. He first went to Ms. Connors' apartment, where he damaged or destroyed a television, a personal computer, a VCR and other household items. The damaged or destroyed property had an approximate replacement value of $6,000.00. He then went to Ms. Perley's nearby apartment, where, with a hammer, he damaged the body and broke four windows of her car, a 1980 BMW sedan. He then forced his way into Ms. Perley's locked apartment, where he, again with the aid of a hammer, destroyed the telephone and a television set and damaged furniture,[Page 3]bedding and clothing. After verbally abusing Ms. Perley and still holding the hammer, Mr. Hachey threw her to the floor and held her down, picked her up, threw her on a bed and smashed her head into the wall while continuing to verbally abuse her. Ms. Perley managed to escape from Mr. Hachey and fled into the street where she stopped a passing motorist.Mr. Hachey submits that the total sentence of 20 months was too long and the sentences should have been made concurrent rather than consecutive. The five incidents were all part of one spree in that they happened within a relatively short period of time. They did, however, occur in three separate locations, the bar, Ms. Connors' apartment and Ms. Perley's apartment. For that reason, the sentences for the two offences that took place at the bar and Ms. Perley's apartment, respectively, might have been made concurrent thereby reducing the total sentence by three months. We are not, however, persuaded that even in that event that the sentence is too long.The Judge took into account that Mr. Hachey had spent 67 days in custody awaiting his sentence and that he pleaded guilty. Mr. Hachey has a previous criminal record which dates back to 1980. There is, however, a gap in that record between 1990 and 1994, when he received a 30 day sentence for break, entry and theft. His Pre-Sentence Report was not unfavourable and leads to the conclusion that Mr. Hachey will likely rehabilitate himself. These mitigating factors, however, having regard to the viciousness displayed in assaulting Ms. Perley after breaking into her locked apartment and the wanton destruction of Ms. Connors' and Ms. Perley's property, are not sufficient to persuade us that the sentence is inordinately high.[Page 4]Mr. Hachey also submits that, contrary to s. 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, he was illegally detained as he was not brought before a Provincial Court Judge until June 5 following his arrest on June 3. Citing the authority of R. v. MacPherson (N.H.) (1995), N.B.R. (2d) Advance Sheets, No. 65, September 20, 1995, page 69, Mr. Hachey requests that his sentence be reduced to time served. As this issue was not raised at the sentencing hearing, where Mr. Hachey was represented by counsel, the Crown had no opportunity to call evidence to explain why Mr. Hachey was not brought before a Provincial Court Judge earlier. In MacPherson, the Charter breach was raised at the sentencing hearing, thus giving the Crown an opportunity to explain why he was not brought before a judge sooner. In our view, such an objection must be raised in a timely manner.In addition, Mr. Hachey submits that the orders for restitution are overly onerous in that they oblige him to make restitution too soon after he will be released from jail, thus making it likely he will be in breach of his probation. As noted, he was ordered to pay $2,000.00 to Bonnie Perley within 12 months of his release from jail and $4,000.00 to Kathy Connors within 18 months of his release from jail. In the first instance, his probation was for two years and in the second instance, three years. We would allow the appeal with respect to the orders for restitution, but only to the extent of enlarging the times for payment. With respect to the s. 430(4)(a) offence involving Bonnie Perley, restitution shall be made within two years of Mr. Hachey's release from jail and with respect to the 430(3)(a) offence involving Kathy Connors, restitution shall be made within three years of Mr. Hachey's release from jail.[Page 5]For the above reasons, we allow the appeal to the extent that the restitution provision in the probation orders relating to the s. 430(4)(a) and s. 430(3)(a) offences are modified as above.THE COURT OF APPEAL OF NEW BRUNSWICKLA COUR D'APPELDU NOUVEAU-BRUNSWICKRegistrar's OfficeBureau du RegistraireRoom 201- Justice BuildingPièce201 - Palais de JusticeFredericton, N.B.

Clements Co. Ct. J. allowed an appeal in three of these cases and remitted the matter back to the provincial judge for sentence after receiving the Crown's evidence.The fourth case was not appealed.In the three cases remitted, the provincial judge declined to reconsider the matter stating that there was no jurisdiction in the County Court judge to remit the matter to him for sentencing.The Crown appealed for mandamus to order the provincial judge to reopen these matters and determine the sentences based upon the Crown's further evidence.Held:an order of mandamus should issue.The provincial judge totally misconceived his role and duty. It was not for him to do anything but obey the instructions of the County Court judge sitting in appeal from his judgment.He had no right to question the jurisdiction of a superior court and if the County Court judge acted without jurisdiction, the proper remedy was by appeal to the Court of Appeal.As regards the accused R., no appeal was taken to the County Court and while mandamus is not generally granted when an alternative remedy is available, here an appeal would not be convenient or satisfactory and would be a futile and unnecessary step as the result would be a foregone conclusion.APPLICATION by the Crown for mandamus directed to a provincial judge to exercise jurisdiction and determine the sentences of four separate accused based upon further evidence.

McCombs, for accused.GRANGE J.:-- Our Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34,provides under ss. 234 and 236 [am. 1974-75-76, c. 93, ss. 14,17] that an impaired driver or a driver with an excessiveamount of alcohol in his blood is liable for a first offence toa fine or imprisonment and for a second or subsequent offenceto a minimum term of imprisonment.Section 740(1) of the Codeprovides as follows:740(1) Where a defendant is convicted of an offence forwhich a greater punishment may be imposed by reason ofprevious convictions, no greater punishment shall be imposedupon him by reason thereof unless the prosecutor satisfiesthe summary conviction court that the defendant, beforemaking his plea, was notified that a greater punishment wouldbe sought by reason thereof.These are applications for mandamus relating to the trial inProvincial Court of four separate accused men all charged withimpaired driving or driving with an excessive amount of alcoholin their blood.In each case the Crown, after a plea ofguilty, sought an adjournment to prove service of notice uponthe accused of an intention to ask for an increased penalty byreason of a prior conviction, and to prove the priorconviction.In each case the adjournment was refused and theaccused sentenced as though it were his first offence.Inthree of the cases an appeal was taken to County Court JudgeClements who allowed the appeal and remitted the matter back tothe provincial judge to receive the Crown's evidence andsentence accordingly.In those three cases the provincialjudge declined to reconsider the matter.In the fourth case(Rybansky) no appeal has been taken.These four cases are not the first where the difficulty hasarisen.On October 5, 1978, Judge Clements gave judgment in R.v. Giesbrecht (1978), 44 C.C.C. (2d) 185.Upon facts similarto those concerning the accused here, he found that theprovincial judge had wrongly established a policy of noadjournment.He then considered whether he should grant atrial de novo to hear the evidence relevant to sentencing,decided against it and referred the matter back to theProvincial Court.Again in R. v. Stallaert (1979), 2 M.V.R.64, a case upon similar facts decided on February 12, 1979,Judge Clements noted that it was the custom in the County ofKent in the first instance to have on Tuesdays only firstappearances and remands before the court with no witnessesavailable.The accused had on his first appearance pleadedguilty and the Crown had sought and been refused an adjournmentto prove the notice and previous conviction.Judge Clementsfound that the refusal of an adjournment had resulted in amiscarriage of justice, set the sentence (a fine) aside andreferred the matter back to the provincial judge forsentencing.Again he was asked to hear evidence relative tosentencing and impose sentence himself but declined relyingupon Giesbrecht.The accused Jones and Veldhuis came on for trial on November18, 1980, and the accused Neto on December 9, 1980, all chargedwith alcohol driving offences all in similar circumstances andall with similar results.Again the sentences (fines) wereappealed to Judge Clements who in June and July of 1981, setaside the fines and referred the matters back to the provincialjudge to hear the evidence and impose sentence.On July 15,1981, the provincial judge refused to deal with the furthersentencing of Jones and Veldhuis and on July 29, 1981, likewiserefused to reopen the sentencing of Neto.To understand his reasoning, it is necessary to consider thedevelopments in two other cases that came before the provincialjudge.One Kerulcin in the same position came before him onthe same date, November 18, 1980.There the provincial judgehad refused a two-day adjournment requested by the Crown andJudge Clements had dismissed the appeal upon the ground thatthe provincial judge had applied his mind to the question andexercised his discretion rather than adopting a fixed policy.From that decision the Crown appealed to the Court of Appealand that court allowed the appeal without reasons and remittedthe sentencing \"to the Provincial Court Judge ... so that heshall hear evidence as to service of notice and criminal recordand then sentence (the accused) accordingly\".Apparently the provincial judge obeyed the order of the Courtof Appeal on November 9, 1981, but the very next day in a caseinvolving one Michael Gene Babb, the provincial judge declinedto obey the order of Judge Clements allowing an appeal insimilar circumstances, accepting the argument that the CountyCourt judge had no jurisdiction to remit the matter forsentencing.The argument was based on s. 755(6) [rep. \u0026 sub. 1974-75-76,c. 93, s. 94] which is:755(6) Where an appeal is taken under subsection (4)against sentence, the appeal court shall, unless the sentenceis one fixed by law, consider the fitness of the sentenceappealed against and may, upon such evidence, if any, as itthinks fit to require or receive, by order,(a) dismiss the appeal, or(b) vary the sentence within the limits prescribed by lawfor the offence of which the defendant was convicted;and in making any order under paragraph (b) the appeal courtmay take into account any time spent in custody by thedefendant as a result of the offence.The provincial judge stated that the County Court judge hadonly two alternatives:either dismiss the appeal or vary thesentence; there was no jurisdiction to remit the matter forsentencing.This in effect was the same reason he had alreadyused to refuse the resentencing of Jones, Veldhuis and Neto.The case of Rybansky stands on a slightly different footing.There the accused also charged with a liquor and drivingoffence appeared before the same provincial judge on January12, 1982, after the matter had been adjourned to that date \"tobe spoken to\".Again the accused pleaded guilty and the Crownasked for an adjournment to prove the prerequisites to anincreased penalty.The provincial judge was prepared to putthe matter down until the afternoon, but the Crown found thatthe police officer was not available and sought an adjournmentfor one week.The provincial judge denied that request andfined the accused.No appeal has been taken.There was much argument before me as to the powers of theCounty Court judge to remit the matter for sentencing andwhether the provincial judge was right or wrong in saying theCounty Court judge had no jurisdiction.The sections of theCriminal Code relating to appeals in summary convictions aswell as indictable offences were thoroughly canvassed.Indeed,the Crown alternatively asked for mandamus directed to JudgeClements requiring him to reopen the appeal in Jones, Veldhuisand Neto to hear the evidence and impose sentence.However, Iam not concerned with anything done by Judge Clements orwhether he was right or wrong in remitting the matter.Isuspect he was right but that is of no moment.In my view the provincial judge totally misconceived his roleand his duty.It was not for him to do anything but obey theinstructions of the County Court judge sitting in appeal fromhis judgment.He had no right to question the jurisdiction ofa superior court.If that court were considered to have actedwithout jurisdiction the remedy was an appeal to the Court ofAppeal.The rule of law is not only for citizens; it is forjudges as well.It is our obligation to obey the law, not tofoment judicial anarchy.The principles of stare decisisrequire us to follow the judgment of superior courts.Theremay be room for distinction, for discretion, for manoeuvre ifyou will, when considering precedents established by superiorcourts in other cases.There is none whatever when a judgereceives a direct order in the case at bar.I am somewhat concerned with the Rybansky application.Thereno appeal has been taken and generally speaking mandamus is notgranted when an alternative remedy is available by way ofappeal.As was stated by Spence J. in Cheyenne Realty Ltd. v.Thompson et al. (1974), 1974 CanLII 4 (SCC), 42 D.L.R. (3d) 733, 1 N.R. 273, 15C.C.C. (2d) 49 at 51:It is, of course, that mandamus does lie to require aninferior Court to accept its jurisdiction and discharge suchduty.The writ of mandamus is, however, an extraordinaryremedy available for that purpose:R. v. Leong Ba Chai (1953), 1953 CanLII 41 (SCC), 107 C.C.C. 337, [1954] 1 D.L.R. 401, [1954] S.C.R.10; 11 Hals., 3rd ed., pp. 84-5.The writ being anextraordinary remedy will not ordinarily issue when there isanother remedy available:R. v. Com'rs of Inland Revenue (1884), 12 Q.B.D. 461.I emphasize, however, the word \"ordinarily\".I think the truetest is found in Re The Queen and Smith (1973), 16 C.C.C. (2d)11, New Brunswick Appeal Division, where Hughes C.J.N.B. statedat pp. 14-15:Another principle applicable to manadamus is that it willnot issue where there is available another specific remedywhich is equally convenient and satisfactory:R. v. Com'rsof Inland Revenue (1884), 12 Q.B.D. 461; Kipp v. A.-G. Ont.,1964 CanLII 20 (SCC), [1965] 2 C.C.C. 133 at pp. 140-1, [1965] S.C.R. 57, 45C.R. 1.Here, in my view, an appeal is not equally convenient andsatisfactory.The result of the appeal as well as theprovincial judge's reaction to that result are both foregoneconclusions.I think it futile, unnecessary and undesirablefor that step to be taken.Orders of mandamus will therefore go requiring the provincialjudge to reopen, hear and determine the sentences of Jones,Veldhuis and Neto in accordance with the orders of JudgeClements and to reopen the sentence of Rybansky, allowing theCrown a reasonable opportunity to bring evidence of notice andprior offences, and to sentence accordingly.Order accordingly."}

(orally)[1]Following his pleas of guilty to charges under s. 173(2) and s. 733.1(1) of the Criminal Code, the applicant (appellant) was convicted and sentenced to 6 months imprisonment on Count 1 and 18 months imprisonment on Count 2 with the sentences to run concurrently.With that he brought an appeal.[2]He was denied legal representation for his appeal by the Saskatchewan Legal Aid Commission on the ground that his appeal lacked sufficient merit to authorize funded counsel.Accordingly he now applies for the appointment of counsel under s. 684(1) of the Criminal Code.[3]The appellant is not unfamiliar with Court proceedings.This sentence appeal does not involve complex issues.Bearing in mind the questions that will face the Court on such an appeal, I am not persuaded that the appointment of funded counsel is required.[4]It is not unusual for appellants to appear and argue their own sentence appeals before this Court.In each and every case the Court carefully considers the merits of the appeal.This includes careful pre-hearing reading of the record and all relevant sentencing materials.[5]Since the appellant is capable of representing himself on this appeal, there is no basis for assigning counsel to act on his behalf and to provide the kind of assistance he is seeking.In the circumstances it has not been demonstrated that lack of funded counsel will impair the appellant’s ability to have his sentence appeal carefully considered by the Court.[6]In his notice of appeal the appellant indicates that he wishes to present his appeal in writing and does not desire to be present in person at the hearing.If he is still of that view he can outline his position and make submissions in writing with the same to be filed with the Registrar.[7]Since the transcript of proceedings in Provincial Court has been filed, the Registrar may proceed to set this appeal for hearing."}

The touching occurred over her clothing.Finally, after about 12 years, a great-niece, [M.W.], was sexually assaulted 10 to 20 times between January 1, 1985 and December 31, 1988 when she was between 9 and 12 years of age.The accused touched her breasts on these occasions. The submissions before me do not refer to any contact with any of the girls beyond touching.[4]The accused joked with the girls about sexual contact and he claimed that he felt a sense of entitlement to touch them.He admits that he manipulated and groomed the victims although he claims that the victims were troubled individuals who were accepting of the contact.[5]The victim’s mother did not believe them when they complained about the accused’s conduct.In fact, some victims were told by their mother that their bad attitude contributed to the problem.There is no indication that she took any steps to speak to her brother about the complaints.There is some indication that she is not prepared to accept the accused’s guilt.Of all of the victims, Ms. [E.S.], who experienced the longest period of indecent contact, still appears to be under the greatest degree of stress.She has suppressed the experiences and she would prefer to do so even as she encourages the other victims to seek counselling.Mr. [P.D.]’sadvances caused Ms. [D.W.] at 17, Ms. [A.B.] at 15 and Ms. [L.H.] to leave the farm at a young age.The family has and continues to be split with some members angry at the victims because the accused is now facing the consequences of his conduct.This split in the family is most unfortunate because the healing process will become even more difficult because the victims may feel a sense of guilt that they brought this matter to the attention of the authorities.I am satisfied that all of the victims have been traumatized by these incidents and fortunately, all but Ms. [E.S.] are in counselling and appear to be slowly coming to terms with their bad experiences. One victim is struggling with the concept of forgiveness and they all have, for the most part, learnt to cope and continue with their lives.Understandably, the victim impact statements disclose considerable bitterness directed to the accused.[6]Mr. [P.D.] has admitted to his conduct but he has denied his involvement to both his wife and his pastor.He has little empathy for his victims.[7]The accused has been a hardworking and successful farmer and he continues to farm.He is a respected member of his community.He was a municipal counsellor at a local rural municipality for 3 terms until he resigned after these charges came to light.He is a regular church goer and is further involved in the church.He has served as a member of the board of directors at the local Credit Union.Friends and neighbours have described him as a “gentle man” and a honest and respectable man who expresses pride in his nieces and nephews.In fact, he has provided financial assistance to Ms. [E.S.] to enable her to pursue her training as a nurse and he helped Ms. [D.W.]’s father on the farm.His wife stands by him and supports him and her children are aware of the charges that he faces.Mr. [P.D.] does not have a substance abuse or an anger management problem in his personal history.He does not have a criminal record.Recently, he underwent surgery to one of his eyes and more surgery may be necessary.[8]A Primary Risk Assessment was conducted in an effort to determine recidivism in general and he is described as a low risk to re-offend despite his denials to his wife and pastor.Furthermore, even with the indifference that he has shown to the plight of his victims, he has scored a “0\" on the Static 99 test - a test designed to predict sexual and violent recidivism.The literature states that such a score would indicate that, on average, a person would sexually re-offend at a 5% chance over 5 years and a 11% chance over 10 years.Accordingly, the probation officer concluded that the accused was in the “Low Risk” category.The Crown views these results with some skepticism arguing that his lack of empathy, his feeling of entitlement and the abuse of his position of trust militate against such a conclusion and that there would be a greater chance of the accused repeating a sexual/violent offence.[9]The Crown submits that the accused ought to be sentenced to a period of 9 months in a custodial facility followed by a probation order for a period of 2 years so as to provide the accused’s with counselling and treatment.It is argued that a conditional sentence would not be appropriate because such an order would not address the need to protect the community.The assault on the grandniece indicates an attack on the next generation of victims.The defence asserts that a conditional sentence of 18 months with 6 to 9 months on the electronic monitor and significant community service hours should be imposed.The accused is elderly and he is not a well man and so it is not likely that he will re-offend.A conditional sentence would adequately denounce his conduct.[10]In imposing a sentence, I am bound to consider the purpose and principles of sentencing set out in the Criminal Code.The Criminal Code Provisions[11]In section 718, the Code sets out the basic purpose of sentencing as follows:The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives:(a) to denounce unlawful conduct;(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences;(c) to separate offenders from society, where necessary(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders;(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community;and(f) to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and acknowledgment of the harm done to victims and to community.In order to achieve the purpose of sentencing, certain principles must be followed and these principles are set out as follows:s.718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.s.718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles:(a) a sentence should be increased or reduced to account for any relevantaggravating or mitigating circumstances relating to the offence or the offender and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,(i) evidence that the offence was motivated by bias, prejudice orhate based on race national or ethnic origin, language, colour, religion, sex, age, mental or physical disability, sexual orientation or any other similar factor,(ii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused the offender’s spouse or common-law partner or child,(iii) evidence that the offender, in committing the offence, abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim,(iv) evidence that the offence was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with a criminal organization, or(v) evidence that he offence was a terrorism offence.shall be deemed to be aggravating circumstances;(b)a sentence should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for similar offences committed in similar circumstances;(c)where consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should not be unduly long or harsh;(d)an offender should not be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions my be appropriate in the circumstances; and(e)all available sanctions other than imprisonment that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.[12]A conditional sentence is available in certain circumstances and section 742.1 describes those circumstances as follows:Where a person is convicted of an offence, except an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment, and the court(a) imposes a sentence of imprisonment of less than two year, and(b) is satisfied that serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community and would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles of sentencing set out in sections 718 to 718.2, the court may, for the purpose of supervising the offender’s behaviour in the community, order that the offender serve the sentence in the community, subject to the offender’s complying with the conditions of a conditional sentence order made under section 742.3Judicial Interpretation[13]The Supreme Court of Canada has examined section 742.1 in the case of R. v. Proulx 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61 and the court reached certain conclusions at paragraph 127.The following are the particularly pertinent points that the court made that are relevant to this case:3.No offences are excluded from the conditional sentencing regime except those with a minimum term of imprisonment, nor should there be presumptions in favour of or against a conditional sentence for specific offences.8.A conditional sentence can provide significant denunciation and deterrence.As a general matter, the more serious the offence, the longer and more onerous the conditional sentence should be.There may be some circumstances, however, where the need for denunciation or deterrence is so pressing that incarceration will be the only suitable way in which to express society’s condemnation of the offender’s conduct or the deter similar conduct in the future.9.Generally, a conditional sentence will be better than incarceration at achieving the restorative objectives of rehabilitation, reparations to the victim and the community, and promotion of a sense of responsibility in the offender and acknowledgment of the harm done to the victim and the community.10.Where a combination of both punitive and restorative objectives may beachieved, a conditional sentence will likely be more appropriate than incarceration.Where objectives such as denunciation and deterrence are particularly pressing, incarceration will generally be the preferable sanction.This may be so notwithstanding the fact that restorative goals might be achieved.However, a conditional sentence may provide sufficient denunciation and deterrence, even in cases in which restorative objectives are of lesser importance, depending on the nature of he conditions imposed, the duration of the sentence, and the circumstances of both the offender and the community in which the conditional sentence is to be served.11.A conditional sentence may be imposed even where there are aggravating circumstances, although the need for denunciation and deterrence will increase in these circumstances.[14]Madame Justice Jackson of our Court of Appeal in R v. Banda 2000 SKCA 92 (CanLII), [2000] S.J. 451 at para. 11 concisely sets out the thought process that a trial judge must follow to determine if a conditional sentence can be imposed.She said this,The thinking process is this:1.Are measures other than incarceration appropriate, e.g., fines or probation?2.If such measures are not appropriate, then is penitentiary appropriate?If penitentiary is not appropriate, the sentencing judge is in the realm of imposing a sentence of two years less a day which satisfies the requirement of s. 742.1 (a) and the possibility of a conditional sentence arises.The questions thenbecome:3.Is a conditional sentence appropriate?4. If a conditional sentence is not appropriate, what should the length of the custodial sentence be?If a conditional sentence is not appropriate, the judge, having eliminated penitentiary or probation, will fix a custodial sentence of less than two years.The Availability of a Conditional Sentence[15]I must first decide if a sentencing option other than incarceration is available in the circumstances of this case.Due consideration must be given to the rulings of our Court of Appeal and the Court of Queen’s bench.A review of the authorities indicates that a period of incarceration is, more often than not, the appropriate sentence in this type of case. In R. v. D.J.J. (1998) 1998 CanLII 12411 (SK CA), 172 Sask. R. 182, the Court of Appeal considered an appeal as to a sentence that had been imposed by the trial judge after a conviction for sexual touching (s. 151) and for sexual assault (s. 271) involving victims that were 3 and 4 years of age.The accused was mentally challenged.Madame Jackson, at para. 24, concluded that the bottom of the range for the offences before the court in which an accused does not have a relevant record was from about 9 months [R. v. Clauson (1990), 1990 CanLII 7775 (SK CA), 84 Sask. R. 237- a case in which a 72 year old male assaulted a neighbour’s child by touching her breasts and genital area from the time that the child was 7 until she turned 15 and the experiences resulted in significant trauma to the child], to 15 months at the mid point [R. v. A.S.U. (1990), 1990 CanLII 7667 (SK CA), 86 Sask. R. 191- in which a 53 year old man inappropriately touched and fondled his step daughter over a 2 year period and then initiated one incident of sexual intercourse],to 4 years at the top of the range (R. v. Racette, August 12, 1992, C.A. No. 5951- a case in which a 51 year old had sexual intercourse with an 11 year old girl who was a friend of his daughter).[16]There are, of course, many factors that impact upon the determination of the applicable range in cases commonly referred to as “historical” indecent or sexual assaults.Mr. Justice Gerein (now Chief Justice of the Court of Queen’s Bench) in R. v C. H. C. (1997), 1997 CanLII 11287 (SK QB), 154 Sask. R. 10 was the trial judge in a case in which a 46 year old male who, between the time that he was 16 years of age to the time that he was 29 years of age, committed a number of indecent assaults between 1968 and 1980 to 4 different complainants who were between the ages of 8 and 20 years of age.The offences consisted of fondling, masturbation, simulated intercourse and, in relation to one victim, attempted penetration.The court referred favourably to the comments of Kerans J. in R v. Sanderock (1984), 1985 ABCA 218 (CanLII), 48 C.R. (3rd) 154 (Alta.C.A.) who, at 159, described a “major sexual assault” as follows:One archetypical case of sexual assault is where a person, by violence or threat of violence, forces an adult victim to submit to sexual activity of a sort or intensitysuch that a reasonable person would know beforehand that the victim likely wouldsuffer lasting emotional or psychological injury, whether or not physical injuryoccurs.The injury might come from the sexual aspect of the situation or from the violence used or from any combination of the two.This category, which we would describe as major sexual assault, includes not only what we suspect will continue to be called rape, but obviously also many cases of attempted rape, fellatio, cunnilingus, and buggery, where the foreseeable major harm which welater describe more fully is present.and at 160 he went on to say,The key, then, to a major sexual assault is the evident blameworthiness of the offender, which was described by Laycraft J. A. (as he then was) in F. v R.(1982), 1982 ABCA 148 (CanLII), 20 Alta. L.R. (2d) 90 (C.A.), as “contemptuous disregard for the feelings and personal integrity of the victim”.It is sometimes said that we live in a sexually permissive era, the age of the liberated libido.Many believe that gratification of sexual desire by almost any means is not only normal but “healthy”.This attitude, unsurprisingly, has led to some confusion, and the belief by some that society also permits the use of others as objects for sexual gratification.It does not, and denunciatory sentences are needed to reinforce the point.The other aspect which creates a major sexual assault is the effect on the victim. Notwithstanding statements in some authorities to the contrary, the tradition is to assume, in thecase of a rape, for example, that the victim has suffered notable psychological or emotional harm aside entirely from any physical injury.Of course, once this assumption is brought into question, the Crown must prove it.Nevertheless, harm generally is inferred from the very nature of the assault.This harm includes not just the haunting fear of another attack, the painful struggle with a feeling that somehow the victim is to blame, and the sense of violation or outrage, but also a lingering sense of powerlessness. What me mean by this last is that, while we are all aware in an intellectual way about the fragility of normal existence, to experience a sudden and real threat to one’s well-being, a threat so intense that one must beg to be spared, tends to destroy that sense of personal security which modern society strives to offer and humanity so obviously wants.It matters little in this respect whether that threat comes from a robber, a rapist or any swaggering bully.[17]Justice Gerein considered two counts in which fondling had taken place over a significant period of time and that extended to simulated intercourse with significant trauma to the victims, as major sexual assaults.In that case, those offences attracted sentences of two years less a day and terms of imprisonment of 6 to 9 months were imposed for the other offences that were not considered to be major in nature.[18]The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal has repeatedly held that major sexual assaults should result in a sentence of 3 years assuming a mature accused with previous good character and no criminal record [R. v Cappo (1993), 116 Sask. R. 15 at para. 10].Such a sentence would apply in cases involving forced sexual intercourse (Cappo at para. 9) furthermore, Jackson, J. A. in Cappo at para. 15 said,As indicated above in Sandercock, the three year threshold assumes a mature individual of good character with no record.It does not say there must be a “trust” relationship between the complainant and the accused.Thus, some of the factors which were found by the trial judge in this case to be mitigation are not to be so classified.In fact, the presence of a trust relationship may very well be aggravation; its absence not mitigating.The cumulative effect of youth, good character, family support and productive member of society may warrant a reduced sentence, but not in this case.[19]The offences in this case took place some time ago.The first four offences that are first in time commenced place 46 years ago and the last incident commenced 16 years ago when the accused was 51 years of age.Noble J. in R. v Ramsey (2000) 2000 SKQB 198 (CanLII), 193 Sask. R. 68 at para. 44 considered the matter of age in sentencing after the accused had been convicted for rape.The complainant was 14 years of age.The court said,I am also if the view that the 30 year lapse of time between the offence and the imposition of a sentence is a mitigating factor at this point in time so far as the determination of what the length of the sentence should be.Clearly it does not mitigate the seriousness of the offence or his moral blameworthiness at the time he committed it.However, in my opinion, his exemplary and useful life since then goes to mitigate the length of any sentence so many years later.The Supreme Court has repeatedly said that sentencing is an individual matter and for that reason I believe the Court must take into account both the good and the bad aspects of a person’s life in deciding what sentence is a fit one in all of the circumstances before it.The comments are helpful even though the Court of Appeal in that case ordered a new trial on a charge of attempted rape [see (2001), 2001 SKCA 8 (CanLII), 152 C.C.C. (3rd) 84].The trial judge imposed a sentence of 9 months in custody.[20]In considering whether the offences before the court can be classified as a major sexual assault I must take into account the following:a.the assault commenced and ended many years ago and extended over a significant period of time and involved 5 different victims,b.the accused was in a position of trust in relation to the victims even though hewas not in a familial relationship with them,c.contact with the victim involved touching over and under clothing and did not involve penial or digital penetration or any element of violence,d.all five victims were traumatized by the assaults and the experience have impacted on their relationships with others such that counselling has been undertaken by most of them, ande.their step-mother’s failure to provide support when they needed it most has deeply affected them.[21]There are few reported sentencing cases decided by the Court of Appeal that are similar to the case before me.On September 11, 1997, in the case of R. v C. (J.H.) (1997), 158 Sask. R. 264, a 72 year old male, who was active in his church and in his community (he was mayor from 1991 to 1994), pled guilty to offences committed between 1980 and 1985 when he was 55 to 60 years of age and the male victim was between 8 and 12 years of age.During the time that the child was under his care, the accused committed 12 acts of anal intercourse upon the victim.Both parties continue to be friends.An eighteen month conditional sentence was imposed by the trial judge followed by a one year probation order.The court was split with the majority of the judges holding the view that the trial judge failed to consider the seriousness of the offences especially when the accused is in a position of trust in relation to the victim.The minority were of the view that the trial judge’s sentence ought not to be interfered with.A period of 1 year incarceration was substituted.[22]After considering the facts (and in particular the factors listed above) and after reviewing the authorities and after applying the purposes and principles of sentencing, I am of the view that while the offences are indeed serious they are not major sexual assaults.Furthermore, I am led to conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, an accused without a criminal record would likely be incarcerated for a term of between 9 months to 1 year.None of the charges mandate a minimum period of imprisonment upon conviction and so, since any sentence of imprisonment would be less than two years, I must now determine if a conditional sentence would satisfy the requirements of section 742.1(b).The section requires the consideration of two matters namely:a.whether serving the sentence in the community would not endanger the safety of the community andb.whether such a sentence would be consistent with the fundamental purpose and principles set out in 718 to 718.2.a.Danger to the Community[23]The court in Proulx was of the view that to determine whether the accused posed a danger to the community, the court should consider two factors that is:a.the risk of the offender re-offending andb.the gravity of the damage that could ensue in the event of re-offencei.Risk of Re-offence[24]Lamer C.J.C. proposed a list of factors for a court to consider at this point in the assessment (see para. 70). The list is not all inclusive.In this case, the accused is described as a low risk to re-offend in the pre-sentence report and even though I am inclined to have sympathy for the Crown’s concerns, given the strength of the relationship with his wife and the lack of any criminal record and of any improper conduct since 1988 and in light of his reputation in the community and the fact that his immediate family is aware of these proceedings, I think that the risk of the accused re-offending is unlikely and, even if there was a risk, the minimal risk could be managed by conditions in a order.In so concluding, I have not ignored the fact that a period of 12 years had elapsed before the accused commenced his assaults on the grandniece.ii.Gravity of Damage in the Event of Re-offence[25]Of course if the accused is to commit any further offences similar in nature to the offences presently before the court, the damage to the victim would be significant but, having concluded that the chance of him re-offending is very unlikely or can be adequately dealt with by conditions, I must conclude that this factor would not pre-empt a conditional sentence.[26]Even if a conditional sentence would otherwise be appropriate, such a sentence must be consistent with the purposes and principles of sentencing.b.The Purpose and Principles of Sentencing[27]A sentence crafted by this court must, in part, contribute to the respect that the public has in the law and to the safety of the community.i.Denunciation and General Deterrence[28]As Proulx points out incarceration is likely to achieve a greater level of denunciation than a conditional sentence but the latter has a significant denunciatory effect (para. 102).The same point was made by Jackson J.A. in D.J.J., in which she referred favourably to the comments of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in R. v. Wismayer (1997), 1997 CanLII 3294 (ON CA), 5 C.R. (5th) 248 - a case in which a 20 to 21 year old accused touched a child under the age of 14 between 1988 and 1990.The contact resulted in a charge of sexual touching.The Ontario Court of Appeal was of the view that general deterrence should be an objective in cases in which a sentence would likely have such an effect.Furthermore, jail is not the only way to express society’s denunciation.I am aware that the court in D.J.J. was considering the sentencing of an accused with diminished capacity and in Wismayer the court had sentenced an accused with psychological problems but, I believe, the points made remain pertinent.In Certain cases, deterrence or denunciation must be particularly emphasized and so incarceration becomes the way in which society expresses its abhorrence for certain conduct.The principles have been particularly important in cases in which a major sexual assault had taken place upon a family member and in which the contact was especially invasive in that penetration had occurred and in which violence may have been a factor.These circumstances existed, in whole or in part, in cases involving contact with,a.daughter,R. v. D.G.H.(1990), 1990 CanLII 7744 (SK CA), 88 Sask. R. 115R. v. N.(G.J.)(1997), 1997 CanLII 9706 (SK CA), 152 Sask. R. 158b.granddaughterR. v. S.(H.W.)September 2, 1992, file # 5632R. v. P.C.[2004] S.J. No. 237c.stepdaughterR. v. R. (W.R.)(1990), 1990 CanLII 7772 (SK CA), 84 Sask. R. 73[29]In this case, the accused felt that he was entitled to fondle the victims and his pursuit of the victims did not end in 1973 because he pursued yet another generation of victim in 1985. He continues to deny, at least to some extent, his involvement even now.These facts are indeed compelling and attribute a greater degree of gravity to the offences than would otherwise have been the case. The denials have been difficult for the victims to understand and I suspect that the denials have added to the trauma that they feel.I am of the view that there is a pressing need to denounce this type of conduct in the circumstances.With respect to general and specific deterrence, one would be hard- pressed to suggest that since the offence occurred many years ago, the sentence proposed today would have any significant general deterrent effect, however the public should be aware that this type of conduct can and will likely result in a period of incarceration. I do not believe that incarceration is necessary to address the matter of specific deterrence.ii.Separation[30]Given my comments above, it would be necessary to separate the accused from society.iii.Rehabilitation[31]The charges for which Mr. [P.D.] has accepted responsibility are serious and indicate a high degree of selfishness on his part He sought to gratify himself at the expense of children.It must be remembered that even though the period over which the assaults took place is significant, the assaults did not take place with alarming frequency (as in R. v. P. C.) despite his having the apparent opportunity to do so. The last offence took place many years ago and since then he has contributed positively to his community and he has even provided assistance to some of his victims.Rehabilitation is likely and so it should be taken into account and can be considered in a probation order so as to take effect on the expiration of any prison term.iv.Reparations to the Victim[32]Nothing short of a heartfelt expression of regret and remorse from the accused for the ordeal that he put them through and for the impact that his conduct has had on them would come close to repair any of the harm done to the victims.It seems that the accused has not yet come to terms with his involvement nor does he appreciate what their lives have been like since these incidents have occurred.Having said that, it seems to me that they have also been victimized by their step-mother who refused to pay heed to their cries for help.v.Responsibility of the Offender and Acknowledgment to the Victims[33]As I have noted earlier in this decision, even though the accused pled guilty and he has spared the victims the need to testify, he must fully accept responsibility and his failure to do so must be reflected in the sentence that I impose.[34]As to the principle set out 718.2, I have already referred to some of the aggravating andmitigating circumstances in this case.The most significant aggravating factor is the position of trust that he held with respect to the young girls.This fact must also be considered when imposing any sentence.[35]It is a principle of sentencing that the court must impose the least restrictive sentence possible in the circumstances and all possible sentencing options ought to be considered short of imprisonment.I have concluded that Mr. [P.D.] could serve a sentence of imprisonment in the community without endangering the community but, I have also concluded, that a conditional sentence would not be consistent with the fundamental purposes and principles of sentencing, in particular the need to denounce his conduct, to promote a sense of responsibility in the offender and to give effect to his abuse of the position of trust that he held relative to the victims.Accordingly, he shall be sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 9 months on count 1 and a similar period, concurrent, for each of the remaining 4 counts.Thereafter, he shall be placed on probation for a period of 18 months.I will hear counsel on the matter of the terms of the probation order.[36]The Crown proceeded by way of indictment in this matter and so, pursuant to section 737(1)(b)(ii) a victim surcharge in the amount of $100.00 for each of the 5 counts shall be imposed.[37]Pursuant to the forensic DNA analysis section in part XV of the Criminal Code the offence set out in count 4 (section 271) is a “primary designated offence”.The offences set out in the remaining counts are not included in the provisions.Accordingly, I must make the following order in form 5.03an order authorizing the taking from the accused for the purpose of forensic DNA analysis, any number of samples of his blood that is reasonably required for that purpose by means of a sterile lancet by a person qualified for that purpose.[38 ]The Crown does not seek a discretionary prohibition order pursuant to section 110 of the Code and, in exercising my discretion I decline to make an order prohibiting the accused from the possession of any firearms or related material____________________________L.A.

(Oral):The accused, Percy Roy Risby, is charged with sexual assault, alleged to have been committed against S.J., a 17-year-old girl, here in Ross River last August.Ms. J. testified that she had retired to her bed, in her own bedroom, in her own house, and had gone to sleep.Some time later, she awoke to find the accused, Mr. Risby, who had been a guest in the house, sitting on her bed and running his hand along her back and coming closer to her privates.He did not, in fact, touch her in her private parts.She awoke in alarm, moved to the end of the bed, told Mr. Risby to get out, and he did so, saying, as he did, that he was sorry.[2]The law is quite clear with respect to a sexual assault, that there does not, in fact, have to be a touching of the private parts or other what would be considered overtly sexual areas of the body.What is required is that it is proved that there has been an assault in circumstances such that the sexual integrity of the complainant was violated.[3]The circumstances here, where the accused comes into the girl’s room, at 3:30 in the morning, when she is sleeping in her own bed, gets into her bed, at least to the extent of sitting it, and begins moving his hands over her back, are circumstances which are quite capable of satisfying the objective test and in satisfying me that these were circumstances such that the sexual integrity of the complainant was violated.[4]The only real question in the case is whether the explanation advanced by the accused provides an alternate or benign explanation for the events which would indicate that although objectively it was a sexual assault, it was not in fact a sexual assault.The explanation of the accused is that at 3:30 in the morning, after everyone else in the house had gone to bed, he decided that he needed somebody to talk to.Of the persons who were in the house, so far as he was aware, he decided that Ms. J. was the most likely conversationalist and for that reason went to her room to wake her up.[5]I reject that explanation as being utterly incapable of belief.[6]That being the case, I am satisfied, to the requisite standard, that this was an assault which occurred in sexually charged circumstances and I find the accused guilty.(Submissions on sentencing)[7]The accused stands convicted of a charge of sexual assault.The incident was fortunately quite brief and non-violent, and the accused desisted upon discovery and left when asked to do so.However, the incident is aggravated, in my mind, by the fact that this was a young complainant who was in her own room, in her bed, in her own home, and found her sexual integrity violated in circumstances where she might most reasonably expect to be safe and free from such assaults.[8]It is suggested, on behalf of Mr. Risby, that the matter be dealt with by way of a suspended sentence.However, in my view, having regard to the need to denounce and deter such egregious conduct, a custodial sentence is warranted.[9]With respect to Mr. Risby’s prior criminal record, it is unrelated.It is quite dated.In my view, essentially, it is irrelevant in fixing the quantum of sentence in this particular case.There may be some benefit in adding a probation order.Obviously, alcohol overconsumption was a large factor in the commission of this offence and a probation order will have the additional virtue of allowing a no contact order to be put in place for a period of time.Also, in fixing the quantum of sentence, I must have regard to the fact that the Crown proceeded by summary conviction.[10]Having regard to all the circumstances, Mr. Risby, you are sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four months.Following your release from imprisonment, you will be subject to a probation order for a period of one year.The terms of the order will be as follows.1.You will keep the peace and be of good behaviour.2.You will report to the court as and when required.3.You will report forthwith to an adult probation officer upon your release from imprisonment, thereafter as directed.4.You will advise the probation officer forthwith of any change of name or address and promptly notify her of any change of occupation or employment.5.You will have no contact directly or indirectly with S.J.6.You will take such alcohol assessment, treatment or counselling as your probation officer directs, including, if she directs, attendance for residential treatment.[11]The surcharge in this case is $50.[12]MR. CAMPBELL:Payable forthwith.[13]THE COURT:Payable forthwith.________________________________FAULKNER T.C.J."}

See the Youth Criminal Justice Act, s. 110(1).REASONS FOR JUDGMENTA)INTRODUCTION[1]D.P. was sentenced in the Youth Justice Court on October 29, 2007 on a charge of driving while the concentration of alcohol in his blood exceeded the legal limit.The sentence he received was a fine of $500.00, a surcharge of $75.00, and a driving prohibition for a period of 12 months.He appeals this sentence on a number of grounds.[2]D.P. alleges some errors of law on the part of the presiding Judge, but his primary complaint is that he did not get a fair sentencing hearing.In his Factum, he alleges that certain things that happened during the proceedings show that the presiding Judge was biased against him, or at the very least, raise a reasonable apprehension of bias.He also alleges that the presiding Judge’s conduct prevented his counsel from making full and effective submissions on his behalf.[3]While the Crowndoesnot agree entirely with D.P.’s characterization of the presiding Judge’s conduct, it does concede that what transpired prevented D.P.’s counsel from presenting complete submissions, and that this opens the door to appellate intervention.Still, the Crown’s position is that the sentence imposed should not be disturbed because it was an appropriate sentence under the circumstances.B)THE SENTENCING HEARING[4]The sentencing hearing began, in the usual course, with the Crown reading the allegations in support of the charge.Those allegations were that in the early morning hours of August 11, 2007, R.C.M.P. officers who were on patrol stopped a vehicle that had made a turn without signalling.The officers also observed that the licence plate on the vehicle was expired.The officers spoke to D.P., the driver of the vehicle.They made observations that led them to place D.P. under arrest and demand that he submit to a breathalyser test.D.P. was cooperative throughout.The breathalyser tests were conducted, and resulted in readings of 120 and 110 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.[5]The Crown’s allegations were not disputed by D.P.D.P.’s counsel told the Court about some additional facts, which were not disputed by the Crown.Those facts were that on the night of this incident, D.P. had been at a party where he had consumed four to five beer.While he was walking home, he was stopped by a person who was highly intoxicated and appeared to be in some distress.That person asked D.P. to drive his vehicle to a nearby parking lot.D.P. had stopped drinking some time earlier and was no longer feeling the effects of alcohol.He agreed to drive the vehicle for the purposes of parking it.[6]Crown counselrequested a fine in the range of $400.00 to $500.00 and a driving prohibition in the range of 12 to 15 months.The presiding Judge asked whether a mandatory minimum driving prohibition applied when dealing with a young person.(By operation of section 259 of the Criminal Code, an adult convicted for the first time of this type of offence is subject to a driving prohibition of a minimum of 1 year).Crown counsel answered that he was not sure if the minimum driving prohibition applied, but maintained that irrespective of that, there should be a driving prohibition of 12 to 15 months.[7]D.P.’s counsel began her submissions by seeking an adjournment to another date to research the question of whether the minimum driving prohibition applied.The presiding Judge said he would not adjourn to another date.Counsel sought an adjournment to the afternoon.The presiding Judge said he would not adjourn to the afternoon but was prepared to stand down until later in the morning.Counsel replied that she was not available later in the morning.The proceedings continued.[8]Counsel made submissions about D.P,’s personal circumstances.The presiding Judge interrupted her a few times during her submissions.By that point considerable tension had built between the presiding Judge and counsel.Eventually counsel renewed her request for an adjournment to consider the question of the applicability of the mandatory minimum driving prohibition, reiterating that she was available at 1:30 but not later that morning.The presiding Judge maintained his decision not to adjourn to 1:30.He adjourned proceedings to 11:15.[9]When proceedings resumed, counsel advised that they had determined that under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, S.C. 2002, c.1, no minimum driving prohibition applied.The presiding Judge then proceeded to deliver his Reasons for Sentence.C)MOOTNESS[10]Although the Notice of Appeal was filed in November 2007, the appealwas not heard until February 16, 2009.By then, the fine and surcharge had long been paid, and the driving prohibition had finished running its course.This raises the question of whether the appeal is moot.[11]D.P. argues that the appeal is not moot, even though the sentence has been completed, because under the Act, the periods of time when records of proceedings can be accessed vary depending on the type of sentence imposed.In other words, if this Court were to set aside the sentence imposed and replace it with another type of disposition, such as an absolute or conditional discharge, it could impact on the extent to which persons and agencies listed at s. 119 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act could access the records.D.P. also argues that in any event, this case raises important issues and that this Court should entertain it on its merits even if it is moot.[12]The issues raised in this appeal are serious because they call into question the integrity of the administration of justice.Although not in agreement with everything that D.P. asserts within this appeal, the Crown concedes that the fairness of the hearing was compromised by what transpired.That concession is a significant factor in deciding whether to consider the matter on its merits. Under the circumstances, I conclude that it is appropriate for this Court to address the issues raised on this appeal irrespective of whether the matter is moot.D)ANALYSIS OF GROUNDS OF APPEAL[13]D.P. argues that the fairness of his sentencing hearing was compromised as a result of the animosity that developed between his counsel and the presiding Judge.He argues that the presiding Judge became so annoyed with his counsel that he lost his ability to impose a fair sentence.In the alternative, D.P. argues that the presiding Judge’s conduct raises a reasonable apprehension of bias.In addition, D.P.’s counsel, who was his counsel at the sentencing, argues that what happened between her and the presiding Judge rendered her ineffective in the representation of D.P.She argues that this too compromised the fairness of the hearing, quite apart from the issue of bias.[14]Given the nature of D.P.’s complaints, it is necessary to examine in some detail some of theexchanges that took place between his counsel and the presiding Judge before addressing the specific procedural fairness issues that are raised.1.The exchanges between counsel and the presiding Judge[15]As already mentioned, the presiding Judge refused counsel’s request to adjourn the continuation of the hearing to another date, or to the afternoon.He became annoyed when, in response to his suggestion to adjourn the matter to later in the morning, counsel advised that she was not available then:THE COURT:Then we’ll continue with the matter right now.MS. PAYNE:That’s fine, sir.Your Honour- - I’m sorry. We’re not able to continue, sir.There’s a question - -THE COURT:No, we will continue. You should have been prepared for this question.MS. PAYNE:Well, sir - -THE COURT:I am not going to put this matter over for your convenience. If you’re otherwise engaged this morning, that’s too bad. We’ll deal with this matter right now.[16]Counsel then began making her sentencing submissions.She made submissions about the mitigating effect of D.P.’s guilty plea, the circumstances under which he got behind the wheel of the vehicle, the support from his family, and information about his employment. She also advised the Court about D.P.’s involvement with sports and other extra-curricular activities, including his interest in music.The presiding Judge interrupted counsel and questioned the relevance of aspects of these submissions:MS. PAYNE:(...) In his spare time, he advises that he also plays guitar.He advises that he is left handed, but he has taught himself to play left-handed and has re-strung his guitar to assist him in that regard.He also writes music.THE COURT:Do you honestly think that that’s relevant to sentence, the fact that he has re-strung his guitar so he can play left-handed?MS. PAYNE:I think, sir, that Mr. P.’s efforts - -THE COURT:You adjust your tone right now.Right now. Go on.MS. PAYNE:I’m suggesting, sir, that this is indeed relevant for your consideration of Mr. P.’s circumstances. He is an industrious young man.THE COURT:Oh, I know he’s industrious, and I’ve certainly concluded that he’s industrious based on what you’ve told me.How some of these submissions can be expected to many any difference on sentence is beyond me.Re-strung a guitar so he can play left-handed.Anyway, go on.Go on, Ms. Payne.[17]Counsel then made submissions about the breathalyser readings.She argued they were in the minimal range.The Judge interjected that he did not consider them to be in the minimal range, that they were in the middle range.[18]Counsel reiterated that D.P. had entered a very early guilty plea, and that he had been cooperative with the police throughout.She then alluded directly to the presiding Judge’s annoyance with her:MS. PAYNE:(...) Whereas you may be annoyed with me, sir, --THE COURT:Oh, I’m quite annoyed with you at this particular point - -MS. PAYNE:Clearly.THE COURT:- - but I’m not going to take it out on your client.[19]Counsel then referred again to the mitigating features of the case and submitted that under the circumstances, the minimum sentence would be appropriate.The presiding Judge questioned her on that submission:THE COURT:What would the minimum sentence be, Ms. Payne?MS. PAYNE:Well, sir, there’s no minimum sentence with regard to a fine.So I submit a low fine - -THE COURT:Well, a minimum sentence would be a reprimand, Ms. Payne.MS. PAYNE:Well, sir - -THE COURT:This is Youth Justice Court.MS. PAYNE:That’s correct.THE COURT:You’re honestly suggesting that that’s appropriate?MS. PAYNE:Well, sir, I would like to investigate the fact that if indeed the Court - - this Youth Court is not bound by the minimum driving prohibition, it may be appropriate in this particular case.THE COURT:Ms. Payne, I’m prepared to give you a reasonable adjournment under the circumstances, but I am not prepared to stand matters down to suit your schedule.MS. PAYNE:I didn’t request this court to do so.[20]The presiding Judge again alluded to the possibility of standing the matter down to later in the morning.The exchange that follows shows the continuing deterioration in the communication between counsel and the presiding Judge:THE COURT:All right.If I were to give you 15 minutes, would that be enough time?MS. PAYNE:No sir. I will be available at 1:30.THE COURT:I’m not going to give it to you.I already said I’m not going to set it over till 1:30.MS. PAYNE:That’s fine.THE COURT:I already said I’m not going to set it over until November 19th.Are you kidding me?I’ve already made that ruling.MS. PAYNE:That’s fine, sir.THE COURT:Fifteen minutes.Not good enough for you?MS. PAYNE:No, sir.THE COURT:All right.Well, what I am going to do is I am going to stand down the imposition of my sentence until quarter after eleven.MS. PAYNE:Sir, I will not be available at a quarter after eleven.THE COURT:That’s too bad.You’ve got a matter set for Youth Court.We’ll proceed in your absence if that’s the case.You are counsel of record.MS. PAYNE:Sir, this is un - -THE COURT:You should schedule - - you should schedule - -MS. PAYNE:- - reasonable.THE COURT:Ms. Payne.You should schedule your appearances.MS. PAYNE:I did schedule - -THE COURT:This can be dealt with - -MS. PAYNE:- - my appearance this morning, sir.THE COURT:- - later on a new day.This is a sentencing.The docket could have been - -MS. PAYNE:Something went awry.The Crown was not prepared as well.THE COURT:Interrupt me one more time, Ms. Payne, while I am speaking and we will finish this later.MS. PAYNE:Outside?THE COURT:Ms. Payne.We’ll finish later.Do the math.Figure it out.Quarter after eleven.[21]When Courtresumed, the presiding Judge asked counsel if they had been able to determine whether the mandatory driving prohibitions applied.Counsel advised that under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, no mandatory minimum applied.[22]The presiding Judge did not ask if D.P.’s counsel had any further submissions, or if Crown counsel had any reply submissions.He did not ask D.P. if there was anything he wished to say.He did not inquire if D.P.’s parents, who were present in the courtroom, had any representations that they wished to make.He simply proceeded to deliver his Reasons for Sentence.2.Reasonable apprehension of bias[23]The Ontario Court of Appeal had occasion to summarize the legal principles that apply in cases where a claim if judicial bias is made.I agree with that summary, and find it provides a useful framework for the analysis that must be undertaken in this case:(...) we will briefly review the principles that apply to a claim of judicial bias.These principles, now well established, have recently been summarized by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. S. (R.D.), 1997 CanLII 324 (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484, 118 CCC (3d) 353.They are as follows:1.All adjudicative tribunals owe a duty of fairness to the parties who appear before them.The scope of the duty and the rigour with which the duty is applied vary with the nature of the tribunal.Courts, however, should be held to the highest standards of impartiality.2.Impartiality reflects a state of mind in which the judge is disinterested in the outcome and is open to persuasion by the evidence and the submissions.In contrast, bias reflects a state of mind that is closed or predisposed to a particular result on material issues.3.Fairness and impartiality must be both subjectively present and objectively demonstrated to the informed and reasonable observer.If the words or actions of the presiding judge give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias to the informed and reasonable observer, this will rendered the trial unfair.4.The test for bias contains a twofold objective standard: the person considering the alleged bias must be reasonable and informed; and the apprehension of bias must itself be reasonable.In the words of de Granpré J. In Committee for Justice and Liberty v. Canada (National Energy Board) 1976 CanLII 2 (SCC), [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369, at p.394, approved of by the Supreme Court of Canada in S. R.(D.), supra:“[T]he apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right-minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information ... [The] test is “what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - and having thought the matter through- would conclude ...”5.The party alleging the bias has the onus of proving it on the balance of probabilities.6.Prejudgment of the merits, prejudgment of credibility, excessive and one-sided interventions with counsel or in the examination of witnesses and the reasons themselves may show bias.The court must decide whether the relevant considerations taken together give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.7.The threshold for finding actual or apprehended bias is high.Courts presume that judges will carry out their oath of office.Thus, to make out an allegation of judicial bias requires cogent evidence.Suspicion is not enough.The threshold is high because a finding of bias calls into question not just the personal integrity of the judge but the integrity of the entire administration of justice.8.Nonetheless, if the judge’s words or conduct give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias, it colours the entire trial and cannot be cured by the correctness of the subsequent decision.Therefore, on appeal, a finding of actual or apprehended bias will ordinarily result in a new trial.Marchand v. Public General Hospital Society of Chatham (2000), 2000 CanLII 16946 (ON CA), 51 O.R. (3d) 97 (Ont.C.A.), at para. 131.[24]I would add to this that when it is alleged that a decision-maker has not acted in an impartial manner, actual bias need not be established.The issue is whether the particular conduct gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.R. v. S. (R.D.), 1997 CanLII 324 (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484, at para.109.[25]The allegation of bias in this case does not stem from any interaction between the presiding Judge and D.P. himself.This is different from cases where judges have engaged in active cross-examination of the accused,made negative comments about the accused’s credibility in the midst of the trial, or made sarcastic remarks to the accused, such as was found to have happened in cases likeBrouillard Also Known As Chatel v. R., 1985 CanLII 56 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R. 39 and R. v. Wells [2003] O.J. No.2025 (Q.L.)[26]Nevertheless, excessive or one-sided interventions with counsel can form the basis of a claim of bias, and that is the foundation of D.P.’s claim in this case.As the party raising the issue, D.P. bears the onus of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that what transpired raises a reasonable apprehension of bias.The threshold for establishing this is high; cogent evidence is required to make out an allegation of bias.[27]All that this Court has to assess D.P.’s claim is the transcript of the proceedings.It goes without saying that transcripts are an essential tool for any reviewing court.However, even the most accurate of transcripts never tells the full story, in particular where the subject-matter of the inquiry is the interaction between individuals.Transcripts do not show the many nuances that may come from voice inflexions or non-verbal cues such as body language.[28]There is a good example of this in this case.In the exchange quoted at Paragraph 16, supra,the presiding Judge tells counsel to “adjust her tone”.The appropriatenessof that intervention is entirely dependent on the tone that counsel was in fact using, something that cannot be determined from the transcript.So this Court has no basis upon which to determine whether this was a case of a judge admonishing counsel who was out of line, or a case of a judge overreacting or interrupting counsel for no good reason.[29]The transcript does establish conclusively that the exchanges between D.P.’s counsel and the presiding Judge were tensed, and this tension escalated during the hearing.It is readily apparent from the transcript that the presiding Judge became increasingly annoyed with D.P.’s counsel.But there is no indication of this irritation or negative disposition being transferred to, or directed at, D.P.On the contrary, the presiding Judge, while acknowledging that he was very annoyed with counsel, specifically said that he would not take his annoyance out on her client.This demonstrates that, irritated as he may have been by what was transpiring, the presiding Judge remained aware of the importance of not losing his objectivity, and of not punishing D.P. for the conduct of his counsel.[30]D.P. argues that the sentence imposed by the presiding Judge belies his words.He argues that the sentence was so harsh that it demonstrates that the presiding Judge did in fact punish him for the conduct of his counsel.I have great difficulty accepting that the sentence imposed, on its face, is so harsh that it provides an indication of bias on the part of the presiding Judge.[31]D.P.’s submission might be persuasive if the sentence was outside the range of sentences ordinarily imposed for these types of offenses; or if it was significantly more harsh than what the Crown was seeking.But that is not the case.There is nothing before this Court to suggest that the sentence imposed is out of line with sentences ordinarily imposed on young persons for drinking and driving offenses.The driving prohibition imposed was at the low end of what the Crown was seeking, and the fine was in the range submitted by the Crown.[32]The fact that a judge is annoyed with counsel, even very annoyed, cannot be taken to necessarily translate, in every case, as an inability on the part of that judge to abide by his oath of office and to be fair to that counsel’s client.Sometimes, it might.But one does not automatically flow from the other.It is all a matter of degree, and the overall circumstances of each case must be examined carefully.[33]It is always regrettable when the interaction between counsel and the court deteriorates in the manner that it did in this case.The stresses associated with litigation in busy courtrooms, and the very nature of the adversarial process are such that it is not surprising that tension sometimes builds between those who work in this environment.Human nature is such that judges and counsel may well become annoyed at one another from time to time.But lack of civility in the courtroom undermines respect for the administration of justice.It can diminish the public’s respect for the process and its outcomes.So everyone should strive to maintain civility in the courtroom; it is the responsibility of counsel and judges alike. R. v. Felderhof 2003 CanLII 37346 (ON CA), [2003] O.J. No.4819 (Ont.C.A.), at paras. 83 and 94.[34]But that is not to say that a decline in civility necessarily give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.Having carefully reviewed the transcript, and in the absence of any other evidence, and also bearing in mind the applicable standardof proof and the other legal principles I have already referred to, I conclude that notwithstanding the unfortunate tone that prevailed in the exchanges between counsel and the presiding Judge, the record fails to establish that what transpired in this case gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.3.Interference with right to make full submissions[35]The second aspect of D.P.’s complaint about how these proceedings were conducted is that he did not get the benefit of full submissions at this hearing.His counsel alleges that the presiding Judge’s conduct, quite apart from the issue of bias, rendered her unable to offer D.P. the effective legal representation that he was entitled to.She said, for example, that she failed to ask the Court to consider granting a conditional discharge.[36]I find it problematic to have counsel, on appeal, argue their own ineffectiveness or inability to adequately represent their client in the proceedings forming the subject-matter of that appeal.A preferable course of action might be to have other counsel argue the appeal, and possibly apply to adduce fresh evidence, in the form of an affidavit from the first counsel, to provide more evidence and context about what transpired and explain how it might have impacted on the hearing.[37]But this problem is of less consequence in this case because the Crown concedes that D.P. was deprived of his right to be fully heard.This concession is not binding on this Court, but it carries considerable weight, as the Crown was present at the hearing and is aware of the full context, including matters not apparent from the transcript.[38]Apart from the impact that the tension between the presiding Judge and counsel may have had on counsel’s effectiveness, the record shows that D.P.’s counsel had not finished her submissions when the presiding Judge stood the matter down.Counsel had made the point, earlier, that if no minimum sentence applied, it may be appropriate for the presiding Judge to consider a disposition other than a fine, including possibly a reprimand.When court reconvened and it was determined that no minimum prohibition applied, D.P.’s counsel was not given an opportunity to make further submissions as to how this should impact on the sentence to be imposed.[39]Another area of concern, which no one raised during the hearing of this appeal,is that neither D.P. nor his parents, who were present in the courtroom, had an opportunity to address the Court before the sentence was imposed.Section 42 of the Act provides that before imposing sentence, the Youth Justice Court shall consider, among other things, “the representations made by the parties to the proceedings or their counsel or agents and by the parents of the young person”.In my view, this implies a requirement to give the parents an opportunity to be heard when they are present.[40]The standard of review on sentence appeals is a very high one.Appellate courts must defer to findings made by a sentencing judge, and to his or her assessment of the various factors thatmust be balanced to arrive at a fit sentence.But sentencing courts must, like any court or tribunal, abide by principles ofprocedural fairness.Failure to do so gives rise to appellate intervention.R. v. Zinck 2003 SCC 6 (CanLII), [2003] S.C.J. No. 5 (Q.L.), at para.41.[41]The presiding Judge’s decision to stand matters down until 11:15 occurred during D.P.’s counsel’s submissions.Counsel had not finished those submissions. She was not given an opportunity to make any further submissions when proceedings resumed.In particular, she was not given an opportunity to make submissionsabouthow the absence of a minimum penalty should impact on the type of disposition that the Court could consider.D.P.’sparents were not given an opportunity to make representations to the Court.All of this, combined with the position taken by the Crown onthis appeal, leads me to conclude that D.P. did not have an opportunity to present full submissions at his sentencing hearing.Additional submissions may not have altered the presiding Judge’s conclusion as to what a fit sentence was, but that, of course, is not the point.If the rules of procedural fairness are breached, that, in and of itself, taints the proceedings and gives rise to appellate intervention.[42]In the Notice of Appeal filed on D.P.’s behalf in November 2007, the relief sought is that this Court send the matter back to the Youth Justice Court for a fresh sentencing hearing.This may have been an appropriate and meaningful remedy had the appeal proceeded in a timely fashion, but it is not an appropriate remedy at this point.The offence dates back to August 2007, some 18monthsago.D.P. is weeks away from turning 18.A re-hearing in the Youth Justice Court, at this point, would make very little sense.Unfortunately, the delay in this case has had a real impact on this Court’s options as far as the relief that can be granted to D.P.[43]A delay of almost a year and a halfbetween the filing of a Notice of Appeal and the hearing of an appeal, on a summary conviction matter, is problematic at the best of times, but it is particularly regrettable in proceedings involving youths.Timely intervention is one of the principles that Parliament has seen fit to emphasize in setting out the policy principles that underlie that Youth Criminal Justice Act:3.(1)The following principles apply in this Act:(...)(b)the criminal justice system for young persons must be separate from that of adults and emphasize the following:(iv)timely intervention that reinforces the link between the offending behaviour and its consequences; and(v)the promptness and speed with which persons responsible for enforcing this Act must act, given young person’s perception of time.(...)[44]D.P. himself acknowledges that a re-hearing would not be appropriate under the circumstances.He asks, instead, that this Court consider the matter of sentencing afresh.That is what I propose to do, because it is the only realistic option available to the Court.[45]D.P. argues that heshould be granted a conditional discharge, with a nominal period of Probation, given his personal circumstances, his early guilty plea and remorse, his cooperation with the police throughout, the fact he only drove the vehicle for a short distance, and the fact that he did so to help someone else.[46]In deciding what a fit sentence is for this offence, the sentencing principles set out in Part 4 of the Act must be considered.While the Youth Criminal Justice Act sets out a framework and sentencing philosophy whereby young persons are dealt with very differently than adults, some of its governing sentencing principles mirror those that apply in adult court.For example, a sentence must be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence and to the degree of responsibility of the offender.It must be similar to sentenced imposed to offenders whose circumstances are similar and have committed similar offenses.Youth Criminal Justice Act, supra, s. 38.[47]In addition, sanctions imposed to young persons must have meaningful consequences to them, and promote their rehabilitation so that the public is, in the long-term, protected. Youth Criminal Justice Act, supra, s. 38.[48]Having considered those factors and the other sentencing principles set out in the Act, I do not think that a conditional discharge would be an appropriate disposition in the circumstances.It is one of the dispositions available under the Act, but it can only be granted if it is in the best interest of the offender and not contrary to the public interest.Youth Criminal Justice Act, supra, s. 42.I conclude that neither one of those criteria is met.[49]Drinking and driving offenses are serious matters.The potential for harm to the public is great any time a person drives a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, no matter what the person’s motivation might be.Even accepting that D.P. only intended to drive the vehicle for a short distance to assist the other person, the fact remains that the concentration of alcohol in his blood was well over the legal limit; he was at an age where it was not even legal for him to consume alcohol in the first place.For those reasons, in my view, it would be contrary to the public interest to grant a discharge in this case.[50]I am also not persuaded that it would be in D.P.’s interest to be granted a discharge.I am not convinced that such a disposition would constitute a meaningful enough consequence to him for his actions.Holding him accountable, in a meaningful way, for the serious errors in judgment he made that day is, in my view, more likely to avoid similar conduct in the future.It is very much consistent with fostering D.P.’s rehabilitation and the long-term protection of the public.[51]Finally, as counsel did not refer me to any other case involving a young person where a discharge was granted for this type of offence, I am not satisfied that a conditional discharge would be consistent with the principle of parity.[52]Before imposing a fine, the presiding Judge ought to have inquired more specifically aboutD.P.’sability topay.Youth Criminal Justice Act, supra, s. 54(1).He had been told that D.P. had worked throughout the summer and continued to workpart-time, but did not have any information about his wage, expenses, and his ability to pay a fine.The presiding Judge was also mistaken when he said that the surchargecould not be worked off as part of the fine options program.Youth Criminal Justice Act, supra, s. 54(2).But examining the matter afresh now, this Court has the information about D.P.’s ability to pay the fine and surcharge, as demonstrated by the fact that he did in fact pay both.[53]Under the circumstances, I conclude that the $500.00 fine and $75.00 surcharge, together with the 12 months driving prohibition, are a fit and appropriate disposition having regard to the circumstances of the offence, the circumstances of D.P., and the applicable sentencing principles.[54]For those reasons, even though the circumstances of this case give rise to appellate intervention, I am not satisfied that the sentence imposed should be interfered with.[55]The appeal is dismissed.L.A.

McKechney, for the appellantAmy Rose, for the respondentHeard and released orally:June 13, 2016On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice Louise Serré of the Ontario Court of Justice on May 29, 2014.ENDORSEMENT[1]The appellant was charged with two counts of assault, one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm, one count of mischief and one count of criminal harassment arising from her employment as a personal support worker at a nursing home.At the preliminary inquiry, the appellant was committed for trial on all counts.[2]Following the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry, the Crown and defence agreed on a joint submission for an eight-month conditional sentence followed by one year’s probation on a guilty plea by the appellant to the two counts of assault and one count of criminal harassment.Counsel met with the preliminary inquiry judge to discuss the proposed resolution.At the conclusion of that meeting, counsel for the appellant understood that the preliminary inquiry judge had approved the proposal and communicated this to the appellant.The appellant then elected to be tried by the preliminary inquiry judge and pled guilty to the two counts of assault and one count of criminal harassment.However, the judge rejected the joint submission and imposed a 90-day intermittent sentence on one count of assault, followed by a six-month conditional sentence on the remaining two counts to which the appellant had pled guilty.[3]The appellant now appeals her conviction arguing that her guilty plea should be set aside.She also applies for leave to appeal the sentence imposed.[4]While we are not persuaded that the appellant’s guilty plea should be set aside, we agree that the sentence imposed cannot stand.Counsel for the Crown does not take issue with the evidence of trial counsel that the preliminary inquiry judge had indicated her approval of the joint submission before the appellant pled guilty.Moreover, the judge did not provide any explanation why the joint submission was contrary to the public interest or why the jointly-proposed sentence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.This omission is particularly glaring, given her prior communication with counsel.[5]In the circumstances, we dismiss the appeal against conviction, grant leave to appeal sentence, allow the appeal against sentence and impose sentence in accordance with the joint submission.“Alexandra Hoy A.C.J.O.”“John Laskin J.A.”“C.W.
